### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Public Presidential Calls for Prosecution of Political Adversaries:** This class includes instances where a sitting president publicly calls for or directs the investigation/prosecution of a political rival or critic. Examples include Trump's calls to prosecute Hillary Clinton, James Comey, and Andrew McCabe.
    *   **Base Rate:** Very low (<5%). Despite intense political pressure and rhetoric, none of the named individuals were indicted for the core political grievances alleged by President Trump. The DOJ did investigate McCabe, but ultimately declined to press charges. This suggests that even with a sympathetic Attorney General, institutional and legal barriers are significant.
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from prominent cases in the last 10-15 years. The denominator is "high-profile public calls for prosecution by a president," and the numerator is "resulting indictments on the specified grounds."
2.  **Federal Investigations of Former Executive Branch Officials:** This class includes all federal criminal investigations into former (non-elected) officials of an administration. This is broader and includes non-political cases.
    *   **Base Rate:** Low (5-10% for indictment). Investigations are common, but indictments of senior officials are rare. They typically involve clear statutory violations like perjury (Scooter Libby), mishandling classified information (David Petraeus), or corruption, not actions based on political speech or policy disagreements.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on a qualitative review of high-profile DOJ investigations over the past several decades. The legal bar for indictment is high, and prosecutorial discretion often weeds out weak or politically fraught cases.
3.  **Prosecutions for Espionage or Treason:** This is a narrow class focused on the specific, extreme rhetoric used in the memoranda.
    *   **Base Rate:** Extremely low (<1%). Treason charges are virtually nonexistent in modern U.S. history, requiring "levying war" or "adhering to their enemies." Espionage charges are more common but are reserved for mishandling national defense information, not publishing a critical op-ed or making public statements about election security.
    *   **Reasoning:** The legal definitions of these crimes are precise and do not align with the known actions of Krebs or Taylor.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-04-09] Trump issues presidential memoranda directing the DOJ to investigate Krebs and Taylor. — ↑ — The initiating event that makes an indictment plausible.
*   [2025-04-10] PBS and other outlets report on the memoranda, framing them as a campaign of retribution. — ↔ — Establishes the political, rather than legal, motivation, which could both increase pressure on DOJ and increase internal resistance.
*   [2025-06-03] Miles Taylor publicly decries the investigation order as an "unprecedented" abuse of power. — ↓ — Signals a vigorous public and legal defense will be mounted, raising the political cost of an indictment and likely slowing any legal process.
*   [2025-07-01 to 2025-11-07] No public reporting of a grand jury being empaneled, key witnesses being subpoenaed, or other signs of an active, progressing investigation. — ↓↓ — The most significant recent factor. With less than two months to the resolution date, the absence of procedural milestones makes an indictment highly unlikely. Complex investigations rarely move this quickly and silently.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Will & AG Compliance (Large ↑):** The primary driver for a "Yes" outcome. A second-term President Trump, unconcerned with re-election, could exert immense pressure on a hand-picked, loyalist Attorney General to produce an indictment as a political victory, regardless of legal merit.
2.  **Legal Weakness of the Case (Large ↓):** The core allegations (treason, espionage, censorship) have an exceptionally weak, if not nonexistent, basis in federal criminal law. The actions of both men are almost certainly protected by the First Amendment. This provides a powerful basis for DOJ institutional resistance.
3.  **DOJ Institutionalism & Career Staff (Moderate ↓):** Career prosecutors operate under the "Principles of Federal Prosecution," which require a reasonable probability of conviction. A purely political prosecution would likely face significant internal friction, leaks, and potential resignations, acting as a powerful brake.
4.  **Extremely Short Timeline (Large ↓):** The directive was issued in April 2025. Federal investigations, especially complex and politically sensitive ones that would be aggressively litigated, take far longer than eight months to proceed from initiation to indictment. The clock is the biggest obstacle.
5.  **"Process Crime" Trap (Small ↑):** The investigation itself, even if baseless, could be used to trap Krebs or Taylor in a process crime (e.g., lying to investigators). This is a known tactic but still requires an active investigation and an interview to take place.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Second-Term Retribution:** Unlike the first-term calls to prosecute Clinton or Comey, this occurs in a hypothetical second term where the President is unconstrained by re-election and may have successfully staffed the DOJ with officials selected for personal loyalty over institutional norms.
*   **Targets' Stature:** Krebs and Taylor are less powerful figures than a former Secretary of State (Clinton) or FBI Director (Comey), potentially making them easier targets with a smaller political constituency to defend them.
*   **Nature of the "Crime":** The alleged offenses are based on political speech and performance of official duties, making them legally weaker than the allegations against Clinton (mishandling classified info) or McCabe (lack of candor), which at least pointed to potential statutory violations.
*   **Explicit Directive:** The use of formal presidential memoranda to direct investigations into specific individuals is a significant and aggressive escalation compared to the public rhetoric used in the past.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 5%) based on the reference class of presidents calling for the prosecution of political enemies, which rarely results in indictment. This is a weak prior (equivalent n≈20).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) An explicit presidential directive in a second term signals extreme political will.
    *   (↓↓ Very Large) The legal case is extraordinarily weak and implicates core First Amendment protections.
    *   (↓↓ Very Large) The timeline is the most critical piece of evidence. The lack of any public investigative progress by November 2025 makes an indictment before January 1, 2026, procedurally almost impossible.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Even a politicized DOJ would face internal friction and risks in pursuing such a case.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence against an indictment (timeline, legal merits) is substantially stronger than the evidence for it (political will). The posterior should be revised significantly downward from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Leaks or reports of a federal grand jury being empaneled to hear evidence in this matter.
    *   Reports that either Krebs, Taylor, or their close associates have been subpoenaed or contacted by the FBI/DOJ.
    *   Public statements by the Attorney General or President Trump referencing an "ongoing investigation" and promising imminent action.
    *   Appointment of a special counsel or dedicated prosecutor to the case.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The passage of time with no news (the current state). Every day that passes without news significantly lowers the probability.
    *   Off-the-record comments from DOJ sources to media indicating the investigation is dormant or has been quietly closed.
    *   Public focus of the President and AG on other political priorities.
    *   Key deadlines (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas holidays) passing, as the DOJ typically slows down during these periods.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Indictment:** A highly motivated and compliant AG could rush a flimsy, single-count indictment through a grand jury simply to meet a political goal, planning to deal with the legal fallout later.
*   **Process Crime:** The investigation could have uncovered an unrelated or process crime (e.g., false statements, obstruction), which would satisfy the resolution criteria even if unrelated to the memoranda's original claims.
*   **Information Environment:** We are operating with public information only. A secret grand jury could be operating, though this is difficult to keep entirely quiet in such a high-profile case.
*   **Definition of "Indictment":** The resolution criteria are clear ("files a federal criminal indictment"), but this does not require the indictment to be legally sound or ultimately successful. A purely political filing would resolve this question "Yes."
*   **Personnel is Policy:** The identity and perceived radicalism of the sitting Attorney General in this hypothetical 2025 scenario is a major unknown variable that could dramatically alter the outcome.

**Final Research Summary:** The stated political will to indict Krebs or Taylor is high, but it is overwhelmingly constrained by the absence of a

To forecast the probability of the Department of Justice filing an indictment against Christopher Krebs or Miles Taylor before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The appropriate base rate for this scenario is derived from the class of "Public Presidential Calls for Prosecution of Political Adversaries." Historically, such calls have resulted in indictments less than 5% of the time. This is due to significant legal and institutional barriers, even when there is political pressure.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the historical frequency, we start with a prior probability of 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a public call by a sitting president to investigate political adversaries, similar to past instances involving figures like Hillary Clinton and James Comey.
- **Differences:** This situation occurs in a hypothetical second term of President Trump, where he may exert more pressure on the DOJ. However, the legal basis for the allegations against Krebs and Taylor is weaker than in past cases, focusing on political speech rather than statutory violations.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential Directive (↑):** The explicit directive from President Trump increases the likelihood of an indictment due to heightened political will. However, the legal basis remains weak.
- **Legal Weakness (↓↓):** The allegations lack a strong legal foundation, particularly concerning treason and espionage, which are rarely prosecuted and require specific legal criteria not met here.
- **Timeline (↓↓):** The absence of public investigative progress by November 2025 significantly decreases the likelihood of an indictment, as complex cases typically take longer to develop.
- **DOJ Institutional Resistance (↓):** Career prosecutors are likely to resist politically motivated prosecutions, further decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 5% translates to odds of 1:19.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The combined effect of the evidence (strong legal and procedural barriers) suggests a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1, indicating a decrease in probability.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:** 
  - Assume a likelihood ratio of 0.1 (reflecting the strong evidence against an indictment).
  - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:19 × 0.1 = 0.1:19.
  - Posterior probability = 0.1 / (0.1 + 19) ≈ 0.0052 or 0.52%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a politically motivated indictment, even if legally weak.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a rushed indictment for political reasons or a process crime unrelated to the original allegations.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, slightly adjust the probability upwards to account for unforeseen political maneuvers.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all factors, the probability of an indictment being filed is adjusted to reflect both the base rate and the impact of the evidence.

Final: 1%

# Probability Analysis: DOJ Indictment of Krebs or Taylor

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use a base rate of 5% as my prior probability. This is derived from the reference class of "public presidential calls for prosecution of political adversaries" where actual indictments are rare.

Key considerations for this base rate:
- Historical precedent shows that despite Trump's first-term calls to prosecute figures like Clinton, Comey, and McCabe, none resulted in indictments for the core political grievances.
- Even with sympathetic AGs, institutional barriers within DOJ have historically prevented purely political prosecutions.
- The legal threshold for federal indictments is high, especially for cases involving political speech or policy disagreements.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Presidential directive targeting former officials who criticized or contradicted him
- Political motivation appears to be the primary driver rather than clear statutory violations
- DOJ institutional norms and career prosecutors would likely resist purely political prosecutions

**Key differences:**
- The use of formal presidential memoranda is more aggressive than past rhetoric
- Second-term dynamics mean Trump is unconstrained by re-election concerns
- Krebs and Taylor are less powerful figures than previous targets like Clinton or Comey
- The timeline is extremely compressed (April 2025 directive to January 2026 resolution)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Presidential memoranda directing DOJ investigation (April 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.9 (Very likely to see this if indictment will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.3 (Less likely but still possible to see this without indictment)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (Moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Extremely weak legal basis for the alleged crimes**
- P(E|H): ~0.2 (Unlikely to see such weak legal basis if indictment will occur)
- P(E|~H): ~0.8 (Very likely to see weak legal basis if no indictment will occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (Significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: No public signs of active investigation by November 2025**
- P(E|H): ~0.1 (Very unlikely to see no progress if indictment will occur by January)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (Very likely to see no progress if no indictment will occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (Strongly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Short timeline (8 months from directive to resolution date)**
- P(E|H): ~0.2 (Unlikely to see such a compressed timeline for complex case ending in indictment)
- P(E|~H): ~0.7 (More likely to see this timeline constraint if no indictment will occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.29 (Significantly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (0.05/(1-0.05) = 0.053)

First update (Presidential memoranda):
- Posterior odds = 0.053 × 3.0 = 0.159
- Posterior probability = 0.159/(1+0.159) = 13.7%

Second update (Weak legal basis):
- Posterior odds = 0.159 × 0.25 = 0.040
- Posterior probability = 0.040/(1+0.040) = 3.8%

Third update (No public investigation signs):
- Posterior odds = 0.040 × 0.11 = 0.0044
- Posterior probability = 0.0044/(1+0.0044) = 0.44%

Fourth update (Short timeline):
- Posterior odds = 0.0044 × 0.29 = 0.0013
- Posterior probability = 0.0013/(1+0.0013) = 0.13%

This extremely low probability reflects the combined weight of evidence against an indictment occurring within the timeframe.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Secret investigations**: Federal grand juries operate in secret, and we might not see public signs of an investigation that is actually progressing rapidly.

2. **Process crimes**: The investigation itself could create opportunities for "process crimes" like false statements that are easier to prosecute than the original allegations.

3. **Political expediency**: A highly motivated AG might push through a legally weak indictment for political purposes, planning to deal with legal challenges later.

4. **Overweighting institutional norms**: I may be overestimating DOJ's institutional resistance in a hypothetical second Trump term with hand-picked loyalists.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability upward from the extremely low 0.13%. The most significant factor is the possibility of secret proceedings or a rushed, politically-motivated indictment.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of an indictment against either Krebs or Taylor before January 1, 2026 is very low but not impossible. The compressed timeline and lack of visible investigation progress are the strongest factors against an indictment.

Adjusting for potential blind spots, I'll increase my final probability to 2%.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "public calls by a U.S. President for the criminal prosecution of a specific political adversary." In recent history, this has been a feature of the Trump presidency. Examples include calls to prosecute Hillary Clinton ("lock her up"), James Comey, and Andrew McCabe.

-   **Hillary Clinton:** No indictment was ever filed related to the 2016 campaign's core allegations.
-   **James Comey:** No indictment was filed.
-   **Andrew McCabe:** The DOJ investigated but ultimately declined to file charges.

Based on this reference class, the historical frequency of such calls leading to an indictment is extremely low, effectively 0 out of 3 prominent cases. A conservative starting point, or prior probability P(H), would be around **5%**. This acknowledges that while it has not happened in these specific recent cases, it is not a logical impossibility. In odds form, this is 1-to-19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current situation involves a President publicly targeting political critics, which is consistent with the reference class. The motivation appears to be retribution.

**Differences:**
-   **Increased Political Will (Increases Probability):** The scenario describes a hypothetical second presidential term, where a president is unconstrained by re-election and may have installed a more loyalist Attorney General and DOJ leadership. The use of formal presidential memoranda, rather than tweets or rally chants, also signals a higher degree of official intent.
-   **Weaker Legal Case (Decreases Probability):** The allegations against Krebs (contradicting election fraud claims) and Taylor (writing a critical op-ed) are centered on actions that are almost certainly protected by the First Amendment. This is a legally weaker foundation than the allegations against Clinton (mishandling classified information) or McCabe (lack of candor), which at least pointed to potential statutory violations.
-   **Lower Stature of Targets (Slightly Increases Probability):** Krebs and Taylor are less powerful figures than a former Secretary of State or FBI Director, potentially making them easier targets.

On balance, the increased political will is countered by the exceptionally weak legal basis for the proposed charges.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that an indictment is filed before Jan 1, 2026. Let ~H be that no indictment is filed.

**Evidence 1: The Presidential Memoranda of April 9, 2025.**
This is the initiating event. It is a strong signal of intent. This evidence moves us from the general base rate to this specific case. It increases the probability from the 5% prior.

**Evidence 2: The extreme legal weakness of the core allegations.**
The charges floated—"domestic espionage and treason"—are legally inapplicable to the known actions of Krebs and Taylor.
-   P(Weak Case | H): The probability of having a weak case given an indictment occurs is low, but not zero. A purely political DOJ might proceed anyway.
-   P(Weak Case | ~H): The probability of having a weak case given no indictment occurs is very high. This is a primary reason for prosecutors to decline a case.
-   The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is much less than 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

**Evidence 3: The timeline. It is November 7, 2025, with a deadline of January 1, 2026.**
This is the most powerful piece of evidence.
-   Seven months have passed since the directive with no public reports of a grand jury being empaneled, subpoenas being issued, or targets being formally contacted.
-   Less than two months remain, a period which includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays when government work, including grand jury proceedings, typically slows.
-   P(No Progress by Nov | H): The probability of seeing no public investigative steps by November, given an indictment is imminent, is extremely low. High-profile federal investigations are complex and difficult to keep entirely secret, and they cannot be completed from a standing start in just a few weeks.
-   P(No Progress by Nov | ~H): The probability of seeing no public investigative steps if the case was quietly dropped or never seriously pursued is very high. This is the expected state of affairs.
-   The likelihood ratio for this evidence is extremely small. This evidence massively decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:19 (5% probability).
2.  **Update for Case Specifics:** The increased political will might double the odds to 2:19. The extreme legal weakness might cut these new odds by a factor of four, to 2:76 or 1:38 (approx. 2.6%). Let's call this our updated prior before considering the timeline.
3.  **Update for Timeline:** The evidence of "no public progress after 7 months" has a very low likelihood ratio (e.g., << 1/10). Multiplying our odds of 1:38 by a likelihood ratio of, say, 1/15 gives posterior odds of 1:570.
4.  **Posterior Probability:** Odds of 1:570 correspond to a probability of 1 / (1 + 570) ≈ 0.17%.

The formal update drives the probability to well below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis relies heavily on the assumption that the DOJ will follow standard procedures and timelines, and that a major investigation cannot be kept entirely secret. What if this is wrong?

-   **Alternative Scenario 1: A "Black Swan" Performative Indictment.** A highly loyalist AG could force a U.S. Attorney to rush a flimsy, one-page indictment before a compliant grand jury purely to give the President a political victory. It might be dismissed by a court weeks later, but it would resolve this question "Yes." This scenario bypasses normal procedure and is driven entirely by political will.
-   **Alternative Scenario 2: A Secret "Process Crime" Investigation.** The DOJ could have interviewed Krebs or Taylor months ago, and the entire investigation could be focused on building a perjury or obstruction case under complete seal. An indictment could then appear with no warning.

These scenarios are the most plausible paths to a "Yes" outcome. The lack of any leaks over seven months makes them unlikely, but the political environment described makes them possible. The procedural evidence points to <1%, but the risk of a norm-breaking political act justifies raising the forecast to account for this tail risk. The probability is low, but not negligible. A probability of 2-4% seems appropriate to capture this uncertainty.

### Final Forecast
The initial base rate for such a politically motivated indictment is very low. While the political will in this scenario is high, the legal case is exceptionally weak. The most decisive piece of evidence is the timeline: seven months have passed with no public signs of an investigation, and less than two months remain before the deadline. This makes a procedurally sound indictment almost impossible. The remaining, small probability is driven by the risk of a highly irregular, purely performative indictment or a surprise indictment for a process crime stemming from a secret investigation.

Final: 3%
