### Reference class & base rates
-   **Infectious Disease Public Health Emergencies (PHEs):** Since 2005, HHS has declared four PHEs for infectious diseases: H1N1 (2009), Zika (2016), COVID-19 (2020), and Mpox (2022). This represents a frequency of roughly one declaration every 4-5 years. Over a 20-year period (2005-2025), this suggests a ~20% annual base rate for *any* infectious disease PHE. For the remaining ~2-month forecast horizon, this implies a raw base rate of approximately 3-4%.
-   **Zoonotic Threats with US Human Cases:** A more specific reference class is novel zoonotic viruses causing dozens of human cases in the US. All four historical examples (H1N1, Zika, COVID, Mpox) fit this description and resulted in a PHE. This suggests that once a zoonotic threat reaches a certain threshold of public and political concern (typically involving dozens to hundreds of cases and evidence of community spread), a PHE declaration is highly probable. The key uncertainty is whether H5N1 has crossed that threshold.
-   **Limitations:** The sample size (N=4) is extremely small, making the base rate highly uncertain. Furthermore, the political and public health context has shifted significantly post-COVID-19, potentially altering the threshold for future declarations.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-21] CDC MMWR reports a small cluster of three human H5N1 cases among family members on a Michigan dairy farm with limited onward spread. — ↑ — First clear instance of limited human-to-human (H2H) transmission in the US, a key trigger for heightened concern, though its limited nature tempers the impact.
-   [2025-10-15] The World Health Organization (WHO) releases a genetic analysis of recent H5N1 isolates from US cattle, finding no new mutations known to significantly increase affinity for human receptors. — ↓ — Reduces immediate concern about the virus adapting for efficient spread in humans, reinforcing the current "low risk" assessment.
-   [2025-09-25] HHS announces an expansion of its wastewater surveillance program for influenza A viruses, citing the ongoing H5N1 outbreak in cattle. — ↑ — Proactive measure indicates a higher level of official concern and increases the probability of detecting cryptic spread, which could trigger a PHE.
-   [2025-09-02] USDA reports H5N1 has been detected in dairy cattle in two new states (Kentucky and Arkansas), bringing the total to 15 states. — ↑ — Geographic expansion of the animal reservoir increases the potential for human exposure and sporadic cases, raising the overall risk profile.
-   [2025-08-12] FDA authorizes an updated H5N1 candidate vaccine for inclusion in the national stockpile, based on the currently circulating clade in cattle. — ↓ — Demonstrates proactive preparedness, which can reduce the perceived urgency and necessity of a PHE declaration to manage the threat.
-   [2025-07-20] Total confirmed human cases in the US since 2024 rise to 71, with all new cases linked to direct dairy cattle exposure. — ↑ (small) — A slow but steady increase in sporadic cases keeps the issue on the public health radar, but the lack of H2H spread prevents major escalation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Sustained Human-to-Human (H2H) Transmission:** This is the primary driver. Any credible evidence of efficient, sustained H2H transmission would make a PHE declaration almost certain. (Large impact)
-   **Sharp Increase in Case Numbers/Geographic Spread:** A rapid spike in human cases, even if all are zoonotic, could overwhelm local public health and healthcare capacity, prompting a PHE to unlock federal resources. (Large impact)
-   **Increased Virulence/Severity:** Evidence that the virus is causing more severe illness (e.g., higher case fatality rate) in humans would significantly increase pressure for a declaration. (Moderate impact)
-   **Political Pressure & Media Attention:** Intense media focus and public alarm, especially during peak respiratory virus season, can compel political leaders to act decisively by declaring a PHE, even if the underlying scientific risk assessment hasn't changed dramatically. (Moderate impact)
-   **Need to Unlock Emergency Powers/Funding:** A PHE is a legal tool. A declaration may be driven by the practical need to invoke specific powers under the Public Health Service Act, such as liability protection for countermeasures or expedited distribution of vaccines/antivirals. (Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Pre-existing Preparedness:** Unlike the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2, H5N1 has been a known pandemic threat for decades. The US has an existing vaccine candidate pipeline, antiviral stockpiles (oseltamivir), and established surveillance systems, potentially reducing the need for a PHE to kickstart a response.
-   **Post-COVID Political Environment:** There is significant public and political fatigue with public health emergencies. Any declaration would likely face immediate scrutiny and political polarization, raising the threshold for the HHS Secretary to act compared to the pre-2020 environment.
-   **Dominant Zoonotic Reservoir:** The primary transmission route is overwhelmingly from animals (cattle/poultry) to humans. This contrasts with COVID-19 and Mpox, where H2H transmission was the dominant mode of spread by the time a PHE was declared. The response focuses more on agriculture and animal health than past PHEs.
-   **Low but Steady Case Drip:** The situation is characterized by a slow accumulation of sporadic cases rather than the exponential growth seen in previous PHE-triggering outbreaks. This "simmering" threat has not yet created a clear crisis point.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Starting from a base rate of ~3-4% (annual rate adjusted for the ~2-month horizon), a reasonable prior might be around 5-10%, acknowledging that an active zoonotic outbreak is a known risk factor. Equivalent n: ~20.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The continued absence of *sustained and efficient* H2H transmission is the single most important piece of evidence against a PHE.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The post-COVID political climate and public fatigue create a higher-than-normal barrier to declaring a national emergency.
    -   (↓ Small) Existing preparedness measures (vaccine candidates, antivirals) provide response options that don't require a PHE declaration.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The recent cluster showing limited H2H transmission demonstrates the virus's potential and prevents complacency.
    -   (↑ Small) The slow but steady increase in case numbers and geographic spread in animals ensures the threat remains a high-priority issue for federal agencies.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly weighs against a PHE declaration in the short term. The lack of efficient H2H spread is the dominant factor. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward from a generic "pandemic threat" prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   CDC/WHO confirmation of mutations enhancing viral adaptation to mammals/humans.
    -   Multiple, geographically distinct clusters of human cases with no clear link to animal exposure.
    -   A sharp increase in weekly case counts (e.g., >10-15 new cases per week).
    -   Hospital systems in any state reporting strain due to H5N1 patients.
    -   High-level government officials (e.g., HHS Secretary, White House) begin holding dedicated H5N1 press briefings.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A multi-week period with zero new reported human cases.
    -   Successful implementation of containment measures in dairy cattle (e.g., culling, vaccination) leading to a drop in animal outbreaks.
    -   CDC formally lowers its risk assessment or states that the threat is receding.
    -   Genetic sequencing of new cases continues to show no significant adaptive mutations.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definition of "Sustained H2H":** There is no universally agreed-upon numerical definition. A PHE could be triggered by a situation that is ambiguous but politically untenable.
-   **Reporting Lags:** Significant delays between infection, detection, and public reporting could mean that a serious outbreak is already underway before it becomes public knowledge, forcing a sudden declaration.
-   **Black Swan Event:** A single superspreader event at a large gathering could dramatically and unpredictably alter the trajectory of the outbreak and the political calculus overnight.
-   **Political Wildcard:** The decision to declare a PHE is not purely scientific; it is made by a political appointee (the HHS Secretary). Unexpected political pressures could force a declaration even if key scientific thresholds are not met.
-   **Diagnostic Conflation:** As the northern hemisphere enters respiratory virus season, initial symptoms of H5N1 could be confused with seasonal flu or other illnesses, potentially masking the true extent of spread until severe cases emerge.

**Final Research Summary:** A Public Health Emergency declaration before 2026 is unlikely. The decisive factor remains the absence of sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission, and while the virus continues to circulate widely in animals, the bar for a national emergency declaration in the post-COVID era is exceptionally high.

To forecast the probability of the US Department of Health and Human Services declaring a public health emergency for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection:** The historical base rate for infectious disease public health emergencies (PHEs) is approximately one every 4-5 years, translating to a 20% annual base rate. For the remaining ~2-month period, this suggests a base rate of about 3-4%. Given the active zoonotic outbreak, a slightly higher prior of 5-10% is reasonable.
- **Rationale:** This base rate is informed by the frequency of past PHE declarations for infectious diseases and the current context of an active zoonotic threat.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a zoonotic virus with confirmed human cases, similar to past PHEs like H1N1, Zika, COVID-19, and Mpox.
- **Differences:** Unlike past PHEs, there is no sustained human-to-human transmission, and the political environment post-COVID-19 is more resistant to declaring new emergencies.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Limited Human-to-Human Transmission:** The recent cluster of cases with limited human-to-human transmission increases concern but is not sustained, reducing the likelihood of a PHE.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Low likelihood of PHE given limited transmission (↓ Large).
- **Political and Public Fatigue:** The post-COVID political climate makes new PHE declarations less likely.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Decreases probability (↓ Moderate).
- **Preparedness Measures:** Existing vaccines and antivirals reduce the need for a PHE.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Decreases probability (↓ Small).
- **Geographic Spread and Case Increase:** The spread in animals and slow increase in human cases keeps the issue on the radar.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Slightly increases probability (↑ Small).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Starting with a prior probability of 5-10%, the odds are approximately 0.05 to 0.10.
- **Evidence Impact:** The dominant evidence (lack of sustained H2H transmission) strongly decreases the probability. Other factors like political climate and preparedness further reduce it, while geographic spread and case increase provide slight upward pressure.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:** Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability is revised downward significantly from the prior.
- **Posterior Probability:** The resulting probability is likely below the initial prior, reflecting the strong evidence against a PHE declaration.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of rapid changes, such as a sudden increase in cases or political shifts.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A superspreader event or new mutations could change the situation quickly.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, maintain a cautious approach but acknowledge the low probability of a PHE.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering all factors, the probability of a PHE declaration for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026, is low.

Final: 3%

# Will the US Department of Health and Human Services declare a public health emergency for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of a Public Health Emergency (PHE) declaration for H5 avian influenza in the remaining ~2 months of the forecast period.

Looking at historical data, since 2005, HHS has declared PHEs for four infectious disease outbreaks:
- H1N1 influenza (2009)
- Zika virus (2016)
- COVID-19 (2020)
- Mpox (2022)

This represents approximately one declaration every 4-5 years, suggesting an annual base rate of ~20-25% for any infectious disease PHE. For our ~2-month window, this would translate to roughly 3-4% as a generic prior.

However, we need to consider that H5N1 is already causing human infections in the US (71 confirmed cases according to the research report), which puts us in a more specific reference class. When a novel zoonotic virus has already caused dozens of human cases in the US, the probability of a PHE declaration increases substantially.

**Initial prior: 15%** - This reflects both the time-adjusted base rate and the fact that we're already dealing with an active outbreak with human cases, which elevates the probability above the generic time-adjusted rate.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to previous PHE declarations:**
- H5N1 is a novel pathogen causing human infections in the US
- The virus has pandemic potential (high mortality rate in humans historically)
- There are ongoing cases with geographic spread (15 states affected in cattle)
- There is evidence of at least limited human-to-human transmission (Michigan family cluster)

**Key differences:**
- **Transmission pattern:** Unlike COVID-19, Mpox, or even H1N1, H5N1 remains predominantly a zoonotic disease with very limited H2H transmission. Previous PHEs were declared when efficient H2H transmission was already established.
- **Post-COVID political environment:** There is significant pandemic fatigue and political sensitivity around emergency declarations, raising the threshold compared to pre-2020.
- **Preparedness level:** Unlike with COVID-19, the US has been preparing for potential H5N1 pandemic for decades, with stockpiled antivirals and vaccine candidates already in development.
- **Case trajectory:** The outbreak shows a "slow burn" pattern rather than exponential growth, with most new cases linked to animal exposure.

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of a PHE declaration compared to previous outbreaks.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Limited human-to-human transmission in Michigan (October 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.9 (If a PHE will be declared, we would very likely see some H2H transmission)
- P(E|~H): ~0.3 (Even without a PHE, limited H2H transmission could still occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of a PHE declaration, as it demonstrates the virus's ability to spread between humans, albeit in a limited context.

**Evidence 2: Absence of sustained and efficient H2H transmission**
- P(E|H): ~0.1 (If a PHE will be declared, it's unlikely we would still see no sustained H2H spread)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (Without a PHE, we would expect to see continued absence of sustained H2H spread)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability of a PHE declaration, as sustained H2H transmission has been the key trigger for previous infectious disease PHEs.

**Evidence 3: Slow but steady increase in human cases (71 total)**
- P(E|H): ~0.7 (If a PHE will be declared, we would expect to see ongoing cases)
- P(E|~H): ~0.6 (Even without a PHE, we might still see sporadic cases from animal exposure)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.17
- This evidence slightly increases the probability, as continued cases keep the issue on the public health radar.

**Evidence 4: Post-COVID political environment and public fatigue**
- P(E|H): ~0.3 (If a PHE will be declared despite political headwinds, the situation would need to be severe)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (Without a PHE, we would expect political considerations to play a role)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.33
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability, as the political threshold for declaring emergencies has increased.

**Evidence 5: Proactive preparedness measures (vaccine development, surveillance)**
- P(E|H): ~0.4 (If a PHE will be declared, it might still be accompanied by preparedness measures)
- P(E|~H): ~0.8 (Without a PHE, we would expect to see these preparedness measures)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability, as robust preparedness reduces the need for emergency powers.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 15% (odds of 0.176), let's update based on the most significant evidence:

**Update on Evidence 2 (Absence of sustained H2H transmission):**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability: 0.019 / (1 + 0.019) = 1.9%

**Update on Evidence 1 (Limited H2H transmission in Michigan):**
- Prior odds: 0.019
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.019 × 3.0 = 0.057
- Posterior probability: 0.057 / (1 + 0.057) = 5.4%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Post-COVID political environment):**
- Prior odds: 0.057
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.057 × 0.33 = 0.019
- Posterior probability: 0.019 / (1 + 0.019) = 1.9%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Slow increase in cases):**
- Prior odds: 0.019
- Likelihood ratio: 1.17
- Posterior odds: 0.019 × 1.17 = 0.022
- Posterior probability: 0.022 / (1 + 0.022) = 2.2%

**Update on Evidence 5 (Proactive preparedness):**
- Prior odds: 0.022
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.022 × 0.5 = 0.011
- Posterior probability: 0.011 / (1 + 0.011) = 1.1%

After considering all key evidence, our posterior probability is approximately 1.1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the political pressure that could arise from even a small cluster of severe cases, especially if they involve children or young adults.
- The research report mentions a Michigan family cluster with limited H2H transmission, which could be the beginning of a more significant shift in the virus's behavior.
- The upcoming winter respiratory virus season could complicate surveillance and create confusion between H5N1 and seasonal influenza, potentially masking the true extent of spread.
- I might be overweighting the post-COVID political reluctance to declare emergencies; public health officials might actually have a lower threshold now due to lessons learned.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden mutation could emerge that enhances H2H transmission, rapidly changing the risk assessment.
- A superspreader event in a healthcare setting could create a localized outbreak that triggers a PHE even without nationwide spread.
- Political considerations might actually favor a PHE declaration if officials want to demonstrate they're taking proactive measures to prevent "another COVID."

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my estimate slightly upward to account for these tail risks and potential blind spots. The most significant risk factor is the potential for rapid viral evolution, given that we've already seen limited H2H transmission.

Adjusting from 1.1% to approximately 3%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Based on my analysis, I believe there is a low probability that the US Department of Health and Human Services will declare a public health emergency for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026. The key factors driving this assessment are:

1. The continued absence of sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission
2. The higher political threshold for emergency declarations in the post-COVID era
3. The existence of proactive preparedness measures that reduce the need for emergency powers
4. The relatively slow progression of the outbreak with most cases linked to animal exposure

While the recent Michigan cluster showing limited H2H transmission is concerning, it hasn't yet demonstrated the pattern of spread that would typically trigger a PHE declaration. With only about two months remaining in the forecast period, there is limited time for the situation to evolve dramatically enough to warrant a declaration.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The reference class for this forecast is the frequency of Public Health Emergency (PHE) declarations for infectious diseases in the United States. According to the provided background, there have been four such declarations since 2005 (H1N1, Zika, COVID-19, Mpox). This spans a period of roughly 20 years (2005-2025).

-   **Frequency:** 4 declarations / 20 years = 1 declaration every 5 years.
-   **Annual Base Rate:** This implies a 20% chance of a PHE for *any* infectious disease being declared in a given year.
-   **Time Horizon Adjustment:** The forecast period is approximately two months (October 27, 2025, to January 1, 2026). Pro-rating the annual base rate gives: (2/12) * 20% ≈ 3.3%.

However, this base rate is for a random two-month period. We are currently in a period with a known, active zoonotic threat (H5N1) that has already caused dozens of human cases in the US. This specific context significantly increases the relevance of a potential PHE compared to an average period. Therefore, I will adjust the prior upward from the raw base rate to reflect this heightened-risk environment.

-   **Initial Prior (P(H)):** I will set the prior probability at **10%**. This acknowledges that while a PHE is still a rare event, the current situation with H5N1 makes it a much more plausible candidate than the 3.3% base rate would suggest. In odds form, this is 0.1 / 0.9 = 1/9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current H5N1 situation has some similarities to the four historical PHEs but also critical differences.

-   **Similarities:** A novel zoonotic virus is causing dozens of human cases across multiple US states, generating significant public health and media attention.
-   **Differences:**
    1.  **Transmission Mode:** This is the most crucial difference. H1N1, COVID-19, and Mpox all demonstrated clear, efficient, and sustained human-to-human (H2H) transmission, which was the primary driver of the emergency. H5N1 transmission remains overwhelmingly zoonotic (animal-to-human).
    2.  **Growth Trajectory:** Past PHEs were declared in response to exponential or near-exponential case growth. H5N1 has shown a slow, linear "drip" of cases over many months.
    3.  **Political Context:** The post-COVID-19 political environment is characterized by public fatigue and polarization regarding public health mandates. This raises the political threshold for a Secretary of HHS to declare a national emergency.

These differences suggest that the current situation is significantly less acute than the historical precedents, making a PHE declaration less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence from the research report. The hypothesis (H) is that a PHE will be declared before Jan 1, 2026.

-   **Evidence 1: Absence of *sustained and efficient* H2H transmission.**
    -   P(E1 | H): Very low. It is highly improbable that a PHE would be declared without this critical trigger. It would be a radical departure from precedent.
    -   P(E1 | ~H): Very high. This is the current state of affairs and the primary reason a PHE has not been declared.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Strongly less than 1. This evidence powerfully decreases the probability of a PHE.

-   **Evidence 2: A small family cluster with "limited" H2H transmission (October 2025).**
    -   P(E2 | H): Moderately high. An event like this is a plausible precursor to a wider outbreak that would necessitate a PHE. It's a significant warning shot.
    -   P(E2 | ~H): Also moderately high. A small, self-contained cluster that does not lead to wider community spread is a very plausible scenario that would not require a PHE.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Moderately greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability, as it confirms the virus's potential for H2H spread, moving it from a theoretical to a demonstrated risk.

-   **Evidence 3: Post-COVID political fatigue and higher bar for declaration.**
    -   P(E3 | H): Low. A declaration would have to overcome this significant political inertia, implying the underlying situation would have to be extremely severe.
    -   P(E3 | ~H): High. This political reality is a strong force maintaining the status quo (no PHE).
    -   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Less than 1. This evidence moderately decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the update process conceptually.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** 10% (Odds: 1/9).
2.  **Apply the strongest evidence:** The lack of efficient H2H transmission (Evidence 1) and the political climate (Evidence 3) are powerful forces against a declaration. Combined, they might have a likelihood ratio of around 1/10, meaning they make the observed situation 10 times more likely if there is *no* PHE than if there is one.
    -   *Intermediate Odds:* (1/9) * (1/10) = 1/90.
    -   *Intermediate Probability:* 1/91 ≈ 1.1%.
3.  **Apply the counter-evidence:** The family cluster (Evidence 2) is the most significant factor pushing *for* a declaration. It's a material change in the risk profile. Let's assign it a likelihood ratio of 3 (i.e., this event makes a PHE three times more likely than it would have been otherwise).
    -   *Posterior Odds:* (1/90) * 3 = 3/90 = 1/30.
    -   *Posterior Probability:* 1 / (1 + 30) = 1/31 ≈ 3.2%.

This structured update suggests a probability in the low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis hinges on the assumption that a PHE requires efficient H2H transmission. I should challenge this.

-   **Alternative Scenario:** A PHE could be triggered not by widespread transmission, but by a localized crisis. For example, a cluster of 20-30 severe cases in a rural area could overwhelm the local healthcare system, prompting a declaration to unlock federal resources, even without evidence of sustained community spread.
-   **Black Swan Risk:** The virus is circulating in a massive animal reservoir, creating countless opportunities for mutation. A new variant with higher transmissibility could emerge and be detected within the two-month window, changing the calculus overnight.
-   **Political Miscalculation/Panic:** Intense media coverage of a particularly tragic cluster could create immense political pressure to "do something," leading to a declaration even if the scientific criteria are not fully met. The memory of being criticized for a slow COVID-19 response could lead to a bias toward earlier action this time.

These factors represent tail risks that my main analysis might under-weigh. The calculated ~3% probability reflects the most likely trajectory based on current evidence, but it may not adequately capture the possibility of a sudden, sharp deviation. To account for these risks, I will adjust my final forecast slightly upward from the calculated value.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability of a PHE declaration for H5N1 before January 1, 2026, is low. The fundamental trigger for past infectious disease PHEs—efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission—is absent. The current slow accumulation of zoonotic cases, while concerning, does not represent the kind of exponential threat that typically warrants a national emergency declaration. Furthermore, the post-COVID political climate creates a high barrier to such an action. While the recent family cluster is a notable warning and a sudden mutation remains a tail risk, these factors are not sufficient to overcome the primary evidence against a declaration in the short, two-month timeframe. My final probability reflects this, with a small upward adjustment for tail risks.

Final: 5%
