### Reference class & base rates
*   **Mass evacuations for slow-moving environmental crises:** Governments rarely order large-scale, mandatory evacuations for slow-onset disasters like drought or land subsidence. Such orders are almost exclusively reserved for acute, immediate threats like hurricanes, industrial accidents, or military attacks. The base rate for a city of Tehran's size ordering a 100,000+ person evacuation due to water stress in any given year is extremely low, likely **<0.1%**. This is derived from the near-total absence of modern historical precedents.
*   **Capital city relocations:** States announce plans to relocate their capitals more frequently than they execute them. When they do happen (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan, Myanmar), the process is a multi-decade project involving construction and phased administrative moves, not an emergency evacuation. The base rate of an *evacuation order* being part of a capital relocation plan is effectively **0%**.
*   **Government responses to severe drought:** The standard playbook for extreme water scarcity in major urban centers involves demand management (rationing, public campaigns), supply augmentation (drilling new wells, water transfers, desalination), and declaring states of emergency to manage resources. Evacuation is a last-resort option that is discussed far more often than it is implemented. The base rate of such discussions converting to a formal evacuation order within a year is very low, estimated at **<1%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Today's date is 2025-12-05. The resolution horizon is <3 months, so the last 6 months are emphasized.*
*   **2025-11-14** President Pezeshkian explicitly states the government might have to "potentially evacuate Tehran" if the drought situation continues past the 21st of November. **↑** — This is the single most important development, as it puts a politically costly and logistically difficult option on the table at the highest level, creating a potential commitment trap.
*   **2025-11-01** (Implied) The November 21st deadline for rainfall passes without relief, triggering the conditions mentioned in Pezeshkian's statement (water rationing, consideration of evacuation). **↑** — Moves the scenario from a conditional threat to an active policy problem the government must now address.
*   **Throughout 2025** Reports highlight Tehran's accelerating land subsidence crisis, directly linked to the water crisis. **↑** — Strengthens the underlying physical case for drastic action by compounding the drought with irreversible infrastructure risk, increasing the pressure on policymakers.
*   **2025-01-07** The government formally announces its intention to relocate the capital to the Makran coast. **↑** — While a long-term project, this establishes the government's official position that Tehran is unsustainable, providing political cover and a strategic framework for more drastic short-term measures.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Presidential Credibility (Commitment Trap):** Pezeshkian has publicly tied his administration to a potential evacuation. Backing down without a clear "off-ramp" (e.g., unexpected heavy rains) could damage his credibility. (Size: Moderate ↑)
*   **Severity of Water Crisis:** The primary driver. If the water situation deteriorates into a true public health emergency (e.g., taps running dry in large districts, disease outbreaks), it could force the government's hand, making the unthinkable necessary. (Size: Large ↑)
*   **Logistical & Economic Immensity:** Evacuating 100,000 people requires immense transport, housing, food, and security resources that Iran's strained economy can ill afford. This is the strongest practical barrier against an order being given. (Size: Large ↓)
*   **Risk of Social & Political Instability:** A forced evacuation order could be seen as a catastrophic government failure, potentially triggering mass panic, protests, and a crisis of legitimacy that could threaten the regime itself. The leadership is likely highly averse to this risk. (Size: Large ↓)
*   **Availability of "Off-Ramps":** The government can take many steps short of evacuation: severe rationing, trucking in water, emergency pipeline construction, public prayer for rain, or announcing a *voluntary* relocation assistance program. These are far more politically and logistically palatable. (Size: Large ↓)
*   **Internal Power Dynamics:** A decision of this magnitude would require consensus from other power centers, notably the Supreme Leader and the IRGC. The IRGC might oppose it due to the risk of chaos or support it as a large-scale logistical exercise and power play. This internal calculus is a key uncertainty. (Size: Moderate ↑/↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Presidential Threat:** Unlike nearly all other historical cases of urban water stress, the head of state has publicly and recently named evacuation as a potential outcome. This is a significant departure from the norm.
*   **Convergence of Crises:** Tehran's situation is not just a drought. It's a combination of extreme water stress, world-leading land subsidence rates, pollution, and overpopulation, creating a uniquely potent and visible crisis multiplier.
*   **Reformist President's Agenda:** President Pezeshkian is portrayed as a pragmatist and critic of past government mismanagement. He may be more inclined to heed scientific warnings and consider radical solutions, but also more sensitive to the potential for public backlash from a poorly executed plan.
*   **Pre-existing Relocation Policy:** The government has already declared Tehran unsustainable via its long-term capital relocation plan. This provides an existing policy justification that is absent in most other historical cases of urban crisis.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 1-2%) based on the reference class of evacuations for slow-moving disasters. The historical evidence against such an event is strong (equivalent n > 50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The President's explicit, recent, and conditional threat to evacuate is a powerful and unusual piece of evidence that dramatically increases the likelihood from the base rate.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The convergence of severe drought, subsidence, and a pre-existing policy to abandon Tehran as the capital provides a strong underlying rationale.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The immense, almost prohibitive, logistical, economic, and political costs of ordering an evacuation serve as a massive brake on any such decision.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The high probability that the government will opt for less drastic "off-ramp" solutions (extreme rationing, voluntary programs) before resorting to a mandatory evacuation order.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence pushes the probability up significantly from its extremely low prior. However, the powerful negative drivers (logistics, political stability) cap the potential increase. The posterior should be revised upwards to a level that reflects a highly unlikely but now plausible "black swan" event, likely remaining in the low-to-mid single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcements of specific, severe water rationing schedules for Tehran districts.
    *   Unusual movements or statements from the IRGC or military regarding domestic logistics.
    *   State media beginning a public information campaign about water scarcity and the need for "difficult measures."
    *   Reports of the government preparing reception centers or temporary housing in other provinces.
    *   A formal declaration of a "state of environmental emergency" for Tehran.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any significant precipitation in the region's watershed.
    *   Government announcements focusing on technical solutions (e.g., fast-tracking desalination plants, cloud seeding).
    *   Statements from senior officials (including Pezeshkian) walking back the "evacuation" rhetoric, replacing it with calls for conservation and resilience.
    *   A new government focus on a large-scale *voluntary* and incentivized relocation program.
    *   Major unrelated domestic or international crises that consume the government's attention.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on a formal "order" for an "evacuation." A "strong recommendation," a voluntary relocation program, or the evacuation of a single critical government building would not meet the criteria.
*   **Information opacity:** The decision-making process of the Iranian government is opaque. A final decision could be made by a small group (e.g., the Supreme National Security Council) with little public warning.
*   **Deception/Rhetoric:** The President's statement could be political rhetoric designed to galvanize public support for unpopular water rationing measures, with no real intention of ordering an evacuation.
*   **Partial fulfillment:** The government could order the evacuation of a specific, smaller area within Tehran County (e.g., a neighborhood with collapsing infrastructure due to subsidence) that might not reach the 100,000-person threshold.
*   **Timeline:** With less than a month to resolution, the window for such a monumental decision and announcement is extremely narrow, making inaction the default outcome.

**Final Research Summary:** The President's explicit threat to evacuate Tehran has made a historically unprecedented event plausible, but the overwhelming logistical, economic, and political barriers mean less drastic measures are far more likely before the January 1, 2026 deadline.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a city of Tehran's size ordering a 100,000+ person evacuation due to water stress in any given year is extremely low, likely **<0.1%**. This is based on the near-total absence of modern historical precedents for such evacuations due to slow-moving environmental crises.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The situation in Tehran involves slow-onset environmental issues like drought and land subsidence, similar to other cases where evacuations were not ordered.
   - **Differences:** The explicit mention by President Pezeshkian of a potential evacuation is unusual and significant. The convergence of multiple crises (drought, subsidence, overpopulation) and the pre-existing policy to relocate the capital are unique factors that differentiate this case from the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **President's Statement (↑):** The explicit threat to evacuate increases the likelihood of the event, as it puts evacuation on the political agenda.
   - **Water Crisis Severity (↑):** The ongoing severe drought and land subsidence increase the probability of drastic measures.
   - **Logistical and Economic Barriers (↓):** The immense logistical and economic challenges decrease the likelihood of an evacuation order.
   - **Political and Social Risks (↓):** The potential for social unrest and political instability further decreases the likelihood.
   - **Alternative Measures (↓):** The availability of less drastic measures (e.g., rationing, voluntary relocation) decreases the likelihood of a mandatory evacuation.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 0.1% or 0.001 in probability terms.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** While the President's statement and the severity of the crisis increase the likelihood, the strong negative factors (logistics, political risks, alternatives) significantly counterbalance this.
   - **Posterior Odds Calculation:** Given the evidence, we might adjust the prior upwards, but the overwhelming barriers suggest a modest increase. Let's assume a likelihood ratio that increases the odds by a factor of 5, resulting in posterior odds of 0.005.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 0.005 / (1 + 0.005) ≈ 0.5%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The probability remains low due to the significant barriers and historical precedent.
   - **Tail Risks:** Consider the possibility of an unexpected crisis or political shift that could force an evacuation.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast of 1-2% might be plausible if one assumes a higher likelihood of political or environmental tipping points.
   - **Rebuttals:** The logistical and political challenges remain strong counterarguments against a higher probability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final calibrated probability reflects a low but non-zero chance of evacuation.

Final: 0.5%

# Will Iran announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before January 1, 2026 (less than a month from now).

The most appropriate reference classes are:
- Major cities evacuated due to slow-onset environmental crises
- Capital city relocations involving evacuation orders
- Government responses to severe drought and water scarcity

Looking at historical precedents, large-scale evacuations of major cities due to slow-onset environmental crises are extremely rare. Governments typically implement gradual mitigation measures rather than sudden evacuations. Capital relocations, when they occur, are planned over decades with phased administrative moves, not emergency evacuations.

**Prior probability: 1%**

This reflects the extremely low base rate of major city evacuations for non-acute disasters, while acknowledging that the situation in Tehran has some unique characteristics that place it slightly above zero.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other water-stressed cities, Tehran has multiple options before evacuation (rationing, emergency infrastructure)
- The logistical challenges of evacuating millions of people remain prohibitive
- Economic constraints make large-scale population movements extremely difficult
- Political costs of ordering evacuations are enormous for any government

**Key differences:**
- President Pezeshkian has explicitly mentioned evacuation as a potential response
- The November 21st deadline he mentioned has already passed without rainfall
- Tehran faces a unique convergence of crises (water scarcity, land subsidence, pollution)
- The government has already formally announced intentions to relocate the capital
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than a month until resolution)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President's explicit evacuation statement (November 14, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If an evacuation will be announced, the President would very likely make preparatory statements like this (95%)
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation will be announced, such statements might still be made as political rhetoric or to emphasize crisis severity (15%)
- Likelihood ratio: 95%/15% = 6.33
- This significantly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Passing of the November 21st rainfall deadline**
- P(E|H): If evacuation is coming, the triggering condition would almost certainly occur (98%)
- P(E|~H): This condition could easily occur without leading to evacuation (80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 98%/80% = 1.23
- This slightly increases probability

**Evidence 3: Formal announcement of capital relocation plans (January 2025)**
- P(E|H): If evacuation is coming, a prior formal relocation plan would likely exist (90%)
- P(E|~H): Such plans can exist for decades without leading to evacuation (70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 90%/70% = 1.29
- This slightly increases probability

**Evidence 4: Logistical and economic barriers**
- P(E|H): If evacuation is announced, the government would have to overcome enormous logistical challenges (50%)
- P(E|~H): These barriers are a primary reason evacuations don't happen (95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 50%/95% = 0.53
- This significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 5: Availability of less drastic measures**
- P(E|H): If evacuation is announced, other measures would have been deemed insufficient (60%)
- P(E|~H): Governments almost always opt for less drastic measures first (98%)
- Likelihood ratio: 60%/98% = 0.61
- This significantly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:99 (1% probability)

Update on President's explicit statement:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1/99 × 6.33 = 6.33/99 = 0.064
- New probability = 0.064/(1+0.064) = 0.064/1.064 = 6.0%

Update on passing of rainfall deadline:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 6/94 × 1.23 = 7.38/94 = 0.078
- New probability = 0.078/(1+0.078) = 0.078/1.078 = 7.2%

Update on formal relocation plans:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 7.2/92.8 × 1.29 = 9.29/92.8 = 0.10
- New probability = 0.10/(1+0.10) = 0.10/1.10 = 9.1%

Update on logistical barriers:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 9.1/90.9 × 0.53 = 4.82/90.9 = 0.053
- New probability = 0.053/(1+0.053) = 0.053/1.053 = 5.0%

Update on availability of less drastic measures:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 5/95 × 0.61 = 3.05/95 = 0.032
- New probability = 0.032/(1+0.032) = 0.032/1.032 = 3.1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of Tehran's water crisis if it has reached truly catastrophic levels
- I might be overestimating the rationality of decision-making in crisis situations
- The internal power dynamics in Iran could be more complex than my model accounts for
- The compressed timeline (less than a month) makes an evacuation announcement extremely unlikely unless preparations are already underway

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The government might announce a partial evacuation of specific neighborhoods most affected by subsidence
- They could announce a "phased evacuation plan" starting after January 1, 2026
- A voluntary relocation program with incentives might be announced instead

**Adjustments:**
- The extremely short timeline until resolution (less than a month) further reduces the probability
- The lack of visible preparations for such a massive undertaking suggests it's not imminent
- The political costs of such an announcement right before the new year would be enormous

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast of 3.1% is slightly high. The compressed timeline and lack of visible preparations are particularly strong signals against an imminent evacuation announcement.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the extremely short timeline until resolution (less than a month), I assess there is a very low probability that Iran will announce an evacuation of Tehran before January 1, 2026.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a government-ordered mass evacuation of a major city due to a slow-onset environmental disaster (drought and land subsidence).

-   **Reference Class:** Historically, mandatory mass evacuations of large urban populations are exceedingly rare. They are almost exclusively ordered in response to acute, immediate threats like military attacks (e.g., London during the Blitz), industrial disasters (e.g., Chernobyl), or fast-moving natural disasters like hurricanes or volcanic eruptions.
-   **Historical Frequency:** There are virtually no modern precedents for a city of Tehran's size (9+ million residents) being evacuated for a slow-moving crisis like water scarcity. Governments invariably resort to less drastic measures like rationing, public works projects, and demand management.
-   **Prior Probability:** Based on this, the base rate for such an event occurring in any given year is extremely low, likely less than 0.1%. Given the question's short timeframe (less than one month), the raw statistical prior is even lower. However, to account for the fact that we are asking this question precisely because the situation is already known to be severe, I will start with a slightly higher prior of **1%**. This acknowledges that conditions are unusual, before considering the most recent specific evidence. In odds, this is 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in Tehran differs from the historical base case in several critical ways:

-   **Similarities:** The crisis is slow-moving, and the government faces immense logistical, economic, and political barriers to ordering an evacuation, which is consistent with the historical reasons why such orders are not made.
-   **Differences:**
    1.  **Explicit Presidential Threat:** Unlike almost any other historical case of urban drought, the head of state has publicly and recently named evacuation as a potential policy response. This is a major departure from the norm.
    2.  **Converging Crises:** The water crisis is amplified by world-leading rates of land subsidence, creating a compounded threat to infrastructure that makes the situation more acute than a simple drought.
    3.  **Pre-existing Relocation Policy:** The government has already formally stated its long-term intention to move the capital, providing a political and ideological framework that could be used to justify a more rapid, emergency-driven move.

These differences suggest the probability is significantly higher than the historical base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Iran announces an evacuation of Tehran before 2026.

-   **Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's public statement threatening evacuation (E1).**
    -   P(E1 | H): If the government were to order an evacuation, it is very likely the President would have made a prior public statement to prepare the population and signal the gravity of the situation. P(E1 | H) is high.
    -   P(E1 | ~H): If the government were *not* going to order an evacuation, it is also plausible the President would make such a statement. It could be political rhetoric to justify deeply unpopular water rationing, to blame previous administrations, or to demonstrate that he is taking the problem seriously. P(E1 | ~H) is moderately high.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** The ratio P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H) is greater than 1, meaning this evidence **increases** the probability from the prior.

-   **Evidence 2: The extremely short timeline (<1 month) and lack of preparatory signs (E2).**
    -   P(E2 | H): The probability of announcing such a monumental operation with less than a month's lead time and no visible preparatory steps (e.g., media campaigns, military logistical planning, preparing reception areas) is extremely low. A genuine announcement would almost certainly be preceded by such signals.
    -   P(E2 | ~H): If no announcement is planned, the lack of preparation is exactly what we would expect to see. P(E2 | ~H) is very high.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** The ratio P(E2 | H) / P(E2 | ~H) is much less than 1. This is strong evidence that **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 1% (Odds = 1:99).
2.  **Update with Positive Evidence:** The President's statement is a powerful, if ambiguous, signal. It makes the unthinkable a "live" option. This evidence is strong enough to move the probability substantially upward from the very low base rate. Let's estimate this moves the probability into the 5-10% range. For this exercise, let's set the interim probability at 8%.
3.  **Update with Negative Evidence:** The practical constraints are immense, but the most powerful piece of new evidence is the combination of the very short deadline (less than a month) and the complete lack of any follow-up signals in the two weeks since the President's own trigger date (Nov 21) passed. This strongly suggests the government is either not serious about the threat or is pursuing much slower, less drastic options first. This evidence is strong enough to warrant a significant downward revision from our 8% interim estimate. A reduction of about two-thirds seems appropriate to account for this inaction and the temporal constraint.

-   Final Probability ≈ 8% * (1/3) ≈ 2.67%

The posterior probability is in the low single digits. It is significantly higher than the base rate, reflecting the unique political statements, but remains very low due to overwhelming practical realities and the lack of follow-up action on a tight deadline.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Argument for a Higher Probability:** I might be underestimating the severity of the crisis. The situation on the ground (e.g., risk of imminent, catastrophic failure of water infrastructure due to subsidence) could be far worse than is publicly known, forcing the government into a sudden, seemingly unplanned announcement. The opacity of the regime makes this a non-zero risk.
-   **Argument for a Lower Probability:** I might be overestimating the significance of the President's words. The statement is most likely political posturing—a classic tactic of "proposing the unthinkable to make the unpalatable acceptable." The real goal is likely to secure public acquiescence for draconian water rationing, with no genuine intention of ordering an evacuation. In this scenario, the true probability is not much higher than the base rate.
-   **Adjustment:** My current estimate in the 2-3% range feels like a reasonable balance. It correctly prices this as a tail risk that has become more plausible due to recent rhetoric, but is still constrained by reality. I will select a final value at the higher end of this range to account for the "unknown unknowns" regarding the true state of Tehran's infrastructure.

### 6. Final Forecast
The President's explicit threat has elevated a historically unprecedented event into the realm of possibility. However, the immense logistical, economic, and political barriers, combined with the extremely short timeline and a lack of any visible preparations, make an actual announcement before January 1, 2026, highly improbable. The most likely scenario is that the threat was rhetoric to justify severe but less drastic measures like rationing.

Final: 3%
