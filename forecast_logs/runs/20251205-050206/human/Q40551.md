### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Cold War Monthly Rate:** From 1991 to 2024 (34 years), approximately 125 contentious cases were filed. This yields an average of ~3.68 cases/year, or a **monthly base rate of ~30%**. This class is useful as it reflects the modern, post-Soviet era of international relations where the court's use has been more frequent.
2.  **Recent Decade Monthly Rate (2015-2024):** In the last 10 full years, 34 cases were filed, for an average of 3.4 cases/year. This translates to a **monthly base rate of ~28%**. This class is highly relevant as it captures the most recent patterns in international litigation, including the rise of "lawfare."
3.  **December Filing Rate (2015-2024):** Over the past 10 years, 3 of the 34 cases (~8.8%) were filed in December. Since December represents 1/12th (~8.3%) of the year, this suggests December is a roughly average month for filings, not significantly impacted by holiday periods. The base rate from this specific monthly data is **1-in-10 Decembers, or 10%**, but the sample size is very small.

*Reasoning:* The recent decade (28% monthly) is the most plausible reference class, as it reflects current geopolitical norms. The long-term post-Cold War rate (30%) is a good cross-check. The December-specific rate (10%) is too noisy due to small numbers but suggests no major seasonal impediment.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-18** ICJ delivers a landmark ruling on maritime delimitation in a high-profile case, increasing the Court's public visibility and perceived relevance. — ↑ — A prominent, successful resolution can encourage other states to see the ICJ as a viable option for their own disputes.
*   **2025-10-29** A border skirmish between two neighboring states in South America leads to casualties and a breakdown in diplomatic relations, with one party mentioning "all available international remedies." — ↑ — Such incidents are classic precursors to ICJ filings, especially when diplomatic channels close and public pressure for action mounts.
*   **2025-09-20** The UN General Assembly passes a resolution condemning a state for transboundary environmental damage from industrial activities, but the UN Security Council takes no action. — ↑ — Security Council inaction often pushes aggrieved states to seek alternative legal venues like the ICJ to enforce international norms and seek reparations.
*   **2025-01-01 to 2025-12-04** Five contentious cases have already been filed at the ICJ in 2025. — ↑ — This is significantly above the recent annual average (~3.4), indicating 2025 is a year of heightened international legal activity and willingness to litigate.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Escalation of Existing Disputes:** A sudden worsening of a long-simmering border, maritime, or resource dispute is the most common trigger for a new case. (Size: Large)
2.  **"Lawfare" and Political Signaling:** States increasingly use ICJ filings not just to win a case, but to publicly condemn an adversary, rally international support, and create a historical record of wrongdoing. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Treaty-Based Jurisdiction:** Many bilateral and multilateral treaties contain clauses that grant the ICJ compulsory jurisdiction over disputes. A perceived violation of such a treaty can provide a direct and rapid path to filing a case. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Sudden, Shocking Events:** Incidents like the downing of an aircraft, seizure of a vessel, or a state-sponsored attack can trigger a rapid legal response as a form of political retaliation and a demand for accountability. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Failure of Other Diplomatic Arenas:** When the UN Security Council is paralyzed by a veto, states may turn to the ICJ as the only remaining high-level international forum to press their claims. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unusually High Caseload in 2025:** With five cases already filed by early December, 2025 is already one of the busiest years in the Court's recent history. This suggests a global environment more conducive to litigation than the historical average.
*   **Increased Normalization of ICJ Use:** High-profile cases (e.g., related to Ukraine, Gaza) have raised the Court's profile and normalized its use as a tool of statecraft, potentially lowering the threshold for other states to file.
*   **Geopolitical Fragmentation:** Persistent deadlock among the permanent members of the Security Council is arguably at a post-Cold War high, increasing the incentive for states to seek recourse through legal mechanisms like the ICJ.
*   **Very Short Time Horizon:** The question is specific to a single month (December). While the annual rate is high, the probability of a filing occurring in this specific ~3-week window is inherently lower than for a longer period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the recent monthly base rate of **~28%** seems appropriate, reflecting the probability of a case in any given month (equivalent n of ~4-5).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The fact that five cases have already been filed in 2025 indicates an exceptionally litigious year, suggesting the pool of potential filers is highly active.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The increasing use of the ICJ for political signaling ("lawfare") and the paralysis of the UN Security Council create stronger incentives for filing.
    *   ↑ (Small): Recent international incidents (e.g., border skirmishes, environmental disputes) provide plausible, concrete triggers for an imminent filing.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The very short resolution window (less than one month) is a significant constraint; many factors must align perfectly for a filing to occur in this specific timeframe.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an environment more prone to ICJ filings than the historical average. The upward pressures from the year's high activity and geopolitical context likely outweigh the constraint of the short timeframe. The posterior should move **significantly upward** from the ~28% prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from a Foreign Ministry explicitly threatening to take a dispute to the ICJ.
    *   A sudden, complete breakdown of bilateral talks over a known international dispute.
    *   A new, acute international incident (e.g., military clash, vessel seizure) where one state is the clear aggressor.
    *   Leaked reports of a state's legal team preparing an application to the Court.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcements of new, high-level diplomatic negotiations between states in known disputes.
    *   A major global crisis (e.g., financial, health) that consumes all diplomatic attention.
    *   Statements from potential litigant states emphasizing de-escalation and peaceful resolution.
    *   The end of the month approaching with no public signals of an impending filing.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Secrecy of Decision-Making:** The decision to file a case is a sovereign, political one made in secret. It can be prepared for months and filed with no public warning.
*   **Lumpiness of Data:** Case filings are discrete, lumpy events, not a smooth statistical process. A high annual rate does not guarantee a filing in any specific month.
*   **Definition of "Introduced":** The resolution depends on the formal act of a case being "introduced" or "instituted" on the ICJ's docket in December, not on preliminary statements or threats.
*   **Hypothetical Premise:** The background information that five cases have already been filed in 2025 is a given for this forecast and is the single most important driver of the analysis. If this premise were inaccurate, the forecast would change dramatically.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for a new ICJ case in any given month is around 28-30%. However, 2025 has been an anomalously active year for ICJ filings, suggesting a heightened global propensity for international litigation that significantly increases the probability of a sixth case being filed in the short window of December.

To forecast the probability of a sixth contentious case being opened at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the recent decade monthly rate of ~28%, reflecting the average probability of a case being filed in any given month from 2015 to 2024. This rate is chosen because it captures the most recent trends in international litigation and is consistent with the current geopolitical environment.
- **Initial Prior:** 28% probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base case in that the ICJ continues to serve as a venue for resolving international disputes, and states have historically filed cases at a consistent rate.
- **Differences:** 2025 has already seen five cases filed, which is above the annual average, indicating a higher-than-usual propensity for litigation. Additionally, recent geopolitical tensions and the ICJ's increased visibility may further encourage filings.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **High Caseload in 2025:** The fact that five cases have already been filed this year suggests a heightened level of international legal activity. This increases the likelihood of another case being filed in December.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High (↑)
- **Recent International Incidents:** Events such as border skirmishes and environmental disputes provide potential triggers for new cases.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate (↑)
- **Short Timeframe:** The specific focus on December limits the window for a new case to be filed, which is a constraining factor.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate (↓)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 0.28 / (1 - 0.28) = 0.3889
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is greater than 1 due to the increased activity and geopolitical context, but tempered by the short timeframe.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.3889 × 1.5 (estimated) = 0.58335
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.58335 / (1 + 0.58335) ≈ 0.368 or 36.8%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of no new cases despite the active year, due to the short timeframe.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of diplomatic resolutions or other international crises diverting attention.
- **Adjustment:** Given the constraints of the short timeframe, a slight downward adjustment is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering the evidence and potential biases, the final probability is adjusted to reflect both the active year and the short timeframe constraint.

Final: 35%

# Forecasting: Will a sixth contentious case be opened at the ICJ in December 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish a prior probability based on historical ICJ case filing patterns:

- **Recent decade monthly rate (2015-2024)**: 34 cases over 10 years = 3.4 cases/year = ~28% chance per month
- **Post-Cold War monthly rate (1991-2024)**: 125 cases over 34 years = 3.68 cases/year = ~30% chance per month
- **December-specific rate**: Limited data suggests December is roughly average for filings (~10% from small sample)

I'll use the recent decade monthly rate of 28% as my prior, as it reflects current geopolitical norms while having a reasonable sample size. This translates to prior odds of 28:72 or approximately 0.39:1.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The ICJ continues to function with the same jurisdictional constraints
- States still need to consent to jurisdiction
- The fundamental mechanisms for filing cases remain unchanged

**Key differences:**
- 2025 has already seen 5 contentious cases filed (by Sudan, Iran, France, Lithuania, and Russia) in ~11 months, significantly above the annual average of 3.4
- Recent high-profile ICJ rulings have increased the Court's visibility
- There are active international disputes that could precipitate filings (South American border skirmish, transboundary environmental damage)
- The UN Security Council appears particularly deadlocked, potentially driving states toward legal remedies

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Five cases already filed in 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If a sixth case will be filed, we'd expect to see an already-active year
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if no sixth case is filed, five cases is plausible but above average
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Recent border skirmish in South America with mention of "international remedies"**
- P(E|H): High (~0.7) - Such incidents often precede ICJ filings
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many disputes mention international remedies without resulting in immediate filings
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: UN General Assembly condemnation with Security Council inaction**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Security Council paralysis can drive ICJ filings
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many such situations don't result in immediate ICJ cases
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Short time window (December only)**
- P(E|H): Certain (1.0) - If a case is filed in December, it must be in this window
- P(E|~H): High (~0.92) - If no case is filed in December, it's because the timing didn't align
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.09
- This has minimal impact on probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.39:1 (28% probability)

First update (five cases already in 2025):
- Posterior odds = 0.39 × 2.25 = 0.88:1
- Posterior probability = 0.88/(1+0.88) ≈ 47%

Second update (border skirmish with international remedies mention):
- Posterior odds = 0.88 × 1.75 = 1.54:1
- Posterior probability = 1.54/(1+1.54) ≈ 61%

Third update (UNGA condemnation with UNSC inaction):
- Posterior odds = 1.54 × 1.5 = 2.31:1
- Posterior probability = 2.31/(1+2.31) ≈ 70%

Fourth update (short time window constraint):
- Posterior odds = 2.31 × 1.09 = 2.52:1
- Posterior probability = 2.52/(1+2.52) ≈ 72%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- The December timeframe is very short (less than a month remaining)
- ICJ filings can be lumpy and unpredictable
- States might delay filings until after holiday periods
- The five cases already filed might exhaust the "pool" of ready disputes for 2025

**Alternative perspective:**
A more conservative forecast might argue that despite the active year, the probability of a filing in any specific month remains closer to the base rate. The December holiday period might further reduce filing likelihood.

**Tail risks:**
- A sudden international crisis could either trigger an immediate filing or divert attention from legal proceedings
- A breakthrough diplomatic solution to a brewing dispute could prevent a filing

After considering these factors, I should adjust my forecast downward somewhat. The evidence for an above-average likelihood is strong, but the short timeframe is a significant constraint.

## 6. Final Forecast

Adjusting for the red team considerations, particularly the short timeframe and potential holiday effects, I'll revise my forecast from 72% to 65%.

Final: 65%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use the rate of new contentious cases filed at the ICJ in the most recent, relevant period. The research report provides data for the last full decade (2015-2024), during which 34 cases were filed over 10 years.

*   **Calculation:** 34 cases / 10 years = 3.4 cases per year.
*   **Monthly Rate:** 3.4 cases / 12 months ≈ 0.283 cases per month.

Using a Poisson distribution to model the arrival of cases, the probability of at least one case in a given month (with a rate λ = 0.283) is:
P(≥1 case) = 1 - P(0 cases) = 1 - e^(-0.283) ≈ 1 - 0.753 = 0.247.

Therefore, the base rate for a new case being filed in any given month is approximately 25%.

*   **Prior Probability P(H): 25%**
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = 1/3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The fundamental drivers of international disputes (borders, treaties, etc.) and the function of the ICJ as a forum for resolution remain consistent with the reference period. The month of December has historically been an average month for filings, so there is no strong seasonal effect to consider.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the context of 2025 itself. Five contentious cases have already been filed by early December. This is significantly higher than the annual average of 3.4, indicating that 2025 is a year of heightened international legal activity. This suggests the underlying conditions for litigation are more favorable than in an average year from our reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate two key pieces of evidence to update the prior.

**Evidence 1 (E1): Five contentious cases have already been filed in 2025.**
This is strong evidence that the "propensity to litigate" in 2025 is higher than the historical average. A year with 5 cases already filed is more likely to produce a 6th than a year with only 1 or 2.
*   **P(E1 | H):** If a 6th case is filed in December (H), it implies a high annual rate of filings. Seeing 5 cases by early December is very consistent with this high-rate world.
*   **P(E1 | ~H):** If no 6th case is filed (~H), the annual total would be 5. This is still above the average of 3.4.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence (5 cases so far) makes the hypothesis (a 6th case will be filed) significantly more likely. Instead of a qualitative likelihood ratio, I will update the base rate itself. A simple method is to create a blended monthly probability, giving weight to both the long-term data (34 cases in 120 months) and the specific 2025 data (5 cases in 11 months). This results in an updated monthly probability of approximately 34-35% for a "hot" year like 2025. This represents a significant upward update from the 25% prior.

**Evidence 2 (E2): Specific geopolitical triggers mentioned in the report.**
The report notes a border skirmish, a UNGA resolution followed by UNSC inaction, and a landmark ICJ ruling increasing the court's visibility. These events provide plausible, concrete pathways for a new case to emerge.
*   **P(E2 | H):** If a case is filed, it is quite likely that there would be preceding public events of this nature.
*   **P(E2 | ~H):** Such events also occur without leading to ICJ filings. However, the presence of multiple potential triggers makes a filing more likely than in a month with no such precursors.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E2 | H) / P(E2 | ~H)):** This is greater than 1. I estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of approximately 1.3, representing a moderate increase in probability.

**Constraint: Short Timeframe**
The forecast is for December, but it is already December 5th. Only 26 of 31 days remain. This will act as a downward adjustment on the final probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 25% (Odds = 1/3).
2.  **Update for E1 (High 2025 Caseload):** As calculated above, this strong evidence updates our baseline probability for a full month in 2025 to approximately 35%.
    *   New Probability P(H') = 35%.
    *   New Odds = 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.54.
3.  **Update for E2 (Specific Triggers):** Now, I apply the likelihood ratio of 1.3 for the specific triggers.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.54 × 1.3 ≈ 0.70.
    *   Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 0.70 / 1.70 ≈ 41%.

This 41% represents the probability of a case being filed in a full December with the given evidence.

4.  **Adjust for Remaining Time:** I must now adjust this for the 26/31 days remaining in the month. Using the Poisson rate method is most appropriate.
    *   A 41% monthly probability corresponds to a rate (λ) where P = 1 - e^(-λ).
    *   0.41 = 1 - e^(-λ)  =>  e^(-λ) = 0.59  =>  λ = -ln(0.59) ≈ 0.527.
    *   The rate for the remaining portion of the month is λ_rem = 0.527 * (26/31) ≈ 0.442.
    *   The final probability is P_rem = 1 - e^(-0.442) ≈ 1 - 0.643 = 0.357.

The resulting posterior probability is approximately **36%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 36% is a significant increase from the 25% base rate. A key counterargument is that case filings are lumpy and random; the high number so far could be a statistical cluster, and the rest of the year could be quiet (regression to the mean). This would imply a probability closer to the base rate, adjusted for time (~21%). Another factor is a potential holiday slowdown in the last two weeks of December, which could slightly reduce the chances of a filing. My model accounts for the high activity in 2025 in a measured way and incorporates the specific triggers, which I believe is more robust than relying solely on the long-term average. The 36% figure correctly reflects that a filing is more likely than usual, but no filing remains the most probable outcome.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate of a new ICJ case in a given month is around 25%. However, 2025 has been an unusually active year with five cases already filed, which strongly suggests a higher underlying propensity for litigation. This evidence, combined with several plausible geopolitical triggers, significantly increases the probability. After adjusting for the fact that part of December has already passed, the updated probability is approximately 36%.

Final: 36%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for the event (a new contentious ICJ case being filed in a given month) is the recent decade monthly rate from 2015-2024, which is ~28% (based on 34 cases over 120 months, averaging ~0.283 cases per month, or a 28% chance of at least one in any month). I chose this because it reflects the most current patterns in international litigation, including the rise of "lawfare" and geopolitical tensions, making it more relevant than longer-term rates like the post-Cold War average (~30%). The December-specific rate (~10%) is too noisy due to small sample size (only 3 cases in 10 Decembers), so I discount it. This gives an initial prior probability of 28%, or odds of about 0.39:1 (28/72).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case (2015-2024 months) in that ICJ filings remain driven by ongoing geopolitical disputes, treaty violations, and Security Council deadlocks, with no fundamental change in the court's jurisdiction or global structure. For example, the mechanisms like escalation of disputes and lawfare are consistent with historical drivers. However, it differs in key ways: 2025 has already seen 5 cases filed by early December, far exceeding the annual average of ~3.4, indicating an unusually litigious year possibly due to heightened global fragmentation and normalization of ICJ use (e.g., from high-profile cases like Ukraine or Gaza). Additionally, recent events like the November 2025 maritime ruling, October border skirmish, and September UN resolution on environmental damage provide specific, timely triggers not always present in average months. These differences matter because they suggest a temporarily elevated propensity for filings, pushing the probability upward, though the short remaining window (~26 days in December) adds a constraining difference, as filings are lumpy and require alignment of political will, preparation, and timing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **High 2025 caseload (5 cases already filed):** This is more likely if the environment is conducive to filings (P(E|H) ~80%, as busy years often cluster cases) than if not (P(E|~H) ~20%, based on historical variance where most years have 2-4 cases). Likelihood ratio: ~4 (80/20), strongly increasing the probability.
- **Recent developments (e.g., November ruling, October skirmish, September UN resolution):** These are somewhat more likely under H (P(E|H) ~60%, as they act as catalysts) than ~H (P(E|~H) ~40%, as such events occur regularly without always leading to filings). Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (60/40), moderately increasing the probability.
- **Geopolitical fragmentation and lawfare trends:** More likely under H (P(E|H) ~70%, as they lower barriers to filing) than ~H (P(E|~H) ~50%, as they're ongoing but not always decisive). Likelihood ratio: ~1.4 (70/50), moderately increasing the probability.
- **Short December window:** This is less likely under H (P(E|H) ~40%, due to time constraints and potential holiday slowdowns) than ~H (P(E|~H) ~70%, as no filing is the default in short periods). Likelihood ratio: ~0.57 (40/70), moderately decreasing the probability.

Overall, the evidence has a net positive likelihood ratio, dominated by the anomalous 2025 activity.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 0.39:1 (28% probability). I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio from the evidence: ~3 (net from strong upward factors like the high caseload and trends, tempered by the short window; this is a qualitative aggregation of the ratios above, erring conservative per calibration guidance to avoid big swings).

Posterior odds = 0.39 × 3 = 1.17:1.

Posterior probability = 1.17 / (1 + 1.17) ≈ 54%.

This update reflects a meaningful but not drastic shift upward from the prior, accounting for the evidence of a hot year while acknowledging uncertainty in the short timeframe and lumpiness of filings. The posterior remains uncertain (not extreme) due to the secrecy of state decisions and potential for no triggers aligning in December.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in upward adjustment, as the 5 cases in 2025 could be a random cluster rather than a signal of sustained activity—historical data shows variance, and with only ~3.4/year average, 5 isn't impossibly high (Poisson distribution suggests ~10% chance of 5+ in a year). Blind spots include over-relying on recent events as "triggers" when many similar incidents don't lead to filings (base rate fallacy), and underestimating secrecy (a case could be filed unexpectedly, but equally, none might). Tail risks: On the high end, a sudden December crisis (e.g., new skirmish) could spike probability to 80%+; on the low end, diplomatic resolutions or global distractions could drop it to 10%. An alternative forecast of ~35% (smaller nudge from prior) is plausible if emphasizing the noisy December data and viewing 2025 as regression to the mean, but I rebut this by noting the report's emphasis on 2025's anomaly as the key driver, which warrants more weight. No major adjustment needed, but I'll mentally widen uncertainty to avoid overprecision.

Final: 54%
