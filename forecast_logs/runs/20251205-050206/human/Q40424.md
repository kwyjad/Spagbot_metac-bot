### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Normal Period):** In a typical year without a major constitutional crisis, resignations from the superior courts are extremely rare. Judges serve until the mandatory retirement age of 65 (Supreme Court) or 62 (High Courts). The base rate for resignations due to political protest or principle in a non-crisis year is effectively **0-1 judges per year** across the entire superior judiciary (~17 SC judges + ~150 HC judges). This class has limited relevance due to the current crisis.
2.  **Judicial Defiance during Pakistani Constitutional Crises:** A more relevant reference class is the 2007-2009 judicial crisis under General Pervez Musharraf. After Musharraf suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and later declared a state of emergency, he issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) requiring judges to take a new oath. Approximately 60 judges of the superior courts, including 13 from the Supreme Court, refused to take the oath and were removed. While not all were formal "resignations," this act of defiance is the closest historical analogue. This suggests a crisis base rate of **30-60 judges (20-40% of the judiciary)** leaving their posts in protest.
3.  **Mass Resignations in Response to Executive Overreach (International):** Globally, mass judicial resignations are rare but do occur in response to actions that cripple judicial independence (e.g., court-packing, stripping jurisdiction). Events in countries like Hungary, Poland, or Venezuela in the 21st century provide examples, but the political and legal cultures are sufficiently different that they offer only a weak prior. The key takeaway is that such events are possible but require a high degree of judicial solidarity and a perception that the institution is being fundamentally destroyed.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-13] 27th Amendment is passed, fundamentally altering judicial structure and stripping the Supreme Court of constitutional jurisdiction. — ↑ (large) — This is the primary trigger event, creating a powerful reason for principled resignations.
*   [2025-11-14] Opposition alliance TTAP, led by Imran Khan, calls for nationwide protests against the amendment. — ↑ (small) — Creates a political atmosphere of resistance, potentially emboldening judges to act, but their decisions are more likely driven by institutional rather than partisan factors.
*   [2025-11-15] Two highly respected Supreme Court justices, Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, resign in protest. — ↑ (large) — Establishes a "permission structure" for others to follow. The seniority and reputation of these judges lend significant weight to the act of resigning.
*   [2025-11-18] Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns, citing the amendment. — ↑ (moderate) — Demonstrates that the protest is not confined to the Supreme Court, suggesting a potentially broader base of dissent among the larger pool of High Court judges.
*   [2025-11-25] (Hypothetical) Major bar associations, including the Supreme Court Bar Association, announce a boycott of court proceedings until the amendment is withdrawn. — ↑ (moderate) — Signals strong, organized support from the legal community, increasing pressure on remaining judges to show solidarity and making it harder to conduct normal judicial business.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Judicial Solidarity & Peer Effects (Large):** The initial resignations by respected senior judges create significant pressure on others to follow suit. Private consultations among judges are likely occurring. If a critical mass is reached, a cascade of resignations could follow as staying on becomes an act of endorsement.
2.  **Principled Stand on Judicial Independence (Large):** The amendment is a direct assault on the judiciary's role as a constitutional arbiter. Judges with a strong commitment to the rule of law and separation of powers will feel a moral or professional obligation to resign rather than legitimize the new system.
3.  **Government Coercion & Incentives (Moderate):** The government can use both threats and rewards. The new power to transfer High Court justices can be used to intimidate. Conversely, appointments to the new, powerful Federal Constitutional Court can be offered to compliant judges, creating a strong incentive to stay.
4.  **Perception of Futility vs. Resistance (Moderate):** Some judges may believe the changes are a *fait accompli* backed by the military establishment. They might choose to "stay and fight from within" or simply preserve their careers, believing mass resignations would be a futile gesture that allows the government to easily stack the courts.
5.  **Pressure from the Legal Community (Small-Moderate):** Bar associations are influential actors. Widespread condemnation, boycotts, and direct appeals from lawyers can create a hostile working environment for judges who choose to remain, pushing waverers toward resignation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Systemic vs. Personalized Attack:** The 2007 crisis was triggered by the removal of a single individual (the Chief Justice). This 27th Amendment is a far more fundamental, systemic restructuring that abolishes the Supreme Court's core function. This could provoke a stronger, more widespread reaction.
*   **Creation of a Parallel Power Structure:** Unlike in 2007, the amendment creates a new, powerful Federal Constitutional Court. This provides the government with a tool to co-opt ambitious or compliant judges, potentially fracturing judicial unity by offering a desirable alternative to the weakened traditional courts.
*   **Consolidated Executive/Military Power:** The context is one of a government that has successfully passed a sweeping amendment, suggesting a high degree of control over state institutions. This may make open defiance seem more dangerous and less likely to succeed than in 2007, when Musharraf's power was visibly waning.
*   **Speed of Initial Resignations:** The resignation of three judges, including two from the Supreme Court, within days of the amendment's passage is a rapid and potent signal of dissent, potentially accelerating the timeline compared to the more drawn-out 2007 crisis.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Given the crisis, the 2007 reference class is most appropriate. A prior centered around **10-15 resignations** seems plausible, with a very wide distribution (e.g., a Negative Binomial with high variance) to account for the possibility of either a fizzle or a full-scale cascade. The equivalent n should be low, reflecting the uniqueness of this specific amendment.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The amendment is more fundamental than the 2007 PCO, attacking the entire institution's core purpose.
    *   ↑ (Large): The immediate resignation of two respected SC justices provides strong initial evidence and a focal point for a movement.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The spread of resignations to the High Court level suggests the dissent is not isolated.
    *   ↓ (Small): The creation of the Federal Constitutional Court provides an "off-ramp" for judges who might otherwise resign, potentially fracturing solidarity.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the estimate upward from the initial prior. The nature of the amendment and the seniority of the first movers suggest the final number is more likely to be in the upper range of the 2007 crisis reference class than the lower. The posterior median should shift significantly higher.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
**UP indicators:**
*   The Chief Justice of Pakistan resigns or issues a statement condemning the amendment.
*   Major bar associations call for an indefinite strike or boycott of court proceedings.
*   A coordinated statement of protest is issued by a group of sitting judges.
*   Another 2-3 judges resign in the next week, indicating a sustained wave.
*   Large-scale, persistent protests by lawyers emerge in major cities.

**DOWN indicators:**
*   The Chief Justice or other senior judges administer oaths for the new Federal Constitutional Court.
*   A week passes with no further resignations.
*   Prominent judges who were expected to resign make public statements about continuing their duties.
*   The government successfully appoints the first slate of judges to the new court without significant protest.
*   Opposition-led street protests fail to gain significant traction.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most important discussions are happening in private among the judges. Public signals may lag behind private decisions.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria specify "resign." It's possible judges could be removed, sidelined, or refuse to take a new oath without formally submitting a letter of resignation. These actions would not count but would reflect the same dynamic.
*   **Volatility:** The situation is highly fluid. A single event, such as a violent crackdown on lawyer protests or a statement from the army chief, could dramatically alter judges' calculations.
*   **Data Lag:** Official confirmation of resignations may be delayed. We are reliant on media reports which may not capture the full picture immediately.
*   **Government Counter-moves:** The government is not a passive actor. It will likely be working intensely behind the scenes to prevent a judicial collapse, and its success or failure is difficult to observe.

**Final Research Summary**
This constitutional crisis is more fundamental than the 2007 precedent, and the quick, high-profile resignations suggest a strong potential for a wider wave. The final number will likely be determined by whether a critical mass of judges acts in solidarity in the next two weeks, balanced against government pressure and incentives offered by the new court structure.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical precedent of judicial defiance during the 2007-2009 crisis under General Musharraf, where approximately 60 judges refused to take a new oath. This suggests a base rate of 30-60 judges (20-40% of the judiciary) leaving their posts in protest. Given the current crisis, a prior centered around 10-15 resignations with a wide distribution is plausible.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both situations involve significant constitutional changes perceived as undermining judicial independence.
   - Differences: The current amendment is more systemic, abolishing the Supreme Court's constitutional jurisdiction, which could provoke a stronger reaction. However, the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court offers an alternative path for judges, potentially reducing resignations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The passage of the 27th Amendment and the immediate resignation of three judges (including two from the Supreme Court) strongly suggest a higher likelihood of further resignations.
   - The call for nationwide protests and the potential for bar association boycotts increase the pressure on judges to resign.
   - The creation of the Federal Constitutional Court provides an incentive for some judges to remain, potentially reducing the number of resignations.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 10-15 resignations, the evidence of immediate resignations and widespread outrage shifts the distribution upward. The posterior distribution is likely skewed towards a higher number of resignations, with a median closer to the upper range of the 2007 crisis reference class.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of overestimating the number of resignations due to the government's ability to coerce or incentivize judges to stay. The creation of the Federal Constitutional Court could fracture judicial solidarity.
   - An alternative scenario could involve fewer resignations if the government successfully mitigates dissent through strategic appointments or other measures.
   - Adjust the forecast to account for these possibilities, ensuring the distribution reflects both the potential for a cascade of resignations and the government's countermeasures.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the number of resignations are as follows:

P10: 5  
P20: 10  
P40: 20  
P60: 30  
P80: 40  
P90: 50

# Forecasting: Judicial Resignations in Pakistan's Superior Courts (Late 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the 2007-2009 Pakistani judicial crisis as my primary reference class, as it represents the most relevant historical precedent of judicial resistance to constitutional changes affecting judicial independence.

During the 2007-2009 crisis, approximately 60 judges from superior courts (including 13 from the Supreme Court) refused to take new oaths under Musharraf's Provisional Constitutional Order. This represents roughly 30-40% of the superior judiciary at that time.

The base rate distribution I'll use has:
- Median: ~15 judges resigning
- Range: 5-60 judges (with a right-skewed distribution)
- This reflects the possibility of either a limited protest or a cascade effect similar to 2007.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to 2007 crisis:**
- Both involve constitutional changes that fundamentally alter judicial independence
- Both occurred during periods of strong military influence in governance
- Both triggered immediate judicial resistance

**Key differences:**
- The 27th Amendment is more systemic than the 2007 PCO, attacking the entire institution's core function rather than targeting specific judges
- The creation of a parallel Federal Constitutional Court provides an alternative path for judges (potentially reducing resignations)
- The immediate resignation of high-profile judges (3 already) suggests faster momentum than in 2007
- The current amendment has already passed, whereas the 2007 crisis evolved over time

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast higher:**
- Two Supreme Court justices (Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah) resigned immediately (strong signal)
- The spread to High Court level (Judge Mirza) suggests broader resistance
- The amendment fundamentally alters the judiciary's constitutional role
- Opposition alliance calling for nationwide protests creates political cover

**Evidence pushing forecast lower:**
- Only 3 resignations so far (out of ~170 superior court judges)
- The new Federal Constitutional Court creates incentives to stay
- The amendment has already passed with apparent military backing
- No indication yet of coordinated mass action among remaining judges

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at ~15 resignations, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. The immediate resignation of two respected Supreme Court justices significantly increases the likelihood of more resignations. This shifts my distribution upward by ~5-10 judges.

2. The spread to High Court level suggests the movement isn't confined to the Supreme Court, which has a multiplicative effect given the larger number of High Court judges. This further shifts my distribution upward.

3. However, the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court provides an alternative that may reduce the incentive to resign, partially offsetting the upward pressure.

After these updates, my posterior distribution has:
- Shifted median: ~25 judges
- Wider range: 8-70 judges
- More right-skewed, reflecting the possibility of a cascade effect

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating judicial solidarity based on the initial resignations
- The government likely has significant leverage over many judges through various means
- The 2007 crisis occurred in a different political context; today's judges may be more pragmatic
- I might be underestimating the government's ability to quickly replace resigning judges

**Alternative scenario:** Only 5-10 judges resign, as most decide to "work within the system" rather than resign in protest. The government successfully isolates the initial resignations as outliers.

**Counterpoint:** The fundamental nature of this constitutional change strikes at the core of judicial identity and purpose. If a critical mass forms (perhaps 10-15 judges), a cascade effect becomes increasingly likely.

Considering these factors, I'll widen my distribution and slightly reduce my median estimate to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 7
P20: 12
P40: 20
P60: 28
P80: 42
P90: 55

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the 2007-2009 judicial crisis in Pakistan under General Pervez Musharraf. During that crisis, approximately 60 judges of the superior courts (out of ~167 total) were removed after refusing to take a new oath. This represents a significant portion (~36%) of the judiciary leaving their posts in protest. While the mechanism was "removal" rather than "resignation," it establishes a precedent for mass judicial defiance in a constitutional crisis.

However, resignation is a more active and individual choice than a collective refusal to take an oath. Therefore, my prior distribution will be centered lower than the 60 judges from 2007 but will have a very wide tail to account for the possibility of a similar-scale event. I'll set a prior with a median around **15 resignations**, reflecting a serious but not total judicial revolt, with a plausible range from just a handful to over 40.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the 2007 crisis in several key ways:
*   **Nature of the Threat (Higher):** The 27th Amendment is a more fundamental, systemic attack on the judiciary's core constitutional function than the 2007 crisis, which was initially triggered by the removal of a single Chief Justice. This suggests a potentially stronger, more principled reaction.
*   **Government Incentives (Lower):** The creation of a new, powerful Federal Constitutional Court provides an "off-ramp" for ambitious or compliant judges. This acts as a powerful tool to break judicial solidarity and co-opt judges, a mechanism that was not present in 2007. This suggests a lower number of resignations.
*   **Initial Response (Higher):** The immediate resignation of two highly respected Supreme Court justices and one High Court judge is a potent, rapid signal of dissent that creates a "permission structure" for others to follow.

On balance, the more fundamental nature of the threat and the strong initial signal suggest an outcome potentially as severe as 2007, while the government's new tools to divide the judiciary pull in the opposite direction.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence for Higher Numbers:**
    *   **The 27th Amendment:** The sheer scope of the changes, particularly stripping the Supreme Court of its constitutional jurisdiction, is a powerful catalyst for principled resignations. (Large upward pressure).
    *   **Senior-Level Resignations:** The resignations of Justices Shah and Minallah on Nov 15 provide a strong focal point for a protest movement and lend it credibility. The High Court resignation on Nov 18 shows the dissent is not confined to the apex court. (Large upward pressure).
*   **Evidence for Lower Numbers:**
    *   **Time Lag:** The question is being evaluated on December 5. The last reported resignation was on November 18. This gap of approximately 17 days with no further resignations is strong evidence that the initial momentum for a mass cascade has stalled. Collective action of this type often happens in a rapid wave; a long pause suggests one is not materializing. (Very large downward pressure).
    *   **Government Counter-Measures:** The implicit threat of forced transfers and the incentive of appointments to the new Constitutional Court are likely being used behind the scenes to ensure judicial compliance and prevent a mass walkout. (Moderate downward pressure).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My initial prior, centered at ~15, was based on the 2007 crisis. The evidence of the amendment's severity and the seniority of the first resigners initially pushed my estimate upwards, making a high number of resignations seem plausible.

However, the ~17-day time lag with no new resignations is a critical piece of new evidence. It strongly updates my belief away from a large-scale, rapid cascade scenario. The most likely outcome is that the initial wave of protest resignations is over, and any further resignations will be a slow trickle, if any.

Therefore, I am performing a significant downward update. My posterior distribution will be heavily anchored to the current number of 3, with a right-skewed tail to account for the possibility of a few more judges resigning before the end of the year. The median of my posterior is now much lower, in the range of 5-7.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk was anchoring too heavily on the 2007 crisis and not giving enough weight to the evidence of the time lag. The alternative forecast is that the three resignations are the final total. This is highly plausible; the government may have successfully quelled the rebellion, and the window for a coordinated protest may have closed. My forecast accounts for this by setting the P10 at 3.

Another risk is that a second wave is triggered by a new event before the end of December (e.g., a particularly controversial appointment to the new court). This could cause a new cluster of resignations. My upper percentiles (P80/P90) are designed to capture this tail risk, acknowledging that the situation remains volatile despite the current lull. The final distribution reflects a belief that the movement has likely stalled but retains a small chance of reigniting.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My forecast is heavily influenced by the lack of new resignations since November 18, suggesting the initial wave of protest has subsided. The distribution is therefore centered on a low number, with a tail for a potential second, smaller wave.

P20: 4
