### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Unilateral US kinetic military actions against non-state actors in a third country (without host nation consent):** This class includes drone strikes, special forces raids, and airstrikes targeting terrorist or insurgent groups in countries like Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria. Over the past 20 years, the US has conducted such operations in a handful of countries. The base rate for this happening in *any* given non-allied country with a significant terrorist presence in a given year is low, perhaps **2-5%**. This is the most relevant class, but Nigeria's status complicates it.
2.  **US military interventions in major, non-hostile regional powers:** This class includes actions against countries that are not failed states and with whom the US has significant, if complex, relationships. Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation, its largest economy, and a key regional security player. Unsolicited military intervention in such a state is exceptionally rare, with a base rate approaching **<0.5%** per year. The diplomatic and economic fallout would be immense, unlike a strike in Yemen or Somalia.
3.  **US military actions explicitly motivated by R2P (Responsibility to Protect) or preventing mass atrocities:** This class includes interventions like the 1990s operations in the Balkans and the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya. These are rare, almost always involve a broad international coalition, and typically follow extensive diplomatic efforts and a clear UN Security Council mandate. The base rate for a *unilateral* US action of this type is extremely low, likely **<1%** per year globally.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-01] US President Trump orders the DoD to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria. — ↑↑ — This moves the possibility from theoretical to operational. "Preparing for action" involves logistics, intelligence gathering, and target selection, making a strike much more feasible on short notice.
*   [2025-11-05] President Trump posts on Truth Social, explicitly threatening to go in “guns-a-blazing” if Nigeria doesn't stop the killing of Christians. — ↑↑↑ — This public, unconditional-sounding threat creates a strong commitment mechanism. The President now faces a political cost for inaction if a high-profile atrocity occurs, significantly raising the odds he will act to appear decisive.
*   [2025-10-20] (Hypothetical based on background) Reports of a large-scale attack by suspected ISWAP militants on a predominantly Christian village in Borno state, with over 100 casualties. — ↑ — This type of event serves as the predicate for the President's subsequent threats and establishes the casus belli in the administration's view.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Volition & Credibility:** The primary driver is the President's personal commitment, amplified by his public statements. Having made a direct threat, he is now politically incentivized to act on it, especially if provoked. This is a **large** driver.
2.  **A High-Profile Trigger Event:** A significant, well-publicized massacre of Christians or the capture of American citizens (e.g., missionaries) would dramatically increase pressure to act. This would provide a clear justification and could override institutional caution. This is a **large** potential driver.
3.  **Institutional Drag (DoD/State Dept.):** The Pentagon and State Department will likely view a unilateral strike in Nigeria as strategically reckless. It would alienate a key regional partner, destabilize the region, endanger US personnel and assets, and potentially unite disparate Nigerian factions against the US. This institutional resistance is a **large** downward driver.
4.  **Nigerian Government Response:** Nigeria's actions are a key variable. If the Nigerian government launches credible, high-profile operations against the groups in question and engages in high-level diplomacy with the US, it could provide the President an "off-ramp." Conversely, defiance or perceived inaction would increase the likelihood of a US strike. This is a **moderate** driver.
5.  **Scope of the "Attack":** The probability is highly sensitive to the definition of an attack. A limited drone strike against a known ISWAP leader is far more plausible than a large-scale ground or air campaign. The former can be executed with less risk and political fallout. This is a **moderate** driver.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Host Nation Stature:** Unlike typical targets of unilateral action (Somalia, Yemen, tribal areas of Pakistan), Nigeria is a major sovereign state, a top-10 oil supplier to the world, and the dominant power in West Africa. A unilateral strike would be a major diplomatic breach with far greater consequences.
*   **Presidential Rhetoric:** The public, specific, and escalatory nature of the President's threats is highly unusual. Most unilateral strikes are conducted with a degree of plausible deniability or are justified after the fact; they are rarely threatened so explicitly in advance.
*   **Explicit Religious Rationale:** While humanitarian concerns are often cited, the specific framing of "protecting Christians" is a powerful and unusual motivator tailored to a specific domestic political audience. This makes the commitment more rigid than a general foreign policy objective.
*   **Ambiguous Target Set:** The threat is not against a single, high-value individual (like bin Laden) but against diffuse groups ("Islamic Terrorists") across a vast area. This makes a decisive, clean military solution difficult, potentially increasing Pentagon reluctance due to the risk of mission creep and civilian casualties.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior anchored on the reference class of unilateral US strikes in major regional powers (<0.5%), suggesting a very low probability. An equivalent n of ~100 reflects a strong belief based on decades of post-Cold War history that such actions are exceptionally rare.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑↑↑ Large) The President's direct, public, and repeated threats create a powerful personal and political commitment to action.
    *   (↑↑ Moderate) The ongoing, high-profile nature of the violence provides a persistent justification and potential trigger.
    *   (↓↓ Large) Nigeria's status as a major, sovereign regional power creates immense strategic and diplomatic barriers to intervention.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Expected institutional resistance from the DoD and State Department, who prioritize stability and partnerships over punitive strikes.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is strongly conflicting. The President's statements are a powerful signal that dramatically pulls the probability up from the extremely low prior. However, the structural realities of Nigeria's importance act as a powerful gravitational force pulling it back down. The posterior should be significantly higher than the base rate, but still well short of even odds. The core of the forecast is the conflict between presidential will and systemic constraints.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Another large-scale, well-publicized attack on a Christian community in Nigeria.
    *   Deployment of US special operations forces, ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) assets, or naval assets to the region (e.g., Gulf of Guinea, neighboring countries).
    *   Hawkish statements from the National Security Advisor or Secretary of State echoing the President's threats.
    *   A breakdown in high-level diplomatic communication between the US and Nigeria.
    *   ISWAP or Boko Haram directly threatening or harming US citizens or interests in Nigeria.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Nigerian military announcing a major, successful offensive against extremist groups, with verifiable results.
    *   High-level US-Nigeria diplomatic meetings resulting in joint statements or new security cooperation agreements.
    *   Leaks from senior DoD or State Department officials to the media expressing grave concerns about potential military action.
    *   A new international crisis elsewhere that diverts the President's attention and US military resources.
    *   Prominent evangelical leaders in the US calling for restraint or diplomatic solutions over military ones.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Attack":** The resolution criteria is broad. A single drone strike on a vehicle in the Sambisa Forest is far more plausible than an air campaign over a city. The forecast probability should be an average over these possibilities.
*   **Covert Action:** A US strike could be conducted covertly, with no official acknowledgement. Resolution may depend on leaks or investigative journalism, which may not emerge before the deadline.
*   **Nigerian Complicity:** A strike could occur with the tacit, non-public approval of a faction within the Nigerian government. This would appear unilateral but would be functionally cooperative, complicating the assessment.
*   **De-escalation Off-Ramps:** The President's threats may be a coercive diplomatic tactic intended to force the Nigerian government to act, rather than a literal statement of intent. If Nigeria responds appropriately, the threat could be withdrawn.
*   **Fictional Premise:** This analysis is based on a hypothetical scenario and a characterization of a political figure. Real-world decision-making involves more complex inputs and unforeseen events than can be modeled.

**Final Research Summary:** The President's explicit and public threats have substantially increased the probability of a US military strike from a near-zero base rate. However, strong institutional and strategic counter-pressures related to Nigeria's regional importance mean that such an action would likely only be triggered by a dramatic focusing event, like a major new atrocity.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the likelihood of unilateral US military actions against major, non-hostile regional powers, which is exceptionally low, estimated at <0.5% per year. This is due to the significant diplomatic and strategic consequences of such actions, especially against a country like Nigeria, which is a major regional power and a key US partner in Africa.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves potential US military action against a non-hostile regional power, aligning with the base case.
   - Differences: The explicit and public nature of the President's threats, combined with the religious framing of the issue, is unusual and increases the probability compared to the base case. The President's rhetoric and the operational preparations by the DoD suggest a higher likelihood than typical.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Presidential Threats**: The President's public threats significantly increase the likelihood of action (↑↑↑). The political cost of inaction after such statements is high.
   - **Operational Preparations**: The DoD's preparation for possible action indicates a higher readiness level (↑↑).
   - **Institutional Resistance**: Strong resistance from the DoD and State Department decreases the likelihood (↓↓).
   - **Nigeria's Status**: Nigeria's importance as a regional power and partner decreases the likelihood (↓↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of <0.5%, the evidence from the President's threats and DoD preparations significantly increases the probability. However, the institutional resistance and Nigeria's status as a major power act as strong counterweights.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the conflicting evidence, the posterior probability is significantly higher than the base rate but remains well below 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast must account for the possibility of the President using threats as a diplomatic tool rather than a literal intent to act.
   - Alternative scenario: Nigeria could take actions that satisfy US demands, reducing the likelihood of an attack.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of covert or limited actions that might not be publicly acknowledged.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering all factors, including the President's rhetoric, operational preparations, institutional resistance, and Nigeria's strategic importance, the probability of a US military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is estimated at 15%.

Final: 15%

# Will the US conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider the base rate of the US conducting military attacks in sovereign nations similar to Nigeria.

The most relevant reference class is **unilateral US military actions against non-state actors in major regional powers without host nation consent**. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, largest economy, and a significant regional power - not a failed state.

Looking at historical precedents:
- The US rarely conducts military operations in stable, sovereign nations without consent
- When it does occur, it's typically against high-value terrorist targets in countries with limited ability to respond
- Nigeria has stronger sovereignty and international standing than typical targets like Yemen or Somalia

Based on this reference class, I estimate a prior probability of **2%** that the US would conduct a military attack in Nigeria before 2026 (about 1 month from now).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Presence of terrorist groups (Boko Haram, ISWAP) that the US opposes
- Ongoing violence against civilians, including religious-based targeting
- US stated interest in counterterrorism globally

**Key differences:**
- The explicit, public threat by President Trump is highly unusual - presidents rarely telegraph military action so directly
- The religious framing ("killing of Christians") creates a specific political commitment
- Nigeria is a much more significant regional power than typical targets of unilateral US action
- The timeframe is extremely short (less than a month until 2026)
- The threat specifically mentions stopping aid first, suggesting a potential escalation ladder

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit threat on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US is planning to attack, such a threat would be consistent
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Presidents sometimes make threats without following through
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump ordering DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Military preparation is a necessary precursor to action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Contingency planning happens more often than actual strikes
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Nigeria's status as a major regional power**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - The US rarely attacks countries of Nigeria's stature
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Most countries of Nigeria's importance don't face US attacks
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeframe (less than a month)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Military operations typically require longer preparation
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Most threatened actions don't materialize this quickly
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.33
- This significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 2% (odds of 1:49)

First update (Trump's explicit threat):
- Prior odds: 1:49
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3:49 = ~1:16.3
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+16.3) = ~5.8%

Second update (DoD preparation order):
- Prior odds: 1:16.3
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 2.4:16.3 = ~1:6.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+6.8) = ~12.8%

Third update (Nigeria's regional power status):
- Prior odds: 1:6.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25:6.8 = 1:27.2
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+27.2) = ~3.5%

Fourth update (Short timeframe):
- Prior odds: 1:27.2
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.33:27.2 = ~1:82.4
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+82.4) = ~1.2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the significance of Trump's explicit threats - he has sometimes followed through on unexpected actions
- I might be overweighting institutional resistance within the DoD/State Department
- A major triggering event (like a mass killing of Christians) could dramatically change the calculus
- Limited strikes (like a single drone operation) might be easier to execute than I'm assuming

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A limited, covert operation that becomes public only after the fact
- A joint operation with Nigerian consent that appears unilateral
- A rapid response to an unforeseen crisis (hostage situation, attack on US personnel)

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability slightly upward. The most significant factor is the possibility of a limited strike following a triggering event, which I may have underweighted.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that the US will conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 (in the next month) at 3%.

The extremely short timeframe, Nigeria's importance as a regional power, and the likely institutional resistance within the US government are the strongest factors limiting the probability, despite the President's explicit threats.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a unilateral US military attack within the territory of a major, non-hostile regional power. The most appropriate reference class is not just any US counter-terror strike (which often occur in failed states or ungoverned spaces like Somalia or Yemen), but specifically strikes in a country like Nigeria—Africa's most populous nation, its largest economy, and a key regional security partner for the US.

Such an event is exceptionally rare. Unsolicited military action against a major sovereign state with which the US is not at war has a historical frequency approaching zero. The research report suggests a base rate of **<0.5% per year** for this class of event. The question's timeframe is less than one month (Dec 5, 2025, to Jan 1, 2026). Prorating this annual rate gives a monthly base rate of less than 0.05%.

For this analysis, I will start with a prior probability of **0.1%**. This reflects the extreme rarity of such an action in a normal month.
- Prior Probability P(H): 0.1%
- Prior Odds: 1:999

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The potential targets (ISWAP, Boko Haram) are established non-state terrorist groups, fitting the profile of targets in past US unilateral actions.
- The US possesses the military capabilities (e.g., drone bases in the region, special operations forces) to execute such a strike with relative ease from a technical standpoint.

**Differences:**
- **Host Nation Status:** Unlike Somalia, Yemen, or Syria, Nigeria is a stable, sovereign state and a major regional power. A unilateral strike would severely damage diplomatic relations, undermine regional stability, and carry immense geopolitical risk. This is the single largest factor making the current situation different from the base case of typical drone strikes.
- **Presidential Rhetoric:** The explicit, public, and personal nature of President Trump's threats is highly unusual. Standard procedure for such operations involves ambiguity and secrecy. This public commitment creates a political "credibility trap," where the President may feel compelled to act to avoid looking weak, especially to his political base.
- **Stated Rationale:** The specific framing of "protecting Christians" is a powerful domestic political motivator, but an unusual and potentially inflammatory justification for international military action. It suggests the decision-making may be driven more by domestic politics than traditional foreign policy or national security calculations.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The prior of 0.1% assumes a "normal" situation. The evidence provided describes a crisis.

**Evidence 1: President Trump's public threats ("guns-a-blazing") and DoD order to "prepare for possible action."**
- **P(E | H):** If the US were to conduct an attack, it is extremely likely that it would be preceded by such threats and preparatory orders from this specific President. His style involves public posturing and direct commands. P(E | H) ≈ 0.9.
- **P(E | ~H):** If the US were *not* going to attack, it is still plausible that such threats would be made. They can serve as a tool of coercive diplomacy (to force Nigeria's hand), as a signal to a domestic audience, or as pure rhetoric. However, a formal DoD order to prepare is a more concrete step than just words. Let's estimate the probability of this level of public threat and preparation *without* a subsequent attack as moderately low, say P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.1.
- **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.9 / 0.1 = 9. This evidence strongly increases the probability of an attack.

**Evidence 2: The powerful structural constraints (Nigeria's status, institutional resistance from DoD/State Dept.).**
- This is not new evidence but a core feature of the environment. It is the reason the base rate is so low. The President's threats are an attempt to *override* these constraints. The key question is which force is stronger. The research report correctly identifies this as the central conflict: "presidential will and systemic constraints." These constraints act as a powerful downward pressure on the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's update the prior based on the President's actions.

- **Prior Odds:** 1:999 (P ≈ 0.1%)
- **Likelihood Ratio from Evidence 1:** 9
- **Posterior Odds:** 1:999 × 9 ≈ 9:999 ≈ 1:111
- **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 111) ≈ 1/112 ≈ 0.9%

This initial update shows that the threats move the needle significantly, but the probability is still very low because the prior was so small. However, this simple update doesn't capture the dynamic nature of the situation, which now depends heavily on a potential trigger.

A better model is conditional on a "trigger event" (e.g., a new, high-profile massacre of Christians) occurring in the short timeframe before 2026.

1.  **Probability of a Trigger Event (P(T))**: Given the ongoing violence described, the chance of a significant, media-worthy attack by extremists in the next ~27 days is plausible. I estimate **P(T) = 50%**.
2.  **Probability of Attack, given a Trigger (P(H|T))**: If a major trigger event occurs, the President's credibility trap snaps shut. He would be under immense pressure from his base to act on his specific threats. While institutional drag would still exist, a limited, symbolic strike (e.g., a few drone or cruise missile strikes) becomes much more likely as a way to demonstrate resolve. I estimate **P(H|T) = 40%**.
3.  **Probability of Attack, given No Trigger (P(H|~T))**: If the situation remains relatively calm, the threats can be framed as successful deterrence. The institutional argument for restraint would easily win, and the political urgency would fade. The chance of a "cold" strike is very low. I estimate **P(H|~T) = 2%**.

**Final Calculation:**
P(H) = [P(H|T) * P(T)] + [P(H|~T) * P(~T)]
P(H) = (0.40 * 0.50) + (0.02 * 0.50)
P(H) = 0.20 + 0.01 = 0.21

This calculation results in a posterior probability of 21%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 21% hinges on the 40% estimate for P(H|T). Could this be wrong?
- **Argument for a higher probability (>21%):** I may be underestimating the President's impulsiveness and his administration's willingness to disregard the foreign policy establishment. The definition of "attack" is broad; a single drone strike is a very low bar and an easy action to authorize to "do something."
- **Argument for a lower probability (<21%):** I may be overestimating the President's commitment. The threats could be pure bluster, a tactic he has used before (e.g., North Korea). The institutional barriers to attacking a major partner like Nigeria may be virtually insurmountable, even for this President, without a direct attack on US assets or citizens. A trigger involving only Nigerian citizens might not be enough to overcome this inertia.

The 21% figure feels like a reasonable balance. It acknowledges that the President's threats have made a rare event plausible, but the fundamental strategic realities still make it an unlikely outcome (i.e., more than a 3 in 4 chance of not happening). The forecast correctly identifies that the outcome is now highly contingent on a near-term triggering event.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a US military strike in Nigeria is near zero. However, the explicit and public threats by the US President have created a political commitment trap, significantly raising the probability. The outcome now likely depends on whether a new, high-profile atrocity occurs before the end of the year, which would provide a clear *casus belli* and immense political pressure to act. Balancing the President's rhetoric against the powerful institutional and strategic reasons to avoid a strike, the probability is substantially elevated but remains well below 50%.

Final: 21%
