### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern US Animal Health Import Suspensions (Pest/Disease):** This is the most relevant class. Examples include bans related to Avian Influenza (AI) or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). These bans vary widely. Regional AI bans can be implemented and lifted in 3-6 months. Comprehensive, national bans for more severe diseases like BSE can last for years (e.g., the US ban on UK beef lasted from 1996 to 2020, though this is an extreme outlier). A more comparable case might be the 2016 New World Screwworm outbreak in the Florida Keys, which was declared eradicated within 6 months. **Base rate for reopening within 9 months: ~60-70%.** This is based on the typical lifecycle of eradication efforts for a containable pest.
2.  **US-Mexico Agricultural Trade Disputes:** This class captures the political and bureaucratic dynamics of cross-border trade. These disputes, even when technical, can be prolonged by political factors, often lasting 6-24 months before resolution. **Base rate for resolution within 9 months: ~40-50%.**
3.  **Rapid Reversals of Trade Policy:** This class considers instances where a policy is implemented, quickly reversed, and then reconsidered. The failed reopening in July 2025 is a key feature. In such cases, regulators become highly risk-averse, leading to significant delays before a second attempt is made. The bar for proof is raised substantially. **Base rate for a second attempt succeeding within 6 months of a failure: ~20-30%.**

Limitations: The current situation is a hybrid of these classes. It's a technical animal health issue (#1) embedded in a complex political relationship (#2) and marked by a failed first attempt (#3), making a simple base rate challenging.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-04] USDA Secretary states she is "pleased with Mexico's efforts" and that "every day... we get a little bit closer." — ↑ — Positive but non-committal language signals progress and continued high-level engagement, but avoids a concrete timeline.
*   [2025-10-21] USDA releases its NWS Response Playbook. Confirms no new cases detected in Mexican border states "recently." — ↑ — The lack of new cases is the single most important factor for reopening. The playbook's release shows the USDA is formalizing its long-term strategy.
*   [2025-10-21] USDA announces a new sterile fly dispersal facility will open in Texas in *early 2026*. — ↓ — This suggests the key infrastructure for a robust, long-term solution will not be fully operational until after the resolution date, potentially delaying a full reopening until it is online.
*   [2025-07-09] U.S. re-imposes the suspension shortly after a brief reopening. — ↓ — This failed attempt significantly increases the institutional cautiousness at USDA/APHIS. The burden of proof for Mexico is now much higher, making a quick decision less likely.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **NWS Case Detection Rate:** The primary driver. Zero new confirmed cases in Mexican border states for a sustained period (e.g., several screwworm life cycles, ~2-3 months) is likely a prerequisite for reopening talks. (Large)
2.  **APHIS Verification & Confidence:** The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must be convinced that Mexico's surveillance and eradication measures (e.g., sterile insect technique) are robust and effective. This involves data sharing, site visits, and bureaucratic processes. (Large)
3.  **Economic Pressure:** The U.S. cattle feeding industry, particularly in the Southwest, relies heavily on feeder cattle from Mexico (typically >1 million head/year). The ban disrupts supply chains and raises costs, creating significant industry pressure on the USDA to find a solution. (Moderate)
4.  **Political & Diplomatic Engagement:** High-level communication between the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and Mexico's SADER is crucial. Positive diplomatic momentum can accelerate the technical review process. (Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Season Bureaucratic Slowdown:** The resolution window (Dec 5 - Dec 31) is dominated by the Christmas and New Year holidays. This period typically sees a significant slowdown in government agency decision-making, creating a major headwind for any new policy implementation. (Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Pre-existing Eradication Infrastructure:** Unlike a novel disease outbreak, the U.S. and Mexico have a decades-long, jointly-operated commission (COMEXA) for screwworm eradication. This provides established channels for communication and action, which should accelerate the response compared to the base rate.
*   **Failed Reopening Attempt:** The July 2025 reopening and rapid re-closure is a significant deviation. This event creates immense institutional pressure on APHIS to be overly cautious, likely extending the timeline beyond a typical pest response.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The resolution date is less than a month away and falls during a major holiday period. This is a severe constraint not typical of the reference class, where reopenings happen when criteria are met, not against a specific calendar deadline.
*   **High Economic Interdependence:** The scale of the U.S.-Mexico live cattle trade is massive and highly integrated. The economic pain is acute on both sides, creating stronger-than-usual pressure for a resolution compared to smaller-scale trade bans.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the reference class of animal health import suspensions, which often last 6-9 months. Given the ban started in May (~7 months ago), a naive prior might be near 50%. However, accounting for the failed reopening and the extreme caution it induces, a more conservative prior of **~30% (equivalent n=10)** seems more appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Sustained period of no new cases in border states. (Large)
    *   (↑) Strong, ongoing economic pressure from the U.S. cattle industry. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) The July 2025 failed reopening has made APHIS exceptionally risk-averse. (Large)
    *   (↓) The resolution window falls squarely within the holiday season, a major bureaucratic obstacle. (Large)
    *   (↓) The announcement of a new sterile fly facility opening in *early 2026* signals that the permanent fix is not yet in place, reducing the urgency to act before then. (Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The negative evidence, particularly the institutional caution from the prior failure and the logistical barrier of the holiday season, appears to strongly outweigh the positive evidence of no new cases. The posterior should move **down significantly** from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An official announcement of a high-level APHIS technical delegation visiting Mexican border state facilities.
    *   A joint press release from the U.S. and Mexican Secretaries of Agriculture outlining a specific, dated "path to reopening."
    *   Industry news quoting sources that a "phased" or "regional" reopening plan is being finalized for specific ports of entry.
    *   USDA/APHIS publishing a formal risk assessment concluding that import risks can be safely managed.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official or unofficial report of a new NWS case in a Mexican state bordering the U.S. (e.g., Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila).
    *   Statements from USDA officials emphasizing "continued caution," "the need for more data," or a "long-term" approach.
    *   Silence from both governments through mid-December.
    *   Reports of Mexico diverting cattle exports to other markets, suggesting they don't expect a near-term reopening.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The term "permitted to resume" could be tricky. A limited, regional reopening for specific classes of cattle (e.g., spayed heifers from a certified NWS-free zone) might technically meet the criteria, even if it's not a full restoration of trade.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Information on eradication efforts within Mexico may be delayed or presented optimistically. The key data is held by APHIS and its Mexican counterpart, SENASICA, and may not be public.
*   **Political Wildcards:** The decision is ultimately a regulatory one, but it could be influenced by unrelated political events or high-level political intervention, which is unpredictable.
*   **The "Close But No Cigar" Risk:** The process could be 99% complete by Dec 31, but the final signature or Federal Register notice might not happen until the first week of January, which would resolve the question as "No." The holiday timing makes this a significant risk.

**Final Research Summary:** While Mexico appears to be making progress in controlling the screwworm outbreak, the combination of extreme institutional caution at the USDA following a failed reopening attempt and the severe bureaucratic slowdown expected over the holidays makes a formal reopening before January 1, 2026, highly unlikely.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is "Modern US Animal Health Import Suspensions (Pest/Disease)." Historically, bans related to containable pests like the New World screwworm have been resolved within 6-9 months. Given the current situation, a base rate for reopening within 9 months is approximately 60-70%. However, considering the failed reopening attempt in July 2025, a more conservative prior of 30% is appropriate. This accounts for increased institutional caution and the complexity of the situation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The situation involves a containable pest, similar to past cases where bans were lifted within months.
- There is a pre-existing eradication infrastructure (COMEXA) that facilitates communication and action.

**Differences:**
- The failed reopening attempt in July 2025 has increased institutional caution, likely extending the timeline.
- The resolution window falls during the holiday season, which typically slows down bureaucratic processes.
- The announcement of a new sterile fly facility opening in early 2026 suggests a long-term solution is not yet in place.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **No new cases detected recently:** This is a positive sign, increasing the likelihood of reopening (Likelihood ratio > 1).
- **Economic pressure from the U.S. cattle industry:** This creates urgency for resolution, slightly increasing the likelihood (Likelihood ratio > 1).
- **Failed reopening attempt:** This significantly increases caution, decreasing the likelihood of reopening soon (Likelihood ratio < 1).
- **Holiday season slowdown:** This is a major obstacle, decreasing the likelihood (Likelihood ratio < 1).
- **New sterile fly facility opening in 2026:** Indicates a delay in a robust solution, decreasing the likelihood (Likelihood ratio < 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 30%, we adjust based on the evidence:
- Positive evidence (no new cases, economic pressure) suggests a slight increase.
- Negative evidence (failed reopening, holiday slowdown, new facility timeline) suggests a significant decrease.

Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability should decrease from the prior. A reasonable adjustment would be to lower the probability to around 15%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for rapid political or economic shifts that could expedite reopening.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A phased or regional reopening could occur, technically meeting the resolution criteria.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of new cases and economic pressure could lead to a quicker resolution than expected.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final calibrated probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is:

Final: 15%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to determine the probability that the US will reopen cattle imports from Mexico in the next 26 days (from Dec 5 to Dec 31, 2025).

The most appropriate reference class is recent animal health import suspensions, particularly those involving the US-Mexico border. Based on the research report, I'll consider:

- Modern US animal health import suspensions: ~60-70% chance of reopening within 9 months
- US-Mexico agricultural trade disputes: ~40-50% resolution within 9 months
- Rapid reversals after failed reopening attempts: ~20-30% chance of success within 6 months of failure

Given that:
- The ban has been in place for about 7 months (since May 11, 2025)
- There was a failed reopening attempt in July 2025
- We're looking at a very short timeframe (26 days)
- The period includes major holidays that slow bureaucratic processes

I'll select a prior of **25%** - leaning toward the lower end of the reference classes due to the failed reopening and the extremely short timeframe remaining.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a standard animal health import suspension based on pest concerns
- The economic importance creates pressure to resolve quickly
- The US and Mexico have established channels for cooperation on agricultural issues

**Key differences:**
- The failed July reopening attempt is unusual and likely makes regulators more cautious
- The extremely short timeframe (26 days) is much more constrained than typical cases
- The resolution window falls during the holiday season (Christmas/New Year), when government decision-making typically slows significantly
- There's an established joint commission (COMEXA) for screwworm eradication, which could accelerate the process

These differences, particularly the failed reopening and holiday timing, suggest the probability should be lower than the typical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: No new cases reported recently in Mexican border states**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If reopening occurs, we would almost certainly see no new cases
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even without reopening, we might see no new cases as eradication efforts continue
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.58 (slightly positive)
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of reopening

**Evidence 2: USDA Secretary's statement that "every day we get a little bit closer"**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - If reopening is imminent, we'd expect positive but non-committal language
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.7) - Even if reopening isn't imminent, diplomatic language would be positive
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.29 (slightly positive)
- This provides a small increase in probability

**Evidence 3: Failed reopening in July 2025**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If reopening is imminent, a recent failed attempt would be unusual
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If reopening isn't imminent, a failed attempt explains the caution
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (strongly negative)
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: New sterile fly facility opening in early 2026**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If reopening occurs before 2026, this timing seems oddly delayed
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If reopening waits until 2026, this aligns with infrastructure timing
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38 (negative)
- This decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Holiday season bureaucratic slowdown**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Major policy changes during holidays are rare
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Delays during holidays are expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.22 (strongly negative)
- This significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 25% (odds of 1:3), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on failed reopening in July:**
- Prior odds: 0.25/0.75 = 1/3
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: (1/3) × 0.25 = 1/12
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+12) = 0.077 or ~8%

**Update on holiday season timing:**
- Prior odds: 0.077/0.923 = 1/12
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: (1/12) × 0.22 = 1/54.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+54.5) = 0.018 or ~2%

**Update on no new cases reported:**
- Prior odds: 0.018/0.982 = 1/54.5
- Likelihood ratio: 1.58
- Posterior odds: (1/54.5) × 1.58 = 1/34.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+34.5) = 0.028 or ~3%

**Update on USDA Secretary's positive statement:**
- Prior odds: 0.028/0.972 = 1/34.5
- Likelihood ratio: 1.29
- Posterior odds: (1/34.5) × 1.29 = 1/26.7
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+26.7) = 0.036 or ~4%

**Update on new facility timing in 2026:**
- Prior odds: 0.036/0.964 = 1/26.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.38
- Posterior odds: (1/26.7) × 0.38 = 1/70.3
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+70.3) = 0.014 or ~1.4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

I should consider whether I've been too pessimistic:

- **Potential underestimation:** The economic pressure from the cattle industry could be stronger than I've accounted for. The ban has been in place for 7 months, creating significant economic hardship.
- **Diplomatic considerations:** The US-Mexico relationship is important, and there could be high-level political pressure to resolve this issue quickly.
- **Partial reopening possibility:** The question resolves as "Yes" even if only a limited reopening occurs. A regional or conditional reopening for specific categories of cattle might be easier to implement quickly.

However, I also need to consider:

- **Risk aversion after failure:** The July reopening attempt that was quickly reversed likely created extreme caution among regulators.
- **Holiday timing:** The period between December 5-31 includes major holidays when government agencies operate at reduced capacity.
- **Bureaucratic processes:** Even with agreement in principle, implementing a reopening requires multiple administrative steps that take time.

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low. While the evidence strongly suggests reopening before 2026 is unlikely, the possibility of a limited or regional reopening gives some chance of a "Yes" resolution.

## 6. Final Forecast

Adjusting my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of a limited reopening and strong economic/political pressure, I arrive at a final probability of 5%.

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is "Rapid Reversals of Trade Policy," which describes situations where a policy is implemented, fails, and is then reconsidered. The failed reopening in July 2025 places this situation squarely in that category. Such events typically induce extreme caution in regulators, making them hesitant to try again quickly. The research report suggests a base rate of 20-30% for a successful second attempt within six months of a failure. The current timeline (reopening before Jan 1, 2026, after a July 9, 2025 failure) is just under six months. Therefore, I will select a prior probability at the midpoint of this range.

**Prior Probability P(H): 25%** (Odds: 1 to 3)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The core dynamic matches the reference class: a failed attempt has made regulators highly risk-averse, and the burden of proof for a second attempt is now much higher.

**Differences:**
*   **Pro-Reopening Factor:** There is immense economic pressure from the U.S. cattle industry, which is highly dependent on Mexican imports. This creates a stronger-than-usual incentive for a rapid resolution.
*   **Anti-Reopening Factor:** The resolution window is extremely short (Dec 5 - Dec 31) and falls entirely within the U.S. holiday season. This is a period of significant bureaucratic slowdown, making the implementation of a major, non-emergency policy change exceptionally difficult. This is a powerful negative factor not necessarily present in the general base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that imports resume before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: No new NWS cases detected "recently" in Mexican border states.**
    *   P(E | H): Very high. This is a necessary precondition for reopening.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. A lack of cases could persist, yet regulators could still decide to wait longer for more data or for other conditions to be met.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: > 1 (Strongly increases probability).** This is the most significant piece of positive evidence.

*   **Evidence 2: A new sterile fly dispersal facility will open in Texas in *early 2026*.**
    *   P(E | H): Moderate. Regulators could see this new facility as a long-term enhancement and decide to reopen now based on Mexico's current efforts.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. This provides a clear, defensible rationale for delaying a decision. Regulators can argue it is more prudent to wait until this key infrastructure is operational.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: < 1 (Moderately decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence 3: The resolution window is Dec 5 - Dec 31.**
    *   P(E | H): Very low. It is rare for a major regulatory decision to be finalized and implemented during the holiday period when key personnel are on leave and processes slow to a crawl.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. The holiday season provides a natural and low-friction reason for inaction and deferring the decision to the new year.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I begin with the prior odds of 1:3 (25% probability).

1.  **Update for "no new cases":** This is strong positive news. I'll estimate this doubles the odds of reopening.
    *   New Odds: (1 * 2) : 3 = 2:3 (Probability ≈ 40%)

2.  **Update for "new facility in early 2026":** This provides a reason to wait and tempers the positive news. I'll estimate this reduces the odds by about a third (LR ≈ 0.67).
    *   New Odds: (2 * 0.67) : 3 ≈ 1.34:3 (Probability ≈ 31%)

3.  **Update for "holiday season timing":** This is a major logistical barrier. The chance of getting the final approvals and public notices through the bureaucracy in the last weeks of December is very low. I'll estimate this cuts the remaining odds by at least half (LR ≤ 0.5). Let's use a factor of 0.4.
    *   New Odds: (1.34 * 0.4) : 3 ≈ 0.54:3, which simplifies to approximately 1:5.6.

**Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 5.6) ≈ 1 / 6.6 ≈ 15%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary risk to this low forecast is an overriding political intervention. The economic pain for the U.S. cattle industry is severe, and a powerful political figure (e.g., a senator from a border state) could force the USDA to expedite the process as a "Christmas gift" to the industry. The resolution could also be a very limited, regional reopening, which might be easier to push through.

However, the institutional risk for the USDA is also immense. A second failed reopening would be a major embarrassment and could have serious consequences for animal health. This powerful incentive for caution, combined with the very real logistical barrier of the holiday season, makes a politically-forced reopening a low-probability event. The "Close But No Cigar" risk is also high: the decision might be made in principle in late December, but the official implementation via Federal Register notice could slip to the first week of January, which would resolve this question as "No." The 15% forecast seems to adequately capture the small but non-zero chance of a politically-driven exception.

### Final Forecast
The forecast starts from a cautious prior of 25% due to the previous failed reopening. While the lack of new screwworm cases is a significant positive development, its impact is heavily counteracted by the rationale to wait for a new facility in early 2026 and, most critically, by the severe bureaucratic slowdown expected during the holiday season. The final probability reflects a small chance that intense political pressure could overcome these substantial hurdles.

Final: 15%
