### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Iran-IAEA Standoffs Leading to New Agreements (2003-Present):** This class includes periods of high tension where Iran restricted IAEA access, followed by negotiations that eventually restored it (e.g., 2003 Paris Agreement, 2015 JCPOA, various interim technical understandings). Agreements are almost always the result of protracted negotiations lasting many months, if not years. A deal reached in under three months from the peak of a crisis is rare.
    *   **Base Rate:** 10-20%. The base rate for a *quick* resolution (<3 months) is low. The September 2025 deal was an anomaly that was quickly reversed, reinforcing the norm of slow progress.
2.  **Post-Military Strike Nuclear Inspections:** This class includes instances where a country's nuclear facilities were attacked by a foreign power (e.g., Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981, Syria's Al-Kibar facility in 2007). In these cases, the targeted nation typically obfuscated, denied, and resisted international inspections to save face, hide the extent of the damage, and avoid appearing to capitulate to military pressure.
    *   **Base Rate:** <5%. Immediate cooperation following a direct, damaging military attack is historically unprecedented.
3.  **Limitations:** The current scenario is a hybrid, combining a long-running standoff (Class 1) with a direct military attack (Class 2). The existence of a large, known stockpile of 60% enriched uranium and a (now defunct) international agreement (JCPOA) makes this situation unique and potentially more volatile than historical precedents.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-10** IAEA and Iran announce a deal to resume inspections. **(↑)** — Matters because it demonstrates that a path to "Yes" was seen as viable by both sides just three months ago, even after the devastating military strikes.
*   **2025-10-14** CBS News details the successful US B-2 bomber raids. **(↓)** — Reinforces the scale and humiliation of the attack, likely hardening Iranian resolve against any action that could be perceived as capitulation.
*   **2025-10-18** The final opportunity to use the JCPOA 'snapback' mechanism to reimpose UN sanctions passes, and it is presumably triggered. **(↓)** — This event appears to be the direct cause of the subsequent deal cancellation, removing a key incentive for Iranian cooperation.
*   **2025-10-20** Reuters reports Iran has scrapped the September inspection deal. **(↓↓)** — A major reversal. This is the single most important recent event, indicating Iran's strategic calculation has shifted decisively against cooperation under current conditions.
*   **2025-11-28** A new IAEA Board of Governors resolution criticizes Iran's lack of cooperation; Iran responds defiantly, announcing expanded enrichment. **(↓)** — Represents a classic escalation cycle. Instead of bowing to pressure, Iran is doubling down, making a near-term reversal for inspections less likely.
*   **2025-12-02** An Iranian spokesperson states that relations with the IAEA will be dictated by parliamentary law (which suspended cooperation). **(↓↓)** — This formalizes the hardline position, creating a significant domestic political and legal barrier to any swift diplomatic reversal by the government before year-end.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Domestic Political Entrenchment (Large ↓):** The Iranian parliament's law suspending cooperation, now cited as official policy, creates high political costs for any official to reverse course. This empowers hardliners who view cooperation as capitulation after the US/Israeli attacks.
2.  **Leverage from Ambiguity (Large ↓):** The 400kg of 60% enriched uranium is Iran's most powerful bargaining chip. The ambiguity about its current state (i.e., how much survived the bombing and is accessible) is a source of leverage. Allowing inspections would clarify this and weaken Iran's negotiating position.
3.  **Nationalist "Resistance" Narrative (Large ↓):** After a direct military attack on its sovereign territory, the Iranian regime's legitimacy is tied to projecting strength and resistance. Granting access to inspectors could be framed internally and externally as a surrender to the perpetrators of the attack.
4.  **Incentive Structure (Sanctions) (Moderate ↓):** The reimposition of "snapback" sanctions appears to have been the catalyst for scrapping the September deal. With the most severe sanctions already in place, Iran has lost a primary incentive to cooperate with the IAEA. A deal now would require a new, significant offer of relief, which seems unlikely in the short timeframe.
5.  **Desire for De-escalation (Small ↑):** Iran may wish to avoid a further round of military conflict. Announcing a deal could be a low-cost way to signal a desire to de-escalate and shift the diplomatic onus back onto the West. However, recent actions suggest this is not their priority.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct Military Attack on Homeland:** Unlike most previous IAEA standoffs, this one follows a massive, overt military strike on Iran's key nuclear sites by its primary adversaries. This fundamentally changes the dynamic from a diplomatic dispute to a post-war confrontation, making concessions far more politically costly for Tehran.
*   **Collapsed Diplomatic Framework:** Previous agreements were built towards or upon an existing framework (e.g., the JCPOA). Now, the JCPOA is effectively dead, and UN sanctions have been snapped back. There is no clear diplomatic end-state for Iran to negotiate towards, reducing the appeal of interim steps like inspections.
*   **Extreme Time Compression:** The resolution window is less than one month. Historical precedents show that building the trust and technical modalities for such a sensitive inspection agreement takes many months of careful, often secret, diplomacy. A deal by Jan 1, 2026, would require an unprecedented diplomatic sprint.
*   **Explicit Parliamentary Veto:** The Iranian parliament has taken an unusually direct and powerful role, passing a law that now dictates the government's official stance. This creates an institutional rigidity not always present in past negotiations, which were often handled more exclusively by the executive branch and the Supreme National Security Council.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., ~15%, equivalent n=15) based on the reference class of slow-moving Iran-IAEA negotiations, adjusted down for the rarity of cooperation after a direct military strike.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The direct military strikes and subsequent nationalist backlash create a powerful disincentive to be seen as cooperating with a UN body perceived as enabling the attacks.
    *   **↑ (Moderate, but negated):** The September deal briefly showed a path to "Yes" was possible, preventing the probability from being near-zero.
    *   **↓↓ (Large):** The scrapping of that deal immediately following the "snapback" of sanctions demonstrates that the primary incentive for cooperation has been removed and Iran's response is defiance.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The formal hardening of Iran's position via parliamentary law creates a significant institutional barrier to a quick reversal.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence since September points overwhelmingly downwards. The brief signal of possible cooperation has been decisively negated by a powerful combination of sanctions, domestic politics, and nationalist reaction. The posterior should move significantly lower than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting YES is more likely):**
    *   Reports of secret, high-level back-channel talks between Iran and the US/E3, likely mediated by Oman or Qatar.
    *   A significant, public offer of sanctions relief or other economic incentives from the P5+1.
    *   A softening of rhetoric from senior Iranian officials (e.g., the Foreign Minister or Supreme National Security Council secretary) about the possibility of a "technical" or "political" solution.
    *   An unscheduled visit by IAEA Director General Grossi to Tehran.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting NO is more likely):**
    *   Continued hardline statements from Iranian government and parliamentary officials citing the law suspending cooperation.
    *   Further announcements of expanded nuclear activities (e.g., installing new centrifuges at alternative sites).
    *   Public accusations from Iran blaming the IAEA for complicity in the June 2025 attacks.
    *   Absence of any high-level diplomatic contact between Iran and Western powers.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Opacity:** The true state of the bombed facilities, the location and condition of the uranium stockpile, and the internal debates within the Iranian regime are highly opaque. Intelligence assessments could be flawed.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution requires Iran to "announce an agreement." Iran could make a vague, conditional announcement of an "agreement in principle" to achieve a short-term diplomatic win without committing to a firm timeline, potentially complicating resolution.
*   **"Black Swan" Events:** The situation is highly volatile. A new military incident, a major domestic political event in Iran (e.g., health crisis of the Supreme Leader), or a sudden policy shift from the US could dramatically alter Iran's calculations overnight.
*   **Deception:** Iran might announce a deal it has no intention of implementing simply to forestall further diplomatic or military pressure, a tactic used in the past. The announcement itself is the resolution criterion, not the implementation.

**Final Research Summary:**
The probability of Iran agreeing to IAEA inspections before 2026 is very low. The brief window of opportunity for a deal in September was decisively closed by the reimposition of UN sanctions and the subsequent entrenchment of a hardline, nationalist position by Iran's parliament, making a rapid diplomatic reversal highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Given the historical context of Iran-IAEA negotiations and the aftermath of military strikes, the base rate for a quick resolution is low. The reference class of Iran-IAEA standoffs leading to new agreements suggests a base rate of 10-20% for a quick resolution. However, considering the post-military strike context, the base rate is adjusted to less than 5%. For this analysis, we will start with a prior probability of 10%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a standoff with the IAEA, similar to past instances where negotiations eventually led to agreements.
   - **Differences:** The direct military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities and the subsequent nationalist backlash create a unique scenario. The collapse of the September 2025 deal and the reimposition of UN sanctions further complicate the situation, making a quick resolution less likely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **September 2025 Deal (↑):** The announcement of a deal in September 2025 suggests that a path to cooperation was possible, albeit briefly. This evidence slightly increases the probability.
   - **Military Strikes and Nationalist Backlash (↓↓):** The scale of the military strikes and the nationalist response significantly decrease the probability, as Iran is unlikely to be seen as capitulating.
   - **Scrapping of the Deal (↓↓):** The cancellation of the September deal following the snapback of sanctions is a strong indicator against cooperation, further decreasing the probability.
   - **Parliamentary Law (↓↓):** The formalization of Iran's hardline position through parliamentary law creates a significant barrier to reversing the decision, decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** The combined evidence overwhelmingly suggests a decrease in probability. The likelihood ratio is heavily weighted towards non-cooperation.
   - **Posterior Odds:** Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior odds are significantly lower than the prior odds.
   - **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is adjusted downwards to reflect the overwhelming evidence against a quick resolution.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast considers the possibility of a sudden diplomatic shift or a strategic announcement by Iran, but these are deemed unlikely given the current evidence.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A "black swan" event or a significant diplomatic breakthrough could alter the outcome, but these are not supported by current indicators.
   - **Adjustment:** The probability is adjusted to account for potential unforeseen developments, but remains low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final probability of Iran allowing IAEA inspections before 2026 is estimated to be very low.

Final: 5%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for Iran allowing IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile in the wake of military strikes on its nuclear facilities.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Iran's historical pattern of IAEA cooperation after periods of tension
- Countries' willingness to allow nuclear inspections after military strikes on their facilities
- Iran's specific response patterns to international pressure regarding its nuclear program

Based on these reference classes, I'll establish a prior of **10%**. This low probability reflects:
- Iran has historically required lengthy negotiations (often years) before agreeing to enhanced inspections
- Countries almost never allow immediate inspections following military strikes on nuclear facilities
- The parliamentary law explicitly suspending IAEA cooperation creates a formal barrier
- The extremely compressed timeframe (less than one month from now until 2026)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran has a pattern of using nuclear inspections as a bargaining chip in broader negotiations
- The IAEA continues to seek access to Iranian nuclear facilities
- International pressure and sanctions remain key leverage points

**Key differences:**
- The direct military strikes by the US and Israel create an unprecedented level of humiliation and domestic pressure against cooperation
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than one month remains until 2026)
- Iran's parliament has formally codified non-cooperation into law
- The September 2025 deal that was quickly scrapped shows unusual volatility in Iran's position
- The 400kg stockpile of 60% enriched uranium represents a uniquely valuable strategic asset and bargaining chip

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of cooperation compared to historical patterns, as they create both practical and political barriers to a quick agreement.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran's parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, there's maybe a 30% chance they would have first passed this law (as posturing before a reversal)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, there's a 95% chance they would pass this law
- Likelihood ratio: 0.32 (strong evidence against inspections)

**Evidence 2: The September 2025 deal was quickly scrapped**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, there's perhaps a 20% chance they would have scrapped a previous deal so recently
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, there's an 80% chance they would scrap a previous deal
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25 (strong evidence against inspections)

**Evidence 3: Iran's spokesperson stated relations with IAEA will be dictated by parliamentary law**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, there's maybe a 15% chance they would make this statement (as it creates a high barrier to reversal)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, there's a 90% chance they would make this statement
- Likelihood ratio: 0.17 (very strong evidence against inspections)

**Evidence 4: The timeframe is extremely short (less than one month)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, we'd expect a longer negotiation period 90% of the time
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, the short timeframe is irrelevant (100%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9 (slight evidence against inspections)

**Evidence 5: Iran announced expanded enrichment after IAEA criticism**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, there's perhaps a 25% chance they would announce expanded enrichment
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, there's an 85% chance they would announce expanded enrichment
- Likelihood ratio: 0.29 (strong evidence against inspections)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 10% (odds of 1:9), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 3 (parliamentary law dictating IAEA relations):**
- Prior odds: 1:9 (0.1/0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.17
- Posterior odds: 1:9 × 0.17 = 0.17:9 ≈ 1:53
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+53) ≈ 1.9%

This single update dramatically reduces the probability, reflecting how the formal parliamentary barrier significantly decreases the chances of a quick reversal.

**Update on Evidence 2 (scrapping of September deal):**
- Prior odds: 1:53
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 1:53 × 0.25 = 0.25:53 ≈ 1:212
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+212) ≈ 0.5%

The combined evidence suggests an extremely low probability of Iran allowing inspections before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Secret negotiations:** There could be back-channel talks occurring that aren't public. However, the compressed timeframe makes this less likely to yield results before 2026.

2. **Domestic political shifts:** A sudden change in Iran's internal politics could alter their stance, but such rapid shifts are rare in Iran's governance system.

3. **Economic desperation:** Iran might be more economically desperate than publicly known, potentially increasing willingness to negotiate. However, the nationalist backlash to the military strikes likely outweighs this.

4. **Definition ambiguity:** Iran could announce a "framework" or "principles" for future inspections without actually allowing them before 2026. However, the resolution criteria specify an "agreement to allow" inspections, which seems to require a concrete commitment.

5. **Overestimating the impact of military strikes:** I might be overestimating how much the strikes have hardened Iran's position. However, historical precedent strongly suggests military action against nuclear facilities leads to entrenchment, not cooperation.

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low. While the evidence strongly points against inspections, the possibility of secret negotiations or economic pressure could marginally increase the chances.

## 6. Final Forecast

Adjusting slightly upward from my Bayesian calculation to account for unknown factors and the inherent uncertainty in international relations, I arrive at a final probability of 2%.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a rapid diplomatic breakthrough between Iran and the IAEA on a highly sensitive issue within a very short timeframe (less than one month). I will consider two reference classes to establish a prior probability.

*   **Reference Class 1: Iran-IAEA Negotiations.** Historically, comprehensive agreements or even significant technical understandings between Iran and the IAEA are the result of protracted negotiations lasting many months or years (e.g., the 2015 JCPOA). A resolution to a major standoff in under one month is exceptionally rare. The base rate for a breakthrough in any given month of a standoff is very low, perhaps 5%.
*   **Reference Class 2: Post-Military Strike Nuclear Inspections.** Countries whose nuclear facilities have been subject to a major military attack (e.g., Iraq in 1981, Syria in 2007) have historically resisted and obstructed subsequent international inspections. This is done to save face, hide the extent of the damage, and avoid the appearance of capitulating to military force. The base rate for cooperation in this context is near zero.

Combining these, the current situation is a negotiation standoff occurring in the immediate aftermath of a devastating military attack. This context makes cooperation far less likely than in a standard diplomatic standoff. Therefore, I will select a low prior probability, significantly below the 5% from the first reference class.

**Initial Prior: 3%**. This reflects the intrinsic difficulty of reaching a deal quickly, compounded by the powerful disincentive to cooperate after being attacked. In odds, this is approximately 1-to-32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical base case of Iran-IAEA standoffs in several critical ways, all of which make an agreement less likely:

*   **Direct Military Attack:** Unlike previous diplomatic disputes, this standoff follows a direct and humiliating military strike on Iran's key nuclear sites. This elevates the political cost of any perceived concession, tying the regime's legitimacy to a narrative of "resistance," not cooperation.
*   **Collapsed Diplomatic Framework:** The JCPOA, the framework for past cooperation, is defunct, and UN "snapback" sanctions have been reimposed. This removes the primary incentive (sanctions relief) that Iran previously had for cooperating with the IAEA.
*   **Domestic Political Entrenchment:** The Iranian parliament has passed a law suspending cooperation, which the government is now formally citing. This creates a significant domestic legal and political barrier to a swift reversal of policy, empowering hardliners who oppose any deal.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key recent developments as evidence for or against the hypothesis (H) that "Iran will announce an agreement before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: A deal was announced in September 2025, but scrapped in October 2025.**
    *   The initial announcement showed that a deal was technically and politically conceivable just a few months ago (P(E|H) is moderate). However, the swift cancellation immediately following the reimposition of UN sanctions is extremely strong evidence.
    *   P(Scrapping deal after sanctions | H): Very low. If Iran intended to make a deal in December, scrapping a similar deal in October for the very reason of sanctions would be illogical.
    *   P(Scrapping deal after sanctions | ~H): Very high. If Iran has no intention of cooperating under sanctions, this is precisely the expected behavior.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<< 1). This evidence powerfully decreases the probability. It establishes a clear causal link: no sanctions relief, no deal.

*   **Evidence 2: Iran's defiant response to the November IAEA resolution and citation of parliamentary law.**
    *   P(Defiance and citing law | H): Very low. A party about to announce a diplomatic breakthrough does not typically engage in escalatory rhetoric and create new legal justifications for non-cooperation just days or weeks beforehand.
    *   P(Defiance and citing law | ~H): Very high. This is the classic playbook for a state that has decided on a path of confrontation and wants to signal its resolve.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<< 1). This evidence also powerfully decreases the probability, reinforcing the conclusion from the first piece of evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the update conceptually.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1-to-32 (3% probability).
*   **Evidence:** The scrapping of the September deal after sanctions were reimposed is a "smoking gun." It reveals that Iran's willingness to cooperate was contingent on avoiding those sanctions. Now that the sanctions are in place, the primary incentive is gone. This evidence is highly likely if Iran will *not* make a deal (~H) and very unlikely if it *will* (H). The likelihood ratio is very small, perhaps 1/10 or less.
*   **Update Step:**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1/32) × (1/10) = 1/320
*   **Posterior Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) = (1/320) / (1 + 1/320) ≈ 1/321 ≈ 0.3%.

The subsequent evidence of Iran's defiant rhetoric and citation of domestic law further reinforces this, pushing the probability even lower. A purely mechanical update suggests a probability below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a very low probability. What could I be missing?

*   **The "Deceptive Announcement" Scenario:** The resolution criterion is an "announcement," not implementation. The most plausible path to a "Yes" is a tactical, deceptive move by Iran. They could announce a vague "agreement in principle" to de-escalate tensions, forestall further military action, and shift the diplomatic blame to the West, with no real intention of allowing inspections. This is a known tactic.
*   **Overlooked Incentives:** Is there an incentive I'm missing? Perhaps the threat of a new, even more devastating military campaign is so acute that Iran's leadership calculates that a tactical concession is necessary for survival, regardless of the political cost.
*   **Opacity:** The internal decision-making of the Iranian regime is notoriously opaque. A sudden policy shift ordered by the Supreme Leader could occur with no external warning.

The "deceptive announcement" scenario is the most compelling counterargument. It's a low-cost way for Iran to achieve a short-term strategic goal. This possibility prevents the forecast from being near-zero. I will adjust my posterior probability upward from the sub-1% calculated result to account for this tail risk. A 2% probability seems appropriate, acknowledging that while a genuine deal is almost impossible, a tactical announcement remains a remote possibility.

### Final Forecast
The combination of a low base rate for rapid diplomatic breakthroughs, the powerful disincentives created by the recent military strikes, and the removal of sanctions relief as a bargaining chip makes an agreement extremely unlikely. Recent Iranian actions and rhetoric have consistently reinforced a hardline, non-cooperative stance. The only plausible, albeit remote, path to a "Yes" resolution is a last-minute, tactical announcement by Iran designed to de-escalate tensions without genuine commitment. The probability of such an event occurring before January 1, 2026, is very low.

Final: 2%
