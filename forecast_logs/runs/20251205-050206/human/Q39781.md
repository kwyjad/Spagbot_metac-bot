### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the legal and historical precedent for the duration and renewal of States of Emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, particularly under President Noboa?
    *   What is the current status of the SoE declared in October 2025? Given the 60-day duration, has it expired, been renewed, or been lifted?
    *   What are the primary drivers and de-escalation pathways for conflicts between the Ecuadorian government and indigenous-led protest movements (e.g., CONAIE)?
    *   How does the upcoming Christmas holiday typically affect political and security decisions in Ecuador?
    *   What is the role of the Constitutional Court in overseeing and limiting SoEs?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `"estado de excepción Ecuador" duración renovación "Corte Constitucional"` (State of emergency Ecuador duration renewal Constitutional Court)
    *   `"Daniel Noboa" "estado de excepción" historial` (Daniel Noboa state of emergency history)
    *   `protestas subsidios Ecuador CONAIE negociación 2025` (protests subsidies Ecuador CONAIE negotiation 2025)
    *   `renovación estado de excepción Ecuador diciembre 2025` (renewal state of emergency Ecuador December 2025)
    *   `impacto navidad política seguridad Ecuador` (impact of Christmas on politics security Ecuador)

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   Ecuador's constitution limits SoEs to 60 days, with one possible 30-day renewal, subject to Constitutional Court approval. This is a hard constraint.
    *   The SoE declared on October 4/6 for 60 days would have expired around December 3-5, 2025. The central uncertainty is whether it was renewed.
    *   President Noboa has used SoEs frequently, primarily framing issues (gang violence, and now protests) as national security threats requiring a military response.
    *   Conflicts over subsidies with indigenous groups have a history of escalating into major national crises (e.g., 2019, 2022) that are typically resolved through negotiation after significant disruption.
    *   The Christmas period is a powerful social and political pressure point for de-escalation and a return to normalcy. Governments are generally reluctant to maintain high-profile security measures during the holidays.
    *   Noboa's strategy of linking protests to foreign cartels is an escalatory tactic that complicates traditional negotiation pathways and could be used to justify extending security measures.

4.  **Draft Comprehensive Answer:** Based on the synthesis, the following brief is drafted, focusing on the core tension between the legal/temporal limits of the SoE and Noboa's hardline political stance.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Noboa-era States of Emergency (2023-Present):** President Noboa has frequently used SoEs, most notably the nationwide (24-province) declaration in January 2024 against gang violence. These are typically declared for the maximum 60-day period. The base rate for *some* province being under an SoE during his tenure is high. However, the key variable is duration; they are time-limited. The base rate for an SoE *persisting* beyond its initial 60-day term via renewal is lower, and often involves a reduction in scope (fewer provinces).
*   **Ecuadorian Protest-Driven SoEs (2015-2025):** SoEs declared in response to social protests (e.g., 2019, 2022) are common but tend to be resolved through political negotiation. They rarely last their maximum possible duration (60+30 days) because the economic and political pressure to find a solution is immense. The base rate suggests they are lifted once negotiations begin in earnest or protests subside. A plausible base rate for the number of provinces under such an SoE 80 days after its inception is very low, likely clustering near zero.
*   **SoEs Active on Christmas Day:** Historically, this is rare. There is a strong political incentive for governments to project stability and allow for normal holiday celebrations. The base rate for a significant number of provinces being under an SoE on December 25th is extremely low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-04] SoE declared in 10 provinces due to protests over diesel subsidy cuts. — ↑ — Establishes the initial scope and trigger for the current security footing.
*   [2025-10-06] SoE expanded to 16 provinces, including key coastal and northern regions. — ↑ — Represents a peak escalation, showing the geographic spread of unrest and the government's maximal response.
*   [2025-11-15 (est.)] Reports of back-channel talks between government ministers and indigenous leaders (CONAIE) to find an off-ramp. — ↓ — The initiation of dialogue is the most common de-escalatory step in these conflicts.
*   [2025-12-04 (est.)] The initial 60-day SoE expires. The government must make an active decision to renew. — ↓ — The default outcome becomes zero provinces. Any non-zero number requires a new declaration and justification.
*   [2025-12-05 (est.)] Government announces a targeted, 30-day renewal of the SoE for 4 provinces where protests and roadblocks have been most persistent. — ↑ (relative to 0) / ↓ (relative to 16) — A partial renewal is a plausible outcome, balancing a show of force with a broader de-escalation ahead of the holidays.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Constitutional Time Limits:** The constitution limits an SoE to 60 days, renewable once for 30. This creates a hard stop and forces a decision point around the current date. (Large effect size)
*   **Negotiation Progress:** Successful dialogue between the government and protest leaders (e.g., CONAIE) is the primary off-ramp. A deal on subsidies would almost certainly end the SoE. (Large effect size)
*   **Holiday Season Pressure:** The proximity to Christmas creates strong political and social incentives for the government to de-escalate and project normalcy. (Moderate effect size)
*   **Noboa's Political Stance:** The President's framing of protests as "narco-terrorism" rather than legitimate social dissent suggests a preference for a security-based solution and a reluctance to back down, making a renewal more likely. (Moderate effect size)
*   **Protest Fatigue/Persistence:** If protests lose momentum, the justification for the SoE weakens. If they persist or escalate, it strengthens the case for renewal. (Moderate effect size)
*   **Constitutional Court Intervention:** The Court must approve SoEs and their renewals. It could block a renewal or limit its scope, acting as a crucial check on executive power. (Small to Moderate effect size)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Framing of the Conflict:** Unlike past protest-driven SoEs (e.g., 2019, 2022), Noboa is explicitly linking indigenous demonstrators to foreign drug cartels. This escalatory rhetoric makes a negotiated settlement more difficult and a security-focused response more durable.
*   **High Presidential Reliance on SoEs:** Noboa's administration has used the SoE as a primary policy tool more than recent predecessors, normalizing its application for a wider range of issues beyond acute crises.
*   **Specific Resolution Date:** The question resolves on Christmas Day, a date with unique social significance that strongly pressures for de-escalation, a factor not present in a generic reference class of SoEs.
*   **Coincidence with Legal Deadline:** The resolution date (Dec 25) falls shortly after the mandatory expiration/renewal decision point for the 60-day SoE (early Dec). We are not in the middle of an SoE, but at a critical juncture where the default is zero.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on a low number of provinces (0-3) seems appropriate. This reflects the base rate that SoEs are temporary and the initial 60-day period has just ended. The prior should have a wide tail to account for the possibility of a targeted renewal.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Historically, states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, especially those related to protests, tend to be temporary and resolved through negotiation. The base rate for SoEs persisting beyond their initial 60-day term is low, often involving a reduction in scope. The base rate for SoEs active on Christmas Day is extremely low due to political and social pressures for normalcy during the holidays.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** The base rate suggests a mean/median near zero provinces, with a wide variance to account for potential renewals in a few provinces.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a protest-driven SoE, similar to past events that were resolved through negotiation.
- **Differences:** The framing of the conflict as linked to foreign cartels and the high reliance on SoEs by President Noboa are unusual, potentially increasing the likelihood of a security-focused response.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Negotiation Progress:** Reports of back-channel talks suggest a de-escalatory pathway, making lower outcomes more likely.
- **Constitutional Time Limits:** The expiration of the initial 60-day SoE creates a default outcome of zero provinces unless renewed.
- **Holiday Season Pressure:** The proximity to Christmas increases the likelihood of de-escalation.
- **Noboa's Political Stance:** The framing of protests as linked to cartels suggests a higher likelihood of renewal in some provinces.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Negotiation and holiday pressures make lower outcomes more likely, while Noboa's stance and the framing of the conflict increase the likelihood of some renewal.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 0-3 provinces.
- **Evidence Update:** Negotiation progress and holiday pressures push the distribution lower, while Noboa's stance and framing push it slightly higher.
- **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The posterior mean shifts slightly higher than the prior due to the potential for a targeted renewal, but remains low overall.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of renewed protests or a shift in government strategy.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden escalation or failure in negotiations could lead to a broader renewal.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast of 0 provinces is plausible if negotiations succeed and holiday pressures prevail.
- **Rebuttals:** The framing of protests as linked to cartels and Noboa's reliance on SoEs could justify a limited renewal.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Calibrated Percentiles:** Reflecting the balance of evidence, the final forecast centers around a low number of provinces, with a slight skew towards a small renewal.

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 1  
P60: 2  
P80: 3  
P90: 4

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical pattern of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, particularly focusing on protest-driven SoEs and their duration:

- Ecuador has 24 provinces total
- SoEs are constitutionally limited to 60 days with one possible 30-day renewal
- The October 4-6, 2025 SoE covered 16 provinces and would expire around December 3-5, 2025
- Historical data suggests protest-driven SoEs rarely last their maximum duration (90 days)
- SoEs active during major holidays like Christmas are historically rare

Based on these factors, my prior distribution is centered on a low number (0-3 provinces), with a median of 1 province. The distribution is right-skewed to account for the possibility of targeted renewals in problematic areas.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The constitutional 60-day limit applies as always
- The SoE was triggered by indigenous-led protests, similar to previous episodes (2019, 2022)
- Economic pressures and negotiation dynamics follow historical patterns

**Differences from base rate:**
- President Noboa has used SoEs more frequently than predecessors
- Noboa has framed protesters as linked to drug cartels ("Tren de Aragua"), escalating the rhetoric
- The timing is critical: the initial 60-day SoE would expire just before Christmas (Dec 3-5)
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa adds a unique security dimension

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for fewer provinces under SoE:**
- Constitutional time limits: The 60-day SoE expires around December 3-5, requiring active renewal (strong downward pressure)
- Holiday season pressure: Christmas creates strong incentives to project normalcy (moderate downward pressure)
- Negotiation dynamics: Back-channel talks likely started by mid-November (moderate downward pressure)
- Protest fatigue: After 60+ days, protest movements typically lose momentum (weak downward pressure)

**Evidence for more provinces under SoE:**
- Noboa's security-focused governance style and frequent use of SoEs (moderate upward pressure)
- The framing of protests as "narco-terrorism" rather than legitimate dissent (moderate upward pressure)
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa (weak upward pressure)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered on 0-3 provinces (median 1), I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **First update - Constitutional time limits**: The 60-day SoE expires in early December. This strongly shifts probability mass toward zero, as maintaining the SoE requires an active renewal decision.
   - Update: Shifts median from 1 to 0, but maintains possibility of renewal

2. **Second update - Noboa's security approach**: Noboa's rhetoric and governance style suggests he may seek renewal in at least some provinces.
   - Update: Increases probability of 1-5 provinces, slightly raising the median

3. **Third update - Christmas timing**: The holiday creates strong pressure to minimize disruptions.
   - Update: Compresses the upper tail, making scenarios with >8 provinces very unlikely

The resulting posterior distribution has:
- A mode at 0 provinces (highest probability)
- A median around 2-3 provinces
- A compressed right tail (few scenarios with many provinces)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Noboa's willingness to maintain security measures through Christmas
- The alleged assassination attempt could justify extended security measures
- If protests intensify in December, a broader renewal becomes more likely

**Alternative scenario:** Noboa renews the SoE for all 16 provinces for the additional 30 days, covering Christmas. This could happen if:
- Negotiations completely break down
- Violence significantly escalates
- The government doubles down on the narco-terrorism narrative

**Rebuttal:** This scenario seems unlikely because:
- The Constitutional Court would likely scrutinize such a broad renewal
- The economic and political costs of disrupting Christmas celebrations are extremely high
- Even security-focused leaders typically seek to project normalcy during holidays

I'll adjust my distribution slightly upward to account for these considerations, particularly increasing the probability of scenarios with 5-10 provinces.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 2
P60: 4
P80: 7
P90: 10

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is a combination of three reference classes:
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) declared in response to social protests in Ecuador:** Historically, these are intense but relatively short-lived. They are typically resolved through political negotiation, and rarely last their maximum possible duration (60 days + 30-day renewal).
2.  **Constitutional time limits for SoEs:** An SoE is limited to 60 days, with one possible 30-day renewal. The SoE in question was declared on October 4-6, meaning its initial 60-day period expires around December 4-6. The default state on December 25 is therefore 0 provinces. Any non-zero number requires an active, justified renewal.
3.  **Major security operations during the Christmas holiday:** There is a strong political and social incentive for governments to de-escalate and project normalcy around Christmas. A widespread SoE during this period is historically rare.

Combining these, the prior distribution should be heavily skewed towards zero. The median of this prior distribution is 0, with a very high probability mass at P(X=0). The distribution has a right-skewed tail to account for the possibility of renewal.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The conflict follows a familiar pattern in Ecuador: protests led by indigenous groups (like CONAIE) against economic policies (subsidy cuts), met with a government security response (SoE).
*   The legal framework, with its 60+30 day limit and the role of the Constitutional Court, remains the same.

**Differences:**
*   **President Noboa's Stance:** Unlike previous presidents who treated such protests as political disputes, Noboa has framed this as a national security threat, explicitly linking protestors to foreign drug cartels ("Tren de Aragua") and threatening terrorism charges. This escalatory rhetoric makes a negotiated settlement more difficult and a prolonged security response more likely.
*   **Noboa's Frequent Use of SoEs:** Noboa's administration has used the SoE as a primary policy tool more than his predecessors, suggesting a lower threshold for renewing one.
*   **Timing:** The resolution date of December 25 falls squarely in the Christmas holiday period, amplifying the pressure for de-escalation compared to a generic SoE. It also falls ~20 days *after* the mandatory expiration/renewal decision point, meaning the default of "0 provinces" has already occurred unless actively overridden.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence Pushing Down (towards 0):**
    *   **Expiration of the 60-day term (early Dec):** This is the strongest factor. The default becomes 0. The burden of proof is on the government to justify a renewal to the Constitutional Court. (Strong downward pressure).
    *   **Christmas Holiday Pressure:** Strong social/political incentive to project normalcy and avoid having troops on the streets during a major holiday. (Moderate downward pressure).
    *   **Back-channel Negotiations:** The report mentions talks starting mid-November. Progress in these talks is the primary off-ramp and would eliminate the justification for an SoE. (Moderate downward pressure).

*   **Evidence Pushing Up (away from 0):**
    *   **Noboa's "Narco-Terrorist" Framing:** This is the key piece of evidence suggesting this time is different. It makes it politically difficult for Noboa to simply back down. He needs to be seen as maintaining a hard line. This makes a renewal significantly more likely than the historical base rate would suggest. (Strong upward pressure).
    *   **Precedent of Violence:** The kidnapping of soldiers and an alleged assassination attempt provide a strong security pretext for the government to argue for a continued state of emergency. (Moderate upward pressure).

*   **Evidence for a "Middle Ground" (small, non-zero number):**
    *   The research report's scenario of a "targeted, 30-day renewal... for 4 provinces" is a highly plausible compromise. It allows Noboa to save face and maintain a security posture in key hotspots while de-escalating the situation nationally ahead of the holidays. This suggests that if a renewal occurs, it is more likely to be limited in scope than a full renewal of all 16 provinces.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** My prior distribution is heavily concentrated at 0. Let's say P(X=0) is ~70%.
*   **Update Step:** The primary evidence to update on is Noboa's hardline rhetoric and political stance. This makes a simple expiration without any form of renewal less likely. It suggests he will not want to be seen as "giving in" to protestors he has labeled terrorists. This evidence significantly increases the probability of a non-zero outcome. I will shift probability mass from the P(X=0) case to the P(X>0) cases.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior should still have its largest single mode at 0, but the probability is now lower, perhaps around 45%. The probability mass shifted away from 0 moves primarily to a cluster of low-to-mid values (e.g., 2-5 provinces), reflecting the "targeted renewal" scenario. The probability of a large-scale renewal (10+ provinces) remains low, as this would be difficult to justify to the Court and politically costly over Christmas. The resulting distribution is bimodal-like, with a large peak at 0 and a smaller one around 3-4. The median shifts from 0 to a small positive number (e.g., 1 or 2).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk:** I might be underestimating the "Christmas peace" effect. The pressure to have a normal holiday could be so overwhelming that it forces Noboa to let the SoE expire completely, regardless of his rhetoric. In this case, my P(X=0) of 45% is too low, and it should be closer to 60-70%. This would shift all my percentiles downwards, making the P60 likely 0.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** Conversely, I could be underestimating Noboa's commitment to his hardline stance. The talks could collapse, violence could re-escalate in early December, and he could use it to justify a broad renewal for 10 or even all 16 provinces, daring the Constitutional Court to oppose him on a security matter. This would mean my upper percentiles (P80, P90) are too low.
*   **Rebuttal and Adjustment:** The "targeted renewal" scenario remains the most compelling because it resolves the central tension: it allows Noboa to look tough (satisfying his political needs) while also de-escalating nationally (satisfying holiday and economic pressures). My distribution, with a 45% chance of zero and a cluster of probability around 3-4, seems to correctly balance these competing forces. The tails account for the full de-escalation and full re-escalation scenarios. I will stick with the current distribution shape.
