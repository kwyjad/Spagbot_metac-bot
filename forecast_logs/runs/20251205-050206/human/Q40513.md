### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Appropriations cycles under divided government since 2011.** In the 7 completed appropriations cycles under divided government since FY2012, Congress has never passed all 12 bills individually on time. The most common outcome is a combination of continuing resolutions (CRs) and large omnibus or "minibus" packages passed late in the calendar year or early in the next. In these cycles, the number of bills enacted by January 1 has varied widely, but a common pattern is to pass a CR into the new year and then finalize spending.
    -   *Base Rate:* The probability of enacting 0 additional bills before Jan 1, after a CR has been passed to late January, is high, perhaps **60-70%**. The alternative is a major "lame-duck" session deal, which happens but is not the default.
-   **Reference Class 2: Appropriations cycles following a significant government shutdown.** Major shutdowns (e.g., 2013, 2018-19) often increase political pressure to avoid a repeat, but they also signal deep partisan divisions that make compromise difficult. Following the 2013 shutdown, a budget agreement was reached in December that set spending levels, paving the way for an omnibus in January. After the 2018-19 shutdown, a deal was reached in February.
    -   *Base Rate:* This class suggests that a deal is not typically immediate. The focus shifts to preventing the *next* deadline from triggering another shutdown. The base rate for passing the remaining bills before the end of the calendar year (a non-critical deadline) is low, perhaps **20-30%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-08] CR passed funding government until Jan 30, 2026 — ↓ — Reduces urgency. The primary "action-forcing" event is now the CR expiration, not the holiday recess, making a pre-2026 deal less critical.
-   [2025-11-08] Three appropriations bills (Ag, Leg Branch, MilCon-VA) enacted — ↓ — This is a common strategy of passing the least controversial bills first. It signals progress but leaves the nine most contentious bills, making a quick omnibus deal on the remainder harder.
-   [2025-10-01 to 2025-11-07] Longest government shutdown in US history occurs — ↑ — The political and economic pain from the shutdown creates significant pressure on leadership to demonstrate governability and avoid a repeat, potentially incentivizing a year-end deal to "clear the decks."
-   [2025-07-17] Senate committee advances MilCon-VA bill — (neutral) — Shows bipartisan work was possible mid-year on less controversial bills, consistent with the outcome of three bills passing, but provides little information on the remaining nine.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Holiday Recess Deadline (Large ↑):** The strongest driver for year-end legislative action. Members of Congress are highly motivated to finalize major business before returning to their districts for the holidays. This creates a powerful, informal deadline.
-   **Complexity of Remaining Bills (Large ↓):** The nine remaining bills include the most difficult ones (Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, Homeland Security). These contain major funding disputes and are magnets for controversial policy riders, requiring extensive, time-consuming negotiations.
-   **Leverage for January Deadline (Moderate ↓):** With a CR in place until January 30, leadership in one or both parties may believe they will have a stronger negotiating position in the new year and may prefer to wait rather than compromise now.
-   **Shutdown Fatigue (Moderate ↑):** The recent, painful shutdown may have exhausted both sides' appetite for brinkmanship, making them more amenable to a compromise now to signal an end to the chaos.
-   **Leadership Priorities (Moderate ↕):** Congressional leaders may prioritize other lame-duck items (e.g., judicial nominations, tax extensions) over the difficult appropriations endgame, pushing the funding fight to January.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Shutdown Length:** The background states the FY26 shutdown was the "longest in US history." This is a significant deviation from the reference class. The political fallout and public anger are likely at a historical high, which could scramble normal political calculations and create unique pressure for a comprehensive deal.
-   **Three Bills Already Enacted:** While passing some bills and a CR for others is not unusual, having three signed into law alongside a CR that punts the rest until late January is a specific setup. It cleanly separates the "easy" from the "hard" work, potentially hardening positions on the remaining bills.
-   **Known Deadline of Jan 30:** Unlike situations where a short-term CR expires in December, the Jan 30 date is a firm, known future deadline. This significantly reduces the power of the informal pre-Christmas deadline, as there is no imminent threat of a shutdown in December.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A bimodal prior is appropriate, reflecting the "all or nothing" nature of lame-duck omnibus deals. Start with the base rate: ~65% probability of 0 additional bills and ~35% probability of the remaining 9 bills passing (as an omnibus/minibus package). Equivalent n: ~10 observations.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) CR expires Jan 30, not in December. This is the strongest piece of evidence, as it removes the primary action-forcing mechanism for a pre-2026 deal.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The 9 remaining bills are the most controversial. This confirms that the path to a deal is structurally difficult and time-consuming.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The historic length of the recent shutdown creates significant "scar tissue" and political pressure on leaders to show they can govern.
    -   (↓ Small) Passing the three easy bills clears the underbrush but also concentrates the political conflict on the remaining items.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence points downward. The lack of an imminent shutdown deadline (due to the Jan 30 CR) is a powerful de-motivator that likely outweighs the general pressure created by the earlier shutdown. The posterior should shift significantly towards 0 additional bills being enacted before 2026.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (more bills likely):**
    -   Daily "four corners" meetings between House/Senate and Democratic/Republican leadership.
    -   Leadership announces a "framework agreement" on top-line spending numbers for the remaining 9 bills.
    -   Circulation of draft omnibus text among appropriations committee members.
    -   Cancellation or shortening of the planned holiday recess.
-   **DOWN indicators (fewer bills likely):**
    -   Leadership publicly blames the other party for the impasse and begins talking about the "need to prepare for the January deadline."
    -   No high-level leadership meetings on appropriations are scheduled.
    -   Focus shifts entirely to other lame-duck priorities (e.g., NDAA, tax policy).
    -   Staff-level talks are reported to have broken down over policy riders.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution Definition:** The resolution hinges on bills being "enacted" (signed by the President) before Jan 1, 2026. A deal could be reached in late December, but delays in enrollment and presidential signature could push enactment into January.
-   **"Minibus" Possibility:** While a single omnibus is a common vehicle, Congress could pass one or two smaller packages ("minibuses") covering some, but not all, of the remaining 9 bills. This would result in a number between 0 and 9.
-   **Political Surprise:** A sudden grand bargain, potentially linking appropriations to other major legislation, could emerge unexpectedly. Leadership negotiations are opaque.
-   **External Events:** A major national security or economic crisis could dramatically shift priorities and either force a quick deal or delay it indefinitely.

**Final Research Summary:** Three of the twelve FY2026 appropriations bills have already been enacted. The remaining nine are the most contentious, and with a continuing resolution already in place until January 30, 2026, the primary incentive for a difficult year-end deal has been removed.

To forecast the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Appropriations cycles under divided government since 2011. Historically, the probability of enacting 0 additional bills before January 1, after a CR has been passed to late January, is high (60-70%).
   - **Reference Class 2:** Appropriations cycles following a significant government shutdown. The base rate for passing the remaining bills before the end of the calendar year is low (20-30%).
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** A bimodal distribution reflecting these probabilities, with a higher likelihood of 0 additional bills being enacted.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a divided government and follows a significant government shutdown, aligning with the reference classes.
   - **Differences:** The unprecedented length of the shutdown and the enactment of three bills already could influence the dynamics, but the CR expiring in January reduces urgency.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR until Jan 30 (↓ Large):** Reduces urgency for a pre-2026 deal.
   - **Remaining Bills Complexity (↓ Moderate):** These are contentious and time-consuming to negotiate.
   - **Shutdown Length (↑ Moderate):** Creates pressure to avoid further chaos.
   - **Three Bills Enacted (↓ Small):** Concentrates conflict on remaining bills.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** 65% probability of 0 additional bills, 35% probability of 9 bills.
   - **Evidence Impact:** The strongest evidence (CR until Jan 30) shifts the distribution towards 0 additional bills.
   - **Posterior:** Increased probability of 0 additional bills being enacted before 2026.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden political compromise or external crisis.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A grand bargain could lead to more bills being enacted, but the evidence suggests this is less likely.
   - **Adjustment:** Maintain a cautious stance with a higher probability of 0 additional bills.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian update, the forecast is skewed towards 0 additional bills being enacted before 2026.

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 0  
P60: 0  
P80: 1  
P90: 2

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Reference Class 1: Recent appropriations cycles under divided government**
In the past decade, when government has been divided, Congress rarely passes all 12 bills individually on time. The pattern typically involves continuing resolutions followed by omnibus packages. Three bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA), with a CR extending to January 30, 2026 for the remaining nine.

**Reference Class 2: Post-shutdown appropriations behavior**
Following major shutdowns (like 2013 and 2018-19), Congress tends to focus on preventing the next deadline from triggering another shutdown rather than quickly resolving all appropriations.

**Prior Distribution:**
- Mean/Median: 3 bills (the ones already enacted)
- Shape: Right-skewed with mass at 3 and 12 (reflecting the bimodal nature - either just the current 3 or all 12 via omnibus)
- Probability of additional bills before 2026: ~30%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- Divided government with partisan tensions
- Some "easy" bills already passed
- CR extending well into the next year (January 30, 2026)

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented shutdown length creates unique political dynamics
- Clean separation of "easy" bills (3 enacted) from "difficult" bills (9 remaining)
- CR extends significantly past the holiday recess, removing a key action-forcing deadline

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing toward fewer bills (3 total):**
- CR extends to January 30, 2026 (strong downward pressure, ~3:1 likelihood ratio)
  * Removes the immediate pressure to act before holidays
  * Creates a clean "next deadline" well into 2026
  
- The 9 remaining bills are the most contentious ones (moderate downward pressure, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)
  * Defense, Homeland Security, and Labor-HHS-Education contain major policy disputes
  * These bills typically require extensive negotiations

**Evidence pushing toward more bills (12 total):**
- Historic shutdown length creates pressure to demonstrate governance (moderate upward pressure, ~1:2 likelihood ratio)
  * Political "scar tissue" from the shutdown may motivate leadership to avoid further crises
  * Public and market pressure for stability

- Holiday recess provides some deadline pressure (weak upward pressure, ~1:1.5 likelihood ratio)
  * Members strongly prefer to finish business before returning to districts
  * But this is significantly weakened by the January 30 CR date

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of ~30% chance of additional bills before 2026:

First update: CR extends to January 30, 2026 (3:1 likelihood ratio against additional bills)
- Prior odds: 30:70 (0.43)
- Posterior odds: 0.43 × (1/3) = 0.14, or about 12:88
- Posterior probability: ~12% chance of additional bills

Second update: Remaining bills are the most contentious (2:1 likelihood ratio against additional bills)
- Prior odds: 12:88 (0.14)
- Posterior odds: 0.14 × (1/2) = 0.07, or about 7:93
- Posterior probability: ~7% chance of additional bills

Third update: Historic shutdown creates governance pressure (1:2 likelihood ratio for additional bills)
- Prior odds: 7:93 (0.075)
- Posterior odds: 0.075 × 2 = 0.15, or about 13:87
- Posterior probability: ~13% chance of additional bills

Fourth update: Holiday recess deadline (1:1.5 likelihood ratio for additional bills)
- Prior odds: 13:87 (0.15)
- Posterior odds: 0.15 × 1.5 = 0.225, or about 18:82
- Posterior probability: ~18% chance of additional bills

This gives us approximately:
- 82% chance of remaining at 3 bills
- 18% chance of passing additional bills (most likely all 9 remaining bills as an omnibus)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the power of the holiday recess deadline. Even with a January CR, Congress often tries to clear major business before year-end.
- The unprecedented shutdown length could create stronger-than-expected pressure for a comprehensive solution.
- I might be overlooking the possibility of partial progress - perhaps 1-3 additional bills could pass as a "minibus" rather than all 9.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be ~40% chance of additional bills, arguing that:
1. The holiday recess is still a powerful forcing mechanism
2. Leadership may want to demonstrate functionality after the historic shutdown
3. Some of the remaining bills might be less contentious than I assume

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The January 30 CR date is the strongest evidence against additional bills. With no shutdown threat until late January, the urgency is significantly reduced. Additionally, the fact that the three "easy" bills were already separated out suggests a strategic decision to defer the contentious bills.

**Adjustment:**
I'll slightly increase my probability of additional bills to account for the possibility of partial progress (minibus packages) and the holiday recess pressure, moving from 18% to 22%.

## 6. Final Percentiles

For a discrete distribution focused on 3 bills (already enacted) with some probability mass at higher values (primarily 12 if an omnibus passes), my percentiles are:

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 12

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the number of appropriations bills enacted before the end of the calendar year, given that a fiscal year has already started and some action has been taken. An appropriate reference class is **appropriations cycles under divided government since FY2012**, particularly those requiring continuing resolutions (CRs) that extend past December.

In these situations, legislative action is typically driven by deadlines. The most powerful informal deadline is the congressional recess for the holidays. However, when a CR is passed that funds the government into the next calendar year (e.g., late January), this primary incentive is removed. The base rate in such cases is for Congress to defer action until the new deadline approaches.

Therefore, my prior distribution for the number of *additional* bills enacted before 2026 is strongly bimodal:
*   **High probability of 0 additional bills:** This is the path of least resistance. Congress has already "solved" the immediate shutdown crisis and can return home, deferring the difficult negotiations. I'll set this prior probability at **~70%**.
*   **Lower probability of all 9 remaining bills:** This represents a "grand bargain" or "lame-duck" omnibus package, where leaders decide to clear the decks before the holidays. This is less common but still plausible. I'll set this prior probability at **~25%**.
*   **Very low probability of a partial number (1-8 bills):** Passing a few more, but not all, of the difficult bills offers little political reward for the effort required. This has a prior probability of **~5%**.

This prior is centered on 0 additional bills, with a significant possibility of a jump to 9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The current situation involves a divided government, which is the basis for the reference class.
*   The pattern of passing the least controversial bills first (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) while deferring the most contentious ones is standard procedure.

**Differences:**
*   **Unprecedented Shutdown Length:** The background states the preceding shutdown was the "longest in US history." This is a major deviation. The political pain and public anger are likely at a peak, creating extraordinary pressure on leadership to demonstrate competence and avoid further brinkmanship. This differs from a standard CR process.
*   **Firm Future Deadline:** The CR extends to January 30, 2026. This is a clear, known, and relatively distant deadline. This differs from situations where a CR might expire in mid-December, making the pre-holiday deadline a true "cliff."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the key pieces of evidence, focusing on the two main outcomes: 0 additional bills vs. 9 additional bills.

*   **Evidence 1: CR funds government until January 30, 2026.**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It is highly consistent with the "0 additional bills" outcome, as it removes the primary action-forcing mechanism for a year-end deal. It makes the "wait until January" strategy logical and politically safe.
    *   **Adjustment:** This strongly pushes the forecast down. It makes the 0-bill outcome at least 3x more likely relative to the 9-bill outcome.

*   **Evidence 2: The nine remaining bills are the most controversial.**
    *   This includes Defense, Labor-HHS, and Homeland Security, which are magnets for disputes over funding levels and policy riders. This complexity makes a quick, pre-holiday deal much harder to achieve.
    *   **Adjustment:** This pushes the forecast down. It makes the 0-bill outcome moderately (perhaps 1.5x) more likely.

*   **Evidence 3: The historic length of the recent shutdown.**
    *   This is the primary evidence pointing upward. The "shutdown fatigue" and political scar tissue may be so severe that leaders feel compelled to strike a deal to signal an end to the chaos and a return to governability.
    *   **Adjustment:** This pushes the forecast up. It makes the 9-bill "grand bargain" outcome more likely than it would be in a typical year, perhaps 2x as likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Let's combine these effects conceptually.

*   **Prior:** A ~70% chance of 0 additional bills and a ~25% chance of 9.
*   **Update:** The powerful downward pressure from the January 30 CR date is the dominant factor. While the shutdown fatigue provides a significant counter-pressure, it is unlikely to overcome the fundamental lack of a hard deadline. The path of least resistance—doing nothing more until January—remains the most probable.
*   **Posterior:** The evidence significantly strengthens the probability of 0 additional bills. I will shift the probability from 70% up to around 80%. The probability of the 9-bill omnibus is consequently reduced, but remains a significant possibility due to the shutdown fatigue factor.

My posterior distribution for the number of *additional* bills is:
*   **P(0 additional bills) = 80%**
*   **P(9 additional bills) = 18%**
*   **P(1-8 additional bills) = 2%**

Since 3 bills have already been enacted, the final distribution for the *total* number of enacted bills is:
*   **P(3 total bills) = 80%**
*   **P(12 total bills) = 18%**
*   **P(4-11 total bills) = 2%** (I will model this as a small chance of a minibus, e.g., 3 more bills for a total of 6).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily skewed towards a single outcome (3 bills total). Could I be wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The "shutdown fatigue" is being underestimated. The political pressure on the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader from their own members, the public, and the media could be so immense that they cannot face their constituents over the holidays without a comprehensive deal. In this world, they force a compromise, and the remaining 9 bills are passed in a single omnibus. My 18% probability for this outcome acknowledges this, but it could be higher, perhaps as high as 30%.
*   **Rebuttal:** The logic of congressional deadlines is exceptionally strong. Inertia is the default. Without a "cliff" to force action, it is far easier for leaders to declare a partial victory (3 bills passed, government funded until Jan 30) and promise to finish the job in the new year. This narrative is plausible and avoids the difficult, rushed negotiations over the most contentious bills.
*   **Final Check:** The bimodal distribution (a high chance of 3, a smaller chance of 12) seems correct. The 80/18 split reflects the powerful structural incentive to delay (the CR date) while still accounting for the unusual political pressure for a deal (shutdown fatigue). The forecast feels robust.

### 6. Final Percentiles

Based on my posterior distribution (80% chance of 3 total bills, ~2% chance of a few more, 18% chance of 12 total bills), I can construct the percentiles.

The cumulative distribution is:
*   P(X ≤ 3) = 80%
*   P(X ≤ ~6) ≈ 82%
*   P(X ≤ 12) = 100%

This means that any percentile up to the 80th will be 3. Any percentile above the 82nd will be 12.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 12
