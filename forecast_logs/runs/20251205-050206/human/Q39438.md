### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on "Major Questions" of Executive Authority (2010-Present):** This is the most relevant class. It involves cases where an executive agency or the President asserts significant new authority based on a broad or old statute. The current Court has developed the "Major Questions Doctrine" to curb such assertions. In recent key cases (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA* on vaccine mandates), the executive branch has lost.
    *   **Base Rate:** The executive branch loses on the core question of authority in roughly 75% of these cases. This suggests a high probability of "Tariffs unlawful."
    *   **Limitations:** This is a relatively new and evolving doctrine, so the number of cases is small. The national security context of IEEPA could make it distinct from cases involving domestic agencies like the EPA or OSHA.

2.  **Supreme Court Rulings Involving Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain. Cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (upholding IEEPA use for asset freezes) or *Trump v. Hawaii* (upholding the travel ban) fit this class.
    *   **Base Rate:** The President's action is upheld in roughly 60-70% of these cases. This reference class points towards "Tariffs lawful."
    *   **Limitations:** This case involves the power to tax (tariffs), a power the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress, making it a weaker case for executive deference than, for example, controlling entry into the country. The use of IEEPA for broad tariffs is also novel, unlike prior uses that had historical precedent or congressional acquiescence.

3.  **Supreme Court Affirmance Rate of Federal Appellate Courts:** The Supreme Court agrees to hear cases often to resolve circuit splits or correct errors, but it still affirms the lower court's judgment more often than it reverses.
    *   **Base Rate:** The Supreme Court affirms the judgment of the court of appeals in approximately 60-65% of cases. Here, both the D.C. District Court and the Federal Circuit ruled the tariffs unlawful.
    *   **Base Rate Application:** This suggests a ~65% chance the Supreme Court will also find the tariffs unlawful, aligning with the "Major Questions" reference class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms in a 7-4 decision that the tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. **(↓ for lawful)** — A ruling from a specialized appellate court with a decisive, albeit not unanimous, majority adds significant legal weight against the administration's position.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari to both cases and consolidates them on an expedited schedule. **(↓ for No 2025 ruling/Other ruling)** — The Court's speed signals the issue's importance and its intent to issue a merits ruling before year-end, making a procedural dodge or delay highly unlikely.
*   **2025-11-05 (Hypothetical)** Oral arguments are held. Reporting suggests a majority of justices, including key conservatives like Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, express deep skepticism about the executive branch's claim that IEEPA authorizes broad taxation powers, repeatedly invoking separation of powers and the Major Questions Doctrine. **(↓ for lawful, ↑ for unlawful/mixed)** — Questions from the bench are a key indicator of the Court's thinking; skepticism from the Court's center and conservative wing is a very strong negative signal for the government's case.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Major Questions Doctrine (Large, ↓ for lawful):** The Court's current conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies discovering transformative powers in vague, old statutes. Imposing trillions of dollars in tariffs based on a 1977 emergency powers act is a textbook "major question" that the Court will likely require explicit, not implicit, authorization for.
*   **Textualism/Separation of Powers (Large, ↓ for lawful):** The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" and to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations." Tariffs are a form of tax. The argument that IEEPA's power to "regulate" economic transactions implicitly includes the power to tax is textually weak and raises profound separation-of-powers concerns for several conservative justices.
*   **National Security Deference (Moderate, ↑ for lawful/mixed):** The government's strongest argument is that the President has broad discretion in declaring and responding to national emergencies. The Court is traditionally hesitant to second-guess the executive in this area. This might provide a path for upholding the more narrowly targeted "trafficking tariffs" even if the broader "reciprocal tariffs" are struck down.
*   **Distinction Between Tariff Types (Moderate, ↑ for mixed):** The Court could easily sever its analysis. The "trafficking tariffs" are tied to a traditional national security threat (cartels, fentanyl). The "reciprocal tariffs" are based on trade deficits, a purely economic rationale that looks much more like general policymaking reserved for Congress. This distinction provides a clear off-ramp for a mixed ruling.
*   **Precedent (*Dames & Moore v. Regan*):** The government will rely heavily on this case, which affirmed broad presidential power under IEEPA. However, that case involved asset freezes and claim suspensions, not taxation, and was supported by a long history of congressional acquiescence, which is absent here. This driver is likely weak.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** Unlike historical uses of IEEPA for sanctions or asset freezes, this is a novel attempt to use it as a general tariff-setting authority, directly encroaching on a core congressional power.
*   **Ascendant Major Questions Doctrine:** Compared to the era of *Dames & Moore*, the Court now possesses a powerful and frequently used doctrinal tool (*West Virginia v. EPA*) specifically designed to strike down executive actions of this type.
*   **Bundling of Strong and Weak Justifications:** The case combines a colorable (though still questionable) national security claim (trafficking) with a very weak economic one (trade deficits). This structure makes a "Mixed ruling" more

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Based on historical deference to presidential power in foreign affairs/national security, the base rate is approximately 60-70%. However, given the constitutional emphasis on Congress's power to regulate commerce, a lower base rate of 40% is more appropriate.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The "Major Questions Doctrine" and recent Supreme Court trends suggest a base rate of about 75% for executive losses in major authority questions. Adjusting for the national security context, a base rate of 50% is reasonable.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: Given the potential for the Court to distinguish between different types of tariffs, a base rate of 20% is plausible.
  
- **Other ruling**: Historically, the Supreme Court rarely issues non-merits rulings in high-profile cases, suggesting a low base rate of 5%.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule and importance of the case make this unlikely, with a base rate of 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves significant questions of executive authority, similar to past cases where the Court has applied the Major Questions Doctrine.
  
- **Differences**: The national security justification for the tariffs is stronger than in typical domestic regulatory cases, potentially increasing the likelihood of a lawful ruling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Federal Circuit Ruling**: The Federal Circuit's decision against the tariffs (7-4) strongly suggests a likelihood of 0.8 that the Supreme Court will find them unlawful.
  
- **Supreme Court's Expedited Review**: The Court's decision to expedite review suggests a likelihood of 0.9 that they will issue a ruling in 2025.
  
- **Oral Arguments**: Reports of skepticism from key justices about the executive's authority suggest a likelihood of 0.7 for an unlawful or mixed ruling.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds = 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.67. Likelihood ratio = 0.2 (Federal Circuit ruling) × 0.3 (Oral arguments). Posterior odds = 0.67 × 0.06 = 0.04. Posterior probability = 0.04 / (1 + 0.04) ≈ 4%.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds = 0.5 / (1 - 0.5) = 1. Likelihood ratio = 0.8 (Federal Circuit ruling) × 0.7 (Oral arguments). Posterior odds = 1 × 0.56 = 0.56. Posterior probability = 0.56 / (1 + 0.56) ≈ 36%.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds = 0.2 / (1 - 0.2) = 0.25. Likelihood ratio = 0.2 (Federal Circuit ruling) × 0.7 (Oral arguments). Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.14 = 0.035. Posterior probability = 0.035 / (1 + 0.035) ≈ 3.4%.
  
- **Other ruling**: Prior odds = 0.05 / (1 - 0.05) = 0.0526. Likelihood ratio = 0.1 (Expedited review). Posterior odds = 0.0526 × 0.1 = 0.00526. Posterior probability = 0.00526 / (1 + 0.00526) ≈ 0.5%.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds = 0.05 / (1 - 0.05) = 0.0526. Likelihood ratio = 0.1 (Expedited review). Posterior odds = 0.0526 × 0.1 = 0.00526. Posterior probability = 0.00526 / (1 + 0.00526) ≈ 0.5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: The high probability for "Tariffs unlawful" could be overconfident given the national security context. Adjusting for this, we might increase the probability for "Mixed ruling."
  
- **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the possibility of a narrow ruling that upholds some tariffs on national security grounds while striking down others.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Normalize probabilities to sum to 100%:

  - Tariffs lawful: 4%
  - Tariffs unlawful: 36%
  - Mixed ruling: 3.4%
  - Other ruling: 0.5%
  - No 2025 ruling: 0.5%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 4%  
Tariffs unlawful: 36%  
Mixed ruling: 3.4%  
Other ruling: 0.5%  
No 2025 ruling: 0.5%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Tariffs lawful (20% prior):**
- Historical deference to executive power in foreign affairs/national security (e.g., *Dames & Moore v. Regan*, *Trump v. Hawaii*)
- IEEPA has been used broadly in the past for economic sanctions
- However, the current Court has been skeptical of executive overreach

**Tariffs unlawful (50% prior):**
- The Court's "Major Questions Doctrine" has limited executive power in recent cases (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*)
- Both lower courts ruled against the tariffs (Court of International Trade and DC District Court)
- Federal Circuit affirmed 7-4 that tariffs exceed IEEPA authority
- Supreme Court typically affirms lower courts in ~60-65% of cases

**Mixed ruling (20% prior):**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions
- The two types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) have different justifications
- The Court could reasonably uphold one while striking down the other

**Other ruling (5% prior):**
- Procedural dismissals are rare in high-profile cases granted expedited review
- The Court has already consolidated the cases and set an expedited schedule

**No 2025 ruling (5% prior):**
- Very unlikely given the expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025
- The Court typically issues decisions within 2-3 months of arguments

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other "major questions" cases, this involves executive action with significant economic impact
- Like other national security cases, it involves IEEPA and presidential emergency powers
- Like typical Supreme Court cases, it comes after lower court rulings

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariff authority (traditionally Congress's domain)
- Combines two distinct justifications (drug trafficking vs. trade deficits)
- Expedited review suggests the Court views this as urgent and important
- The case directly implicates separation of powers and taxation authority

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Lower court rulings against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 (Unlikely to see unanimous lower court rulings against if legally sound)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 (Expected outcome if tariffs exceed authority)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375 (Favors "Tariffs unlawful")

**Evidence 2: Federal Circuit's 7-4 decision**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.4 (A specialized court with expertise in trade law ruled decisively)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.7 (Expected outcome if tariffs exceed authority)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.7 = 0.57 (Favors "Tariffs unlawful")

**Evidence 3: Distinct legal bases for different tariffs**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.8 (This setup creates a natural path for a mixed ruling)
- P(E|Uniform ruling) = 0.5 (Courts could still treat them uniformly)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6 (Favors "Mixed ruling")

**Evidence 4: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.1 (Very unlikely to expedite and then not rule)
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = 0.9 (Expected if Court intends to rule quickly)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (Strongly disfavors "No 2025 ruling")

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the lower court rulings for "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.375 = 0.09375
- Posterior probability: 0.09375/(1 + 0.09375) ≈ 8.6%

Further updating on Federal Circuit's 7-4 decision:
- Prior probability: 8.6%
- Prior odds: 0.086/0.914 = 0.094
- Posterior odds: 0.094 × 0.57 = 0.054
- Posterior probability: 0.054/(1 + 0.054) ≈ 5.1%

For "Mixed ruling," updating on the distinct legal bases:
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 1.6 = 0.4
- Posterior probability: 0.4/(1 + 0.4) ≈ 28.6%

For "No 2025 ruling," updating on expedited schedule:
- Prior probability: 5%
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.11 = 0.0058
- Posterior probability: 0.0058/(1 + 0.0058) ≈ 0.6%

Additional qualitative updates:
- The Major Questions Doctrine strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful" given the Court's recent jurisprudence
- The constitutional assignment of tariff/tax power to Congress further strengthens "Tariffs unlawful"
- The distinction between trafficking tariffs (security) and reciprocal tariffs (economic) increases probability of "Mixed ruling"

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to executive power in national security matters
- The Court's conservative majority might be more sympathetic to Trump's policy goals than recent precedent suggests
- I might be overestimating the likelihood of a mixed ruling if the Court sees a common legal principle across both tariff types

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the tariffs on narrow grounds specific to IEEPA without undermining the Major Questions Doctrine
- The Court might issue a ruling that appears mixed but functionally upholds or strikes down all tariffs
- The Court could surprise with a procedural ruling that avoids the merits entirely

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly increase "Tariffs lawful" to account for potential national security deference
- Slightly decrease "Tariffs unlawful" to account for potential conservative sympathy
- Maintain high probability for "Mixed ruling" given the natural division in the case

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:
- Tariffs lawful: ~10%
- Tariffs unlawful: ~55%
- Mixed ruling: ~30%
- Other ruling: ~4%
- No 2025 ruling: ~1%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 10%
Tariffs unlawful: 55%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes:

1.  **Supreme Court Affirmance Rate:** The Supreme Court affirms the judgment of the lower appellate court in approximately 60-65% of cases. In this scenario, both the Court of International Trade and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled the tariffs unlawful. This base rate suggests a ~65% probability for the "Tariffs unlawful" option.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine Cases:** In recent years, the Supreme Court has increasingly used this doctrine to strike down major executive actions not explicitly authorized by Congress (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*). The executive branch loses these cases roughly 75% of the time. This reference class also strongly supports the "Tariffs unlawful" option.
3.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court shows significant deference to the President in this area, upholding executive action in ~60-70% of cases. This reference class supports the "Tariffs lawful" option.

Synthesizing these, the first two reference classes are more directly applicable. The current Court's composition and jurisprudence favor the Major Questions Doctrine, and the specific power at issue (tariffs as taxes) is a core congressional function, weakening the national security deference argument. Therefore, I will start with a prior that heavily favors the lower courts' view.

*   **P(Tariffs unlawful):** 60%
*   **P(Tariffs lawful):** 15% (reflecting the national security deference argument)
*   **P(Mixed ruling):** 20% (A plausible outcome given the two different types of tariffs)
*   **P(Other ruling):** 3%
*   **P(No 2025 ruling):** 2%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case fits the "Major Questions" framework perfectly: an executive action of vast economic significance based on a novel interpretation of a decades-old statute. It also follows the standard appellate review process, making the affirmance rate relevant.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and national security. This is the government's strongest argument and distinguishes the case from domestic regulatory disputes. However, the use of IEEPA to impose broad tariffs is unprecedented, and tariffs are constitutionally the domain of Congress, making the separation-of-powers conflict particularly sharp. The existence of two distinct tariff justifications (trafficking vs. trade deficits) makes a "Mixed ruling" more plausible than in a typical case challenging a single regulation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate several key pieces of evidence from the background and research report:

*   **Evidence A: Two lower courts, including the specialized Federal Circuit, ruled the tariffs unlawful.**
    *   This evidence is highly likely if the "Tariffs unlawful" option is correct (P(E|H)). It is much less likely if the "Tariffs lawful" option is correct (P(E|~H)). This strongly confirms the prior derived from the affirmance base rate.

*   **Evidence B: The Supreme Court granted review on an expedited schedule for argument in November 2025.**
    *   This makes the "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling" options extremely unlikely. The Court is signaling its intent to resolve the case on the merits and quickly. The likelihood of this evidence, given those two options, is very low. This will cause a significant downward update for those probabilities.

*   **Evidence C (Hypothetical): Oral arguments show skepticism from key conservative justices (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) about the executive's authority, invoking the Major Questions Doctrine and separation of powers.**
    *   This is a very strong piece of evidence. P(E|Tariffs lawful) is very low. If the government were going to win, one would expect these justices to be more receptive to the executive's arguments.
    *   P(E|Tariffs unlawful) is very high. This is precisely the line of questioning expected if the Court intends to strike down the tariffs entirely.
    *   P(E|Mixed ruling) is moderately high. The skepticism could be directed primarily at the weaker "reciprocal tariffs" while leaving the door open for the more traditional national security-based "trafficking tariffs."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Initial Prior:** P(Unlawful) = 60%, P(Mixed) = 20%, P(Lawful) = 15%, P(Other) = 3%, P(No ruling) = 2%.
2.  **Update on Expedited Schedule (Evidence B):** This evidence makes procedural outcomes highly improbable. I will reduce "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling" to 1% each. The freed-up 3% will be redistributed proportionally to the merits-based outcomes.
    *   **Post-Update 1 Probabilities:** P(Unlawful) ≈ 62%, P(Mixed) ≈ 21%, P(Lawful) ≈ 15%, P(Other) = 1%, P(No ruling) = 1%.
3.  **Update on Oral Arguments (Evidence C):** This is the most significant update. The skepticism from the Court's conservative wing is a major blow to the government's case.
    *   **Prior Odds (Lawful vs. Unlawful):** 15 / 62 ≈ 0.24
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence is much more likely under "Unlawful" than "Lawful". Let's estimate the ratio P(E|Lawful)/P(E|Unlawful) as low, perhaps 0.1.
    *   **Posterior Odds (Lawful vs. Unlawful):** 0.24 * 0.1 = 0.024. This implies the probability of "Lawful" is now minuscule compared to "Unlawful".
    *   This evidence also makes "Mixed" more likely relative to "Lawful", but less decisive when compared to "Unlawful". It pushes significant probability mass away from "Lawful" and towards both "Unlawful" and "Mixed".
    *   After this update, "Lawful" should be reduced to a small tail risk (e.g., 2-3%). The remaining probability should be distributed between "Unlawful" and "Mixed".

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My initial update points toward a very high probability for "Tariffs unlawful" (approaching 80%). Is this overconfident? The primary risk is underestimating the Court's willingness to create a national security exception to the Major Questions Doctrine. A "Mixed ruling" is a very elegant judicial solution: it allows the Court to rein in the most expansive claim of executive power (the reciprocal tariffs on trade deficits) while still showing deference on the more traditional national security claim (the trafficking tariffs). This "split the baby" approach is a common feature of difficult Supreme Court cases. Therefore, I believe the probability for "Mixed ruling" should be higher than my initial update suggests. I will adjust by shifting probability from the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome to the "Mixed ruling" outcome to reflect this as a major alternative scenario.

### 6. Final Normalization

After red teaming, I will re-allocate the probabilities to better reflect the significant chance of a compromise ruling.

*   **Tariffs unlawful (65%):** This remains the most likely outcome. The legal arguments against both sets of tariffs, grounded in the Major Questions Doctrine and Congress's explicit power to tax, are very strong for this Court.
*   **Mixed ruling (31%):** This is the most plausible alternative. The Court could easily distinguish between the trafficking tariffs (plausible national security link) and the reciprocal tariffs (purely economic policy), striking down the latter while upholding the former.
*   **Tariffs lawful (2%):** This is a tail risk. It would require the Court to grant extreme deference to the President's emergency powers, setting aside its recent skepticism of executive overreach, which seems unlikely.
*   **No 2025 ruling (1%):** Extremely unlikely given the expedited schedule and the date of December 5th.
*   **Other ruling (1%):** Also extremely unlikely. The Court took the case to decide it on the merits.

The probabilities sum to 100%.

Tariffs lawful: 2%
Tariffs unlawful: 65%
Mixed ruling: 31%
Other ruling: 1%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
