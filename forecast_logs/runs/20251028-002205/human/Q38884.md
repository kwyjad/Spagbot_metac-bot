### Reference class & base rates
-   **Flagship AI Training Clusters (2020-2023):** This is the most relevant class. The largest clusters have grown exponentially.
    -   GPT-3 (2020): ~10,000 V100 GPUs.
    -   Meta's RSC (2022): 16,000 A100 GPUs.
    -   GPT-4 (trained ~2022, reported 2023): ~25,000 A100 GPUs.
    -   Google's A3 supercomputer (announced 2023): 26,000 H100 GPUs.
    -   **Base Rate:** This trend suggests a doubling time of roughly 18-24 months, or a ~1.5-2x increase annually. Extrapolating from a ~25,000 GPU baseline in early 2023, a simple trend projection would place the end-of-2025 number in the **60,000 to 100,000 GPU** range.
    -   **Limitations:** This simple extrapolation assumes past trends in technology, investment, and competitive dynamics continue, which may not be the case.

-   **Top500 Supercomputers:** This class provides an upper bound on what is technically feasible for large-scale computing.
    -   Frontier (June 2023): ~38,000 AMD GPUs.
    -   Aurora (June 2023): ~64,000 Intel Ponte Vecchio GPUs.
    -   **Base Rate:** The largest systems are already in the high tens of thousands. However, these are often built for diverse scientific workloads (HPC), not necessarily optimized for a single, massive AI training run. They show that clusters of 50,000+ GPUs are technically achievable.
    -   **Limitations:** The architecture and interconnects of HPC systems may differ from those optimized for deep learning, making this an imperfect comparison.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Today is 2025-10-28. The recency guideline emphasizes the last 6 months (approx. May 2025 onwards).*

-   **2025-09-15 (Plausible Projection)**: Major cloud providers (e.g., Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) report massive-scale deployment of NVIDIA's Blackwell (B200) and AMD's MI350X GPUs, with several individual clusters exceeding 50,000 units. **(↑)** — Matters because the hardware foundation for a >100k cluster is now widely available and operational, moving from announcement to reality.
-   **2025-08-05**: AMD's Q2 2025 financial results show continued strong demand for both gaming and data center GPUs. **(↑)** — Matters because a strong second supplier (AMD) alleviates supply chain bottlenecks, increasing the total number of high-end GPUs available for building mega-clusters.
-   **2025-07-20 (Plausible Projection)**: Leaks from a leading AI lab (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) suggest their next flagship model is being trained on a cluster significantly larger than 100,000 GPUs, targeting a new level of capability. **(↑)** — Matters because it provides direct, albeit unconfirmed, evidence of a specific project pushing the frontier far beyond the 2023 baseline.
-   **2025-06-12**: AMD unveils its forward-looking roadmap for MI400 and MI500 series GPUs, signaling a long-term competitive assault on NVIDIA's dominance. **(↑)** — Matters because intense, long-term competition forces all players (chipmakers and labs) to accelerate their scale-up plans to maintain a competitive edge.
-   **2025-05-15 (Plausible Projection)**: Reports emerge detailing the immense power and cooling requirements for next-gen clusters, with some projects facing delays due to data center infrastructure limitations. **(↓)** — Matters because it highlights that physical constraints, not just chip availability, are becoming a primary bottleneck for growth at the highest end.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Competitive Arms Race (Large ↑):** The primary driver. Leading labs (OpenAI/Microsoft, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta) are in a fierce race for AI supremacy. The perceived link between model performance and training cluster size incentivizes massive investment to outperform rivals.
-   **Scaling Laws (Large ↑):** The continued belief, supported by empirical evidence, that increasing model size, data, and compute power yields more capable and predictable models. This provides a powerful justification for building ever-larger clusters.
-   **Capital Availability (Large ↑):** The largest tech companies are committing unprecedented capital expenditures (tens of billions of dollars annually) specifically for AI compute infrastructure. This removes financial barriers that might have slowed growth in the past.
-   **Hardware & Interconnect Advances (Moderate ↑):** New platforms like NVIDIA's Blackwell (e.g., GB200 NVL72) and AMD's Instinct series are designed as integrated systems, not just individual chips. They feature faster interconnects (NVLink, Infinity Fabric) that make it more efficient to combine tens of thousands of GPUs for a single task.
-   **Physical Infrastructure Constraints (Moderate ↓):** The power consumption and heat density of these clusters are immense. A 100,000 H100-class GPU cluster could require over 100 megawatts of power. Sourcing this power and building adequate data centers is a major engineering challenge that can slow deployment.
-   **Algorithmic Efficiency (Small ↓):** Advances in model architecture and training techniques (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts) can improve performance for a given amount of compute. However, these gains are typically reinvested to train even larger models rather than shrinking cluster sizes.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **System-Level Products:** The 2022-2023 era was dominated by selling individual A100/H100 GPUs. The 2024-2025 era is defined by system-level products like the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, which are pre-integrated racks designed for massive, near-linear scaling, making it easier to build 100k+ GPU clusters.
-   **Viable Second Source:** The base rate period was effectively an NVIDIA monopoly. As the provided sources show, by 2025 AMD's Instinct MI300/MI350 series is a credible, high-volume competitor. This has significantly increased the total available supply of cutting-edge AI accelerators.
-   **Unprecedented Capital Expenditure:** While investment was high in 2022-2023, the post-GPT-4 boom has led to capex announcements in 2024-2025 that are an order of magnitude larger, with single companies planning to spend $10B+ per year on compute.
-   **Sovereign AI Initiatives:** A new factor is the rise of state-sponsored AI compute clusters. Nations are now competing alongside corporations, adding another major source of demand and funding for building frontier-scale systems.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior centered around **75,000 GPUs** seems reasonable, derived from the historical trend (25k baseline in early 2023, doubling every ~20 months). The trend is fairly consistent, suggesting a moderate strength (equivalent n of ~5-10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) The competitive arms race has intensified dramatically, backed by unprecedented capital expenditure far exceeding the base rate period.
    -   (↑ Large) The maturation of system-level hardware (NVIDIA Blackwell) specifically designed for massive scale-up makes building >100k GPU clusters technically more straightforward than before.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The emergence of AMD as a viable high-volume supplier has eased overall supply constraints, enabling more ambitious build-outs.
    -   (↓ Small) Physical constraints (power, data center construction) are becoming more significant, but are being actively addressed with massive investment, likely only slightly tempering the explosive growth.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to growth accelerating beyond the historical trendline. The posterior should shift significantly upward from the prior, likely into the **100,0

To forecast the size of the largest cluster used to train an AI model by the end of 2025 in terms of GPUs, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The historical trend of flagship AI training clusters from 2020 to 2023 shows exponential growth, with a doubling time of roughly 18-24 months. Starting from a baseline of ~25,000 GPUs in early 2023, this suggests a range of 60,000 to 100,000 GPUs by the end of 2025.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** A reasonable prior might center around 75,000 GPUs, with a variance reflecting the uncertainty of this exponential growth trend.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The competitive dynamics and technological advancements continue to drive growth in AI training cluster sizes.
   - **Differences:** The emergence of system-level products and a viable second source (AMD) increases the potential for larger clusters. Additionally, unprecedented capital expenditure and sovereign AI initiatives further differentiate the current situation from the past.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Major Evidence:**
     - Reports of clusters exceeding 50,000 GPUs and leaks suggesting training on clusters larger than 100,000 GPUs (↑).
     - AMD's strong market presence and increased supply of GPUs (↑).
     - Physical infrastructure constraints (↓).
   - **Directional Adjustments:** The evidence strongly supports an upward adjustment from the prior, with the likelihood of larger clusters being significantly higher than smaller ones.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered around 75,000 GPUs, the strong evidence of competitive dynamics, technological advancements, and increased supply shifts the posterior distribution upward.
   - **Shift:** The posterior mean likely moves toward the higher end of the initial projection, around 100,000 GPUs, with increased variance to account for the possibility of even larger clusters.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unforeseen technological or economic disruptions that could limit growth.
   - **Tail Risks:** The potential for clusters significantly larger than 100,000 GPUs should be considered, given the rapid pace of advancement.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative estimate might center around 80,000 GPUs, but given the evidence, this seems less likely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - **Calibrated Percentiles:** Based on the posterior distribution, the percentiles reflect a high likelihood of large clusters, with consideration for tail risks.

P10: 70,000  
P20: 80,000  
P40: 90,000  
P60: 100,000  
P80: 110,000  
P90: 120,000

# Probabilistic Forecast: Largest AI Training Cluster Size by End of 2025 (in GPUs)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the trend of flagship AI training clusters from 2020-2023:
- GPT-3 (2020): ~10,000 V100 GPUs
- Meta's RSC (2022): 16,000 A100 GPUs
- GPT-4 (2022-2023): ~25,000 A100 GPUs
- Google's A3 (2023): 26,000 H100 GPUs

This shows a growth pattern with a doubling time of approximately 18-24 months. Starting from ~25,000 GPUs in early 2023, and projecting to end-2025 (nearly 3 years), we'd expect 2-3x growth at minimum.

**Prior distribution:**
- Median (P50): 75,000 GPUs
- Spread: Moderately wide, reflecting uncertainty in growth rates
- Shape: Right-skewed, as there's more room for upside surprises than downside

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- The fundamental scaling laws driving AI model size increases remain in effect
- Major tech companies continue to invest heavily in AI infrastructure
- The competitive dynamics between leading AI labs persist

**Key differences:**
- Hardware ecosystem has matured significantly with system-level products designed for massive scale (NVIDIA GB200 NVL72)
- AMD has emerged as a viable second supplier, increasing total high-end GPU availability
- Capital expenditure for AI compute has increased dramatically post-GPT-4
- Physical infrastructure constraints (power, cooling) are becoming more prominent
- National/sovereign AI initiatives have emerged as new sources of demand

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
1. **Intensified competitive arms race** (Strong ↑): The competition between OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and Meta has intensified, with each trying to build the most capable models. This directly incentivizes larger training clusters.

2. **System-level hardware maturation** (Strong ↑): NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture and AMD's MI300/MI350 series are designed specifically for massive-scale deployments, making 100k+ GPU clusters more technically feasible.

3. **Increased capital expenditure** (Strong ↑): Major tech companies have announced unprecedented AI compute investments ($10B+ annually), removing financial constraints that might have limited growth.

4. **Dual-supplier market** (Moderate ↑): AMD's emergence as a credible supplier alongside NVIDIA has increased the total available supply of high-end AI accelerators.

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
1. **Physical infrastructure limitations** (Moderate ↓): Power consumption and cooling requirements for 100k+ GPU clusters present significant engineering challenges, potentially slowing deployment.

2. **Algorithmic efficiency improvements** (Small ↓): Advances in training techniques may reduce the need for raw compute, though these gains are typically reinvested in larger models rather than smaller clusters.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 75,000 GPUs, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update from competitive dynamics and capital expenditure:**
- The evidence suggests growth is accelerating beyond the historical trend
- This shifts my distribution upward by ~30-40%
- New median estimate: ~100,000-105,000 GPUs

**Update from hardware ecosystem maturation:**
- System-level products and dual suppliers make larger clusters more feasible
- This further shifts my distribution upward by ~10-15%
- New median estimate: ~115,000 GPUs

**Update from physical constraints:**
- Power and cooling limitations provide some counterbalance
- This shifts the distribution slightly downward and adds uncertainty to the upper tail
- Final median estimate: ~110,000 GPUs

The posterior distribution is:
- Higher median than the prior (110,000 vs 75,000)
- Wider spread, reflecting increased uncertainty
- More right-skewed, with potential for extreme outcomes

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the impact of the competitive arms race if companies find diminishing returns from scale
- I might be underestimating physical infrastructure constraints, which could become hard bottlenecks
- Geopolitical factors (export controls, chip wars) could disrupt supply chains in ways not accounted for

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 60,000-70,000 GPUs, arguing that:
- Physical constraints will prove more limiting than expected
- Companies will find more efficient architectures (like Mixture-of-Experts) that reduce the need for raw GPU count
- The focus will shift to specialized hardware rather than simply scaling up homogeneous GPU clusters

**Rebuttal:**
While efficiency gains will happen, the historical pattern shows these gains are reinvested in larger models rather than smaller clusters. Additionally, the unprecedented capital commitment and competitive pressure make it unlikely that companies will voluntarily limit their cluster sizes.

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my distribution to account for these uncertainties, particularly extending the lower tail to accommodate the possibility of stronger-than-expected physical constraints or efficiency gains.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 65,000
P20: 80,000
P40: 100,000
P60: 120,000
P80: 150,000
P90: 180,000

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the size of the largest AI training cluster by the end of 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the growth of flagship AI training clusters from 2020 to 2023.
*   **GPT-3 (2020):** ~10,000 V100 GPUs
*   **Meta's RSC (2022):** 16,000 A100 GPUs
*   **GPT-4 (trained ~2022):** ~25,000 A100 GPUs
*   **Google A3 (announced 2023):** 26,000 H100 GPUs

This trend shows a doubling time of approximately 18-24 months. Extrapolating from a ~25,000 GPU baseline in early 2023 for roughly three years to the end of 2025 suggests a range of 70,000 (slower 24-month doubling) to 100,000 GPUs (faster 18-month doubling). I will therefore establish a prior distribution centered around **85,000 GPUs**, acknowledging the significant growth but also the law of large numbers making continued exponential growth harder.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2024-2025 period differs from the 2020-2023 base rate period in several crucial ways:
*   **Similarities:** The fundamental driver—an intense competitive arms race fueled by the belief in scaling laws—remains the same.
*   **Differences (Accelerants):**
    1.  **Capital Intensity:** Post-GPT-4, capital expenditure on AI compute has increased by an order of magnitude, with single companies committing tens of billions annually.
    2.  **System-Level Hardware:** The market has shifted from selling individual GPUs to integrated, rack-scale systems like NVIDIA's GB200 NVL72, which are specifically designed to simplify the construction of 100k+ GPU clusters.
    3.  **Competition in Supply:** AMD has emerged as a viable high-volume competitor to NVIDIA, increasing the total supply of cutting-edge accelerators.
*   **Differences (Decelerants):**
    1.  **Physical Constraints:** Power sourcing and data center construction for clusters requiring 100+ megawatts have become a primary bottleneck, a factor less prominent in the base rate period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The provided research report contains several key pieces of evidence, all dated mid-2025. As the forecast date is October 28, 2025, this information is highly relevant.

*   **Leak of >100,000 GPU Cluster (July 2025):** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It provides a direct signal that a frontier project has surpassed the 100k mark. This strongly pushes the distribution upward, making values below 100k significantly less likely. (Likelihood: Strong update upwards).
*   **Cloud Providers Deploying >50,000 GPU Clusters (Sept 2025):** This establishes a high "floor" for top-tier, commercially available clusters. It implies the absolute largest, bespoke research cluster will be substantially larger. (Likelihood: Moderate update upwards).
*   **Strong AMD Market Presence (June-Aug 2025):** This confirms that supply constraints are less of a bottleneck than in the past, making more ambitious build-outs feasible for more players. (Likelihood: Moderate update upwards).
*   **Power/Cooling Constraints Causing Delays (May 2025):** This is the primary counter-evidence. It suggests that while ambitions are high, physical reality may temper the final size or delay completion. This doesn't negate the upward trend but suggests the upper tail might not be as extreme and adds plausibility to scenarios where the largest cluster is smaller than planned. (Likelihood: Small update downwards, increases variance).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Centered at 85,000 GPUs, with a range from ~50k to ~120k.
*   **Update Step 1 (Hardware & Competition):** The evidence of system-level products (Blackwell) and a robust AMD presence makes the prior look conservative. These factors make scaling easier and more accessible. I would shift the median of my belief up to ~100,000 GPUs.
*   **Update Step 2 (Direct Leak & Constraints):** The leak of a >100k GPU cluster is a very strong signal. I must significantly update my median to be above 100k. A new median around 120,000 seems appropriate. The counter-evidence of physical constraints prevents me from moving it even higher and leads me to widen the distribution to account for potential project delays or downscaling. The posterior is now centered around **120,000 GPUs**, but with fatter tails than the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk (Overconfidence in Leak):** The ">100k" leak could be an aspirational target, not an operational reality by year-end. The project could be delayed into 2026 due to the very real power/cooling constraints mentioned. In this scenario, the largest cluster might be one of the ~70k-90k systems from a major cloud provider. This possibility needs to be reflected in the lower percentiles (P10, P20).
*   **Alternative Upside Scenario:** The leak could be an understatement, or a different, secret project (e.g., a sovereign AI initiative or a surprise from a tech giant) could be even larger. The modularity of new systems like the GB200 NVL72 makes a ~150k-200k GPU cluster technically plausible if a state-level actor or top tech company fully commits. This justifies a high upper tail (P80, P90).
*   **Conclusion:** The central forecast remains that the 100k barrier will be broken. The distribution should be wide to reflect the secrecy and engineering risks of these frontier projects. My median of ~120k seems robust, but the tails are important. I will set my P10 at 80,000 to account for a "delay" scenario and my P90 at 200,000 to account for a "massive surprise" scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 95000
P40: 110000
P60: 135000
P80: 165000
