### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Virginia Gubernatorial Elections vs. Presidential Party (1977-2021):** This is the most specific and powerful reference class for the Virginia race. In the 12 elections held since 1977, the party not holding the White House has won the Virginia governorship 11 times. The only exception was in 2013 (Terry McAuliffe, D).
    *   **Base Rate (GOP win in VA):** ~92% (11/12).
    *   **Reasoning:** Virginia's off-year gubernatorial election often serves as the first major referendum on the sitting U.S. President, leading to a backlash vote.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a small sample size (n=12). State and national demographics and political alignments have shifted significantly over this period.

2.  **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (Post-2000):** New Jersey is a reliably blue state in federal elections, but its gubernatorial politics are more competitive. Since 2001, there have been six elections.
    *   **Base Rate (Dem win in NJ):** ~67% (4/6). Democrats won in 2001, 2005, 2017, and 2021. Republicans won in 2009 and 2013 (both Chris Christie).
    *   **Reasoning:** This reflects the state's general Democratic lean while acknowledging its willingness to elect Republican governors, often in response to state-level issues or national political headwinds for Democrats.
    *   **Limitations:** A small sample size (n=6) that spans different political eras.

3.  **Modern Off-Year Gubernatorial Elections in "Lean/Likely D" States:** This class includes recent (post-2010) VA and NJ elections. It captures the modern polarized environment where state results are heavily influenced by national trends.
    *   **Base Rate (Dem win):** Highly variable, but generally, the out-of-power party at the national level has a significant advantage. In the 2021 VA/NJ cycle, with a Democratic president, the GOP flipped VA and came within 3 points of flipping NJ. This suggests a strong headwind for the party in the White House.
    *   **Reasoning:** These elections are low-turnout affairs where the opposition party's base is often more motivated.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-30** Spanberger (D) leads Earle-Sears (R) by 10 points (51-41%) in Roanoke College poll. — ↑ (Both/Only VA) — A double-digit lead this close to an election is a very strong signal, suggesting Spanberger is massively outperforming the historical base rate for her party in Virginia.
*   **2025-10-28** Monmouth University poll shows Sherrill (D) leading Ciattarelli (R) by 6 points (50-44%) in New Jersey. — ↑ (Both/Only NJ) — A solid, though not insurmountable, lead for the Democrat in a state that saw a surprisingly close race in 2021. Suggests a less dramatic but still clear Democratic advantage.
*   **2025-10-20** Final campaign finance reports show both Democratic candidates with a significant cash-on-hand advantage for the final two weeks. — ↑ (Both) — Financial superiority allows for a final advertising blitz and robust get-out-the-vote (GOTV) operations, which are crucial in lower-turnout off-year elections.
*   **2025-09-15** National generic ballot polling averages show a neutral environment (D+1), an improvement for Democrats from earlier in the year. — ↑ (Both) — The national political environment, a key driver, appears less hostile to the President's party than in the 2021 cycle, softening a major headwind for both candidates.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **National Political Environment (Presidential Approval):** The single most important driver in these off-year elections. Low presidential approval creates a strong headwind for the President's party. (Large)
2.  **Candidate Quality and Ideological Fit:** How candidates are perceived by swing voters. Spanberger's profile as a moderate former CIA officer in a purple state and Sherrill's as a former federal prosecutor in a suburban district are assets. Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 shows he is a strong campaigner for New Jersey. (Moderate to Large)
3.  **State-Specific Partisan Lean:** The underlying political geography of each state. New Jersey's deep blue tint provides a significant structural advantage for Sherrill, while Virginia's purple-to-light-blue status makes it a perpetual battleground. (Large)
4.  **Differential Turnout:** The party base that is more energized and turns out at a higher rate has a massive advantage. This is often linked to the national environment but can also be influenced by candidate appeal and campaign ground games. (Moderate)
5.  **Key Issues (e.g., Abortion, Economy):** The salience of specific issues can alter outcomes. If issues where Democrats have an advantage (e.g., abortion rights) are top-of-mind for voters, it can counteract the negative effects of the national environment. (Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Virginia's Polling vs. History:** The primary anomaly is the strong and consistent polling lead for Democrat Abigail Spanberger, which is in direct and stark opposition to the powerful historical trend of the President's party losing the Virginia governorship.
*   **Candidate Profiles in Virginia:** Unlike a generic Democrat, Spanberger has a well-established brand as a moderate who has won tough races in swing districts. Conversely, Earle-Sears, while the incumbent LG, may be perceived as more conservative than the 2021 GOP nominee, Glenn Youngkin, potentially limiting her appeal to suburban swing voters.
*   **New Jersey's Repeat Challenger:** It is somewhat unusual for a candidate (Jack Ciattarelli) to be the nominee again immediately after a loss. This gives him high name recognition but also may limit his ceiling, as he is already a known and previously rejected quantity for a majority of voters.
*   **Post-Roe Electoral Environment:** These are the first gubernatorial elections in these states since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This has consistently provided a boost to Democratic candidates, especially in suburban areas, and may be scrambling the traditional "backlash" model of off-year elections.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A strong prior favoring the "Only New Jersey" outcome, derived from the combination of VA's ~92% base rate for a GOP win and NJ's ~67% base rate for a Dem win. The "equivalent n" for the VA prior is high (~12), while the NJ prior is weaker (~6).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The 10-point polling lead for Spanberger in VA is powerful evidence that should cause a massive update away from the historical prior.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** The consistent mid-single-digit polling lead for Sherrill in NJ reinforces the base rate expectation of a Democratic win there.
    *   **↓ Small/Moderate:** The national environment (assuming a Democratic president with mediocre approval) still provides a headwind, tempering the update from polling alone.
    *   **↑ Small/Moderate:** The post-Roe issue environment and strong Democratic candidate profiles provide a plausible mechanism for why the historical base rates might not hold.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the historical model for Virginia is broken in this specific instance. The posterior probability should shift dramatically away from "Only New Jersey" and "Neither" and strongly towards "Both elections." The update for the Virginia outcome is much larger in magnitude than for the New Jersey outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Both" or "Only VA/NJ"):**
    *   Final polling averages from high-quality pollsters (e.g., Marist, Siena, Fox News) confirming Democratic leads in both states.
    *   Reports of high early voting turnout in Democratic-leaning areas (e.g., Northern Virginia, North Jersey suburbs).
    *   A late-breaking national event that improves the Democratic president's approval rating.
    *   A significant gaffe or scandal involving either Republican candidate.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "Neither" or "Only VA/NJ"):**
    *   Final polls showing the races tightening to within the margin of error, especially in Virginia.
    *   Public reporting of GOP internal polling showing a closer race than public polls suggest.
    *   A national crisis or economic downturn that sours the mood on the incumbent party.
    *   Lower-than-expected

To forecast the outcome of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections for the Democrats, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections**: Historically, the likelihood of Democrats winning both elections is relatively low due to Virginia's tendency to elect a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President. However, given the current polling, we need to adjust this base rate upwards.
- **Only Virginia**: The historical base rate for a Republican win in Virginia is ~92% due to the state's tendency to elect a governor from the opposite party of the sitting President. However, current polling shows a strong lead for the Democrat, Abigail Spanberger.
- **Only New Jersey**: New Jersey has a base rate of ~67% for a Democratic win, reflecting its general Democratic lean.
- **Neither election**: This scenario is less likely given the current polling data favoring Democrats in both states.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia**: The current situation differs from the historical base case due to Spanberger's strong polling lead and her moderate profile, which may appeal to swing voters.
- **New Jersey**: The situation aligns more closely with the base case, with Sherrill leading in the polls, although Ciattarelli's previous near-win suggests a competitive race.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia Polling**: Spanberger's 10-point lead is strong evidence against the historical trend, suggesting a high likelihood of a Democratic win.
- **New Jersey Polling**: Sherrill's 6-point lead supports the base rate expectation of a Democratic win.
- **Campaign Finance**: Both Democratic candidates have a financial advantage, increasing the likelihood of effective GOTV efforts.
- **National Environment**: A neutral national environment (D+1) reduces the typical headwind for the President's party.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia**: The strong polling lead for Spanberger significantly shifts the probability towards a Democratic win, despite the historical base rate favoring Republicans.
- **New Jersey**: The polling lead for Sherrill aligns with the base rate, reinforcing the expectation of a Democratic win.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: The strong polling leads could be overestimated if there are systematic polling errors or late shifts in voter sentiment.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A late-breaking national event or scandal could alter the dynamics, but current indicators favor Democrats.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to approximately 100%, considering the evidence and potential uncertainties.

### 7. Output Format

Based on the analysis, the probabilities for each option are:

Both elections: 60%  
Only Virginia: 10%  
Only New Jersey: 25%  
Neither election: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the strong polling leads for Democrats in both states, with adjustments for historical trends and potential uncertainties.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia Gubernatorial Elections:**
- Historical pattern: In 11 out of 12 elections since 1977, Virginia has elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting president.
- With a Democratic president in 2025, this gives Republicans a prior probability of ~92% (11/12).
- Prior for Democratic win in Virginia: ~8%

**New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections:**
- Since 2001, Democrats have won 4 out of 6 gubernatorial elections (67%).
- New Jersey is generally considered a reliably blue state, though it has elected Republican governors (Chris Christie twice).
- Prior for Democratic win in New Jersey: ~67%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Rate:**
- Both are off-year elections where turnout is typically lower.
- The party holding the White House often faces a disadvantage in these elections.
- New Jersey remains a Democratic-leaning state at the federal level.

**Differences from Base Rate:**
- Virginia: Abigail Spanberger has a significant 10-point lead (51-41%) in recent polling, which is unusual given the historical pattern.
- New Jersey: Mikie Sherrill has a 6-point lead (50-44%), which is stronger than Phil Murphy's narrow victory margin in 2021.
- Both Democratic candidates have strong moderate profiles that may appeal to swing voters.
- The post-Roe v. Wade political environment has generally benefited Democrats in recent elections.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia Evidence:**
- Spanberger's 10-point polling lead: This would be very unlikely (P(E|H) is low) if the historical pattern held true, but much more likely (P(E|~H) is high) if Democrats were to win.
- Spanberger's profile as a moderate former CIA officer fits well with Virginia's electorate.
- Earle-Sears may be perceived as more conservative than Glenn Youngkin was in 2021.

**New Jersey Evidence:**
- Sherrill's 6-point polling lead: This aligns with expectations of a Democratic win (P(E|H) is high).
- Ciattarelli's previous narrow loss (48%) shows he's a strong candidate, making a Republican win more plausible than typical for New Jersey.
- Democratic candidates have financial advantages in both races.

**National Environment:**
- National generic ballot shows D+1, a neutral environment that's less hostile to Democrats than in 2021.
- This reduces the typical headwind facing the president's party.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia Update:**
- Prior odds for Democratic win: 0.08/(1-0.08) = 0.087
- Likelihood ratio for 10-point polling lead: ~10 (strong evidence against historical pattern)
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 10 = 0.87
- Posterior probability: 0.87/(1+0.87) ≈ 47%
- Additional factors (candidate quality, financial advantage, abortion issue): +13%
- Updated probability for Democratic win in Virginia: ~60%

**New Jersey Update:**
- Prior odds for Democratic win: 0.67/(1-0.67) = 2.03
- Likelihood ratio for 6-point polling lead: ~2 (moderately supporting prior)
- Posterior odds: 2.03 × 2 = 4.06
- Posterior probability: 4.06/(1+4.06) ≈ 80%
- Adjustment for Ciattarelli's strength as a candidate: -5%
- Updated probability for Democratic win in New Jersey: ~75%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- Polling errors: Recent elections have seen polling misses, often underestimating Republican performance.
- Late shifts: Off-year elections can see late movement toward the out-party.
- Turnout uncertainty: Lower-turnout elections are harder to poll accurately.

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- Virginia's historical pattern reasserts itself with a late Republican surge.
- New Jersey's race tightens as it did in 2021, potentially leading to a Republican upset.
- National events in the final days could shift both races.

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce confidence in Virginia Democratic win: -5%
- Reduce confidence in New Jersey Democratic win: -5%

## 6. Final Normalization

**Virginia Democratic Win Probability:** 55%
**New Jersey Democratic Win Probability:** 70%

**Joint Probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 55% × 70% = 38.5%
- Only Virginia (Dem win in VA, GOP win in NJ): 55% × 30% = 16.5%
- Only New Jersey (GOP win in VA, Dem win in NJ): 45% × 70% = 31.5%
- Neither (GOP wins both): 45% × 30% = 13.5%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 39%
Only Virginia: 16%
Only New Jersey: 32%
Neither election: 13%
(sum = 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

First, I will establish a prior probability for a Democratic win in each state, based on historical data.

*   **Virginia:** The most relevant base rate is the strong historical trend where the party not holding the White House wins the Virginia governorship. Since 1977, this has happened in 11 of 12 elections. Assuming a Democrat is president in 2025, this gives a base rate for a Republican win of P(GOP Win VA) ≈ 92%, and thus a prior of **P(Dem Win VA) ≈ 8%**. This is a very strong prior.
*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey is a blue state but has elected Republican governors. Since 2001, Democrats have won 4 of the 6 gubernatorial elections. This provides a prior of **P(Dem Win NJ) ≈ 67%**.

Combining these independent priors, the initial base rates for the four options would be:
*   P(Both) = 0.08 * 0.67 = ~5%
*   P(Only VA) = 0.08 * 0.33 = ~3%
*   P(Only NJ) = 0.92 * 0.67 = ~62%
*   P(Neither) = 0.92 * 0.33 = ~30%
So, my starting point heavily favors the "Only New Jersey" outcome.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from the historical average in several key ways that might weaken the predictive power of the base rates:

*   **Post-Roe Environment:** The overturning of *Roe v. Wade* has consistently boosted Democratic electoral performance since 2022, an effect not present in the historical data. This provides a strong mechanism for Democrats to outperform historical trends.
*   **Candidate Quality:** In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger is presented as a particularly strong Democratic candidate with a moderate profile who has won in swing districts. This may make her more resilient to the national headwinds that drive the historical trend.
*   **National Environment:** The national environment is described as "neutral (D+1)," which is less hostile to the president's party than the environment in 2021, when Republicans won in Virginia and nearly won in New Jersey.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will now evaluate the new evidence, primarily the polling data.

*   **Evidence for Virginia:** A Roanoke College poll shows Spanberger (D) leading by 10 points (51-41).
    *   This is extremely strong evidence. The likelihood of seeing a 10-point Democratic lead if the Democrat is actually going to win is high. The likelihood of seeing such a lead if the Republican is going to win is very low (it would require a massive polling error).
    *   The likelihood ratio P(10-pt lead | Dem win) / P(10-pt lead | GOP win) is very large, strongly favoring a Democratic victory.

*   **Evidence for New Jersey:** A Monmouth University poll shows Sherrill (D) leading by 6 points (50-44).
    *   This is solid evidence that reinforces the base rate. A 6-point lead is consistent with a Democratic win. While a polling error of this size is more plausible than in the Virginia case (and happened in 2021), the evidence still points toward a Democratic victory.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(6-pt lead | Dem win) / P(6-pt lead | GOP win) is moderately large.

*   **Other Evidence:** Both Democratic candidates have a fundraising advantage, which is a positive but less predictive indicator.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

The new evidence, especially the Virginia polling, requires a dramatic update from the priors.

*   **Updating Virginia:** The prior was P(Dem Win VA) ≈ 8%. The evidence (10-point lead) is so strong that it must overwhelm this prior. A candidate with a 10-point lead a week from an election is a very heavy favorite. However, the strength of the historical trend provides a valid reason to be skeptical of the polls (e.g., turnout models might be wrong). I will update the probability of a Democratic win significantly, but not to the ~95% one might expect from polling alone. I estimate the posterior **P(Dem Win VA) ≈ 75%**.

*   **Updating New Jersey:** The prior was P(Dem Win NJ) ≈ 67%. The 6-point lead and other factors reinforce this. The 2021 close race is a reason for caution, but the current environment appears better for Democrats. I update the posterior to **P(Dem Win NJ) ≈ 85%**.

Now, I will combine these updated individual probabilities to get the posteriors for the four options. I will also account for correlation: a national polling error would likely affect both races in the same direction.

*   **P(Both elections):** This is the most likely outcome, where the polls are broadly correct in both states. P(Dem Win VA) * P(Dem Win NJ) = 0.75 * 0.85 = 0.6375. Adjusting for correlation, this becomes the central scenario.
*   **P(Only New Jersey):** This is the "historical trend wins" scenario, where the polls are wrong in Virginia but correct in New Jersey. This is the most plausible failure mode. P(GOP Win VA) * P(Dem Win NJ) = 0.25 * 0.85 = 0.2125.
*   **P(Neither election):** This is the "systematic polling miss" or "GOP wave" scenario, where Republicans outperform expectations in both states. P(GOP Win VA) * P(GOP Win NJ) = 0.25 * 0.15 = 0.0375. This tail risk is likely higher due to correlation.
*   **P(Only Virginia):** This is the least likely scenario, requiring the polls to be correct in the historically challenging state (VA) but wrong in the much bluer state (NJ). P(Dem Win VA) * P(GOP Win NJ) = 0.75 * 0.15 = 0.1125.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My biggest concern is over-reliance on polling that contradicts a powerful historical trend in Virginia. The "Only New Jersey" outcome, where history reasserts itself, is a significant possibility. A systematic polling error that undercounts Republican enthusiasm could also lead to the "Neither" outcome. The correlation between the races means that if one race surprises, the other is more likely to as well. Therefore, I will assign more weight to the "Both" and "Neither" outcomes than a simple independent calculation would suggest, and slightly less to the split outcomes.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updated probabilities and accounting for correlation, I will distribute the 100 points as follows:

*   **Both elections (70%):** This is the modal outcome, supported by strong polling in both states.
*   **Only New Jersey (15%):** This is the most likely alternative, where the powerful Virginia historical trend overcomes the polling, but the Democrat holds on in blue New Jersey.
*   **Neither election (10%):** This represents the tail risk of a significant GOP overperformance or a systematic polling miss across the board.
*   **Only Virginia (5%):** This is the least likely outcome, as it would require a polling miss in the bluer state (NJ) but not in the more competitive one (VA).

These probabilities sum to 100%.

Both elections: 70%
Only New Jersey: 15%
Only Virginia: 5%
Neither election: 10%
