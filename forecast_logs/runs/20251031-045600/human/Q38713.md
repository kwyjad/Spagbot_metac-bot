### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical base rate of the U.S. initiating military attacks against sovereign nations, particularly in Latin America?
    *   What defines a "military attack" for resolution purposes? (e.g., full invasion vs. limited strike).
    *   What are the primary drivers and constraints for U.S. military action against Venezuela in the current (hypothetical 2025) context?
    *   How does the current situation, specifically a second Trump administration and the described escalations, differ from previous periods of high tension (e.g., 2019-2020)?
    *   What are the most reliable leading indicators of imminent U.S. military action?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `List of United States military interventions post-Cold War`
    *   `US military operations in Latin America since 1990`
    *   `Casus belli for US invasion of Panama 1989`
    *   `US military action against Libya 2011 rationale`
    *   `Trump administration foreign policy Venezuela first term`
    *   `John Bolton "military option" Venezuela`
    *   `US public opinion on military intervention Venezuela`
    *   `Venezuelan military capabilities and readiness`
    *   `International and regional response to potential US-Venezuela conflict`
    *   `Precursors to US military strikes (e.g., embassy evacuations, NOTAMs)`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The base rate for U.S. initiating a significant military attack on a Latin American nation is very low post-Cold War (Panama 1989 being the last major case).
    *   The provided background depicts a rapid and severe escalation in late 2025, far exceeding the tensions of 2019-2020. The deployment of warships and mobilization of militias are critical new developments.
    *   The primary driver is the stated policy and personality of the hypothetical second Trump administration, which has shown a lower barrier to considering military options and is framing the conflict around domestic issues (migration, gangs).
    *   Constraints include the risk of a costly quagmire, a regional refugee crisis, international condemnation (especially from Latin American partners), and potential opposition from within the U.S. military establishment concerned about overstretch.
    *   The current situation is distinct from the base rate due to the specific actors (Trump), the speed of escalation, and the framing of the *casus belli* around non-traditional security threats.

4.  **Drafting the Research Brief:**
    The following brief is structured according to the required format, integrating the synthesized findings to provide a decision-useful analysis for the statistician.

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. Hostile Military Interventions in the Post-Cold War Era (1991-Present):** This class includes major invasions (Iraq), sustained air campaigns (Yugoslavia, Libya), and significant special operations. There have been roughly 5-7 such interventions in ~34 years. This suggests a base rate of ~15-20% for the U.S. initiating a new attack *somewhere* in any given year.
2.  **U.S. Military Attacks on Latin American States (Post-Cold War):** This is a much narrower class. The last major U.S. invasion in the region was Panama in 1989. Since then, direct, overt state-on-state attacks have been virtually non-existent, though covert operations and counter-narcotics support have occurred. This suggests a very low base rate, perhaps **<1% per year**.
3.  **U.S. "Maximum Pressure" Campaigns Against Hostile Regimes:** This class includes cases like Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela (first Trump term), where severe sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and military threats were used but did not escalate to direct military attack. In the last 20 years, there have been at least 3-4 such sustained campaigns, none of which resulted in a U.S.-initiated attack. This suggests a base rate of **near 0%** for this strategy culminating in war.

*Limitations:* The current scenario's unique political leadership and rapid escalation may render historical base rates, particularly from different geopolitical eras, less predictive. The definition of "attack" is broad and could include actions with lower historical barriers than a full-scale invasion.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-03-24** U.S. restarts deportation flights to Venezuela. — ↑ — Signals a breakdown in diplomatic channels and a shift to a more confrontational U.S. policy.
*   **2025-05-XX** U.S. accuses Maduro of supporting criminal gangs targeting the U.S. — ↑ — Establishes a potential *casus belli* linked to U.S. domestic security, a powerful motivator.
*   **2025-06-XX** U.S. imposes significant new sanctions on Venezuela. — ↑ — Indicates the failure of non-military pressure and an exhaustion of economic tools, often a step before military considerations.
*   **2025-07-18** A brief prisoner swap occurs. — ↓ — A momentary de-escalation showing channels for communication and deal-making still exist, though this was quickly reversed.
*   **2025-08-10** U.S. increases reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million. — ↑ (moderate) — Personalizes the conflict and frames Maduro as a criminal, dehumanizing the target and justifying more extreme measures.
*   **2025-08-18** U.S. deploys several warships near the Venezuelan coast. — ↑ (large) — The most significant indicator. It positions military assets for a potential strike, serves as a credible threat, and dramatically shortens the timeline for action.
*   **2025-08-29** Maduro mobilizes 4 million militia members in response. — ↑ — Escalates the situation on the ground, raising the stakes and potentially creating a pretext for U.S. action if U.S. assets are threatened.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **President Trump's Decision-Making Style:** A preference for decisive action, a history of publicly and privately considering the "military option" for Venezuela, and a potential desire for a "rally 'round the flag" effect. (Large impact)
2.  **Domestic Political Framing:** Linking Maduro to migration and cross-border crime (e.g., Tren de Aragua gang) creates a powerful domestic rationale for action that is more compelling to the U.S. public than democracy promotion. (Large impact)
3.  **Perceived Military Mismatch:** The belief that the Venezuelan military is a hollow force, prone to collapse, could lower the perceived cost of an intervention and make a "quick, decisive" operation seem feasible. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Risk of a Quagmire/Regional Instability:** Fear of a protracted conflict, high U.S. casualties, and a massive refugee crisis impacting regional allies (like Colombia, Brazil) is a powerful deterrent for the Pentagon and State Department. (Large impact, opposing)
5.  **International Condemnation:** Strong opposition from Latin American and European allies would increase the diplomatic cost of an attack, though the administration may be willing to bear this cost. (Moderate impact, opposing)
6.  **Trigger Event/Pretext:** An attack on U.S. assets (e.g., a drone, a ship), harm to U.S. citizens in Venezuela, or a manufactured incident could serve as the final justification to overcome internal U.S. government resistance. (Large impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Presidential Volatility:** The key actor (Trump) has a documented history of seriously considering this specific action, unlike other presidents in the reference class who maintained a more ambiguous or defensive posture.
*   **Speed and Nature of Escalation:** The timeline described in the background shows an extremely rapid escalation from sanctions to direct military posturing in a matter of months. This is much faster than the slow-burn pressure campaigns against Iran or North Korea.
*   **Domestic Political Linkage:** The explicit connection being made to U.S. domestic issues (crime, migration) is a more potent and unusual *casus belli* than the democracy/human rights arguments of the past.
*   **Exhaustion of Other Options:** The background implies a rapid cycling through sanctions and diplomatic pressure, leaving the military option as the "last resort" on a much shorter timeline than in other historical cases.
*   **Lack of a Peer Competitor Constraint:** Unlike Cold War scenarios, there is no Soviet Union to deter U.S. action. While Russia and China support Maduro, their ability and willingness to intervene directly is limited, lowering the geopolitical risk calculus for the U.S.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start from a low base rate derived from post-Cold War U.S. attacks in Latin America (<1% per year). This suggests a prior of perhaps **2-3%**, equivalent to observing 1 attack in 30-50 similar high-tension crises that did not escalate to war (high n).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Deployment of warships to the coast. This is a classic and strong signal of both capability and intent.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Framing the conflict around U.S. domestic security (gangs/migration). This significantly increases the political viability of an attack.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Reinstatement of a president who has previously and seriously considered this specific military action.
    *   ↑ (Small): Increased reward for Maduro, new sanctions. These confirm the hostile trendline but are less indicative of *imminent military* action than the naval deployment.
    *   ↓ (Small): The brief prisoner swap in July showed a channel for de-escalation existed, but its reversal negates most of its impact.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is recent, strong, and points overwhelmingly in one direction. The posterior probability should be updated **significantly upward** from the very low prior. The base rate is a poor guide given the extreme and specific circumstances.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Evacuation of non-essential U.S. diplomatic personnel or a travel advisory urging all U.S. citizens to leave Venezuela.
    *   Movement of a carrier strike group or amphibious assault ship into the southern Caribbean.
    *   Establishment of a no-fly zone or increased U.S. air surveillance near/over Venezuela.
    *   A specific, time-bound ultimatum issued by the U.S. to the Maduro regime.
    *   A significant incident (real or alleged) involving U.S. forces or citizens.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Withdrawal of U.S. naval assets from the immediate vicinity of Venezuela.
    *   Announcement of high-level talks or third-party mediation (e.g., by Brazil, Mexico, or Norway).
    *   A significant de-escalatory statement from President Trump or the Secretary of State.
    *   A major domestic or international crisis that diverts U.S. attention and resources.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Attack":** The resolution criteria are broad. A limited cruise missile strike, a special forces raid, or a naval blockade could all qualify, and have a much lower threshold for execution than a full-scale invasion.
*   **Deception and Misinformation:** Both sides have an incentive to use propaganda. Reports of atrocities or attacks on U.S. assets should be treated with extreme skepticism as they could be a manufactured pretext.
*   **"Madman Theory" Risk:** The U.S. administration may be engaging in brinkmanship to force concessions, making the military posturing look more credible than it is. The risk is that this brinkmanship could spiral into an unintended conflict.
*   **Internal U.S. Dissent:** The analysis assumes presidential authority is sufficient. Strong, public opposition from the Joint Chiefs of Staff or key congressional leaders could act as a significant brake on action.
*   **Information Gaps:** Our visibility into the internal decision-making of both the White House and the Miraflores Palace is extremely limited. The outcome could hinge on a handful of conversations we will never know about.

### Final Research Summary
The historical base rate for a U.S. attack on Venezuela is very low, but the current scenario is an acute outlier. The combination of a specific U.S. president, a rapid and severe escalation, and the positioning of military assets warrants a significant upward revision of the probability, as the situation has moved from a chronic pressure campaign to a potential military flashpoint.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for U.S. military attacks on Latin American countries post-Cold War is extremely low, with the last major intervention being Panama in 1989. This suggests a base rate of less than 1% per year for such an event. Given the unique circumstances and escalations described, a slightly higher prior of around 2-3% is reasonable, reflecting the increased tensions and specific political context.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a U.S. administration with a history of considering military options against Venezuela, similar to past periods of tension.
   - Differences: The rapid escalation, deployment of U.S. naval forces, and the framing of the conflict around domestic security issues are significant deviations from past scenarios, suggesting a higher likelihood of military action.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Deployment of warships: Strong indicator of potential military action, significantly increasing the likelihood of an attack (large likelihood ratio).
   - Framing around domestic security: Increases political viability of military action, moderately increasing likelihood (moderate likelihood ratio).
   - Trump's return to power: Increases likelihood due to his past consideration of military options (moderate likelihood ratio).
   - Increased reward for Maduro and new sanctions: Confirm hostile intent but are less indicative of imminent action (small likelihood ratio).
   - Brief prisoner swap: Indicates potential for de-escalation, slightly decreasing likelihood (small likelihood ratio).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 2-3%, the deployment of warships and the framing of the conflict around domestic issues are strong indicators that significantly increase the probability. The likelihood ratios for these pieces of evidence suggest a substantial upward revision.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Assuming a prior probability of 3% (odds of 0.03/0.97), and a combined likelihood ratio from the evidence of approximately 10 (reflecting strong indicators), the posterior odds become 0.03 × 10 = 0.3.
   - Posterior probability = 0.3 / (1 + 0.3) = 0.23 or 23%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast may overestimate the likelihood due to the dramatic nature of recent events. Historical constraints and potential internal opposition within the U.S. government could still prevent military action.
   - Alternative scenario: The U.S. could be using military posturing as a negotiation tactic, with no real intent to attack. This would suggest a lower probability.
   - Adjustments: Considering these factors, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential overestimation and alternative scenarios is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, the final calibrated probability is adjusted to reflect both the increased likelihood due to recent developments and the constraints that still exist.

Final: 20%

# Will the United States attack Venezuela before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the U.S. initiating a military attack against Venezuela before January 1, 2026 (approximately 2 months from now).

The most relevant reference class is U.S. military attacks on Latin American states in the post-Cold War era. As noted in the research brief, the last major U.S. invasion in the region was Panama in 1989. Since then, direct state-on-state attacks have been virtually non-existent in Latin America. This suggests a very low base rate of <1% per year.

Given that we're looking at a specific 2-month window, and considering the historical rarity of such events, I'll start with a prior of approximately 2-3%. This reflects the observation of roughly 1 attack in 30-50 similar high-tension crises that did not escalate to war.

**Prior probability: 3%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Venezuela, like other Latin American nations, is in the U.S. sphere of influence
- There is a history of diplomatic tensions and sanctions
- The U.S. has historically been reluctant to engage in direct military confrontation in Latin America since the end of the Cold War

**Key differences:**
- Presidential leadership: Trump has previously and seriously considered military action against Venezuela specifically
- Rapid escalation: The timeline shows an extremely accelerated escalation from sanctions to direct military posturing in months
- Domestic political framing: The conflict is being linked to U.S. domestic issues (crime, migration) rather than just democracy/human rights
- Military positioning: U.S. warships have already been deployed near the Venezuelan coast
- Exhaustion of non-military options: The U.S. appears to have cycled through sanctions and diplomatic pressure rapidly
- Absence of peer competitor constraint: Unlike during the Cold War, there is no Soviet Union to deter U.S. action

These differences significantly increase the likelihood of military action compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Deployment of U.S. warships near Venezuelan coast (August 18, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the U.S. were planning to attack, positioning warships would be a necessary precursor
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.2) - Warship deployments as pure intimidation without follow-through are less common
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This evidence substantially increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 2: Framing conflict around U.S. domestic security (gangs/migration)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Creating a domestic security justification would be important before an attack
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This framing could also be used for political purposes without military action
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 3: Increased reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Personalizing the conflict helps justify military action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could also be part of a pressure campaign without military intent
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This slightly increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 4: Maduro's mobilization of 4 million militia members**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - This could provide a pretext if U.S. assets are threatened
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - This defensive posture might actually deter U.S. action by raising the cost
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.86
- This slightly decreases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 5: Brief prisoner swap in July followed by reversal**
- P(E|H): Low-moderate (~0.3) - Some diplomatic engagement would still occur before an attack
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - More consistent with ongoing diplomatic pressure
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.43
- This moderately decreases the probability of an attack

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3% (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence.

**Update on Evidence 1 (Warship deployment):**
- Prior odds: 3:97 ≈ 0.031
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 4.5 ≈ 0.14
- Posterior probability: 0.14/(1+0.14) ≈ 12.3%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Domestic security framing):**
- Prior odds: 0.14
- Likelihood ratio: 2
- Posterior odds: 0.14 × 2 ≈ 0.28
- Posterior probability: 0.28/(1+0.28) ≈ 21.9%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Increased reward for Maduro):**
- Prior odds: 0.28
- Likelihood ratio: 1.4
- Posterior odds: 0.28 × 1.4 ≈ 0.39
- Posterior probability: 0.39/(1+0.39) ≈ 28.1%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Militia mobilization):**
- Prior odds: 0.39
- Likelihood ratio: 0.86
- Posterior odds: 0.39 × 0.86 ≈ 0.34
- Posterior probability: 0.34/(1+0.34) ≈ 25.4%

**Update on Evidence 5 (Prisoner swap and reversal):**
- Prior odds: 0.34
- Likelihood ratio: 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.34 × 0.43 ≈ 0.15
- Posterior probability: 0.15/(1+0.15) ≈ 13%

After considering all key evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 13%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the deterrent effect of Venezuela's militia mobilization and potential international backlash
- I might be overweighting the significance of warship deployment, which could be primarily for show
- The timeline is very short (2 months until 2026), which constrains the likelihood of action
- The research brief doesn't mention any concrete attack plans or specific ultimatums, which would typically precede military action

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The U.S. might engage in limited covert operations that don't qualify as an "attack" under the resolution criteria
- The naval deployment could be part of a calculated brinkmanship strategy without actual intent to attack
- Internal U.S. government resistance (Pentagon, State Department) might effectively block military action
- A diplomatic breakthrough could occur, especially if Maduro makes concessions under pressure

**Adjustments:**
Given the very short timeframe (2 months), the absence of specific ultimatums or attack plans, and the potential for internal U.S. government resistance, I should adjust my probability downward somewhat. However, the naval deployment and escalatory rhetoric remain significant factors.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of the United States attacking Venezuela before January 1, 2026 is approximately 10%.

This reflects:
- The historically low base rate of U.S. military attacks in Latin America
- The significant escalation represented by naval deployments
- The domestic political framing that could justify military action
- The very short timeframe remaining (2 months)
- The absence of specific ultimatums or attack plans
- The potential for internal U.S. government resistance

Final: 10%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a U.S. military attack on Venezuela within a very short, specific timeframe (before January 1, 2026, from a hypothetical present of October 31, 2025).

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of "U.S. 'Maximum Pressure' Campaigns Against Hostile Regimes" that escalate into a direct U.S.-initiated military attack. The research report notes that in the last 20 years, there have been several such campaigns (e.g., against Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela itself during the first Trump term), and none have resulted in a direct U.S. attack. This suggests a base rate close to zero.

However, the most relevant, narrower reference class is "Acute military crises involving the U.S. and a Latin American nation." The last major U.S. invasion in the region was Panama in 1989. This indicates that such events are exceptionally rare.

Given these considerations, I will select a low prior probability that acknowledges that while rare, such escalations are not impossible. The research brief's suggestion of a 2-3% chance for a high-tension crisis escalating to war seems appropriate. I will set my prior at **P(H) = 2.5%**. This is equivalent to prior odds of 1-to-39 against an attack.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs significantly from the base case of a typical "maximum pressure" campaign in several critical ways:

*   **Specific Leadership:** The hypothetical scenario involves a second-term President Trump, who has a documented history of seriously considering and advocating for a "military option" against Venezuela. This is a major departure from other U.S. presidents in the reference class.
*   **Domestic Justification:** The conflict is explicitly framed around U.S. domestic security threats (migration and criminal gangs). This provides a more potent and politically resilient *casus belli* for the American public than abstract goals like democracy promotion.
*   **Pace of Escalation:** The timeline depicts an extremely rapid escalation from sanctions to direct military posturing (warship deployment) in a matter of months. This suggests a lower tolerance for a protracted diplomatic standoff and a greater willingness to use force.
*   **Overt Military Action:** The deployment of warships is a concrete, costly, and highly visible step that moves the situation from a political/economic conflict to a military standoff. This is a key feature not present in the same way during most of the Iran or North Korea pressure campaigns.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence as a consolidated package, as the individual pieces are causally linked and their combined effect is most important.

*   **Evidence (E):** The full sequence of events in 2025: a breakdown of diplomacy (deportations), the establishment of a domestic *casus belli* (gangs), the exhaustion of economic tools (new sanctions), the personalization of the conflict (bounty on Maduro), and critically, the deployment of several warships to the Venezuelan coast.

*   **Likelihood if an attack will happen (P(E | H)):** This sequence of events is highly probable if the U.S. were genuinely preparing for a military attack. An administration would need to build a political case, position assets, and exhaust other options to justify military action. This entire package of evidence is a textbook prelude to war. I estimate P(E | H) to be high, perhaps around 0.8.

*   **Likelihood if an attack will NOT happen (P(E | ~H)):** This is the "coercive diplomacy" or "bluff" hypothesis. Could the U.S. administration take all these steps with no intention of attacking? Yes, but it is a very costly and risky strategy. Deploying naval assets is expensive, it raises tensions to a point where accidental escalation is possible, and it puts U.S. credibility on the line. While possible, it is not a probable course of action. I estimate the probability of this entire, very specific sequence of escalatory events occurring without an attack as the intended outcome to be low, perhaps around 0.05.

*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood ratio is P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.8 / 0.05 = 16. This indicates that the observed evidence is approximately 16 times more likely if the U.S. is planning an attack than if it is not. This is a very strong update.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will now update the prior odds using the likelihood ratio calculated above.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1-to-39 (corresponding to P=2.5%)
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** 16
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/39) × 16 = 16/39, or 16-to-39.

To convert these posterior odds back to a probability:
*   **Posterior Probability:** 16 / (16 + 39) = 16 / 55 ≈ 0.2909

This calculation moves the probability from a very low 2.5% to approximately **29%**. This significant update is warranted by the extremity of the evidence presented in the scenario.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 29% is high but remains below 50%. This reflects the powerful constraints and alternative scenarios that could prevent an attack.

*   **Primary Counterargument:** The most plausible alternative is that this is "performative coercion." The goal of the military deployment is not to attack, but to force a major concession from the Maduro regime or to rally domestic political support. The significant risks of a military quagmire, a regional refugee crisis, and opposition from the Pentagon and international allies are powerful deterrents that could still prevent the president from giving the final order. My forecast implies there is a ~71% chance that these constraints hold and an attack is averted.
*   **Definition of "Attack":** The resolution criteria are broad, including limited strikes. A full-scale invasion is much less likely, but a punitive cruise missile strike or a special forces raid has a much lower threshold and could be executed quickly. This breadth is a key reason the probability is not lower.
*   **Accidental Escalation:** The high concentration of military forces creates a risk of miscalculation. An unintended incident could trigger a U.S. response that qualifies as an "attack," even if one was not originally planned. This risk puts upward pressure on the final probability.

Considering these factors, the 29% forecast feels well-calibrated. It acknowledges the extreme danger of the situation described while respecting the powerful structural forces that militate against war.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such an attack is extremely low. However, the specific evidence in this hypothetical scenario—a president with a known predisposition for this action, a powerful domestic justification, and the overt positioning of military assets—is exceptionally strong. This evidence compels a significant update from the prior. While powerful constraints against an attack remain, making it less likely than not, the situation has clearly moved into a high-risk flashpoint where an attack before 2026 is a distinct possibility.

Final: 29%
