### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency under President Noboa (Nov 2023 - Present):** Noboa has shown a high propensity to use this tool. He declared a nationwide (24 provinces) state of emergency in January 2024 for gang violence and the current one (initially 10, now 16 provinces) for protests. This class suggests a bimodal outcome: either 0 provinces or a large number (16-24). The base rate of *any* province being in a state of emergency on a given day in this period is high.
2.  **States of Emergency in Ecuador due to Indigenous-led Protests (2015-2025):** Major protests in 2019 and 2022 also led to states of emergency, but they were often more targeted or of shorter effective duration before being lifted through negotiation. This class suggests a lower base rate of provinces (e.g., 6-12) and a higher chance of resolution before the 60-day limit.
3.  **All States of Emergency in Ecuador (any cause, last 10 years):** This class includes declarations for natural disasters, health crises (COVID-19), and security issues. It shows that while declarations are not uncommon, most days in Ecuador see zero provinces under a state of emergency. When declarations occur, they are significant events. This class suggests the most likely outcome is 0, but with a "fat tail" for a large number of provinces.

*Limitations:* Noboa's presidency is a short and volatile period, making the first reference class small but highly relevant. The underlying security situation in Ecuador has fundamentally changed since 2022, potentially making older reference classes less applicable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-06** State of emergency expanded to 16 provinces. — ↑ — Indicates the government's assessment that the crisis was widening and required a broader security response, signaling a commitment to the measure.
*   **2025-10-05** (approx.) Five arrested for alleged assassination attempt on President Noboa. — ↑ — This event significantly hardens the government's stance, justifies extreme measures, and reduces the political space for negotiation or de-escalation.
*   **2025-10-04** (approx.) Noboa attributes protests to Venezuelan cartel Tren de Aragua. — ↑ — By framing the protests as a foreign-backed criminal issue rather than a domestic political one, the government delegitimizes protesters and justifies a security-first response.
*   **2025-10-04** Initial 60-day state of emergency declared in 10 provinces. — ↑ — The primary event that sets the stage for a potential continuation or renewal of emergency measures.
*   **2025-09-16** State of emergency declared in Carchi and Imbabura. — ↑ — Shows that the government was already using this tool for security reasons even before the major protests, indicating a low threshold for its use.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Government Fiscal Imperative:** The need to cut fuel subsidies is driven by fiscal constraints and likely commitments to international lenders (e.g., IMF). This is a non-negotiable for the government, making it unlikely to concede to the primary demand of protesters. (Large impact)
2.  **Protest Movement's Resilience:** Indigenous organizations like CONAIE have a long history of sustained, disruptive protests that can paralyze the country. Their capacity to maintain pressure is the main trigger for the state of emergency. (Large impact)
3.  **President Noboa's Political Stance:** Noboa's political brand is built on a "tough on crime/disorder" platform. Backing down would be politically costly. His hardline rhetoric suggests a preference for security measures over dialogue. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Constitutional Limits & Court Oversight:** The constitution limits states of emergency to 60 days, with one 30-day renewal possible, subject to Constitutional Court approval. The current 60-day period expires in early December, creating a legal hurdle for continuation. (Moderate impact, acts as a brake)
5.  **Underlying Organized Crime:** The severe, ongoing gang violence crisis provides a parallel justification for states of emergency. A flare-up in gang activity could trigger a new, overlapping declaration, even if protests subside. (Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dual Crises:** Unlike past protest-driven emergencies (e.g., 2019, 2022), this one occurs simultaneously with an unprecedented national security crisis from organized crime. This gives the government a stronger rationale and broader public support for maintaining security measures.
*   **Noboa's Political Capital:** Compared to his predecessors (Lenín Moreno, Guillermo Lasso), who faced protests with low approval ratings, Noboa's popularity has been buoyed by his security agenda. This gives him more leeway to withstand political pressure from protests.
*   **Escalated Rhetoric:** The government's explicit and repeated framing of protesters as terrorists linked to international cartels is a significant departure from past disputes. This strategy is designed to criminalize the protest and makes a negotiated settlement much more difficult.
*   **Proximity to Expiration:** The resolution date (Dec 25) is very close to the expiration of the current 60-day declaration (early Dec). The question is not about long-term stability but specifically about the government's decision to renew, re-declare, or let it lapse in the immediate term.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A bimodal prior seems appropriate, with a significant probability mass at 0 provinces (the historical norm) and another peak in the high range (10-24 provinces), reflecting Noboa's recent actions. An equivalent n of ~10 observations could represent this moderate prior belief.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The intractability of the subsidy issue combined with the resilience of protest movements suggests the underlying conflict will not be resolved by December.
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's consistent hardline stance, security-first approach, and escalatory rhetoric strongly suggest he will favor renewing or re-imposing emergency measures.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The parallel crisis of gang violence provides an alternative, and publicly popular, justification for a state of emergency if the protests wane.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The 60-day constitutional limit is a key friction point. The government cannot simply extend the current declaration indefinitely and will need to justify a renewal or new declaration to the Constitutional Court in early December.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points away from the "0 provinces" mode. The posterior should shift decisively towards a high number of provinces. The constitutional limit introduces a small chance of a temporary lapse, but the drivers of conflict make a renewed or new declaration covering many provinces the most probable outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official statements from the government about the necessity of extending security measures past the early December deadline.
    *   CONAIE or other indigenous groups call for a national strike (`paro nacional`) in late November or December.
    *   A major, unrelated act of gang violence (e.g., a prison riot, assassination of a public official) occurs.
    *   The Constitutional Court approves a government request to renew or extend the state of emergency.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The government and protest leaders agree to a formal, mediated dialogue.
    *   The government announces a compromise on the diesel subsidy cuts (e.g., a phased implementation or compensation for specific sectors).
    *   A sustained period (e.g., >1 week) of calm with no significant roadblocks or protests.
    *   The Constitutional Court rules against an extension of the state of emergency.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Expiry vs. Renewal:** The current state of emergency will expire before Dec 25. The forecast hinges on the government's action to renew it or declare a new one, which is a discrete event that will likely occur in early December.
*   **Definitional Scope:** A state of emergency can be declared in a canton, as with Echeandía. Per the prompt, this appears to count for the entire province (Bolívar). This could lead to a higher count than expected if the government uses more targeted, cantonal declarations.
*   **Holiday Lull:** Protest activity often subsides during the Christmas holiday period. The government might preemptively lift the state of emergency just before Christmas as a goodwill gesture, even if the underlying conflict is unresolved.
*   **Conflation of Causes:** A state of emergency could be in effect on Dec 25, but for a different reason (e.g., a major gang offensive). The outcome would be the same, but the causal pathway would be different from the current situation.
*   **Information Reliability:** News will be highly polarized. Government sources will emphasize violence and criminal links, while opposition sources will focus on state repression. Assessing the true level of instability on the

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the frequency of states of emergency under President Noboa's tenure, given his propensity to declare them. Historically, under Noboa, there have been instances of both nationwide and targeted states of emergency. This suggests a bimodal distribution: one peak at 0 provinces (if no emergency is declared) and another peak at a high number of provinces (16-24) if a state of emergency is declared.
   - Mean/median: Given the bimodal nature, a median might not be representative, but the mean could be around 8-12 provinces, considering the high likelihood of a declaration.
   - Variance: High, due to the bimodal distribution.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation under Noboa is consistent with his past behavior of using states of emergency as a tool for managing crises.
   - Differences: The dual crises of protests and organized crime, along with the constitutional limits on emergency declarations, create a unique situation that might lead to a temporary lapse or a targeted re-declaration.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The government's hardline stance and framing of protests as linked to organized crime increase the likelihood of a high number of provinces being under a state of emergency (↑ Large).
   - The constitutional limit on the duration of states of emergency introduces a potential for a temporary lapse (↓ Moderate).
   - The resilience of the protest movement and the government's fiscal imperatives suggest continued unrest, supporting a high number of provinces under emergency (↑ Large).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Bimodal with peaks at 0 and 16-24 provinces.
   - Evidence overwhelmingly supports the continuation or renewal of emergency measures, shifting the posterior distribution towards the higher mode.
   - The constitutional limit introduces some uncertainty, but the overall evidence suggests a high number of provinces will remain under emergency.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The bimodal nature of the distribution should be respected, and the possibility of a temporary lapse due to constitutional limits should not be ignored.
   - Tail risks: A major unrelated event (e.g., gang violence) could lead to a new declaration, affecting the distribution.
   - Alternative forecast: A temporary lapse followed by a new declaration could result in fewer provinces under emergency on Dec 25. However, given the evidence, this scenario seems less likely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Considering the evidence and potential scenarios, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the high likelihood of a significant number of provinces being under a state of emergency, while accounting for the possibility of a temporary lapse.

# Forecasting the Number of Ecuadorian Provinces Under State of Emergency on Dec 25, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a composite prior based on three reference classes:

1. **States of Emergency under President Noboa (Nov 2023-Present)**: Noboa has declared nationwide (24 provinces) and partial (16 provinces) states of emergency. This suggests a bimodal distribution with peaks at 0 and 16-24 provinces.

2. **Indigenous-led Protest States of Emergency (2015-2025)**: These typically involve 6-12 provinces and often resolve before reaching the 60-day limit through negotiation.

3. **All States of Emergency (last 10 years)**: Most days see 0 provinces under emergency, but when declared, they often cover multiple provinces.

Given these reference classes, my prior distribution has:
- Mean: ~8 provinces
- Median: ~5 provinces
- A bimodal shape with peaks at 0 and ~16-20
- Significant variance (standard deviation of ~9 provinces)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes:**
- The current situation involves indigenous-led protests against subsidy cuts, similar to past protests
- The constitutional 60-day limit applies as in previous cases
- Noboa continues his pattern of using states of emergency as a governance tool

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented dual crisis: protests occurring during severe organized crime problems
- Noboa's rhetoric is exceptionally harsh, framing protesters as terrorists linked to cartels
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa significantly raises stakes
- The December 25 resolution date falls just after the current 60-day declaration expires

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring higher numbers:**
- Noboa's rapid expansion from 10 to 16 provinces suggests willingness to use broad declarations (2x more likely to see high numbers)
- The alleged assassination attempt provides strong justification for continued security measures (3x more likely)
- Framing protests as cartel-linked terrorism makes negotiated resolution less likely (2x more likely)
- Ongoing gang violence provides alternative justification for emergency measures (1.5x more likely)

**Evidence favoring lower numbers:**
- Constitutional 60-day limit creates a procedural hurdle for continuation (1.5x more likely for lower numbers)
- Christmas period typically sees reduced protest activity (1.2x more likely)
- Indigenous movements historically have negotiated resolutions before maximum durations (1.3x more likely)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my bimodal prior centered around 8 provinces but with peaks at 0 and 16-20, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - Assassination attempt and terrorist framing:**
This significantly reduces the probability of 0 provinces and shifts weight toward higher numbers. The posterior mean increases to ~12 provinces, with much less weight on the 0-province outcome.

**Second update - Constitutional limits and timing:**
The 60-day limit creates a procedural moment in early December where the government must justify renewal. This slightly moderates the extreme high-end but doesn't significantly affect the central tendency. The posterior mean remains ~12 provinces.

**Third update - Christmas holiday period:**
The holiday timing slightly increases the chance of a goodwill gesture to temporarily lift some emergency declarations. This creates a small shift downward, with a posterior mean of ~11 provinces.

The posterior distribution is now less bimodal, with most probability mass in the 8-20 province range, a mean of ~11, and a median of ~12.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the government's desire for a "Christmas peace" gesture
- The Constitutional Court could reject renewal requests, which I've given insufficient weight
- I haven't fully accounted for how quickly the situation could change with a negotiated settlement

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would forecast 0 provinces, arguing that:
1. The 60-day limit will expire in early December
2. The government will use Christmas as an opportunity to reset relations
3. The protests will have achieved some concessions by then

**Rebuttal:**
While plausible, this alternative underestimates Noboa's consistent security-first approach and the political capital he's invested in framing protesters as terrorists. The assassination attempt allegation makes backing down particularly difficult.

**Adjustment:**
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these considerations, particularly increasing the probability of both very low (0-3) and very high (20+) outcomes.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 5
P40: 10

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is the frequency and scale of states of emergency during President Daniel Noboa's tenure (November 2023 - present). Unlike previous administrations, Noboa's presidency has been characterized by a dual crisis of unprecedented gang violence and significant political unrest, leading to a much higher propensity to use this measure.

During his first year, Noboa has declared states of emergency covering 24, 7, 2, and now 16 provinces for periods of 60-90 days. This establishes a bimodal prior distribution: on any given day, the number of provinces under a state of emergency is either 0 or a large number (typically 10-24). A simple prior might be a 50% chance of 0 provinces and a 50% chance of a distribution centered around 16 provinces. This reflects that while "no emergency" is a common state, Noboa's government reverts to large-scale declarations when faced with a crisis.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to the Noboa-era base case in that it involves a significant security/disorder challenge met with a large-scale state of emergency.

However, there are crucial differences:
1.  **Nature of the Crisis:** This state of emergency is driven by political protests against economic policy, not primarily by gang violence. This could make a long-term extension harder to justify to the Constitutional Court.
2.  **Timing:** The current 60-day declaration (which began Oct 4-6) is set to expire in early December 2025. The forecast date of December 25 falls *after* this expiration. Therefore, the forecast is not about the continuation of the current declaration, but about the government's decision to renew it or declare a new one.
3.  **Escalated Rhetoric:** The government's framing of protesters as "terrorists" linked to foreign cartels is a significant escalation compared to past protest-related crises. This hardens positions and makes a negotiated de-escalation less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Several pieces of evidence update the prior distribution:

*   **(↑ Strong Upward Pressure) Intractable Core Conflict:** The protests are against fuel subsidy cuts, a measure the government sees as a fiscal necessity. The indigenous groups leading the protests have a history of sustained mobilization. The underlying cause of the conflict is highly unlikely to be resolved by December, making continued unrest and thus a continued justification for emergency measures very likely.
*   **(↑ Strong Upward Pressure) Noboa's Hardline Stance:** The President's political brand is built on a "tough-on-crime" platform. The "terrorist" rhetoric and the highlighting of an alleged assassination attempt lock him into a security-first approach, making it politically costly to back down or let the state of emergency lapse.
*   **(↑ Moderate Upward Pressure) Parallel Gang Crisis:** The ongoing national security crisis with organized crime provides a persistent, publicly supported alternative justification for a state of emergency. If the court were to reject a renewal based on protests, the government could almost immediately declare a new one based on gang activity.
*   **(↓ Moderate Downward Pressure) Constitutional Limits & Holiday Lull:** The constitution requires court approval for a renewal (for 30 days). The court might be hesitant to approve a renewal for a political protest, especially if violence subsides. Furthermore, protest movements often lose momentum over the Christmas holiday period. The government might lift the state of emergency just before Christmas as a political gesture of goodwill.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior was bimodal, with roughly 50% probability mass at 0 and 50% at a high number (e.g., 10-24).

The evidence strongly suggests the drivers for the state of emergency will persist past the early December expiration date. The combination of the intractable conflict, Noboa's political posture, and the backup justification of gang violence makes a renewal or a new declaration highly probable. This evidence significantly reduces the likelihood of the "0 provinces" outcome.

I will update the probability of being at 0 provinces from ~50% down to ~25%. The possibility of the Constitutional Court rejecting a renewal combined with a "Christmas lull" is plausible but is outweighed by the strong drivers of the conflict.

The posterior distribution is therefore a mixture: a 25% chance of 0 provinces, and a 75% chance of a high number. The distribution for the "high number" is centered on the current 16 provinces, but with significant spread, reflecting the possibility of a smaller renewal (e.g., 10-12 provinces) or a nationwide escalation (24 provinces).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast could be wrong if I am underestimating the possibility of de-escalation. The "terrorist" rhetoric could be a negotiating tactic, and a back-channel deal could be reached, as has happened in previous protest crises in Ecuador. A "Christmas truce" where the government lifts the state of emergency as a goodwill gesture is a very real scenario that would lead to a 0 outcome.

Conversely, I might be underestimating the risk of escalation. A significant violent event could trigger a nationwide (24 province) declaration that would be easily approved by the court, pushing the upper end of my forecast higher.

My current distribution, with a 25% chance of 0 and a P90 of 24, attempts to account for both of these tail risks. The central estimate remains that some form of large-scale state of emergency is the most likely outcome due to the powerful underlying drivers of the conflict. I believe the 25% probability assigned to the "0" outcome adequately captures the de-escalation/holiday lull scenario.
