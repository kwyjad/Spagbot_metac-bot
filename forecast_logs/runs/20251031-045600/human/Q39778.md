### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections within a Regional Group:** In cases where more than one country actively bids for a COP presidency within a regional group, the outcome is typically resolved through political negotiation rather than a formal vote. In the last decade, most selections have been by consensus on a single candidate. The most recent contested case (COP29, Eastern European Group) resulted in a deadlock that was only broken by a bilateral political deal between the main opponents (Armenia and Azerbaijan).
    *   **Base Rate:** A named, credible bidder wins ~80% of the time. A compromise/late-entrant candidate wins ~15%. The process fails and defaults to Bonn ~5% of the time. This is a rough estimate based on the high frequency of successful bids vs. the rare but real possibility of deadlock.
2.  **WEOG Bids from non-EU Members:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is diverse. While many COPs have been in the EU, non-EU members also host (e.g., Canada, COP11). There is no formal sub-rotation, but there's an informal pressure for geographic diversity.
    *   **Base Rate:** A bid from a non-EU WEOG member is not inherently disadvantaged and may even be slightly favored if recent hosts have been European. This suggests neither Australia nor Turkey starts at a significant disadvantage based on location alone.
3.  **Bids Featuring "Climate Justice" or Developing Nation Partnerships:** Since the Paris Agreement, bids that emphasize equity and partnership with vulnerable nations have gained narrative power. The UK's COP26 bid highlighted global cooperation, and Egypt's COP27 was framed as an "African COP."
    *   **Base Rate:** This is a relatively new factor, but such bids appear to have a higher success rate than those based purely on logistics or national prestige. This class would favor the Australia/Pacific bid.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-15** Australia's government formally committed significant funding for its COP31 bid and confirmed Adelaide as the proposed host city. — ↑ Australia — Demonstrates serious intent and logistical readiness, moving beyond mere aspiration.
*   **2025-06-28** Turkey's Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change launched a promotional campaign for its COP31 bid at a Mediterranean climate summit. — ↑ Turkey — Shows active diplomacy and efforts to build a regional coalition of support.
*   **2025-08-01** The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) issued a communiqué reiterating its strong support for a "Pacific-hosted" COP, explicitly backing the joint bid with Australia. — ↑ Australia — Solidifies the bid's key narrative strength and demonstrates unified support from crucial partners.
*   **2025-09-18** A report from a prominent European think tank questioned the suitability of both bids, citing Australia's fossil fuel industry and Turkey's democratic backsliding. — ↓ Australia, ↓ Turkey, ↑ Germany — Injects negative narratives for both frontrunners, potentially making the neutral default option in Bonn more attractive to some WEOG members.
*   **2025-10-12** During UN General Assembly side meetings, diplomats from several key EU countries reportedly expressed a preference for a candidate with an unambiguous climate policy record, a subtle critique of both bids. — ↓ Australia, ↓ Turkey, ↑ Germany — Signals potential difficulty in reaching consensus within the powerful EU bloc of WEOG.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Building (Large):** This is the decisive mechanism. The decision requires unanimity. The preferences of the major players (US, UK, Canada, and the EU bloc, particularly Germany and France) are critical. A single influential objector can force a deadlock.
2.  **Narrative and Moral Authority (Moderate):** The Australia/Pacific Islands bid has a powerful, emotionally resonant narrative focused on those most affected by climate change. This plays very well in the UNFCCC context and can create soft power pressure on other nations to support it. Turkey's narrative is less distinct.
3.  **Geopolitical Alignment (Moderate):** Turkey's complex relationships with some EU members and the US could be a liability. While a WEOG member, it is often seen as an outlier. Australia is part of the core Anglosphere alliance (Five Eyes, AUKUS), which could provide a solid foundation of support within WEOG.
4.  **Host Country Climate Credibility (Small to Moderate):** A country's domestic climate policies are a factor. Australia's status as a major fossil fuel exporter is a significant vulnerability. Turkey's climate policies will also face scrutiny. This can be used as a political weapon by opponents but is rarely a dealbreaker if the political will is there.
5.  **Reciprocal Diplomacy (Moderate):** The final decision could be influenced by unrelated deal-making. For example, a country might trade its support for COP31 in exchange for support for its candidate to head another international body. This is how the COP29 deadlock was resolved.
6.  **Risk of Deadlock (Large):** The consensus rule and the presence of two determined bidders make a deadlock a significant possibility. The credibility of Bonn as a default host makes this a viable outcome, unlike in other situations where a default would be a major crisis. This incentivizes both bidders to negotiate but also empowers objectors.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Co-hosting with Vulnerable Nations:** The proposed Australia-Pacific partnership is a novel model for a COP. It directly embeds the "climate justice" narrative into the bid's structure, making it different from a standard single-nation host.
*   **Two Strong Bidders from the WEOG Periphery:** Unlike many past selections, this is not a contest between a core EU country and another member. Both Australia and Turkey are geographically and, to some extent, politically on the edges of the group, creating a unique dynamic.
*   **Significant Credibility Flaws in Both Bids:** Both frontrunners have clear vulnerabilities (Australia's fossil fuels, Turkey's political climate) that are being actively discussed. This is more pronounced than in typical contests, increasing the probability of the "none of the above" (Germany) outcome.
*   **High-Stakes Climate Reputation Repair:** For Australia, the bid is a central part of its post-2022 government's effort to restore its international climate reputation, giving it a strong domestic political incentive to win.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of contested bids, a reasonable prior would slightly favor the bid with the stronger narrative and political alignment. A weak prior (n≈10) could be: Australia 50%, Turkey 35%, Germany 10%, Another Pacific Island Nation 1%, Other 4%.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Australia, moderate) The formal partnership with Pacific Island nations provides a uniquely powerful and compelling narrative that aligns with the current zeitgeist of the climate negotiations.
    *   (↓ Australia, small) Its continued high level of fossil fuel exports provides a point of legitimate criticism that opponents can easily leverage.
    *   (↓ Turkey, moderate) Turkey's strained geopolitical relationships with key WEOG members (e.g., several EU states) present a significant hurdle in a consensus-based process.
    *   (↑ Germany, small/moderate) The clear and competing flaws of the two main bidders make the neutral, technically proficient default option in Bonn a more plausible outcome than in a standard race.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence reinforces Australia's position as the frontrunner but also increases the probability of a deadlock. The posterior for Australia should increase slightly, Turkey's should decrease, and Germany's should increase notably from the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support from major WEOG countries (e.g., Canada, Germany, France, UK, US).

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the strong narrative of co-hosting with Pacific Island nations and the backing from the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia has a compelling bid. The base rate for a named, credible bidder winning is ~80%, but considering Australia's unique narrative, a prior of 50% seems reasonable.
  
- **Turkey**: Turkey is the only other official bidder from the WEOG group. However, its geopolitical challenges and less compelling narrative compared to Australia suggest a lower base rate. A prior of 35% seems appropriate.

- **Germany**: As the default host city, Bonn, Germany, has a small chance of hosting if a consensus isn't reached. Given the history of defaults and the current situation, a prior of 10% is reasonable.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: While Australia is co-bidding with Pacific nations, no other Pacific nation is independently bidding. Thus, a prior of 1% is appropriate.

- **Other**: The chance of another unexpected country hosting is low, given the current bids. A prior of 4% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The partnership with Pacific nations is a novel approach, enhancing its bid beyond the typical base case. However, Australia's fossil fuel exports are a notable downside.

- **Turkey**: Turkey's bid is typical of a single-nation host but is weakened by its geopolitical issues and lack of a strong narrative.

- **Germany**: The default option is more plausible than usual due to the flaws in both main bids.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: The formal partnership with Pacific nations and strong support from the Pacific Islands Forum increase the likelihood of Australia's bid succeeding. However, the critique of its fossil fuel industry slightly decreases this likelihood.

- **Turkey**: The promotional campaign shows intent, but geopolitical tensions and critiques from the EU decrease the likelihood of success.

- **Germany**: The critiques of both main bids and the potential for deadlock increase the likelihood of Germany hosting by default.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Starting with a prior of 50%, the positive evidence from the Pacific partnership and support increases its likelihood. Adjusting for critiques, the posterior probability is slightly increased to 55%.

- **Turkey**: Starting with a prior of 35%, the geopolitical issues and critiques decrease its likelihood. The posterior probability is adjusted down to 25%.

- **Germany**: Starting with a prior of 10%, the increased chance of deadlock due to critiques of both bids raises its likelihood. The posterior probability is adjusted up to 15%.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Remains at 1% due to lack of independent bids.

- **Other**: Remains at 4% due to the low likelihood of an unexpected host.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The forecast may overestimate Australia's chances due to the compelling narrative. However, geopolitical dynamics and critiques are significant factors.

- **Tail Risks**: Consideration of a late entrant or a dramatic geopolitical shift is necessary but remains unlikely.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure the probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- Australia: 55%
- Turkey: 25%
- Germany: 15%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
- Other: 4%

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 55%  
Turkey: 25%  
Germany: 15%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%  
Other: 4%

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia: 45%**
- Australia is one of two official bidders from the WEOG group
- Has formal government commitment and a designated host city (Adelaide)
- Has formed a strategic partnership with Pacific Island nations
- Base rate for a named, credible bidder is ~80%, split between two main contenders

**Turkey: 35%**
- The only other official bidder from the WEOG group
- Has launched a promotional campaign for its bid
- Has identified a likely host location (Antalya)
- As a credible bidder, shares in the ~80% base rate for named bidders

**Germany: 10%**
- Default host if consensus cannot be reached
- Houses UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn
- Base rate for default option is ~5-10% based on historical precedent of deadlocks

**Another Pacific Island Nation: 5%**
- While Pacific nations are partnering with Australia, there's a small chance one could emerge as the primary host
- This would be unusual but not impossible given the emphasis on climate justice

**Other: 5%**
- Covers any other WEOG member that might emerge as a compromise candidate
- Historical precedent suggests ~15% chance of a compromise/late-entrant

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The host rotation to WEOG is following the established pattern
- The selection process requires consensus among WEOG members
- Multiple countries are actively bidding, creating a competitive process

**Key differences:**
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations is novel and creates a unique narrative
- Both main bidders have significant vulnerabilities (Australia's fossil fuel industry, Turkey's political issues)
- Both main bidders are from the periphery of WEOG rather than core EU countries
- The climate justice narrative has become increasingly important in recent COPs

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Australia:**
- P(Formal funding commitment | Australia wins) = High (~0.9)
- P(Pacific Islands Forum explicit support | Australia wins) = Very High (~0.95)
- P(Criticism of fossil fuel record | Australia wins) = Moderate (~0.6) - This would happen regardless
- P(EU diplomats expressing preference for unambiguous climate policy | Australia wins) = Moderate (~0.5)

**Evidence for Turkey:**
- P(Promotional campaign at Mediterranean summit | Turkey wins) = High (~0.8)
- P(Criticism from European think tank | Turkey wins) = Moderate (~0.6) - Would happen regardless
- P(EU diplomats expressing preference for unambiguous climate policy | Turkey wins) = Moderate (~0.5)

**Evidence for Germany:**
- P(Criticism of both main bidders | Germany wins) = High (~0.8)
- P(EU diplomats expressing concerns | Germany wins) = High (~0.8)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update Australia's probability based on the Pacific Islands Forum support:
- Prior probability (Australia): 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: P(PIF support | Australia wins) / P(PIF support | Australia doesn't win) = 0.95/0.3 = 3.17
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 3.17 = 2.60
- Posterior probability: 2.60/(1+2.60) = 72%

However, we need to adjust this down due to other evidence:
- The criticism of Australia's fossil fuel industry reduces confidence
- EU diplomats' concerns about climate policy records affects both main bidders
- The possibility of deadlock increases Germany's chances

After qualitative consideration of all evidence, I adjust to:
- Australia: ~55% (up from 45%)
- Turkey: ~25% (down from 35%)
- Germany: ~15% (up from 10%)
- Another Pacific Island Nation: ~3% (down from 5%)
- Other: ~2% (down from 5%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots:
- I may be overvaluing the narrative strength of Australia's bid with Pacific nations
- I might underestimate the importance of geopolitical alignments that favor Turkey
- The likelihood of a deadlock could be higher than estimated
- I may be underestimating the chance of a compromise candidate emerging late

Alternative forecast: Turkey could have a stronger position if:
- Its Mediterranean climate summit campaign built significant regional support
- Australia's fossil fuel industry creates more opposition than anticipated
- Turkey has secured behind-the-scenes support from key WEOG members

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probabilities slightly to account for greater uncertainty.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations, my final normalized probabilities are:

Australia: 52%
Turkey: 27%
Germany: 16%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 2%
(sum 100%)

## 7. Output Format

Australia: 52%
Turkey: 27%
Germany: 16%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 2%

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the provided reference class for contested COP host selections within a regional group.
*   **A named, credible bidder wins:** ~80%
*   **A compromise/late-entrant candidate wins:** ~15%
*   **The process fails and defaults to the UNFCCC headquarters (Bonn, Germany):** ~5%

We have two named bidders, Australia and Turkey. The research report suggests that bids with a "climate justice" narrative and strong geopolitical alignment have an advantage. Australia's bid, co-hosted with Pacific Island nations, fits this description better than Turkey's. Therefore, I will split the 80% probability for a named bidder, giving Australia a significant edge.

My initial prior distribution is:
*   **Australia:** 55% (The stronger of the two named bids)
*   **Turkey:** 25% (The second named bid)
*   **Germany:** 5% (The default option in case of failure)
*   **Other:** 14% (Represents a compromise candidate)
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** 1% (A very specific and unlikely type of compromise candidate)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This specific case differs from the base rate scenario in a crucial way that warrants a significant update:

*   **Similarity:** The process is a contested bid within a UN regional group (WEOG) requiring consensus.
*   **Difference:** Both leading candidates, Australia and Turkey, have significant and well-publicized vulnerabilities (Australia's fossil fuel industry, Turkey's democratic backsliding and geopolitical standing). This is unusual, as often one candidate has a clearer profile.
*   **Implication:** The presence of clear, legitimate grounds for objection against *both* frontrunners makes it much harder to achieve consensus. This dramatically increases the probability of a deadlock compared to the 5% base rate. The default option, Germany, becomes a much more plausible outcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report:

*   **Evidence A: Australia's formal funding commitment and the Pacific Islands Forum's (PIF) strong backing.**
    *   This evidence is highly likely if Australia's bid is serious and destined to win (P(E|Australia Wins) is high).
    *   It makes Australia's bid appear more organized, credible, and narratively powerful than Turkey's.
    *   **Update:** This evidence strengthens Australia's position as the frontrunner relative to Turkey.

*   **Evidence B: The think tank report and EU diplomats' comments criticizing both bids for a lack of "unambiguous climate policy."**
    *   This is the most critical piece of evidence. The EU forms a powerful bloc within WEOG, and their dissatisfaction is a major obstacle to consensus.
    *   This evidence is much more likely if a deadlock occurs (P(E|Germany Wins) is high) than if either Australia or Turkey easily secures consensus (P(E|Australia/Turkey Wins) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood ratio for this evidence strongly favors the "Germany" (deadlock) outcome over either "Australia" or "Turkey".

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will now update my priors based on the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds (Germany vs. Not Germany):** 5 / 95 ≈ 0.053.
*   **Evidence:** Strong signals of dissatisfaction from the EU bloc with both candidates. Let's estimate this evidence is at least 5 times more likely given a deadlock (Germany) than given a successful bid from a flawed candidate. (Likelihood Ratio ≈ 5).
*   **Posterior Odds (Germany):** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.053 × 5 = 0.265.
*   **Posterior Probability (Germany):** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 0.265 / 1.265 ≈ 21%.

This update significantly increases Germany's probability from 5% to ~21%, taking that probability mass primarily from the two frontrunners.

*   **Australia vs. Turkey:** Evidence A (PIF support) solidifies Australia's advantage over Turkey. While both are damaged by Evidence B, Australia's stronger narrative and geopolitical alignment within WEOG (with the US, UK, Canada) make it more likely to overcome the objections or force a compromise.

After this qualitative update, I adjust the full distribution:
*   **Australia's** probability is reduced from its prior due to the increased risk of deadlock, but it remains the clear frontrunner.
*   **Turkey's** probability is also reduced, and it falls further behind Australia.
*   **Germany's** probability increases substantially.
*   **Other/Another Pacific Island Nation** remain as tail risks, but the clear default to Germany makes a surprise compromise candidate less likely.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must consider if I am overestimating the chance of a deadlock. Diplomatic pressure to avoid failure is immense. A deal could be struck where one candidate withdraws in exchange for future support. Given Australia's strong domestic political motivation for this specific COP, it is more likely to be the beneficiary of such a deal than Turkey. This consideration slightly reinforces Australia's position as the favorite, even with the high deadlock risk. Conversely, am I underestimating the EU's resolve? If their objections are fundamental, they could hold the line, making deadlock even more likely. My final distribution attempts to balance these competing pressures, keeping Australia as the favorite but assigning a substantial probability (over 1 in 4) to the deadlock outcome.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will now finalize the probabilities, ensuring they sum to 100%. I believe Australia is the most likely host, but the risk of a deadlock resulting in a Bonn conference is unusually high.

*   **Australia:** Remains the favorite due to the powerful narrative of a Pacific-partnered COP and strong geopolitical backing, but its chances are capped by the high risk of deadlock.
*   **Germany:** The probability is high because the consensus rule is a high bar, and both candidates have flaws that key WEOG members have explicitly criticized.
*   **Turkey:** A credible bidder, but with a weaker narrative and more geopolitical hurdles than Australia, making it the second choice.
*   **Other / Another Pacific Island Nation:** These remain low-probability outcomes, representing a surprise compromise or a breakdown of the current Australian-Pacific bid.

This leads to the following final distribution.

---
Australia: 53%
Turkey: 16%
Germany: 25%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 5%
