### Reference class & base rates
*   **RC1: Longest Field Goal per Season (2014-2024).** This 11-season period captures the modern era of kicking specialization. The median longest field goal was 62 yards. The distribution is tight, with a minimum of 60 and a maximum of 66. The 66-yard record in 2021 is a significant outlier. Base rate suggests a value in the **61-63 yard range**.
*   **RC2: Longest Field Goal per Season (2021-2024).** This recent four-year period reflects the current surge in long-range kicking, with four of the top five longest field goals in history being made. The average longest kick in this period was 63 yards [(66+62+62+62)/4]. This class better reflects the current talent and strategic environment. Base rate suggests a value in the **62-64 yard range**.
*   **Limitations:** Both reference classes are small. The outcome is a single maximum value for an entire season, making it highly susceptible to stochastic events (e.g., a single, unique game situation). Neither class accounts for the 2025 rule change regarding "kicking balls."

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-10** Cam Little (JAX) makes a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. — ↑ — Demonstrates a new upper bound of plausible human capability under game conditions, even if unofficial.
*   **2025-09-01** (approx.) New "K-ball" rule implemented for the regular season. — ↑ — A structural change allowing kickers to prepare game balls all week, potentially increasing kick distance.
*   **2025-10-03** (approx.) Reports emerge that two FGs of 64 and 65 yards were made in the first four weeks. — ↑ — Strong early-season evidence that the high end of the distribution is more accessible this year, potentially due to the new rule.
*   **2025-10-26** Media highlights Brandon Aubrey's (DAL) upcoming game in Denver. — ↑ — Focuses attention on a specific, high-probability opportunity for a record attempt, combining an elite kicker with ideal altitude conditions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Kicker Leg Strength & Technique (Large):** The primary driver. A small cohort of elite kickers (e.g., Justin Tucker, Brandon Aubrey, Cam Little, Matt Prater) possess the raw power to attempt 65+ yard field goals. The presence of multiple such kickers in the league increases the probability of a new record.
*   **Environmental Conditions (Large):** Altitude (Denver) is the most significant factor, reducing air density and allowing the ball to travel farther. Three of the five longest kicks in history occurred in Denver. Tailwinds and warm, dry air also provide a moderate boost.
*   **Game Situation (Large):** Record attempts are almost exclusively made at the end of a half or game, when the low probability of success is outweighed by the potential reward and the low cost of a miss (no field position change on a miss at the end of a half). The occurrence of such a situation is a necessary condition.
*   **"K-Ball" Preparation Rule (Small to Moderate):** The new 2025 rule allowing kickers to break in the "K-balls" is a new mechanism. The theory is that working the leather makes the ball more elastic and aerodynamic, increasing travel distance. The true effect size is currently unknown but is directionally positive.
*   **Coaching & Analytics (Small):** Increased analytical acceptance of long-field-goal variance and a better understanding of kicker-specific range may lead to slightly more attempts in the 60+ yard range than in the past, marginally increasing the chances of a record.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Structural Rule Change:** The 2025 "K-ball" rule is a significant departure from all seasons in the reference classes. This introduces a novel physical variable that is expected to increase maximum kicking distances.
*   **Unprecedented Early Season Results:** Two kicks of 64+ yards within the first four weeks is highly anomalous compared to previous seasons. This suggests the 2025 season's distribution of long kicks has a higher mean and/or a fatter right tail.
*   **Demonstrated Human Potential:** Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick, while unofficial, serves as a powerful psychological and practical anchor. It proves that a kick of that length is mechanically possible, making a regular-season attempt in the 67-69 yard range seem more plausible to coaches and kickers.
*   **Concentration of Elite Power Kickers:** The league features a notable group of kickers with demonstrated 60+ yard power, including Brandon Aubrey, who specializes in long kicks, and the emerging Cam Little, alongside established veterans.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2021-2024 reference class seems appropriate, centered around **63 yards** with a standard deviation reflecting a range from 61 to 66 yards. Equivalent n is low (e.g., n=10) due to the small sample of seasons.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The two 64+ yard kicks in the first month are strong evidence that this season is fundamentally different and has a higher ceiling.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The new "K-ball" rule provides a causal mechanism for why distances might be increasing, even if the effect size is uncertain.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick is a strong signal of the current physical limits of the sport, expanding the "cone of plausibility."
    *   (↔/↓ Small) The observation that overall 50+ yard FG percentages are not up tempers the K-ball hypothesis slightly. It may mean the rule's effect is marginal and only apparent at the absolute extremes of distance, rather than a universal benefit.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the prior is too low. The posterior distribution should shift significantly to the right, with a mean likely in the **65-66 yard range**. The probability of the current 66-yard record being broken should be considered substantial.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any successful field goal of 63+ yards.
    *   An attempt of 66+ yards, regardless of outcome.
    *   Games played by elite kickers (Aubrey, Little, etc.) in Denver or other domed/warm-weather stadiums.
    *   Public statements from kickers or special teams coaches confirming a noticeable distance benefit from the new K-ball rule.
    *   Game situations in the final seconds of a half where a team with a strong-legged kicker is near midfield.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Multiple missed attempts from 60-63 yards in ideal conditions, suggesting a performance ceiling.
    *   Coaches opting to punt or use a "Hail Mary" pass instead of attempting 62+ yard field goals in end-of-half situations.
    *   An injury to a key long-range kicker like Brandon Aubrey or Cam Little.
    *   NFL Competition Committee investigation or statement about the K-balls, suggesting the effect is unintended and may be reversed.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Stochasticity of a Single Maximum:** The final result is a single data point, the maximum of the entire season. A record could be set by a fluke weather event or prevented by a lack of opportunity, making it difficult to forecast with precision.
*   **Opportunity is Rare:** The specific game script required for a record attempt (end of half/game, right field position, coach's trust, favorable weather) is rare. A season could easily pass without a single attempt beyond 65 yards.
*   **K-Ball Effect is Unproven:** The mechanism is plausible, but the effect is not quantified. The lack of an increase in overall 50+ yard accuracy suggests the effect may be smaller than theorized or only matters at extreme ranges.
*   **Definitional Clarity:** The question resolves based on the regular season only. Preseason (Little's 70-yarder) and postseason kicks do not count.

**Final Research Summary:** The 2025 season is operating under a new rule change that appears to be increasing maximum field goal distances, as evidenced by two 64+ yard kicks in the first month. This, combined with a cohort of elite power kickers, suggests the prior expectation of ~63 yards is too low, and the 66-yard NFL record is in significant jeopardy.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - I will use RC2: Longest Field Goal per Season (2021-2024) as the base rate. This period reflects the recent surge in long-range kicking and includes the current talent and strategic environment. The average longest kick in this period was 63 yards, with a range from 62 to 66 yards. The variance is small, reflecting a tight distribution around the mean.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation still involves the same cohort of elite kickers and similar game conditions.
   - Differences: The 2025 season has introduced a new "K-ball" rule, and early results show two kicks of 64 and 65 yards within the first four weeks, suggesting a shift towards longer kicks. Additionally, Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick demonstrates a new potential upper bound.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The two 64+ yard kicks early in the season suggest that longer kicks are more feasible this year, increasing the likelihood of a record-breaking kick.
   - The "K-ball" rule is a structural change that could increase kick distances, though its effect size is uncertain.
   - Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick indicates that longer kicks are within human capability, increasing the plausibility of a 67-69 yard kick during the regular season.
   - The lack of increase in overall 50+ yard FG percentages suggests the "K-ball" rule may have a marginal effect, primarily at extreme distances.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 63 yards, the evidence of early-season long kicks and the "K-ball" rule shifts the distribution to the right.
   - The posterior mean is likely in the 65-66 yard range, with increased variance to account for the potential of a record-breaking kick.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate the impact of the "K-ball" rule and early-season results.
   - Tail risks: A fluke weather event or lack of opportunity could prevent a record-breaking kick.
   - Alternative forecast: A conservative estimate might center around 64 yards, assuming the "K-ball" rule has minimal impact.
   - Rebuttal: The combination of structural changes and early results suggests a genuine shift towards longer kicks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Considering the evidence and potential tail risks, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect a higher likelihood of a record-breaking kick while accounting for uncertainty.

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Reference Class 1: Longest Field Goals by Season (2014-2024)**
- This 11-year period shows a median of 62 yards
- Range: 60-66 yards (with 66 yards being the current NFL record set in 2021)
- Mean: approximately 62.2 yards

**Reference Class 2: Recent Longest Field Goals (2021-2024)**
- This captures the recent upward trend: 66, 62, 62, 62 yards
- Mean: 63 yards

I'll primarily use Reference Class 2 as my prior since it better reflects current kicking capabilities, with a mean of 63 yards and a standard deviation of about 2 yards.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental physics of kicking remains unchanged
- The same elite kickers (Tucker, Aubrey, etc.) are still in the league
- Game situations that allow for extremely long attempts remain similarly rare

**Key differences:**
- The new "K-ball" rule allowing kickers to practice with game balls all week is a structural change not present in any prior season
- Two 64+ yard kicks already made in the first four weeks of 2025 (unprecedented pace)
- Cam Little's preseason 70-yard kick demonstrates a new upper bound of possibility
- There appears to be a concentration of elite power kickers currently in the league

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Two 64+ yard kicks in first four weeks**
- This is strong evidence that the distribution has shifted upward
- In previous seasons, kicks of this length were rare across an entire season
- Likelihood ratio: Makes values ≥65 yards about 2.5× more likely than my prior would suggest

**Evidence 2: New "K-ball" rule implementation**
- Provides a causal mechanism for increased distances
- The effect size is uncertain but directionally positive
- Likelihood ratio: Makes values ≥65 yards about 1.5× more likely

**Evidence 3: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick**
- Demonstrates the physical possibility of kicks well beyond the current record
- While preseason conditions differ, it expands the plausible upper bound
- Likelihood ratio: Makes values ≥67 yards about 2× more likely

**Evidence 4: No increase in 50+ yard FG percentages through Week 4**
- Slightly tempers expectations about the K-ball effect
- Suggests the benefit may only manifest at extreme distances
- Likelihood ratio: Makes values ≥67 yards about 0.9× as likely (slight downward adjustment)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 63 yards (σ ≈ 2):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Two 64+ yard kicks early in season):**
- Prior mean: 63 yards
- Likelihood favors higher values (2.5× for ≥65 yards)
- Posterior mean shifts to ~64.5 yards
- Probability mass shifts toward 65-67 yard range

**Update on Evidence 2 & 3 combined (K-ball rule + 70-yard preseason kick):**
- Prior mean (after first update): 64.5 yards
- Combined likelihood favors higher values (3× for ≥67 yards)
- Posterior mean shifts to ~65.5 yards
- Right tail extends further, with non-negligible probability at 68-70 yards

**Update on Evidence 4 (No increase in 50+ accuracy):**
- Small downward adjustment
- Final posterior mean: ~65.3 yards
- Distribution becomes slightly more concentrated around 64-67 yards

The posterior distribution has:
- Mean: ~65.3 yards
- Median: ~65 yards
- Significant probability mass in the 64-68 yard range
- Non-negligible probability extending to 70 yards

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting early-season results (small sample size)
- The K-ball effect might be overstated based on limited evidence
- Cam Little's preseason kick occurred under different conditions than regular season

**Tail risks and alternative scenarios:**
- Upside scenario: Perfect storm conditions in Denver with elite kicker could enable a 70+ yard kick
- Downside scenario: No appropriate game situations arise for record attempts
- Weather conditions in late season (December) could limit opportunities

**Best alternative forecast:**
- A more conservative forecast would center around 63-64 yards, arguing that:
  - Early season results are anomalous
  - The K-ball effect is minimal
  - Game situations for record attempts are too rare

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The causal mechanism (K-ball rule) is real and unprecedented
- Multiple data points already support the shift (two 64+ yard kicks)
- The demonstrated capability (70-yard preseason kick) establishes plausibility

I'll adjust my distribution slightly to account for these considerations, widening the tails to reflect uncertainty.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is the longest field goal made per season in the recent era of specialized, powerful kickers. I will use the 2021-2024 NFL regular seasons as the primary reference class. This period is most relevant because, as the background notes, four of the five longest field goals in history occurred during this time, indicating a shift in kicker capability and strategy.

*   **Reference Class Data (2021-2024):**
    *   2021: 66 yards (Justin Tucker)
    *   2022: 62 yards (Matt Prater)
    *   2023: 62 yards (Jake Moody)
    *   2024: 62 yards (Brandon Aubrey)
*   **Distribution:** The median of this small sample is 62 yards, and the mean is 63 yards. The distribution is tight (three of four values are 62) but includes the all-time record of 66 yards. My prior distribution is centered around **62.5 yards**, with a low probability of exceeding 64 yards and a very low probability of exceeding the 66-yard record.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base case due to several key factors that suggest the distribution of maximum kick distances has shifted upwards.

*   **Similarities:** The league still features the same elite kickers, and the game situations (end of half/game) that prompt record attempts remain the same.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **"K-Ball" Rule Change:** A new rule allows teams to prepare the kicking balls all week. This is a structural change not present in the reference class. The plausible mechanism is that "breaking in" the balls makes them travel farther, directly impacting the maximum possible distance.
    2.  **Early Season Results:** Two field goals of 64 and 65 yards have already been made in the first four weeks of the 2025 season. This is a powerful signal. In the entire 2021-2024 period, only one kick (the 66-yard record) was longer than 63 yards. Having two kicks of 64+ so early strongly suggests this season is anomalous and has a higher ceiling.
    3.  **Demonstrated Potential:** A 70-yard field goal was made in the preseason. While unofficial, this serves as a psychological anchor, proving the feat is within the realm of human possibility under game conditions and making coaches more likely to attempt kicks in the 67-69 yard range.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the evidence in terms of how it shifts the prior distribution.

*   **Evidence 1: Two kicks of 64 and 65 yards by Week 4.** This is the most significant piece of evidence. It establishes a hard floor for the forecast at 65 yards. The probability of observing two kicks of this length so early, given the historical base rate, is extremely low. This evidence makes outcomes greater than 65 yards much more likely. This is a **strong upward update**.
*   **Evidence 2: The "K-Ball" Rule Change.** This provides a causal reason for the observed increase in long kicks. While its precise effect is unknown, it directionally supports longer kicks. The counter-evidence that overall 50+ yard accuracy is not up suggests the effect may be concentrated at the absolute extremes of distance, which is what this question is about. This is a **moderate upward update**.
*   **Evidence 3: Cam Little's 70-yard Preseason Kick.** This expands the "cone of plausibility." It makes a record-breaking attempt of 67+ yards seem less like a fantasy and more like a calculated risk, increasing the probability of such an attempt. This is a **moderate upward update** to the right tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Centered at 62.5 yards, with a very small tail extending beyond 66 yards.
*   **Likelihoods:** The combined evidence (early results, rule change, preseason potential) is highly inconsistent with the prior distribution and strongly favors a new distribution with a higher mean and a fatter right tail.
*   **Posterior:**
    1.  The first and most crucial update comes from the 65-yard kick already made. This truncates the distribution, setting a hard minimum of 65. The question is now, "What is the probability of a kick longer than 65 yards in the remaining ~75% of the season?"
    2.  Given the other evidence (K-ball rule, 70-yard potential), this probability is high. The environment is clearly more conducive to long field goals than in previous years.
    3.  Therefore, the posterior median must be above 65. The current record is 66 yards. The evidence is strong enough to suggest that breaking this record is a very real possibility. I will center my posterior distribution such that there is roughly a 50% chance the record is broken (i.e., the longest kick is ≥ 67 yards). This places the median at **66.5 yards**. The distribution is now heavily concentrated in the 65-69 yard range.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The 65-yard kick made in the first four weeks ends up being the longest of the season. This could happen if the early kicks were flukes (e.g., perfect weather conditions) and no other ideal opportunities (right kicker, right stadium, right game situation) arise for the rest of the season. The lack of an overall increase in 50+ yard accuracy lends some credence to the idea that the "K-ball" effect is being overestimated.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this scenario seems unlikely. With over 200 games remaining, the probability of zero ideal opportunities for the league's elite kickers (especially with a known game for a top kicker in Denver's altitude) is low. The early success is more likely to embolden coaches than to be dismissed as a fluke.
*   **Overconfidence in the Tail:** Is a 69-yard kick (P90) too aggressive? A 3-yard increase on the all-time record is massive. However, the 70-yard preseason kick provides a strong anchor that this is physically possible. The P90 represents a "perfect storm" scenario (e.g., Brandon Aubrey in Denver with a tailwind at the end of a half), which is a plausible high-end outcome for this specific season. I will retain the aggressive but justified tail. My distribution assigns a ~30-35% probability that the 65-yarder holds, which adequately accounts for the alternative scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is anchored by the 65-yard kick already made, with a median of 66.5, reflecting a 50% chance the current NFL record of 66 yards will be broken. The upper tail accounts for the increased potential demonstrated this season.

P10: 65
P20: 65
P40: 66
P60: 67
P80: 68
P90: 69
