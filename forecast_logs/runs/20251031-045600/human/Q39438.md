### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court reviews of executive actions invalidated by lower courts under the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** This is the most relevant class. In recent years, when the Court has invoked the MQD (or its principles) to assess major executive actions not explicitly authorized by Congress, it has consistently ruled against the executive. Examples include striking down the OSHA vaccine-or-test mandate (*NFIB v. OSHA*, 2022), the EPA's Clean Power Plan (*West Virginia v. EPA*, 2022), and the CDC's eviction moratorium (*Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. HHS*, 2021).
    *   **Base Rate:** The executive action is upheld <10% of the time in these specific cases. This suggests a very low probability for "Tariffs lawful."
2.  **Supreme Court reviews of cases concerning presidential power under IEEPA:** This class is broader. The Court has historically been deferential to the President in this area, famously upholding the freezing of Iranian assets in *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981). However, that case involved a specific foreign policy crisis and actions (asset freezes) more traditional to emergency powers than imposing broad-based taxes.
    *   **Base Rate:** Historically, presidential authority under IEEPA is upheld >75% of the time. However, the current Court's jurisprudence and the unprecedented nature of the tariffs make this historical base rate a poor guide.
3.  **Supreme Court reviews after multiple lower courts rule against the government on different grounds:** When lower courts coalesce on an outcome but offer different legal paths, it signals the government's position is weak from multiple angles. The Supreme Court may affirm on one of the grounds, or find its own. It is less common for the Court to reverse entirely in such situations.
    *   **Base Rate:** A full reversal in favor of the government is likely below 40%. The Court is more likely to affirm, or perhaps find a middle ground.

**Reasoning:** The first reference class is the most pertinent due to the massive economic and political significance of the tariffs, which squarely implicates the Major Questions Doctrine, a favored tool of the current Court's majority. The historical deference under IEEPA is less relevant given the Court's recent shift in jurisprudence regarding executive power.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** CAFC affirms ruling against tariffs (7-4) — ↓ — A powerful appellate court affirmed the tariffs are unlawful, strengthening the legal case against them and providing a direct vehicle for Supreme Court review.
*   **2025-09-03** Government petitions for SCOTUS review — ↑↓ — Signals the administration's commitment, but also accelerates the timeline for a final, likely negative, judgment. Net effect is neutral to slightly negative for "lawful."
*   **2025-09-09** SCOTUS grants expedited review of both cases — ↓ — The Court's speed signals the issue's gravity and its desire for a swift resolution. This makes "No 2025 ruling" highly unlikely and suggests the majority sees a clear, urgent need to resolve the legal cloud over the tariffs.
*   **2025-10-14** Reporting highlights unprecedented nature of tariffs — ↓ — Analysis distinguishing these tariffs from the 1971 Nixon surcharge weakens the government's key historical precedent, making a ruling of "lawful" less likely.
*   **2025-10-28** Pre-argument analysis focuses on IEEPA's text — ↓ — Public focus on the fact that IEEPA does not explicitly mention tariffs reinforces the challengers' core textualist argument, which is likely to appeal to the Court's conservative majority.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The Court's conservative majority has repeatedly used this doctrine to strike down executive actions of "vast economic and political significance" not clearly authorized by Congress. Imposing tariffs on trillions of dollars of trade is a textbook example. (Driver size: Large; Direction: Favors "Tariffs unlawful").
2.  **Textualism:** The text of IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate" commerce but does not explicitly grant the power to "tax" or "impose tariffs." Challengers argue this is a deliberate omission, as the power to tax is constitutionally vested in Congress. This argument is likely to resonate with the Court's textualist/originalist justices. (Driver size: Large; Direction: Favors "Tariffs unlawful").
3.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court could treat the "trafficking tariffs" (on Mexico, Canada, China) differently from the "reciprocal tariffs." The former are tied to a more traditional national security threat (drug trafficking), while the latter are based on a purely economic rationale (trade deficits). This provides a clear path for a split decision. (Driver size: Moderate; Direction: Favors "Mixed ruling").
4.  **Judicial Deference in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** The government's strongest argument is that the President deserves broad deference when acting under a declaration of a national emergency, especially one touching on foreign relations. Some justices may be swayed by this, particularly concerning the trafficking tariffs. (Driver size: Moderate; Direction: Favors "Tariffs lawful" or "Mixed ruling").
5.  **Nondelegation Doctrine Concerns:** Underlying the MQD, some justices (notably Gorsuch) are skeptical of broad delegations of legislative power (like the power to tax) to the executive branch. This case presents a prime opportunity to enforce stricter limits on such delegations. (Driver size: Moderate; Direction: Favors "Tariffs unlawful").
6.  **Desire for a Clear Judgment:** The expedited review suggests the Court wants to provide a clear, final answer to a question causing massive economic uncertainty. This makes procedural off-ramps ("Other ruling") or failing to decide ("No 2025 ruling") very unlikely. (Driver size: Large; Direction: Disfavors "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling").

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** Unlike prior uses of IEEPA for sanctions or asset freezes, this is the first time a President has used it to impose broad-based tariffs on nearly all global trade, fundamentally altering U.S. economic policy. This pushes the action into the heartland of Congress's constitutional authority.
*   **The Current Court's Jurisprudence:** Unlike the Warren or Burger Courts that were more deferential to executive power, the current Roberts Court is actively engaged in curtailing it, especially via the Major Questions Doctrine. This case is a perfect vehicle for that project.
*   **Dual Justifications for Tariffs:** The case involves two distinct tariff regimes based on two different declared emergencies (trafficking vs. trade deficits). This structural feature makes a "Mixed ruling" unusually plausible compared to a typical case challenging a single, monolithic policy.
*   **Consolidation of Different Legal Theories:** The Court is simultaneously reviewing two different legal arguments for why the tariffs are unlawful (IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all vs. these tariffs don't "deal with" the threat). This gives the Court multiple avenues to invalidate the tariffs.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a neutral prior, the most relevant reference class (modern MQD cases) suggests a very low probability (<10%) for "Tariffs lawful." A plausible prior might be: Lawful (15%), Unlawful (50%), Mixed (25%), Other/No Ruling (10%).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The core legal question is a perfect fit for the Major Questions Doctrine, which the current Court majority has consistently used to invalidate executive actions.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): Unanimous invalidation by lower courts, including a bipartisan majority on the en banc Federal Circuit, signals profound legal weakness.
    *   ↑ (Moderate for "Mixed"): The existence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provides a clear off-ramp for a split decision, which could appeal to centrist justices like the Chief Justice.
    *   ↓ (Large for "Other/No Ruling"): The Court's decision to grant expedited review makes a non-decision or procedural punt extremely unlikely.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior against "Tariffs lawful" and significantly reduces the probability of "Other/No Ruling." The posterior probability should be heavily concentrated on "Tariffs unlawful," with "Mixed ruling" as the second most likely outcome. The probability of "Tariffs lawful" should be very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Tariffs lawful"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from Roberts, Kavanaugh, or Barrett focusing heavily on historical precedent for presidential economic power (e.g., Nixon's surcharge) and deference in national emergencies.
    *   The Solicitor General effectively framing the "trafficking tariffs" as a national security imperative indistinguishable from traditional sanctions.
    *   Prominent amicus briefs from national security-focused conservatives arguing for broad presidential authority.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from a majority of justices about the lack of the word "tariff" in IEEPA

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: The base rate for the Supreme Court upholding executive actions under the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) is less than 10%. Given the Court's recent trend of striking down such actions, the prior probability for "Tariffs lawful" is very low.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The base rate for the Court ruling against executive actions under the MQD is high, around 90%. This suggests a strong prior probability for "Tariffs unlawful."
  
- **Mixed ruling**: Given the distinct nature of the two tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal), a mixed ruling is plausible. A reasonable prior might be around 25%.
  
- **Other ruling**: The expedited review and the Court's desire for a clear resolution make procedural outcomes unlikely. A prior of 10% seems appropriate.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule and urgency of the issue make this very unlikely, suggesting a prior of 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves significant executive action with vast economic implications, fitting the MQD scenario.
  
- **Differences**: The dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) introduces complexity, making a mixed ruling more plausible than in typical MQD cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Major Questions Doctrine**: Strong likelihood that the Court will apply this doctrine, favoring "Tariffs unlawful."
  
- **Textualism**: The lack of explicit mention of tariffs in IEEPA supports the challengers' argument, favoring "Tariffs unlawful."
  
- **Lower Court Rulings**: Unanimous rulings against the tariffs by lower courts strengthen the case for "Tariffs unlawful."
  
- **Dual Tariff Regimes**: The distinct justifications for the tariffs increase the likelihood of a "Mixed ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds are low. Given the strong evidence against this outcome, the posterior probability remains very low.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Strong evidence and prior support increase the posterior probability significantly.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: The distinct nature of the tariffs and potential for a split decision increase the posterior probability.
  
- **Other ruling**: The expedited review reduces the likelihood, decreasing the posterior probability.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule and urgency make this very unlikely, further reducing the posterior probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Consider the possibility of the Court finding a novel legal rationale or procedural issue.
  
- **Alternative Forecast**: A "Mixed ruling" is plausible given the distinct nature of the tariffs.
  
- **Rebuttals**: The Court's recent jurisprudence and expedited review suggest a clear ruling is likely.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- **Tariffs lawful**: 5%
- **Tariffs unlawful**: 55%
- **Mixed ruling**: 30%
- **Other ruling**: 5%
- **No 2025 ruling**: 5%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
Mixed ruling: 30%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 5%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish an appropriate base rate:

**Tariffs lawful:**
- Base rate: 15%
- Reasoning: The Supreme Court has historically been deferential to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security, but the current Court has consistently limited executive power through the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD). In recent cases involving executive actions of "vast economic and political significance" not explicitly authorized by Congress (OSHA vaccine mandate, EPA Clean Power Plan, CDC eviction moratorium), the Court has ruled against the executive ~90% of the time.

**Tariffs unlawful:**
- Base rate: 55%
- Reasoning: When multiple lower courts have ruled against the government on different grounds (as here), the Supreme Court rarely reverses entirely. The Court's recent jurisprudence shows strong skepticism toward broad executive actions without clear congressional authorization, especially in areas of major economic significance.

**Mixed ruling:**
- Base rate: 20%
- Reasoning: The case involves two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking tariffs and reciprocal tariffs) with different legal justifications. This creates a natural opportunity for a split decision, which occurs in approximately 20% of complex administrative law cases with multiple challenged provisions.

**Other ruling:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Reasoning: Procedural off-ramps (standing issues, mootness, etc.) are uncommon when the Court grants expedited review of cases with clear national importance.

**No 2025 ruling:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Reasoning: The Court has granted expedited review with argument scheduled for early November 2025, making a 2025 ruling highly likely unless extraordinary circumstances intervene.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other MQD cases, this involves executive action with massive economic implications
- Multiple lower courts have ruled against the government, as in many cases where the Supreme Court ultimately affirms
- The case presents statutory interpretation questions about the scope of delegated authority

**Key differences:**
- The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) has historically received more judicial deference than other statutory delegations
- The dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) creates a clearer path for a mixed ruling than in many cases
- The expedited review schedule makes a 2025 ruling more likely than in typical cases
- The unprecedented nature of using IEEPA for broad tariffs makes historical precedents less reliable

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low: The text of IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate" commerce but does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "taxes" - a critical omission given the Constitution's vesting of taxing power in Congress
- P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low: Both lower courts ruled against the tariffs on different grounds, suggesting multiple legal vulnerabilities
- P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low: The Federal Circuit affirmed 7-4 with a bipartisan majority, indicating the legal weakness transcends political alignment
- P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low: The Court's conservative majority has consistently applied the Major Questions Doctrine to limit executive power in areas of vast economic significance

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate: The trafficking tariffs have a stronger national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs, creating a natural dividing line
- P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate: The Court has consolidated two cases with different legal theories, giving it flexibility to adopt different approaches for different tariff regimes

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- P(E|H) moderate, P(E|~H) low: Historical precedent of judicial deference to the President in foreign affairs and national security
- P(E|H) moderate, P(E|~H) low: The Nixon administration's 1971 import surcharge provides some historical precedent, though distinguishable

**Evidence against "No 2025 ruling" or "Other ruling":**
- P(E|H) very low, P(E|~H) high: The Court granted expedited review with argument in early November 2025, signaling urgency
- P(E|H) very low, P(E|~H) high: The economic significance and uncertainty created by the tariffs incentivizes a clear, prompt ruling

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior probabilities:
- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 55%
- Mixed ruling: 20%
- Other ruling: 5%
- No 2025 ruling: 5%

Let's update based on key evidence:

**Update on the Major Questions Doctrine applicability:**
- Prior odds for "Tariffs unlawful" vs. others: 55:45 = 1.22:1
- Likelihood ratio (conservative estimate): 2:1 (the MQD strongly applies to this case)
- Posterior odds: 1.22 × 2 = 2.44:1
- Posterior probability for "Tariffs unlawful": 2.44/(1+2.44) ≈ 71%

Adjusting other probabilities proportionally:
- Tariffs lawful: ~10%
- Mixed ruling: ~13%
- Other ruling: ~3%
- No 2025 ruling: ~3%

**Update on the dual nature of tariff regimes:**
This evidence increases the probability of a "Mixed ruling" relative to "Tariffs unlawful":
- Likelihood ratio for "Mixed ruling" vs. "Tariffs unlawful": 1.5:1
- This shifts some probability from "Tariffs unlawful" to "Mixed ruling"

After this update:
- Tariffs lawful: ~10%
- Tariffs unlawful: ~60%
- Mixed ruling: ~24%
- Other ruling: ~3%
- No 2025 ruling: ~3%

**Update on expedited review schedule:**
This further reduces the probability of "No 2025 ruling":
- Likelihood ratio against "No 2025 ruling": 3:1
- This reduces "No 2025 ruling" to ~1% and distributes that probability to other options

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent MQD cases and underweighting historical deference to presidential power in foreign affairs
- The Court might be more concerned about economic disruption from invalidating the tariffs than I've accounted for
- The conservative majority might be more willing to support a Republican president's policies than recent jurisprudence suggests

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could find a narrow statutory basis to uphold the trafficking tariffs while invalidating the reciprocal tariffs
- The Court might remand for further proceedings on specific aspects while providing guidance on the legal framework
- Unexpected events (health issues of justices, national emergencies) could delay the ruling beyond 2025

**Best alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would place more weight on "Mixed ruling" (~40%) and less on "Tariffs unlawful" (~40%), considering:
- The Court often seeks narrower grounds when possible
- The distinct nature of the two tariff regimes provides a clean dividing line
- Chief Justice Roberts often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The textual argument against tariffs under IEEPA is so strong that even a compromise-seeking Court would likely invalidate both tariff regimes, perhaps on different grounds but with the same outcome.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I'll make some final adjustments:
- Slightly reduce "Tariffs unlawful" to account for potential judicial deference in national security matters
- Slightly increase "Mixed ruling" to account for the distinct nature of the two tariff regimes
- Maintain low probabilities for "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling" given the expedited schedule

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 9%
Tariffs unlawful: 58%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class for this case is the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence under the **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD)**. This doctrine is applied to executive actions of "vast economic and political significance" that are not explicitly authorized by Congress. Recent examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), and *Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. HHS* (2021). In these cases, the Supreme Court has consistently invalidated the executive action.

*   **Base Rate:** Based on this reference class, the prior probability of the executive action being upheld ("Tariffs lawful") is very low, likely under 10%. The probability of the action being struck down ("Tariffs unlawful") is correspondingly high. However, this case involves two distinct tariff regimes, making a split decision ("Mixed ruling") unusually plausible.
*   **Initial Prior Distribution:**
    *   Tariffs lawful: 10%
    *   Tariffs unlawful: 55%
    *   Mixed ruling: 30%
    *   Other ruling / No 2025 ruling: 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The imposition of broad tariffs on trillions of dollars of trade is a textbook example of an action with "vast economic and political significance." The authorizing statute, IEEPA, grants broad powers to "regulate" commerce but does not explicitly mention the power to "impose tariffs," which is constitutionally vested in Congress. This fits the MQD pattern perfectly.
*   **Differences:** Unlike the domestic policies in prior MQD cases, these tariffs are enacted under a statute (IEEPA) that explicitly grants emergency powers in the realm of foreign commerce and national security. The Court is historically more deferential to the President in this sphere. Furthermore, the existence of two distinct tariff regimes—one tied to a national security threat (drug trafficking) and one to a purely economic rationale (trade deficits)—creates a clear path for a split or "Mixed" ruling that is not always present in MQD cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence 1: Multiple Lower Courts Invalidate Tariffs.** Two different federal courts (the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court) invalidated the tariffs, and a major appellate court (the en banc Federal Circuit) affirmed one of those rulings.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is strong evidence against the "Tariffs lawful" option. When lower courts, especially on different legal grounds, reach the same conclusion, a complete reversal by the Supreme Court becomes less likely. This evidence strongly increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling." P(E | Lawful) is low; P(E | Unlawful or Mixed) is high.

*   **Evidence 2: Supreme Court Grants Expedited Review.** The Court consolidated the cases and scheduled arguments for early November 2025, signaling an intent to rule before the end of the year.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is extremely strong evidence against the "No 2025 ruling" option, reducing its probability to near zero. It also makes a procedural punt ("Other ruling") less likely, as the Court is clearly signaling its intent to resolve the merits of this urgent national issue.

*   **Evidence 3: The Nature of the Legal Arguments.** The challengers' arguments are based on textualism (IEEPA doesn't say "tariffs") and the Major Questions Doctrine. These are precisely the legal theories favored by the current conservative majority. The government's strongest counterargument rests on historical deference in foreign affairs.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** The alignment of the challengers' arguments with the Court's recent jurisprudence is a powerful factor. This significantly decreases the likelihood of "Tariffs lawful" and increases the likelihood of "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
1.  **Initial Prior:** P(Unlawful) = 55%, P(Mixed) = 30%, P(Lawful) = 10%, P(Other/No Ruling) = 5%.
2.  **Update for Expedited Review:** The expedited schedule makes a non-decision highly improbable. We can reduce P(No 2025 ruling) and P(Other ruling) to ~1% each and redistribute the saved probability mass to the merits outcomes. This might shift the probabilities to roughly: P(Unlawful) ~57%, P(Mixed) ~31%, P(Lawful) ~10%.
3.  **Update for Strength of MQD/Textualist Arguments:** This is the most significant piece of evidence. The challengers' arguments are tailor-made for the current Court. This evidence dramatically reduces the probability of "Tariffs lawful." The prior odds of Lawful vs. (Unlawful or Mixed) were about 1:9. The evidence makes this ratio much wider, perhaps 1:20. This pushes P(Lawful) down to ~5%.
4.  **Re-allocating between "Unlawful" and "Mixed":** The redistributed probability must go to "Unlawful" and "Mixed." The "Mixed ruling" option is a very strong candidate for a compromise that could attract a majority (e.g., Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh). It allows the Court to curb the most expansive use of executive power (the reciprocal tariffs) while still showing deference on the more traditional national security issue (the trafficking tariffs). A narrow ruling that resolves the case without setting a sweeping precedent is a common feature of the Roberts Court. Therefore, "Mixed ruling" is arguably the single most likely outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast places a 93% combined probability on the tariffs being at least partially struck down. The main risk is underestimating the Court's deference to the executive in foreign affairs and national security. A majority could decide that IEEPA's broad language is sufficient and that this is a "political question" best left to Congress to resolve legislatively. This scenario supports the "Tariffs lawful" option. However, the sheer economic scale and the intrusion into Congress's core taxing power make this a weak argument for the current Court. The distinction between the two tariff types makes the "Mixed ruling" a very stable compromise position, potentially more stable than an outright "Unlawful" ruling that strikes down everything. Therefore, making "Mixed ruling" the modal outcome is a robust choice.

### 6. Final Normalization
The analysis suggests the vast majority of the probability mass should be on "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling." A small probability remains for "Tariffs lawful," and a negligible probability for a non-merits or delayed ruling.

*   **Mixed ruling (48%):** This is the most likely single outcome. It represents a classic judicial compromise, allowing the Court to rein in executive overreach on the purely economic tariffs while showing deference on the national security-linked tariffs.
*   **Tariffs unlawful (45%):** A close second. A majority of the Court could opt for a cleaner, broader ruling that IEEPA simply does not authorize tariffs at all, fully invalidating both sets.
*   **Tariffs lawful (5%):** A small but non-zero chance that the Court defers entirely to the President's emergency powers in foreign affairs.
*   **Other ruling (1%) / No 2025 ruling (1%):** Extremely unlikely given the expedited review and national importance of the case.

The probabilities sum to 100%.
