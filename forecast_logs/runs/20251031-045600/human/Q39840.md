**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Base Rates:** The recent El Niño-fueled years (2023, 2024) saw record-breaking anomalies, with daily peaks likely exceeding +0.9°C and approaching +1.1°C relative to the 1991-2020 baseline. The last major La Niña period (the 2020-2022 "triple-dip") saw lower anomalies, but due to the strong background warming trend, late-year daily peaks were still in the +0.5°C to +0.7°C range.
*   **La Niña Status:** The provided sources from October 2025 unanimously confirm that La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter. The event emerged in September 2025. Forecasts suggest a weak-to-moderate event, not a particularly strong one.
*   **Lag Time:** The peak impact of ENSO on global air temperatures typically lags the oceanic signal by 3-6 months. With La Niña emerging in September 2025, its maximum cooling effect would be expected around December 2025 - March 2026. Therefore, the Nov-Dec 2025 period will be fully under its influence.
*   **Other Drivers:** A key factor is the persistent, record-breaking warmth in other ocean basins, particularly the North Atlantic. This warmth acted as an amplifier during the recent El Niño and will now serve as a buffer, counteracting some of La Niña's global cooling effect. The warming influence from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption is likely waning but may still contribute a minor positive anomaly. There have been no recent major volcanic eruptions to provide a significant aerosol cooling effect.
*   **Recent Trend:** The provided chart clearly shows the 2025 temperature anomaly (dark red line) peaking early in the year and steadily declining since, falling below both 2023 and 2024 levels by September/October. This trajectory is consistent with the transition from lingering El Niño warmth to the onset of La Niña's cooling influence.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent El Niño / Neutral Years (2023-2024):** This class represents the recent "hot" state of the climate system. The highest daily anomalies in Nov/Dec of these years were in the **+0.9°C to +1.1°C** range (relative to the 1991-2020 baseline). This serves as a plausible upper bound.
2.  **Recent La Niña Years (2020-2022):** This class represents the climate system's response to Pacific cooling. During the Nov/Dec periods of this "triple-dip" La Niña, peak daily anomalies were in the **+0.5°C to +0.7°C** range. This serves as a more relevant, but likely low, baseline due to continued background warming since 2022.
3.  **Reasoning:** The primary short-term driver of inter-annual temperature variability is the ENSO cycle. The 2025 Nov/Dec period will be under La Niña conditions, making the 2020-2022 class more analogous. However, the long-term warming trend means any new La Niña will start from a higher baseline temperature than the last.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-11** US CPC raises probability of La Niña to 71% for Oct-Dec. — ↓ — Matters because it solidified expectations for a cooling phase, moving the forecast away from the record highs of early 2025.
*   **2025-09-30** Copernicus data for September (implied by background text) shows 2025 is now the third warmest year, having stagnated and fallen behind 2023/2024. — ↓ — Matters because it provides observational evidence that the cooling influence of the developing La Niña is already taking effect on global temperatures.
*   **2025-10-09** NOAA's Climate Prediction Center officially announces La Niña conditions have emerged and are expected to persist through the end of 2025. — ↓ — Matters because this is the definitive confirmation of the primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period, removing uncertainty about the ENSO state.
*   **2025-10-27** CPC update reiterates that La Niña is present and will continue, with a transition to neutral not likely until early 2026. — ↓ — Matters because it confirms the cooling mechanism will be active and stable throughout the entire Nov-Dec resolution window.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ENSO State (Large):** La Niña, characterized by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the equatorial Pacific, has a direct global cooling effect. This is the dominant downward driver for this forecast.
2.  **Long-term Warming Trend (Large):** The accumulation of greenhouse gases provides a powerful, persistent upward pressure on the baseline temperature. This ensures that 2025 will be warmer than past years with similar La Niña conditions.
3.  **Global SSTs ex-Pacific (Moderate):** Unusually high SSTs in other ocean basins, particularly the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans, will release excess heat into the atmosphere, partially counteracting La Niña's cooling effect.
4.  **Stratospheric Water Vapor (Small):

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The recent La Niña years (2020-2022) provide a relevant base rate for this forecast. During these years, peak daily anomalies in November and December were in the range of +0.5°C to +0.7°C relative to the 1991-2020 baseline.
- **Reasoning:** Given the current La Niña conditions, this period is the most analogous. However, due to ongoing global warming, we expect a slightly higher baseline than the last La Niña period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current La Niña conditions are similar to those in 2020-2022, suggesting a cooling influence on global temperatures.
- **Difference:** The background warming trend since 2022 means that even under La Niña conditions, the baseline temperature is higher. Additionally, unusually high SSTs in other ocean basins could counteract some of the cooling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **La Niña Status:** The emergence of La Niña is a strong cooling factor, suggesting lower anomalies. This factor makes lower outcomes more likely.
- **Long-term Warming Trend:** The persistent increase in greenhouse gases suggests higher anomalies, making higher outcomes more likely.
- **Global SSTs ex-Pacific:** High SSTs in other ocean basins could moderate the cooling effect of La Niña, slightly increasing the likelihood of higher anomalies.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Peak anomalies of +0.5°C to +0.7°C.
- **Likelihood Adjustments:** 
  - La Niña suggests a downward adjustment.
  - Long-term warming and high SSTs elsewhere suggest an upward adjustment.
- **Posterior:** Considering these factors, the posterior distribution shifts slightly upward from the prior, reflecting the influence of global warming and high SSTs.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of extreme events or unexpected climate drivers.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A stronger-than-expected La Niña could lead to lower anomalies, while unexpected warming events could push anomalies higher.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, we should slightly widen the range to account for tail risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025 are:

P10: 0.6  
P20: 0.65  
P40: 0.7  
P60: 0.75  
P80: 0.8  
P90: 0.85

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use the highest daily temperature anomalies during November-December periods in recent La Niña years, since the background indicates La Niña conditions have emerged and will persist through the end of 2025.

Looking at recent La Niña years (2020-2022), the highest daily anomalies in Nov-Dec were approximately in the +0.5°C to +0.7°C range relative to the 1991-2020 baseline. However, due to the continued background warming trend since then, I'll adjust this slightly upward.

The prior distribution I'll use has:
- Median (P50): +0.65°C
- Range: Approximately +0.45°C to +0.85°C (covering ~80% of probability)

I chose this base rate because ENSO state is the primary driver of inter-annual temperature variability, and La Niña conditions specifically tend to suppress global temperatures.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- We are in a confirmed La Niña phase, similar to 2020-2022
- The timing (Nov-Dec) matches our reference class
- The measurement methodology (Copernicus Climate data) is consistent

**Differences from reference distribution:**
- The background warming trend means 2025 starts from a higher baseline than 2020-2022
- The current La Niña emerged more recently (September 2025) than some previous events
- 2025 has shown exceptionally high temperatures earlier in the year (second warmest first half)
- Ocean heat content outside the Pacific remains anomalously high in 2025

These differences suggest our distribution should be shifted somewhat higher than the 2020-2022 La Niña years, but still well below the El Niño-influenced years of 2023-2024.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing distribution higher:**
1. Long-term warming trend: Each year adds ~0.02-0.03°C to the baseline, meaning 2025 should be ~0.06-0.09°C warmer than 2022 from this factor alone. (Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring higher values)

2. Exceptional warmth in non-Pacific ocean basins: The North Atlantic and other regions remain anomalously warm, which partially counteracts La Niña cooling. (Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher values)

3. 2025 has already shown very high temperatures in the first half of the year, suggesting underlying warming factors beyond ENSO. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring higher values)

**Evidence pushing distribution lower:**
1. La Niña conditions officially confirmed and expected to persist through end of 2025, providing a strong cooling influence. (Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring lower values)

2. Temperature has already "stagnated" and fallen to third warmest by September 2025, showing La Niña's cooling effect is already taking hold. (Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring lower values)

3. The timing of La Niña emergence (September) means its cooling effect will be strengthening during Nov-Dec, which is our period of interest. (Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring lower values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at +0.65°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

First update - Long-term warming trend:
- This shifts the distribution upward by ~0.07°C
- New median: +0.72°C

Second update - Confirmed La Niña conditions and already observed cooling:
- This shifts the distribution downward by ~0.10°C
- New median: +0.62°C

Third update - Non-Pacific ocean warmth partially offsetting La Niña:
- This shifts the distribution upward by ~0.05°C
- New median: +0.67°C

The posterior distribution has:
- Median: +0.67°C
- Range: Approximately +0.47°C to +0.87°C (80% interval)
- Shape: Slightly right-skewed due to potential for extreme warm events

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be underestimating the strength of this La Niña. If it develops into a strong event, temperatures could be lower than my forecast.

2. I might be overestimating the persistence of warmth in other ocean basins. If these cool significantly by November, the global anomaly would be lower.

3. Conversely, I could be underestimating the background warming trend. The exceptional warmth of 2023-2024 might indicate a step change in the climate system rather than just El Niño effects.

4. Unpredictable events like volcanic eruptions could significantly impact temperatures in either direction.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center the distribution lower, around +0.55°C, based on giving more weight to the cooling effect of La Niña and less to the background warming trend. This would be justified if the La Niña strengthens more rapidly than expected.

Rebuttal: While possible, the persistent warmth in other ocean basins and the strong first half of 2025 suggest the climate system has significant inertia toward warmth.

After considering these factors, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these alternative scenarios, particularly on the lower end.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the highest daily global surface air temperature anomaly in November-December 2025. The most significant short-term driver of inter-annual variability in global temperature is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. The background information confirms that La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through the end of 2025.

Therefore, the most appropriate reference class is the peak daily anomalies observed during recent La Niña years. The "triple-dip" La Niña from late 2020 to early 2023 provides the best recent data. Based on historical charts and the research report's synthesis, the peak daily anomalies during the November-December periods of 2020-2022 were in the range of **+0.5°C to +0.7°C** relative to the 1991-2020 baseline. I will set my prior distribution with a median around **+0.6°C** and this approximate spread.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The primary similarity is the ENSO state. The forecast period (Nov-Dec 2025) will be under the influence of La Niña, just like the reference period (2020-2022). This provides a strong anchor for the forecast.
*   **Differences:** Several key factors differentiate 2025 from the 2020-2022 period, all of which push the expected temperature anomaly upwards:
    1.  **Long-Term Warming Trend:** The planet's baseline temperature continues to rise due to greenhouse gas emissions. The three years between 2022 and 2025 add approximately +0.06°C to the global mean temperature baseline (based on a ~0.2°C/decade trend).
    2.  **Strength of La Niña:** The research report suggests the current La Niña is forecast to be "weak-to-moderate," whereas the 2020-2022 event was stronger for sustained periods. A weaker La Niña will exert less of a cooling influence.
    3.  **Global Ocean Heat:** The research report highlights persistent, record-breaking warmth in ocean basins outside the equatorial Pacific, particularly the North Atlantic. This excess heat acts as a powerful buffer, counteracting La Niña's cooling effect and keeping the global average temperature higher than it would be otherwise.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Confirmed La Niña:** This is the primary cooling driver. It makes outcomes similar to the record-breaking El Niño years of 2023/2024 (peaks > +1.0°C) extremely unlikely. It strongly anchors the forecast to a lower range.
*   **Evidence 2: Long-Term Warming Trend:** This acts as a uniform upward shift on the entire distribution. It makes an outcome identical to the 2020-2022 base rate (e.g., a peak of +0.6°C) less likely, and an outcome of ~+0.66°C more likely, all else being equal.
*   **Evidence 3: Unprecedented Non-Pacific Ocean Warmth:** This is a major upward factor. This evidence suggests that even with a La Niña, the global temperature will remain stubbornly high. This significantly increases the likelihood of outcomes at the upper end of, or even exceeding, the typical range for a La Niña year. I estimate this pushes the distribution up by at least +0.1°C compared to a "normal" La Niña.
*   **Evidence 4: Observed 2025 Temperature Trajectory:** The provided chart shows that the 2025 temperature anomaly has been steadily declining from its early-year peak, falling below 2023 and 2024 levels. This confirms that the cooling influence of the developing La Niña is already taking effect, providing strong observational evidence against a late-year spike back to record levels.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** A distribution centered at **+0.60°C**, based on the 2020-2022 La Niña peaks.
2.  **Update for Warming Trend:** Shift the distribution up by ~+0.06°C. The new center is around **+0.66°C**.
3.  **Update for Weaker La Niña & Warm Oceans:** These are the most significant factors. The weak La Niña provides less cooling, and the warm Atlantic provides active warming. Combined, these factors suggest a substantial further upward shift. I estimate a combined upward push of +0.10°C to +0.15°C. Applying this to the +0.66°C intermediate value moves the center of my posterior distribution to approximately **+0.80°C**.
4.  **Final Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution is centered significantly higher than the initial La Niña base rate. The median is now around +0.80°C. The competing forces of a cooling Pacific (La Niña) and a warming rest-of-the-world create significant uncertainty, but the net effect is a much warmer "La Niña year" than those seen recently.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Downside Risk:** What if the La Niña strengthens unexpectedly, or the warmth in the Atlantic finally dissipates? In this scenario, the cooling effect would be more pronounced, potentially pushing the peak anomaly down towards +0.70°C, which would still be warmer than the 2022 peak due to the background trend.
*   **Upside Risk:** What if the background warmth in the global system is even more dominant than I've estimated? The "new climate state" seen in 2023-2024 could persist, making La Niña's cooling effect almost negligible. This could push the peak anomaly towards +0.90°C or slightly higher, though the observed cooling trend in the chart makes this less probable.
*   **Conclusion:** My median of +0.80°C seems to be a reasonable balance between these competing forces. The tails of my distribution must account for these risks. A P10 of +0.70°C captures the "stronger cooling" scenario, while a P90 of +0.92°C captures the "stubborn warmth" scenario. The distribution is slightly right-skewed, acknowledging that recent surprises have been overwhelmingly on the warm side.
