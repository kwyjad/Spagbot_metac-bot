### Reference class & base rates
*   **US Bilateral Bailouts of Major Economies (Non-G7):** This is the most specific class. Direct, large-scale US-led financial rescues are rare, typically reserved for crises with significant systemic or geopolitical risk to the US. The 1994-95 bailout of Mexico ($20B loan guarantees) is the primary modern example. This class suggests a low base rate, perhaps **5-10%** for any given country in a multi-year crisis period.
*   **Federal Reserve Swap Line Activations for Emerging Markets:** The Fed has standing swap lines with a core group of developed-country central banks. It has also extended temporary lines to select emerging markets (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, South Korea) during global stress events like 2008 and 2020. Argentina is not part of this core group. Activation for a single country's idiosyncratic crisis is extremely rare. This suggests a base rate of **<5%**.
*   **Major IMF Programs with US Backing:** This is the most common form of "bailout" for countries like Argentina. The US uses its influence at the IMF to support a package. Argentina has had 22 IMF programs. While the US doesn't provide funds directly, its political approval is critical. This class is not a direct fit for the resolution criteria but indicates a high likelihood of *some* form of international support, with the US playing a key role. This context makes a US-led alternative more plausible if the IMF route is blocked.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-09-24] U.S. announces plans for a $20 billion swap line with Argentina's central bank. — ↑ — The most direct and powerful evidence of US intent to provide a financial backstop, moving from abstract possibility to concrete planning.
*   [2025-09-23] President Trump downplays the "bailout" label but affirms the U.S. will "help" Argentina. — ↑/↓ — Mixed signal. "Not a bailout" lowers the odds of a direct loan, but "we're gonna help" and personal affinity for Milei strongly supports other mechanisms like the swap line. Net effect is likely positive.
*   [2025-09-19] Argentina's central bank (BCRA) intervenes to defend the peso, using reserves. — ↑ — Indicates escalating financial distress. The more reserves are depleted, the higher the probability the BCRA will need to draw on an external credit line, like the proposed swap line, to avoid a full collapse.
*   [2025-04-12] Argentina lifts currency controls and allows the peso to float freely. — ↑ — This action exposes the peso to market forces, increasing volatility and the risk of a currency crisis that would necessitate intervention and potential external support.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Geopolitical Alignment:** The strong ideological alignment between President Milei and the hypothetical Trump administration is a primary driver. This transforms the decision from a purely economic calculation to a strategic one of supporting a key regional ally. (Large impact)
*   **Argentine Reserve Depletion:** The BCRA is actively spending its foreign reserves to defend the peso. If reserves fall below a critical threshold, Argentina will be forced to either devalue sharply or seek immediate external liquidity. A pre-arranged swap line is the fastest option. (Large impact)
*   **US Domestic Politics:** A Trump administration's "America First" posture could create headwinds for a "bailout." However, framing it as a "swap line" (a collateralized loan, not a handout) and a move to support a like-minded leader against leftist/Chinese influence could make it politically palatable. (Moderate impact)
*   **Risk of Regional Contagion:** While Argentina's direct systemic importance to the global economy is limited, a disorderly default or hyperinflationary collapse could destabilize neighboring economies (Brazil, Chile) and create migration pressures, which is a key concern for the US. (Moderate impact)
*   **Alternatives to US Support:** Argentina's ability to secure funding from other sources (e.g., China, private markets, IMF) is low. Its history with the IMF is fraught, and reliance on China would be anathema to both the Milei and Trump administrations, increasing the pressure for a US-led solution. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Exceptional Political Synergy:** Unlike the typical arm's-length relationship in past crises, the personal and ideological alignment between the US and Argentine presidents is exceptionally strong, creating a powerful non-economic incentive for US support.
*   **Preference for Bilateralism:** The hypothetical US administration may prefer a direct, bilateral tool like a swap line, which it controls completely, over working through the IMF, which it only influences. This circumvents the conditionality and bureaucracy of the IMF, which Argentina also dislikes.
*   **The Instrument Choice (Swap Line):** The focus on a swap line is key. It is less politically toxic than a direct loan/bond purchase ("bailout") and can be framed as a prudent backstop for a partner. The resolution criteria specifically include this.
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Stance:** The September announcement of a *planned* swap line is a proactive measure, unlike many past bailouts which were hastily assembled *after* a crisis erupted. This suggests the US is already committed to preventing a worst-case scenario.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10%, n=10) based on the historical rarity of direct US bilateral bailouts for countries like Argentina.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): US announcement of a planned $20B swap line. This is the single most important piece of evidence, signaling clear intent.
    *   ↑ (Large): Strong ideological alignment between Milei and Trump, providing a powerful political motive absent in most reference cases.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): BCRA is actively burning through reserves, creating the conditions of need that would trigger a draw on the swap line.
    *   ↓ (Small): Trump's "not a bailout" rhetoric suggests a potential aversion to the most direct forms of aid (loans/bond purchases), but it reinforces the swap line as the likely path.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points toward a "Yes" resolution. The prior should be revised upwards very significantly, as the specific political and economic conditions of this case overcome the low base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Argentine Central Bank (BCRA) foreign reserve levels falling below $20 billion.
    *   Argentine credit default swap (CDS) spreads widening sharply.
    *   Official statements from the US Treasury or Federal Reserve confirming technical details of the swap line are being finalized.
    *   High-level meetings between US Treasury/Fed officials and Argentine economic ministers.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Stabilization of the Argentine peso without significant BCRA intervention.
    *   A sudden rebound in Argentina's foreign reserve levels (e.g., due to a bumper soy harvest).
    *   Significant political opposition to the plan materializing within the US Congress.
    *   Argentina announces a new, substantial financing agreement with a different partner (e.g., IMF, China).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The question resolves YES only if the swap line is *drawn upon*, not just opened. Argentina may treat it as a deterrent and avoid using it if market pressure subsides.
*   **Trump's Volatility:** The US President's support could be withdrawn or altered on short notice, as his policy positions can be mercurial.
*   **Definition of "Government":** The resolution criteria are specific ("US Government"). A swap line is typically between central banks (The Fed and BCRA). While the Fed is quasi-independent, such a move would be coordinated with and approved by the Treasury/Administration, thus counting as a "US Government" action.
*   **Information Gaps:** The provided scenario lacks precise data on Argentina's current reserve levels, the burn rate, and the exact political climate in Washington D.C.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a direct US bailout is low, but the unique and powerful combination of extreme ideological alignment between leaders and the proactive announcement of a swap line in the face of a worsening currency crisis makes it highly probable that Argentina will be forced to draw on this US support before 2026.

To forecast the probability of the United States bailing out Argentina before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is "US Bilateral Bailouts of Major Economies (Non-G7)," with a base rate of 5-10%. This is chosen because direct US-led financial rescues are rare and typically reserved for crises with significant systemic or geopolitical risk to the US. The 1994-95 bailout of Mexico is a primary example.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the rarity of such events, we start with a prior probability of 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Both Argentina and Mexico faced severe economic crises with potential regional impacts. The US has a strategic interest in stabilizing both countries.
- **Differences:** The current situation involves a strong ideological alignment between the US and Argentine leadership, which was not a factor in the Mexico case. Additionally, the proposed mechanism (swap line) is different from past direct loans.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **US Announcement of Swap Line:** This is a strong indicator of intent to provide financial support. The likelihood of this announcement if the US plans to bail out Argentina (P(E | H)) is high, while it is low if the US does not plan to bail out Argentina (P(E | ~H)). This increases the probability.
- **Trump's Mixed Signals:** While Trump downplays the "bailout" label, his statement of "help" suggests support. This is a mixed signal but leans towards increasing the probability due to the political alignment.
- **BCRA Reserve Depletion:** The active use of reserves to defend the peso indicates financial distress, increasing the likelihood of needing external support. This evidence increases the probability.
- **Currency Controls Lifted:** Allowing the peso to float increases volatility and the risk of a crisis, which would necessitate intervention. This increases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The combined evidence (swap line announcement, political alignment, reserve depletion) suggests a strong likelihood ratio, significantly greater than 1.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = Updated odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** Convert updated odds back to probability. Given the strong evidence, the posterior probability is significantly higher than the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility that the swap line is never drawn upon, or that political dynamics change.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Argentina might secure alternative funding or stabilize without US intervention.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, slightly temper the probability to account for uncertainties.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the strong evidence of intent and the unique political alignment, balanced with potential uncertainties, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a high likelihood of a US bailout via the swap line being drawn upon.

Final: 75%

# Will the United States bailout Argentina before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US providing a bailout to Argentina before 2026.

The most relevant reference class is **US bilateral financial support for non-G7 economies in crisis**. Looking at historical precedents:
- The 1994-1995 Mexico bailout ($20B in loan guarantees)
- Limited direct bilateral bailouts to other countries (most support channeled through IMF)
- The US has occasionally provided currency swap lines to select countries during global crises

Given the rarity of direct US bilateral bailouts to countries like Argentina, I'll set a low prior of **10%**.

This prior reflects that:
1. Direct US bailouts to individual countries are uncommon
2. The US typically prefers multilateral solutions through the IMF
3. Argentina has a complex history with international creditors

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Argentina is experiencing a severe economic crisis with high inflation
- There's concern about regional stability and contagion effects
- The US has strategic interests in Latin America

**Key differences:**
- Unusually strong ideological alignment between Milei and Trump
- The US has already announced plans for a $20B swap line (September 2025)
- Trump has personally indicated intent to help Argentina
- The mechanism (swap line) is less politically toxic than direct loans
- This is a proactive rather than reactive approach

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: US announcement of $20B swap line (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US intends to bailout Argentina, announcing a swap line is a logical first step
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.1) - If the US had no intention to provide support, announcing such a plan would be unlikely
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.0
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump's statements about helping Argentina**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If a bailout is planned, such statements align with that intent
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Trump might make supportive statements without following through
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Argentina's central bank actively depleting reserves to defend peso**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Depleting reserves creates conditions that would necessitate drawing on external support
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Reserve depletion might be addressed through other means
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This somewhat increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Argentina's lifting of currency controls**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - This increases volatility and risk, potentially necessitating external support
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This could be part of reforms that eventually stabilize the economy
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 10% (odds of 1:9), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (US announcement of swap line):**
- Prior odds: 0.10/(1-0.10) = 0.111
- Likelihood ratio: 9.0
- Posterior odds: 0.111 × 9.0 = 1.0
- Posterior probability: 1.0/(1.0+1) = 50%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Trump's statements):**
- Prior odds: 0.50/(1-0.50) = 1.0
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 1.0 × 2.0 = 2.0
- Posterior probability: 2.0/(2.0+1) = 67%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Reserve depletion):**
- Prior odds: 0.67/(1-0.67) = 2.03
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 2.03 × 1.6 = 3.25
- Posterior probability: 3.25/(3.25+1) = 76%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Currency control lifting):**
- Prior odds: 0.76/(1-0.76) = 3.17
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- Posterior odds: 3.17 × 1.5 = 4.76
- Posterior probability: 4.76/(4.76+1) = 83%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- The swap line might be established but never drawn upon (required for resolution)
- Trump's mercurial nature could lead to withdrawal of support
- Argentina might find alternative solutions (e.g., improved exports, IMF support)
- US domestic political opposition could block the bailout

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Argentina's economy stabilizes enough to avoid drawing on the swap line
- A change in US political priorities shifts focus away from Argentina
- Argentina secures alternative funding sources

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should moderate my forecast somewhat. The key uncertainty is whether Argentina will actually need to draw on the swap line before 2026, even if it's established. This reduces my confidence from 83% to approximately 75%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the strong evidence of US intent to provide support through a swap line, the ideological alignment between leaders, and Argentina's deteriorating reserves situation, but also accounting for the uncertainty about whether the swap line will actually be drawn upon before 2026, I arrive at a final forecast of 75%.

Final: 75%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is direct, large-scale U.S. financial rescues of major non-G7 economies. This is a rare event. The 1994-95 bailout of Mexico, which involved loan guarantees and a swap line, is the most prominent modern example.
*   **Reasoning:** Over the past several decades, the U.S. has typically preferred to work through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for such crises. Direct bilateral action is reserved for situations with exceptional U.S. geopolitical or economic interests at stake. Argentina has had 22 IMF programs, highlighting the standard approach. The frequency of a direct U.S. bailout for any given country in crisis over a 1-2 year period is very low.
*   **Initial Prior:** Based on the rarity of these events (perhaps 1-2 major instances in the last 40 years across many crises), I will set a low prior probability.
*   **P(H) = 10%**. This reflects that in a typical situation where a country like Argentina is in crisis, there is about a 1 in 10 chance the U.S. would step in directly with a bailout package before 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from the historical base case in several critical ways, all of which increase the probability of a U.S. bailout.

*   **Similarities:** Argentina is experiencing a classic emerging market currency crisis, characterized by dwindling foreign reserves, high inflation, and pressure on its currency. This is the standard trigger condition for a bailout.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Exceptional Political Alignment:** The scenario describes a strong ideological synergy between the Argentine (Milei) and U.S. (hypothetical Trump) administrations. This provides a powerful non-economic motive for U.S. support that is absent in most historical cases. The decision is not just about financial stability but also about bolstering a key political ally.
    2.  **Proactive U.S. Stance:** Unlike most bailouts, which are reactively assembled as a crisis peaks, the U.S. has *proactively announced plans* for a $20 billion swap line. This is an exceptionally strong signal of intent, moving the possibility from speculative to concrete.
    3.  **Instrument Choice:** The focus on a "swap line" rather than a direct loan is politically astute. It can be framed as a collateralized, temporary liquidity provision between central banks, not a "handout" to a foreign government, making it more palatable domestically in the U.S.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate the key evidence, where H is the hypothesis "The U.S. will bailout Argentina before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: U.S. announces plans for a $20B swap line.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of the U.S. announcing these plans, given they intend to follow through with a bailout, is very high. It's a necessary public and political step.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of the U.S. making such a specific announcement but then *not* executing a bailout (either because the line isn't finalized or isn't used) is much lower. It could be a bluff to scare markets, but a public reversal on a $20B commitment would be diplomatically costly.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (>>1). This evidence dramatically increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Argentina's central bank is actively using reserves to defend the peso.**
    *   P(E2 | H): The probability that Argentina is in acute distress, given it receives a bailout, is very high. This distress is the reason for the bailout.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): The probability that Argentina is in acute distress, but a bailout *doesn't* happen, is also significant. The country could simply run out of reserves and be forced into a default or massive devaluation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors H (>1). This evidence confirms the *need* for the bailout is real and urgent.

*   **Evidence 3: President Trump's rhetoric ("not a bailout" but "we're gonna help").**
    *   P(E3 | H): This language is highly probable if the chosen bailout mechanism is a swap line. It allows the administration to claim it is providing responsible support, not a handout.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): This rhetoric is also possible if the plan is just political posturing. However, it aligns so perfectly with the swap line mechanism that it lends it credibility.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors H (>1). It reinforces the political viability of the specific action being planned.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 10% → Odds = 0.1 / 0.9 = 1/9.
*   **Updating:** The combined evidence, especially the proactive announcement of a specific plan driven by strong political alignment, is exceptionally powerful. A simple mechanical update struggles with the non-independence of the evidence, but the holistic impact is clear. The announcement of the plan (E1) is the dominant factor. This evidence is so strong that it fundamentally shifts the context away from the base rate. The question is no longer *if* the U.S. is willing to help, but whether the help will be finalized and drawn upon within the short, two-month timeframe (Nov-Dec 2025).
*   The prior odds of 1/9 should be multiplied by a large combined likelihood ratio. A factor of 10-15 seems appropriate for such a strong signal.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1/9) * 14 = 14/9 ≈ 1.55
    *   **Posterior Probability** = 1.55 / (1 + 1.55) ≈ 0.61 or **61%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must challenge this forecast. What are the strongest arguments for a "No" resolution?

1.  **The "Draghi Effect":** The announcement of the swap line might be a powerful enough deterrent on its own. Like the ECB's "whatever it takes" pledge, the mere existence of the backstop could stabilize the peso, meaning Argentina never actually needs to *draw* on the line to meet the resolution criteria. This is a highly plausible failure mode.
2.  **Timeline Risk:** The deadline is "before 2026," and the current date is October 31, 2025. This leaves only two months. While crises move fast, finalizing the technical and legal details of a $20 billion international swap line could easily be delayed into January 2026, causing the resolution to be "No" even if the bailout is imminent.
3.  **Political Volatility:** The U.S. president's support, while currently strong, could be withdrawn or complicated by other domestic or international crises.

The "deterrent effect" and the tight timeline are the most significant risks. The fact that Argentina was still intervening *after* the announcement suggests the pressure is severe, making a draw more likely. However, these risks are substantial enough to keep the probability well below 80-90%. My posterior of 61% implies a 39% chance of failure, which seems to give adequate weight to these plausible counterarguments.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for a direct U.S. bailout of a country like Argentina is low. However, the evidence in this specific case is exceptionally strong. The combination of a deep, ongoing currency crisis, an unprecedented level of political and ideological alignment between the two administrations, and the proactive public announcement of a specific, politically-palatable support mechanism (the $20B swap line) overwhelmingly suggests that the U.S. is committed to preventing an Argentine collapse. The primary uncertainties are whether the announcement itself will be a sufficient deterrent (negating the need for a draw) and whether the execution can happen within the tight two-month window. On balance, the acute need and strong political will make it more likely than not that the line will be drawn upon.

Final: 61%
