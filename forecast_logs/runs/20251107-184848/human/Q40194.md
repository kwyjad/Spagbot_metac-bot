### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Initial Phase of New UK Resettlement Schemes:** Programs like the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) or the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) serve as a useful reference. These schemes typically have a slow start due to high administrative friction (vetting, logistics, security checks). In its first full year (2014), the Syrian scheme resettled only 143 people. In its first few months, the intake is often in the dozens, not hundreds. This suggests a base rate of **50-150 people** for the first 3-4 months of a new, complex migration program.
2.  **Bilateral Migration Return/Transfer Agreements:** Agreements that involve the transfer of people between two sovereign nations (e.g., EU-Turkey deal, various intra-EU Dublin Regulation transfers) are often plagued by political friction, legal challenges, and implementation delays. The number of people actually transferred is frequently a small fraction of the initial targets or the total flow of people. This class suggests the operational reality will be slow and the numbers will be low, likely **below 100 people** in the initial pilot phase.
3.  **Linear Extrapolation of Early Data:** Based on the provided data points, the program admitted its first people around September 24, 2025. By October 24 (30 days later), 23 people had been admitted. This establishes an initial run rate of ~0.77 people/day. Extrapolating this rate for the remaining 68 days of the year (Oct 25 - Dec 31) would yield approximately 52 more people, for a total of **around 75**. However, the rate between Oct 9 and Oct 24 was slower (5 people in 15 days, or 0.33/day), suggesting a simple linear extrapolation might be optimistic.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-06** Agreement comes into force. — (→) — Establishes the program's legal basis but gives no information on implementation speed.
*   **2025-09-24** First family of three admitted under the scheme. — (↑) — Confirms the program is operational, moving from theory to practice.
*   **2025-10-09** Total admissions reach 18 people. — (↑) — Shows continued operation. The rate over the prior 15 days was ~1 person/day, setting an early benchmark.
*   **2025-10-24** Total admissions reach 23 people; RFI reports the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting. — (↓) — The rate of admissions slowed significantly to ~0.33 people/day. Reports of the deal's ineffectiveness as a deterrent reduce political capital and the incentive to accelerate it.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Administrative Capacity (Large):** The ability of UK and French authorities to vet, process, and transfer individuals is the primary bottleneck. This includes security screening, visa issuance, and arranging travel. As a new "pilot" program, these processes are likely inefficient and cautious.
2.  **Number of Successful Returns (Large):** The agreement is reciprocal: the UK accepts one asylum seeker from France for each person returned to France. If returns are low (due to legal challenges, operational difficulty, or French non-cooperation), the number of admissions will be correspondingly low.
3.  **Political Will & Pressure (Moderate):** The UK government is incentivized to show the program is working, which could lead to a push to increase numbers. Conversely, mounting criticism in both countries and the program's failure to act as a deterrent could reduce the political will to expand it.
4.  **Weather and Seasonality (Moderate):** The number of Channel crossings, the input to the entire system, typically decreases significantly in the winter months (November-December) due to poor weather. Fewer crossings mean fewer potential interceptions and returns, thus capping the number of potential admissions.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Reciprocal Dependency:** Unlike unilateral resettlement schemes (e.g., Syrian VPRS), this program's intake is directly tied to a separate, difficult action: returning migrants to France. This creates a second major point of failure and friction that does not exist in standard resettlement programs.
*   **Pilot Scheme Status:** The program is explicitly a pilot running until June 2026. This implies a cautious, small-scale, and experimental approach rather than a full-scale rollout, making a rapid ramp-up in numbers highly unlikely.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves at the end of 2025, leaving less than two months. This is insufficient time for a new, complex international program to overcome initial administrative hurdles and scale significantly.
*   **Primary Goal is Deterrence:** The admission of asylum seekers is a concession to secure the primary goal of returning crossers. If the program fails on deterrence (as early reports suggest), political support for upholding the concessionary part of the deal may weaken.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **70 people** (n≈10) seems plausible, blending the slow start of new resettlement schemes with a simple extrapolation of the initial data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The observed deceleration in the admission rate between early and late October is strong evidence that initial administrative bottlenecks are persistent or worsening.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The impending winter season will almost certainly reduce Channel crossings, limiting the raw input for the returns-for-admissions mechanism.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Reports that the agreement is failing as a deterrent and is attracting criticism reduce the political imperative to accelerate the "admissions" side of the bargain.
    *   (↑ Small) The program is demonstrably functional, having processed over 20 people, making a result of near-zero unlikely.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downwards. The decelerating rate and seasonal factors are powerful constraints. The posterior should be revised significantly lower than the initial prior, likely to a range of **35-55**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   UK or French government press releases announcing a "successful" new tranche of admissions.
    *   Reports of the first successful large-scale return of a boat of migrants to France under the deal.
    *   A sudden simplification of the online application or vetting process for applicants in France.
    *   Unseasonably calm weather in the Channel leading to a spike in crossings.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Another 2-3 week period with only single-digit admissions reported.
    *   Official statements from French authorities expressing frustration or a desire to "review" the deal.
    *   Legal challenges in the UK or France that successfully block or pause returns.
    *   Sustained periods of bad weather in the Channel.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Batch Processing:** Admissions may not be linear. Vetting could be done in batches, leading to a sudden jump in numbers after a long lull. The current slow rate might precede a larger group being admitted at once.
*   **Political Manipulation:** With the year-end approaching, the UK government might orchestrate a "good news" story by pushing through a larger-than-usual cohort for PR purposes, creating a spike that isn't representative of the program's true capacity.
*   **Data Reporting Lags:** The public reporting of numbers may not align perfectly with the date visas are granted. The final, official number may only be released after the resolution date.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria is "received visas." This is specific, but public announcements might use vaguer terms like "approved for travel" or "admitted," which could cause confusion.

**Final Research Summary:** The program is in its infancy and is constrained by administrative friction, a dependency on successful returns to France, and the approaching winter season. The initial rate of admissions has already slowed, making a significant acceleration before year-end highly improbable.

To forecast the number of people who will be admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for this forecast is derived from the initial phase of new UK resettlement schemes and bilateral migration agreements. Historical data from similar schemes suggest a slow start due to administrative and logistical challenges. The Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme, for example, resettled only 143 people in its first year. Bilateral agreements often result in fewer transfers than anticipated due to political and operational hurdles. Therefore, a base rate of 50-150 people in the first few months is reasonable, with a central estimate around 100 people.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that it involves a new, complex migration program with high administrative friction. However, it is different because it is a reciprocal agreement dependent on successful returns to France, adding another layer of complexity and potential delay. This reciprocal dependency suggests a lower number than typical resettlement schemes.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Deceleration in Admission Rate:** The slowdown from 1 person/day to 0.33/day suggests persistent administrative bottlenecks, making lower outcomes more likely.
- **Winter Seasonality:** Poor weather typically reduces Channel crossings, limiting the number of potential returns and admissions, pushing the forecast lower.
- **Political Criticism:** Mounting criticism and the program's failure as a deterrent reduce the political will to accelerate admissions, favoring lower outcomes.
- **Operational Status:** The program is operational, having admitted 23 people, which makes a near-zero outcome unlikely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered around 70 people, the evidence strongly points towards a downward adjustment. The deceleration in admissions, seasonal factors, and political criticism suggest a revised range of 35-55 people. The posterior distribution is thus centered lower than the prior, with reduced variance due to consistent evidence of constraints.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden batch processing of admissions or political manipulation to boost numbers.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden political push or batch processing could lead to a spike in admissions, though this is less likely given current trends.
- **Alternative Forecast:** An alternative scenario could see admissions reaching 70-80 if administrative processes are streamlined or political pressure mounts to demonstrate success.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Considering the evidence and potential tail risks, the final percentiles are adjusted to reflect a conservative estimate with some allowance for unexpected increases.

# Forecast: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of:

1. **Early implementation data**: 23 people admitted in the first 30 days (Sept 24 - Oct 24, 2025), averaging 0.77 people/day
2. **Similar migration schemes**: New resettlement programs typically start slowly with administrative bottlenecks

Based on these reference classes, I'll use a prior centered around 50-70 people by the end of 2025, with significant uncertainty. This assumes some continuation of the early implementation rate with potential for modest acceleration or deceleration.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- This is a new bilateral migration agreement requiring complex coordination
- It involves security vetting, administrative processing, and political considerations
- The program has demonstrated operational capability (23 people already admitted)

**Key differences:**
- The reciprocal nature (one-for-one exchange) creates a hard dependency on successful returns to France
- The program is explicitly a pilot scheme, suggesting intentionally limited scale
- Winter weather (Nov-Dec) will likely reduce Channel crossings, limiting the input for returns
- The program is already showing signs of deceleration (slower rate in mid-October)
- Very short time horizon (less than 2 months remaining in 2025)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing numbers lower:**
- Deceleration observed: From Oct 9-24, only 5 people were admitted (0.33/day), down from 1/day in the previous period
- RFI reports the deal "is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting" (Oct 24)
- Winter weather typically reduces Channel crossings significantly
- The reciprocal mechanism creates a bottleneck - UK can only admit as many as they successfully return

**Evidence pushing numbers higher:**
- The program is operational and has successfully processed 23 people
- Political pressure to demonstrate success could lead to efforts to accelerate admissions
- Administrative processes often become more efficient after initial implementation

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 60 people, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on deceleration evidence:**
- The slowdown from 1.0 to 0.33 people/day is significant
- If this lower rate continues for the remaining ~55 days of 2025, we'd expect only ~18 more people
- This would yield a total of 41 people (23 + 18)

**Update on seasonal factors:**
- Winter weather typically reduces Channel crossings by 30-50%
- This further constrains the potential for returns and thus admissions
- This suggests the 41 estimate might be optimistic

**Posterior after updates:**
- Mean shifts downward to ~40 people
- Increased uncertainty in the upper tail due to potential for administrative improvements or political push
- Decreased uncertainty in the lower tail as the program is already operational with 23 people admitted

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the UK government's ability to accelerate processing if politically motivated
- Admissions might happen in batches rather than linearly, creating potential for sudden jumps
- The agreement might be modified or expanded in response to criticism

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **High scenario (90-100)**: UK government prioritizes demonstrating success, streamlines processes, and pushes through a large batch in December
- **Low scenario (25-30)**: Political will collapses as criticism mounts, winter reduces crossings dramatically, and almost no new admissions occur

**Adjustments needed:**
- Widen my uncertainty bands to account for potential non-linear processing
- Slightly increase upper percentiles to account for potential political intervention

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 28
P20: 32
P40: 38
P60: 45
P80: 55
P90: 65

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is derived from a simple extrapolation of the program's initial performance. This is more specific than using a broader reference class of other migration schemes.

*   **Data Points:**
    *   September 24, 2025: 3 people admitted.
    *   October 9, 2025: 18 people total (15 people in 15 days, a rate of 1.0/day).
    *   October 24, 2025: 23 people total (5 people in the next 15 days, a rate of ~0.33/day).
*   **Extrapolation:** The most recent rate is ~0.33 people per day. There are 68 days remaining in 2025 (from Oct 25 to Dec 31). Extrapolating this most recent rate gives: 68 days * 0.33 people/day ≈ 22 additional people.
*   **Prior Estimate:** This leads to a total estimate of 23 (current) + 22 (future) = 45 people.
*   **Prior Distribution:** I will set my prior distribution centered on this value of 45. Given the novelty of the program, the uncertainty is high. A secondary reference class of other new government schemes (which often start very slowly) supports the idea that the number will be in the low dozens, not hundreds. My prior distribution is therefore centered around a median of **45**, with a wide spread, for instance, an 80% confidence interval of [30, 80].

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The base case is a simple continuation of the most recently observed rate of admissions.

*   **Similarities:** The underlying administrative processes and political context will likely remain similar over the next two months. There is no indication of a major policy or process change.
*   **Differences (and why they matter):**
    *   **Seasonality:** The forecast period is November-December. Historically, weather in the English Channel worsens significantly during these months, leading to a sharp drop in small boat crossings. Since the number of admissions is tied to the number of people returned to France (who are caught crossing), a reduction in crossings will act as a strong physical constraint on the program's inputs, likely pushing the rate of admissions even lower than the 0.33/day observed in October.
    *   **Political Pressure:** The RFI report notes the deal is failing as a deterrent and criticism is mounting. This reduces the political will to accelerate the program. If the primary goal (deterrence) is not being met, the incentive to process the "concession" part of the deal (admissions) may weaken.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on my prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Decelerating Rate (from 1.0/day to 0.33/day).** This is strong evidence that the initial, higher rate was not sustainable, perhaps representing a pre-vetted backlog. The lower, more recent rate is a better indicator of the program's true capacity. This evidence strongly supports a lower final number and makes outcomes >70 much less likely.
*   **Evidence 2: Approaching Winter.** This is a highly reliable seasonal factor. Fewer crossings mean fewer potential returns, which directly caps the number of potential admissions. This is a strong downward pressure on the forecast for the Nov-Dec period.
*   **Evidence 3: Reports of Failing Deterrence and Criticism.** This suggests the political environment for the program is negative. This is a moderate downward pressure, as it could lead to a de-prioritization or quiet stalling of the program by either the UK or French government.
*   **Evidence 4: The program is operational.** The fact that 23 people have been processed provides a hard floor for the forecast and makes an outcome below this number impossible. It also suggests a complete and immediate halt is less likely than a continued slow trickle.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at 45.
*   **Update:** The evidence from seasonality and political friction strongly suggests that even the most recent rate of 0.33/day may be optimistic for the coming two months. These factors are not yet reflected in the data we have. Therefore, I must adjust my distribution downwards from the initial prior of 45. The median of my posterior should be lower than 45. The combination of these factors makes a final tally in the 30s or low 40s more likely than one in the high 40s or 50s.
*   **Posterior:** I will shift the median of my distribution down to **42**. The strong downward pressures (especially weather) suggest the left tail is more probable, but I will maintain a wide distribution to account for uncertainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher Outcome):** The government, facing criticism that the program is ineffective, could orchestrate a PR-driven "success" by processing a large batch of applicants before the end of the year to generate positive headlines (e.g., "Nearly 100 asylum seekers brought to safety under new deal"). This could cause a sudden, non-linear jump in the numbers. This is a plausible tail risk on the upside.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower Outcome):** The program could stall almost completely. A combination of terrible weather, legal challenges, and political fallout could reduce admissions to a mere handful over the next two months. The final number could end up being below 30. This is also a plausible tail risk.
*   **Rebuttal and Adjustment:** The "PR stunt" scenario is plausible and requires me to keep a reasonably high P90. A total of 75 (implying ~50 more people are processed) seems like a credible upper bound for such a stunt. The "stall" scenario is also credible, justifying a P10 near 30. My central estimate remains anchored by the existing data and predictable seasonal effects, but the tails of my distribution must be wide enough to account for these political and operational volatilities. My proposed median of 42, with an 80% confidence interval from 30 to 75, seems to balance these risks appropriately.

### 6. Final Percentiles

Based on the reasoning above, I have constructed the following probabilistic forecast.

P10: 30
P20: 35
P40: 40
P60: 48
P80: 65
P90: 75
