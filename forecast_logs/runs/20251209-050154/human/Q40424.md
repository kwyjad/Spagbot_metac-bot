### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Judicial Resignations in Pakistan During Constitutional Crises:** The most relevant reference class is the behavior of the Pakistani judiciary during periods of intense executive-judicial conflict. The 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement, triggered by General Musharraf's suspension of the Chief Justice and imposition of a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO), is the primary analogue. During that crisis, approximately 60 of the 100 superior court judges refused to take the oath under the PCO, effectively a mass forced resignation/removal. This event, however, involved a military ruler and a clear-cut choice (take the oath or be removed). The current situation involves a parliamentary amendment, making the act of protest resignation a more voluntary and individual decision.
    *   **Base Rate:** A mass defiance event on the scale of 2007 is a rare, once-in-a-generation occurrence. A base rate for *voluntary resignations* in a crisis is lower than forced removals. A plausible range for protest resignations in a major crisis might be 2-10 judges, with a fat tail possibility of a 2007-style event (20+).
2.  **Routine Resignations from Pakistan's Superior Judiciary:** In normal times, resignations are extremely rare. Judges typically serve until the mandatory retirement age of 65 (Supreme Court) or 62 (High Courts). Early departures are usually due to health reasons or occasionally to pre-empt removal for misconduct.
    *   **Base Rate:** Fewer than one judge per year resigns for non-crisis reasons across the entire superior judiciary (~170 judges). This base rate is not particularly useful for the current context.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed, fundamentally altering judicial powers and independence. — **Large ↑** — This is the primary causal trigger for protest resignations.
*   **2025-11-15** Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resign in protest. — **Large ↑** — Established that resignation is a credible response by senior, respected judges, setting a precedent.
*   **2025-11-17** Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns, citing the amendment. — **Moderate ↑** — Showed the protest was not confined to the Supreme Court, but the momentum did not immediately build.
*   **2025-11-18** TTAP opposition alliance, led by Imran Khan, calls for nationwide protests. — **Small ↑** — Creates a political atmosphere supportive of judicial defiance but has limited direct influence on judges' personal decisions.
*   **Late Nov** Bar Associations across Pakistan hold protests and condemn the amendment. — **Moderate ↑** — Provides crucial institutional and moral support for judges considering resignation, making the act less isolating.
*   **2025-11-20 to 2025-12-08** No further resignations announced from any of the superior courts. — **Large ↓** — The most significant recent evidence. The initial shock did not trigger an immediate cascade, suggesting a new, tense equilibrium has been reached.
*   **2025-12-08** Supreme Court grants bail to Imran Khan in several cases. — **Moderate ↓** — Signals that the remaining judges, even without their constitutional jurisdiction, believe they can still exercise meaningful power and check the executive, reducing the incentive to resign.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand on Judicial Independence (Large):** The amendment is a direct assault on the judiciary's power and autonomy. Judges with a strong ideological commitment to the separation of powers and the rule of law are the most likely to resign as a matter of conscience. This was the likely driver for the first three.
2.  **Peer Effects & Social Cascade (Large):** The decision to resign is easier if others do it. The first resignations broke the dam. However, the lack of a subsequent wave suggests the conditions for a full cascade have not been met. A resignation by another highly respected senior judge could still trigger a small, secondary wave.
3.  **Government Pressure & Inducements (Large):** The executive and military establishment have powerful tools (both coercive and persuasive) to discourage further resignations. These can range from private assurances and promises of future appointments (e.g., to the new Constitutional Court) to implicit threats against judges or their families.
4.  **Perceived Efficacy of Resigning vs. "Fighting from Within" (Moderate):** Judges must weigh whether their resignation serves as a powerful symbolic protest or an abdication of their duty to resist from the bench. The recent Supreme Court bail for Imran Khan strengthens the "fight from within" argument.
5.  **Support from the Bar (Moderate):** Strong, unified, and sustained protests by the various Bar Councils and Associations provide a crucial support system for judges. If the legal community's protests intensify, it could embolden more judges to step down.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Constitutional vs. Extra-Constitutional Crisis:** Unlike the 2007 PCO which was an extra-constitutional military action, the 27th Amendment was passed by Parliament. This creates a "veneer of legality" that makes collective defiance more complex than refusing an illegal order from a dictator.
*   **Targeted Nature of the Changes:** The amendment specifically dismantles the Supreme Court's constitutional role and institutionalizes executive control over transfers. This is a more direct and fundamental attack on the judiciary's power than previous crises, potentially provoking a stronger reaction.
*   **Lack of a Unified Front:** The judiciary in 2025 appears more internally divided than the one that faced Musharraf in 2007. The initial resignations came from judges known for their independent and liberal jurisprudence; it is unclear if this sentiment is shared widely enough to fuel a mass movement.
*   **Absence of an Immediate Cascade:** In past crises, events have often moved quickly. The three-week lull since the last resignation is a significant deviation, suggesting that many judges have made a calculated decision to wait and see or to remain in their posts.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Given the unprecedented nature of the amendment, a reasonable prior would be centered slightly above the three resignations that have already occurred, but with significant uncertainty and a wide tail to account for the possibility of a 2007-style cascade. A Negative Binomial distribution might be appropriate, centered around 4-6 with high variance.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The initial three resignations confirmed this was a major event and set the floor at 3.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The subsequent three-week period with zero new resignations is the strongest piece of evidence. It heavily weighs against a cascade scenario and suggests the initial wave has crested.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The Supreme Court's ability to grant bail to Imran Khan demonstrates remaining institutional agency, strengthening the rationale for judges to stay and fight from within.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Ongoing protests from Bar Associations provide some upward pressure but have proven insufficient to trigger more resignations thus far.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence since mid-November, particularly the lack of further resignations, should pull the posterior distribution significantly downwards and reduce its variance. The mean of the forecast should move closer to the current count of 3, with a much-reduced probability assigned to outcomes greater than 5.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Resignation of a Chief Justice of a High Court or another senior Supreme Court judge.
    *   Bar Associations call for a complete boycott of courts until the amendment is withdrawn.
    *   Leaked reports of direct government threats against specific judges, which could backfire and trigger protest resignations.
    *   The new Federal Constitutional Court makes an immediate, highly controversial ruling.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A collective statement from a High Court bench affirming their intent to continue their duties.
    *   Key judges who were considered "on the fence" accept appointments to new judicial committees.
    *   Protests by lawyers and civil society begin to lose momentum and attendance.
    *   The government initiates a dialogue with the judiciary or Bar Councils to "smooth implementation."

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria specify "resign." This excludes judges who might be forcibly transferred, refuse a transfer, or are later removed for non-compliance. The count is strictly for voluntary resignations.
*   **Information Lag:** A resignation may not become public for several days. Given the short resolution window (ending Dec 31), a resignation late in the month could be missed until after the fact.
*   **High Volatility:** The situation remains tense. A single unpredictable event (e.g., a violent crackdown on protests, a controversial judicial appointment) could dramatically alter the calculations for dozens of judges overnight.
*   **Individual Psychology:** The final number depends on the personal calculations, courage, and ideology of about 160 individuals, which is inherently difficult to forecast.
*   **Data Gaps:** The internal deliberations of the judiciary and the back-channel communications between the government and judges are opaque, limiting a full understanding of the pressures at play.

**Final Research Summary:** The initial wave of three high-profile resignations following the 27th Amendment has not triggered a wider cascade. The subsequent three-week lull and signs of the remaining judiciary's continued agency suggest that most judges have opted to "fight from within," making a final count much higher than the current three unlikely.

To forecast the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the structured probabilistic forecasting approach outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant historical reference is the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement, where approximately 60 out of 100 judges refused to take the oath under the PCO. However, this was a forced removal rather than voluntary resignations. For voluntary resignations in a crisis, a plausible range is 2-10 judges, with a fat tail possibility of a 2007-style event (20+). Given the current context, a reasonable prior might center around 3-5 resignations, acknowledging the initial three resignations already observed.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** Both situations involve significant constitutional changes perceived as undermining judicial independence. The initial resignations indicate a protest response similar to past crises.
   - **Differences:** The 27th Amendment was passed by Parliament, providing a legal framework that complicates mass defiance. The lack of an immediate cascade suggests a more cautious approach by the judiciary.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Initial Resignations (Large ↑):** The resignations of three judges immediately following the amendment indicate a strong protest response.
   - **Lack of Further Resignations (Large ↓):** The absence of additional resignations over three weeks suggests a stabilization and reluctance to escalate.
   - **Bar Association Protests (Moderate ↑):** Ongoing protests provide support for potential resignations but have not yet catalyzed further action.
   - **Supreme Court Actions (Moderate ↓):** The court's ability to grant bail to Imran Khan suggests remaining judicial agency, reducing the incentive to resign.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 3-5 resignations with a wide variance.
   - **Evidence:** The lack of further resignations significantly reduces the likelihood of a large number of resignations. The posterior distribution shifts towards the lower end, closer to the current count of 3, with reduced variance.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of sudden political or social changes that could trigger more resignations. However, the current evidence strongly suggests stabilization.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A sudden increase in resignations could occur if a highly respected judge resigns or if government actions provoke a stronger response.
   - **Rebuttal:** The three-week lull and continued judicial actions suggest a low probability of a large increase in resignations.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast is adjusted to reflect the current evidence and likelihood of further resignations.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 4

# Forecasting Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Late 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two reference classes:

1. **Primary reference class**: Judicial resignations during constitutional crises in Pakistan
   - The 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement saw approximately 60 out of 100 superior court judges refuse to take oath under Musharraf's PCO (effectively mass resignations)
   - However, that was a more extreme scenario with a military ruler directly removing judges
   - For voluntary protest resignations in constitutional crises, a more reasonable base rate would be 5-10 judges

2. **Secondary reference class**: Routine judicial resignations in Pakistan
   - In normal times, fewer than 1 judge per year resigns from the superior courts before retirement age
   - This provides a lower bound but is less relevant given the extraordinary circumstances

Given these reference classes, I'll use a prior distribution centered around 6-8 judges, with significant uncertainty (wide tails) to account for both the possibility of minimal additional resignations and the possibility of a larger cascade.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases:**
- The 27th Amendment represents a fundamental challenge to judicial independence, similar to past constitutional crises
- There is significant civil society and opposition mobilization against the changes
- The initial resignations demonstrate that some judges view this as a matter of principle worth resigning over

**Key differences:**
- Unlike the 2007 PCO, this is a parliamentary amendment with a "veneer of legality" rather than an extra-constitutional military action
- The amendment specifically targets the Supreme Court's constitutional jurisdiction rather than removing specific judges
- The initial wave of resignations (3 judges) has not immediately triggered a cascade effect
- Three weeks have passed without additional resignations, suggesting a different dynamic than past crises

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting higher numbers of resignations:**
- Three judges have already resigned in protest (floor of 3) (+2)
- The amendment fundamentally alters judicial powers and independence (+2)
- Bar associations across Pakistan are holding protests, providing moral support for judges (+1)
- Opposition alliance led by Imran Khan is organizing nationwide protests (+0.5)

**Evidence supporting lower numbers of resignations:**
- Three-week lull with no additional resignations since mid-November (-3)
- Supreme Court's recent bail grant to Imran Khan demonstrates judges can still exercise meaningful power (-2)
- The amendment passed through parliamentary process rather than military decree, giving it procedural legitimacy (-1)
- Lack of a unified judicial front compared to 2007 crisis (-1)

**Net evidence assessment:** The evidence, particularly the three-week lull without new resignations, suggests that the initial wave has crested and a mass exodus is unlikely. The likelihood ratio favors outcomes closer to the current count of 3 rather than a large-scale protest movement.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered around 6-8 judges with wide tails, I need to update based on the evidence.

The strongest evidence is the three-week period without additional resignations, which significantly reduces the probability of a cascade scenario. This shifts the distribution downward.

**Prior distribution:** Mean ~7, wide variance (3-20+ range)
**Likelihood function:** Strongly favors lower values (3-5 range) given the lull in resignations
**Posterior distribution:** Mean ~4-5, reduced variance, concentrated mass in 3-6 range

The posterior distribution should:
- Have a floor at 3 (confirmed resignations)
- Place highest probability on outcomes between 3-6
- Assign diminishing probability to values above 6
- Maintain some small probability for a delayed cascade (10+ resignations)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the three-week lull. Historical patterns show that protest movements can have multiple waves, and a triggering event could still occur.
- The internal deliberations of judges are opaque. There could be many judges contemplating resignation but waiting for the right moment or additional developments.
- The resolution window extends through December 31, giving time for new developments that could trigger additional resignations.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would place more weight on a delayed cascade scenario. If a highly respected Chief Justice of a High Court were to resign, or if the government took additional actions perceived as attacks on the judiciary, we could still see 10-15 resignations by year-end.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The three-week period without resignations suggests that most judges have made their calculations and decided to remain. The Supreme Court's continued exercise of power (granting bail to Imran Khan) indicates that many judges believe they can be more effective by staying in their positions.

**Adjustments:**
I'll slightly increase the upper percentiles to account for the possibility of a delayed cascade triggered by new developments, while keeping the median relatively low based on current evidence.

Here is a full probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary reference class for this forecast is the behavior of Pakistan's superior judiciary during major constitutional crises. The most significant modern precedent is the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement, which was triggered by General Musharraf's attempt to remove the Chief Justice. In that event, approximately 60 of the 100 superior court judges were effectively removed for refusing to take an oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO).

However, the 2007 event involved a clear-cut choice—take an illegal oath from a military ruler or be removed—making it more of a mass forced removal than a series of voluntary resignations. The current crisis stems from a parliamentary amendment, making the decision to resign more individual and complex.

Therefore, my prior distribution for the total number of resignations in this crisis will be anchored below the 2007 number but will account for the severity of the constitutional changes. I will set a prior with a median around 7 resignations, but with a very wide spread to reflect the high uncertainty and the tail risk of a 2007-style mass defiance. For example, a prior might have a 10th percentile of 2 and a 90th percentile of 20.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation resembles the 2007 crisis in that it represents a major executive action perceived as a fundamental assault on judicial independence, sparking condemnation from bar associations and opposition parties.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Nature of the Action:** The 27th Amendment, having been passed by Parliament, has a "veneer of legality" that the 2007 military PCO lacked. This makes collective defiance more difficult and suggests a lower number of resignations.
    *   **Momentum:** The 2007 crisis saw sustained, escalating action. The current crisis saw an initial burst of three resignations followed by a multi-week pause, suggesting momentum for a mass resignation has stalled. This is a crucial difference pointing to a much lower final number.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The forecast must incorporate events that have already occurred in the resolution period (November-December 2025).

*   **Evidence for Higher Numbers:**
    *   **Three initial resignations (Nov 15-17):** Two Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice resigned. This is strong evidence that the amendment is seen as a red line by at least some senior judges, setting a credible precedent for resignation as a form of protest. This establishes a hard floor of 3 for the final count.
    *   **Support from Bar Associations:** Ongoing protests from the legal community provide moral and institutional support for judges considering resignation, making the act less isolating.

*   **Evidence for Lower Numbers:**
    *   **Three-week lull (Nov 18 - Dec 8):** The absence of any further resignations for three weeks is the single most powerful piece of evidence. It strongly suggests that an immediate cascade or mass resignation is not occurring. This evidence dramatically lowers the probability of a high final count (e.g., 10+).
    *   **Judiciary exercising remaining power (Dec 8):** The Supreme Court granting bail to Imran Khan signals that the remaining judges believe they can still function as a check on the executive. This strengthens the "fight from within" argument, reducing the incentive for further protest resignations.

The evidence for a lower number, particularly the three-week lull, is substantially stronger than the evidence for a higher number at this point.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered around a median of 7, with a fat tail allowing for a 2007-style event.
*   **Update 1 (Three Resignations):** The first three resignations confirm the crisis is severe. This eliminates outcomes below 3 and shifts the entire distribution to the right. The median of my belief might move up to 8-10, as a cascade now seems plausible.
*   **Update 2 (The Lull & SC Bail):** The subsequent three weeks with no resignations is highly inconsistent with a cascade scenario but very consistent with a scenario where only a small number of judges resign on principle. This new evidence acts as a strong likelihood ratio in favor of low final numbers. It drastically prunes the right tail of the distribution (outcomes of 10+ now seem very unlikely) and pulls the central tendency sharply down towards the current count of 3.
*   **Posterior:** My posterior distribution is now heavily concentrated at 3, with a small right skew. The most likely outcome is that no more judges will resign before December 31. There remains a small but non-zero chance of one or two more resignations if a new provocation occurs. The median of the posterior distribution is now 3.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The lull could be the "calm before the storm." Perhaps judges are coordinating behind the scenes for a second, more impactful wave of resignations. A new, egregious action by the government (e.g., attempting to forcibly transfer a respected judge) could be the trigger. This would lead to a final count of 5-10.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this is speculative. The hard evidence of the three-week lull and the Supreme Court's recent actions points toward a new, stable equilibrium where most judges have decided to stay. With only three weeks left in the resolution period, a major, coordinated wave of resignations seems unlikely without a significant new catalyst.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast is heavily weighted on the number staying at 3. I need to ensure the upper percentiles leave enough room for the "new trigger" scenario. A P90 of 5 seems appropriate; it acknowledges a ~10% chance of at least two more resignations, which is a reasonable hedge against the volatility of the situation.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final forecast is heavily anchored on the three resignations that have already occurred, with a small probability of one or two additional resignations before the end of the year. The distribution is therefore tightly packed at the low end.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 4
P90: 5
