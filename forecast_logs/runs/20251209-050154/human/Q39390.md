### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All UK Christmas Number Ones (1952-2024):** This class includes all 73 winners. It provides the broadest historical context but may be less relevant due to significant changes in music consumption and chart mechanics.
    *   **Base Rates (approximate):**
        *   2020s: 4% (3 songs)
        *   2010s: 10% (7 songs)
        *   2000s: 14% (10 songs)
        *   1990s: 14% (10 songs)
        *   1980s: 14% (10 songs)
        *   1970s: 11% (8 songs)
        *   1960s or earlier: 34% (25 songs)
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a direct count of the decade of release for each of the 73 number ones. Its primary limitation is that over 95% of songs in this set were contemporary releases (released in the same year or the year prior). The recent trend of older songs winning represents a potential regime change, making this base rate a poor predictor.

2.  **Post-Streaming Dominance / Post-X Factor Era (2014-2024):** This class begins after the last X Factor winner, capturing the modern era dominated by streaming, social media campaigns (LadBaby), and now, classic revivals. N=11.
    *   **Base Rates:**
        *   2020s: 27% (3 songs: LadBaby)
        *   2010s: 45% (5 songs: LadBaby x2, Ed Sheeran, Clean Bandit, NHS Choir)
        *   1980s: 18% (2 songs: Wham!)
        *   1970s: 9% (1 song: Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' in a 2015 streaming anomaly)
        *   Other decades: 0%
    *   **Reasoning:** This class reflects the current mechanics of the chart race more accurately. It shows a strong tendency for contemporary releases (8 of 11) but also establishes the precedent for older songs winning.

3.  **Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024):** This is a very small but highly relevant reference class (N=2), representing the current "power vacuum" state.
    *   **Base Rates:**
        *   1980s: 100% (2 songs: Wham! in '23 and '24)
        *   All other decades: 0%
    *   **Reasoning:** This class reflects the immediate past and the most recent market behavior. Its obvious limitation is the tiny sample size, making it highly sensitive to noise but also potentially the most accurate signal of the current regime.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-12-23** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) secures the Christmas number one for a second consecutive year. ↑ 1980s — This solidifies the "classic revival" trend, demonstrating that 2023 was not a fluke and that perennial streaming hits can dominate in the absence of a strong contemporary campaign.
*   **2023-11-21** LadBaby announces they will not release a 2023 Christmas single. ↓ 2020s — This officially ended a five-year era of guaranteed, high-profile contemporary charity singles, creating the power vacuum that allowed a classic song to win. This vacuum persists.
*   **2023-12-22** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) becomes Christmas number one for the first time, 39 years after its release. ↑ 1980s — This was the pivotal event that broke the contemporary-release paradigm of the LadBaby era and established a new precedent for legacy tracks winning.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Perennial Streaming Power:** Classic Christmas songs ("Last Christmas," "All I Want for Christmas Is You") are mainstays on millions of personal and curated playlists. Their cumulative streaming volume creates an enormous baseline of chart points each December. (Large driver for older decades, esp. 1980s/1990s).
2.  **Coordinated Novelty/Charity Campaign:** The model perfected by LadBaby. Requires a well-known personality, a catchy parody of a classic song, a charity partner, and a strong social media push. This can overcome the streaming advantage of classics through high-volume, low-cost downloads. (Large driver for 2020s).
3.  **Major Artist Contemporary Release:** A new, genuinely popular song released in Q4 by a global superstar (e.g., Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Adele), especially if it has a festive theme. This combines organic popularity with a strong promotional push. (Moderate driver for 2020s).
4.  **Social Media "Protest" Campaign:** The RATM 2009 model. Requires a clear "villain" to rally against (like The X Factor) and significant grassroots organization. Less likely now without a single dominant force to oppose. (Small driver for older decades).
5.  **Media Narrative:** The story around the race can become self-fulfilling. The "Wham! for #1" narrative was powerful in 2023. A new narrative could emerge around another classic act (e.g., The Pogues) or a new contender. (Moderate driver, can affect any decade).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Structural Power Vacuum:** Unlike most of the last 20 years, there is no institutional "kingmaker" like The X Factor or a recurring, dominant force like LadBaby. This lack of a focal point for contemporary releases leaves the door wide open for classics.
*   **Streaming Dominance:** The chart is now heavily influenced by streaming, which has a strong incumbency bias. In the past, single sales (physical or download) were key, allowing new campaigns to spike to number one more easily.
*   **Campaign Fatigue:** After five years of LadBaby, the public and media may have less appetite for another formulaic charity/novelty campaign, making it harder for a new act to replicate that success.
*   **Lack of a "Villain":** The 2009 RATM campaign was fueled by opposition to Simon Cowell and The X Factor. There is no equivalent, widely disliked cultural entity to rally against in 2025, weakening the potential for a "protest" winner.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior would be based on the Post-X Factor era (2014-2024), giving significant weight to contemporary releases (2010s/2020s) but acknowledging the possibility of an older song winning. Equivalent n ≈ 11.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ **1980s (Large):** Wham!'s back-to-back wins in '23 and '24 are powerful evidence of a new regime where streaming classics can dominate.
    *   ↓ **2020s (Large):** The persistent vacuum left by LadBaby, with no obvious successor, significantly lowers the probability of a coordinated contemporary campaign succeeding.
    *   ↑ **Older Decades (Moderate):** The continued growth of streaming as a share of chart calculation structurally favors songs with decades of accumulated cultural relevance.
    *   ↔ **(Neutral):** As of today, there is no sign of a major artist Q4 release or a nascent social media campaign, maintaining the status quo that favors the classics.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift significantly away from the 2020s and towards the 1980s. The probability for the 1980s should be substantially higher than the prior, with smaller increases for other "classic" decades like the 1970s and 1990s.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP (older song wins):**
    *   Early betting odds from bookmakers (e.g., William Hill, Ladbrokes) list Wham!, Mariah Carey, or The Pogues as favorites.
    *   No announcement of a high-profile charity single by a major UK celebrity by early December.
    *   Music industry news focuses on the "battle of the classics" narrative.
    *   Early-December streaming charts show perennial Christmas hits already dominating the top 10.
*   **DOWN (older song wins) / UP (2020s song wins):**
    *   A major YouTuber, TikTok star, or celebrity announces a charity single with a strong hook.
    *   A global superstar (e.g., Harry Styles, Dua Lipa) releases a surprise track in late November that gains immediate traction.
    *   A grassroots social media campaign for a specific new song begins to trend on X or TikTok.

To forecast the decade in which the 2025 UK Christmas number one will have been originally released, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities of each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Reference Class:** Post-Streaming Dominance / Post-X Factor Era (2014-2024)  
- This class captures the modern era's chart mechanics, including streaming and social media influences. It reflects both contemporary releases and the recent trend of older songs winning.

**Base Rates:**
- 2020s: 27%
- 2010s: 45%
- 1980s: 18%
- 1970s: 9%
- Other decades: 0%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**  
- The current scenario continues to be influenced by streaming and social media, similar to the Post-X Factor era.

**Differences:**  
- The absence of LadBaby and a clear contemporary contender creates a power vacuum, increasing the likelihood of older songs winning, as seen with Wham!'s recent victories.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence:**
- **Wham!'s Back-to-Back Wins (2023, 2024):** Strong evidence for the 1980s. The likelihood of an 80s song winning is high given this trend.
- **LadBaby's Exit:** Reduces the likelihood of a 2020s song winning, as no similar campaigns have emerged.
- **Streaming Dominance:** Favors older songs with established popularity, especially from the 1980s and 1990s.

**Likelihood Assessments:**
- **1980s:** High likelihood given recent wins and streaming power.
- **2020s:** Lower likelihood due to the lack of a dominant contemporary campaign.
- **2010s:** Moderate likelihood; while less likely than the 1980s, still possible due to recent history.
- **1970s and earlier:** Low likelihood; no recent evidence supports these decades.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Key Update for 1980s:**
- Prior odds for 1980s = 18%
- Likelihood ratio (based on Wham!'s wins and streaming power) significantly increases the odds.
- Posterior probability for 1980s increases substantially.

**Other Updates:**
- **2020s:** Posterior decreases due to the lack of a strong contemporary campaign.
- **2010s:** Slight decrease but remains plausible.
- **1970s and earlier:** Remain low due to lack of supporting evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise contemporary release or a new social media campaign.
- **Tail Risks:** A major artist could release a surprise hit, shifting probabilities.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A 2010s song could win if a strong campaign emerges.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the updated evidence.

### 7. Output Format

Final forecast probabilities:

1960s or earlier: 1%  
1970s: 2%  
1980s: 60%  
1990s: 5%  
2000s: 2%  
2010s: 20%  
2020s: 10%  

(sum ~100%)

# Forecasting the Decade of the 2025 UK Christmas Number One

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the "Post-LadBaby Era" (2023-2024) as my primary reference class, with some influence from the "Post-Streaming Dominance Era" (2014-2024). The Post-LadBaby Era is most relevant because:

- It represents the current regime where classic songs can dominate in the absence of coordinated campaigns
- It captures the structural power vacuum left by LadBaby's departure
- It reflects the current streaming-dominated chart mechanics

Initial base rates:
- 1980s: 70% (heavily weighted from the 100% in Post-LadBaby era)
- 2020s: 15% (reduced from Post-Streaming era due to LadBaby's absence)
- 1990s: 5% (potential for other classic Christmas songs)
- 1970s: 5% (potential for other classic Christmas songs)
- 2010s: 3% (reduced relevance of recent but not current songs)
- 2000s: 1% (few streaming-dominant Christmas classics from this era)
- 1960s or earlier: 1% (limited streaming presence despite historical importance)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The structural power vacuum created by LadBaby's departure persists
- Streaming continues to dominate chart calculations, favoring perennial classics
- Wham!'s "Last Christmas" has demonstrated the viability of older songs winning

**Key differences:**
- Wham!'s consecutive wins may create expectation and momentum for a "three-peat"
- The novelty of an older song winning has diminished, potentially reducing media attention
- There's more time for a new campaign or artist to emerge compared to the immediate post-LadBaby transition
- The music industry may actively try to counter the trend with strategic Q4 releases

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Wham!'s back-to-back wins (2023-2024)**
- P(E|1980s): Very high (~0.9) - This directly supports the 1980s hypothesis
- P(E|~1980s): Low (~0.2) - This pattern suggests a regime change favoring classics

**Evidence 2: Continued absence of LadBaby**
- P(E|2020s): Moderate-low (~0.4) - Reduces the chance of a contemporary hit
- P(E|~2020s): High (~0.8) - Creates space for older songs to dominate

**Evidence 3: Streaming dominance in chart calculations**
- P(E|1980s/1990s): High (~0.8) - Structurally favors songs with decades of cultural relevance
- P(E|2020s): Moderate (~0.5) - New songs need exceptional momentum to overcome classics

**Evidence 4: No clear "villain" to rally against**
- P(E|older decades): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Reduces likelihood of protest campaigns
- P(E|2020s): Moderate (~0.5) - Makes coordinated campaigns harder but not impossible

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on Evidence 1 (Wham!'s back-to-back wins) for the 1980s:

Prior odds for 1980s: 70/30 = 2.33
Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.2 = 4.5
Posterior odds: 2.33 × 4.5 = 10.49
Posterior probability: 10.49/(1+10.49) ≈ 91%

This seems too extreme, as it doesn't account for regression to the mean and the possibility of coordinated campaigns. Let's moderate this and continue updating.

Moderated posterior for 1980s: 80%

Now updating on Evidence 2 (LadBaby's absence) for 2020s:

Prior odds for 2020s: 15/85 = 0.176
Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.5 = 0.088
Posterior probability: 0.088/(1+0.088) ≈ 8%

This suggests a significant decrease in 2020s probability, which aligns with intuition.

Qualitatively incorporating the other evidence:
- Evidence 3 (streaming dominance) further strengthens the case for 1980s and somewhat for 1990s
- Evidence 4 (no clear villain) slightly reduces 2020s and increases older decades

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recency bias with Wham!'s consecutive wins
- I might be underestimating the music industry's ability to engineer a contemporary hit
- I haven't fully accounted for other classic Christmas songs from different decades
- The possibility of a viral TikTok campaign emerging is hard to predict but potentially significant

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major artist (Taylor Swift, Adele) releases a Christmas-themed song in Q4 2025
- A charity campaign emerges with strong celebrity backing (similar to Band Aid)
- Another classic from a different decade (e.g., Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas" from 1994) breaks through
- A viral social media campaign propels an unexpected song to the top

**Adjustments needed:**
- Reduce 1980s probability to account for regression to the mean
- Increase 1990s probability to account for other streaming-dominant classics
- Maintain some probability for 2020s to account for potential coordinated campaigns

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming:
- 1980s: 65% (down from 80% to account for regression to the mean)
- 1990s: 12% (up from 5% due to streaming classics like Mariah Carey)
- 2020s: 10% (slightly up from 8% to account for potential campaigns)
- 1970s: 7% (slightly up for classics like "Merry Xmas Everybody")
- 2010s: 3% (unchanged)
- 2000s: 2% (slightly up to account for uncertainty)
- 1960s or earlier: 1% (unchanged)

## 7. Final Forecast

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 7%
1980s: 65%
1990s: 12%
2000s: 2%
2010s: 3%
2020s: 10%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior, I will use the "Post-X Factor Era" (2014-2024) as my primary reference class. This period of 11 years is most relevant as it reflects the modern music industry dominated by streaming and social media, and it post-dates the era where a single TV show (The X Factor) consistently determined the winner.

The winners in this period, by decade of original release, were:
*   **2010s:** 6 wins (Ben Haenow '14, NHS Choir '15, Clean Bandit '16, Ed Sheeran '17, LadBaby '18, LadBaby '19)
*   **2020s:** 3 wins (LadBaby '20, '21, '22)
*   **1980s:** 2 wins (Wham! '23, '24)
*   **Other decades:** 0 wins

This gives us the following base rates:
*   **2010s:** 55%
*   **2020s:** 27%
*   **1980s:** 18%
*   **Other decades:** ~0%

This prior suggests a very high probability of a contemporary song winning, but it is heavily skewed by the five consecutive wins of a single act, LadBaby, who is no longer in the race.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarity:** The 2025 race will operate under the same market mechanics as the 2014-2024 period: streaming is the dominant factor, downloads are a secondary factor that can be leveraged by campaigns, and social media is the key driver for any new challenger.
*   **Difference:** The crucial difference is the existence of a "power vacuum." The base rate period was dominated first by a series of one-off contemporary hits and then by the five-year reign of LadBaby. LadBaby's exit in 2023 fundamentally changed the landscape. The last two years (2023, 2024) saw this vacuum filled by a perennial classic, establishing a new pattern not fully captured by the 11-year base rate. Therefore, the 2025 case is much more similar to 2023/2024 than it is to 2018-2022.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate three key pieces of evidence:

*   **E1: LadBaby's confirmed absence.** This act was the sole driver for all the 2020s wins and two of the 2010s wins in our base rate.
    *   P(E1 | 2020s win) is low. His absence removes the most proven mechanism for a contemporary song to win.
    *   P(E1 | 1980s win) is high. His absence created the opportunity for Wham! to win in 2023 and 2024.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E1 | 1980s win) / P(E1 | 2020s win) is significantly greater than 1.

*   **E2: Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) won in both 2023 and 2024.** This demonstrates that a classic song's massive streaming baseline can be enough to win in the absence of a strong, coordinated contemporary campaign.
    *   P(E2 | 1980s win in 2025) is high. It establishes a "default" winner and a proven path to victory for songs from this decade.
    *   P(E2 | 2020s win in 2025) is low. It shows that the bar for a new song to win is now extremely high.
    *   This evidence strongly favors the 1980s and other "classic" decades over contemporary ones.

*   **E3: The existence of other massive streaming classics.** Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994) is another perennial streaming giant that consistently challenges for the top spot.
    *   P(E3 | 1990s win) is high. This provides a very plausible alternative winner to Wham!, making the 1990s a strong contender.
    *   This evidence diversifies the probability away from just the 1980s and into other decades with beloved, high-streaming Christmas hits.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with the prior odds for a 1980s win vs. a non-1980s win.
*   **Prior P(1980s):** 18%
*   **Prior Odds(1980s):** 0.18 / (1 - 0.18) ≈ 0.22

Now, let's update with the evidence (E2) that an 80s song has won the last two years, establishing a new default. This evidence is much more likely if an 80s song wins again than if it doesn't. I'll estimate a conservative Likelihood Ratio of 5 (i.e., this state of affairs is 5x more likely given another 80s win).

*   **Posterior Odds(1980s):** Prior Odds (0.22) × Likelihood Ratio (5) = 1.1
*   **Posterior P(1980s):** 1.1 / (1 + 1.1) ≈ 52%

This single update dramatically shifts the probability towards the 1980s. The same evidence strongly reduces the probability for the contemporary decades (2010s and 2020s), whose base rates were built on a now-defunct model of winning. The evidence about Mariah Carey (E3) suggests that a significant portion of the remaining probability should be allocated to the 1990s. The probability for a 2020s win is now dependent on a new, successful campaign emerging, which is possible but no longer the default expectation.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis points heavily to a classic song winning, with the 1980s as the frontrunner. What could be wrong?

*   **Overlooking Campaign Fatigue for Classics:** Is it possible the public and media get bored of "Wham! vs Mariah" and actively campaign for something new? This could create an opening for a novel 2020s charity single to succeed by offering a fresh story.
*   **The "Sleeping Giant" Artist:** A global superstar like Taylor Swift or Ed Sheeran could release a surprise Christmas song. Their star power could potentially overcome the streaming baseline of the classics, something a smaller act couldn't do. This is the most plausible path to a 2020s win.
*   **A Different Classic:** While Wham! (80s) and Mariah (90s) are the titans, a campaign could coalesce around another song, like The Pogues' "Fairytale of New York" (1987) or Slade's "Merry Xmas Everybody" (1973). This reinforces the 80s probability but also gives a non-trivial chance to the 70s.

Considering these points, while the 1980s remain the most likely option, the probability for a 2020s win should not be negligible, as it captures the "new campaign" and "superstar release" scenarios. The 1990s are the primary challenger due to Mariah Carey's enduring popularity.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updated reasoning and red teaming, I will distribute the probabilities as follows:

1.  **1980s (50%):** This is the highest probability. It reflects the new "default" status of "Last Christmas" (1984) and is reinforced by the possibility of another major 80s classic like "Fairytale of New York" winning.
2.  **1990s (25%):** This is the second most likely outcome, almost entirely driven by the immense popularity of Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994), the most credible challenger to Wham!.
3.  **2020s (15%):** This represents the chance that a new force emerges to fill the LadBaby vacuum. This could be a different social media star, a well-organized charity campaign, or a surprise release from a global superstar.
4.  **1970s (5%):** A smaller chance for a classic from this decade, like Slade or Wizzard, to win on the back of a nostalgia-driven campaign.
5.  **2000s (2%):** Low probability. This decade lacks a dominant perennial Christmas hit and is too old for a release to be considered a "contemporary" hit.
6.  **2010s (2%):** Similar to the 2000s, songs from this decade are in an awkward middle ground—not yet classic, no longer new.
7.  **1960s or earlier (1%):** Very low probability. While there are beloved songs from this era, they do not have the modern streaming numbers to compete without an exceptionally strong and unexpected campaign.

The sum is 50 + 25 + 15 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 100%.

### Final Forecast

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 5%
1980s: 50%
1990s: 25%
2000s: 2%
2010s: 2%
2020s: 15%
