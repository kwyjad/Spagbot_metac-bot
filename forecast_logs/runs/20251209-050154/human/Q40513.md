### Reference class & base rates
-   **Fiscal Years with a Continuing Resolution (CR) into December (2000-2024):** In the last 25 fiscal years, Congress has frequently relied on CRs. When a CR is passed that extends funding beyond January 1st, it is rare for Congress to enact additional individual appropriations bills during the December holiday period. Legislative activity typically halts until the new year, with focus shifting to the next CR deadline. In these cases, the base rate for enacting *additional* full-year bills between early December and January 1 is very low, likely **<10% of instances seeing any additional bills passed**, and near 0% for more than one or two.
-   **Lame-Duck Sessions (Post-Election):** While FY2026 is not a lame-duck session year, the dynamic is analogous: a period of low legislative momentum before a major break. In lame-duck sessions, activity is often focused on "must-pass" items or clearing consensus legislation. Contentious appropriations are frequently punted. This reference class also suggests a low probability of passing the remaining, more difficult bills.
-   **"Minibus" Precedents:** The passage of a 3-bill package ("minibus") is a common strategy to show progress by passing the least controversial bills first. Historically, this often precedes a pause in activity, with the more difficult bills bundled into a larger "omnibus" package closer to a final deadline. The base rate of passing a *second* minibus in December after a first one in November is extremely low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-08] CR and 3-bill minibus enacted — **(NEUTRAL)** — Ended a month-long shutdown, showing some capacity for compromise. However, it also set the next major deadline for January 30, 2026, reducing urgency to act before year-end.
-   [2025-11-05] Bipartisan leadership announces deal framework — **(↑)** — The deal combined a CR with the three least controversial appropriations bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA), indicating a pragmatic path was chosen to reopen government.
-   [2025-10-01] FY2026 begins; government shuts down — **(↓)** — The failure to pass any funding bills by the deadline signaled deep partisan divisions and procedural gridlock, particularly on the nine more contentious bills.
-   [2025-09-18] House passes H.R.3944 — **(↑)** — The House passed a package containing the three bills that were eventually enacted. This early action identified these specific bills as having the most bipartisan support.
-   [2025-08-01] Senate Appropriations releases summaries for Leg. Branch and MilCon-VA — **(↑)** — The relatively smooth and early committee work on these bills over the summer confirmed their non-controversial status, paving the way for their eventual passage.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **CR Deadline Pressure (Large):** This is the primary driver of appropriations action. The current CR expires January 30, 2026. This removes any hard deadline before December 31, 2025, making significant action in December highly improbable.
-   **Holiday Recess (Large):** Congress is scheduled to leave for the Christmas and New Year's holiday recess, typically by the third week of December. There is immense social and political pressure to adhere to this schedule, creating a powerful incentive to defer complex and contentious work.
-   **Political Will & Post-Shutdown Exhaustion (Moderate):** After a bitter, month-long shutdown, members may be exhausted and unwilling to immediately re-engage on the most difficult funding bills (e.g., Labor-HHS, Homeland Security). The incentive is to maintain the truce provided by the CR through the holidays.
-   **"Must-Pass" Legislative Vehicles (Moderate):** The existence of other essential legislation that must be enacted before year-end (e.g., the National Defense Authorization Act - NDAA) could provide a vehicle to attach another consensus appropriations bill. However, leadership is often reluctant to complicate must-pass bills with controversial funding fights.
-   **Isolating Contentious Bills (Small):** By passing the three easiest bills, Congress has isolated the nine most difficult ones. This makes it harder, not easier, to pass them individually or in small packages, as there are fewer non-controversial items to facilitate compromise.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Partial Progress Already Made:** Unlike many CR scenarios where *zero* bills are done, three are already enacted. The question is not about starting from scratch, but about whether momentum continues. This is unusual and focuses the remaining conflict entirely on the most difficult bills.
-   **Recent Major Shutdown:** The severity and length of the recent shutdown may have altered political calculations. It could either chasten members into further compromise (unlikely on hard issues) or, more likely, harden partisan positions, making deals on the remaining bills even more difficult before a major deadline.
-   **Explicit "Two-Tiered" CR Deadline:** The CR passed in November reportedly set two different deadlines (a "laddered CR"), with some agencies funded through Jan 30 and others perhaps to a later date. The prompt only mentions Jan 30, but if true, this strategy is designed to force negotiations in January/February, not December.
-   **Known Set of "Easy" Bills:** The three enacted bills (Ag, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are consistently among the least controversial. Their passage confirms the standard political dynamic, suggesting the remaining nine will follow a much more difficult path typical of their historical contentiousness.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior heavily concentrated on the current number of 3 enacted bills. The base rate for passing *additional* bills in December when a CR is in place until late January is near zero. An "equivalent n" of ~10 observations where the outcome was 0 additional bills is plausible.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The CR deadline is Jan 30, 2026, removing the primary action-forcing event for December.
    -   (↓ Large) The impending and powerful norm of the holiday recess disincentivizes any new, difficult legislative work.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The remaining nine bills are the most controversial, making quick, quiet passage impossible. The easy wins have been taken.
    -   (↑ Small) The fact that a bipartisan deal was reached in November to pass three bills shows compromise is possible, but this is weak evidence it can be replicated on harder issues without a deadline.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. The posterior should be even more sharply peaked at 3. The probability of any additional bills being enacted before Jan 1, 2026, is very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Leadership announces a surprise pre-holiday deal on another "minibus" (e.g., Energy & Water, Financial Services).
    -   An appropriations bill is attached to the final version of the NDAA or another must-pass vehicle.
    -   High-level, bipartisan appropriations negotiations ("four corners") are publicly announced and reported as making progress.
    -   Floor time is scheduled for an appropriations bill before the holiday recess.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Leadership announces the holiday recess schedule with no mention of appropriations votes.
    -   Public statements from party leaders focus exclusively on the January 30 deadline.
    -   News reports indicate that staff-level talks on the remaining nine bills have been paused until January.
    -   Riders or poison pill amendments are publicly proposed for the remaining bills, signaling a lack of intent for quick passage.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires the bill to be "enacted," meaning passed by both chambers and signed by the President before Jan 1, 2026. A last-minute deal passed by Congress on Dec 31 might not be signed in time.
-   **Source Timeliness:** The provided sources are from mid-2025, prior to the shutdown. They are useful for identifying which bills were non-controversial but offer no insight into the current (Dec 2025) political dynamics.
-   **"Christmas Miracle" Scenario:** Unpredictable events or a sudden bipartisan breakthrough, while highly improbable, can never be fully ruled out in Congress. A deal could come together unexpectedly.
-   **Misinformation Risk:** Be wary of rumors about "imminent deals." Action, such as scheduled floor time or official leadership statements, is a much more reliable signal than anonymous staffer comments.
-   **Ignoring the Obvious:** The most powerful forces in this forecast are structural and calendrical (the CR deadline and the holiday), not personality-driven. Over-weighting day-to-day political rhetoric would be a mistake.

**Final Research Summary:** The current number of enacted bills is three. The combination of a distant January 30 CR deadline and the powerful norm of the holiday recess makes it extremely unlikely that Congress will enact any of the nine remaining, more controversial appropriations bills before January 1, 2026.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from historical instances where a continuing resolution (CR) extends funding beyond January 1st. In such cases, the probability of enacting additional appropriations bills in December is very low, with less than 10% of instances seeing any additional bills passed. The mean number of additional bills passed in these scenarios is close to zero, with a variance reflecting occasional outliers.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation aligns with the base case where a CR extends into the new year, reducing urgency for December action. Differences include the recent passage of three bills, which is unusual but does not significantly alter the base rate for additional bills due to the remaining bills' contentious nature.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR Deadline Pressure (↓ Large):** The January 30 deadline reduces the likelihood of additional bills being passed in December.
   - **Holiday Recess (↓ Large):** The upcoming recess further decreases the probability of legislative action.
   - **Political Will & Post-Shutdown Exhaustion (↓ Moderate):** The recent shutdown likely discourages immediate action on contentious bills.
   - **Bipartisan Deal (↑ Small):** The November deal shows some capacity for compromise, but this is weak evidence for further action without a pressing deadline.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 3 enacted bills, the evidence overwhelmingly supports maintaining this number. The likelihood of additional bills being enacted before January 1 is very low, reinforcing a posterior distribution sharply peaked at 3.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as a sudden bipartisan breakthrough, suggests a small probability of additional bills. However, structural factors like the CR deadline and holiday recess dominate, supporting a conservative forecast. An alternative forecast might consider a slight increase in enacted bills due to unexpected legislative maneuvers, but this remains unlikely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the percentiles reflect a high probability of no additional bills being enacted, with a slight chance of one more bill due to unforeseen circumstances.

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical pattern of appropriations bills enacted before January 1st in fiscal years with continuing resolutions extending into December:

- Currently, 3 bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA)
- When a CR extends funding beyond January 1st (as the current one does until January 30, 2026), the base rate for enacting additional bills in December is extremely low (<10% of instances)
- The most relevant reference class is fiscal years where some bills were enacted early but a CR was needed for the remainder extending into January

Based on this reference class, my prior is heavily concentrated at exactly 3 bills, with a small probability of 4-5 bills, and negligible probability of more than 5 bills being enacted before January 1, 2026.

Prior distribution mean: ~3.1 bills
Prior distribution variance: Very narrow, with ~90% of probability mass at 3 bills

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The "easy" bills have already been passed (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, MilCon-VA), which is typical
- A CR is in place with a deadline well after January 1st (January 30, 2026)
- The holiday recess will interrupt legislative work in December

**Differences from base case:**
- The recent shutdown was unusually long and contentious, which may reduce appetite for further appropriations fights before the CR deadline
- Three bills have already been enacted, which is slightly more progress than typical at this stage
- The remaining nine bills are all in the "difficult" category, with no easy wins left

These differences generally reinforce the prior expectation that additional bills are unlikely before January 1st.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for additional bills being enacted:**
- A bipartisan deal was reached in November to pass three bills, showing some capacity for compromise (weak evidence, LR ≈ 1.2)
- The recent shutdown may have created pressure to show more progress (very weak evidence, LR ≈ 1.1)

**Evidence against additional bills being enacted:**
- The CR deadline is January 30, 2026, removing any forcing mechanism before January 1st (strong evidence, LR ≈ 0.3)
- Congress typically recesses for holidays in mid-December, leaving limited legislative days (strong evidence, LR ≈ 0.4)
- The remaining nine bills are the most controversial ones, making quick passage unlikely (moderate evidence, LR ≈ 0.6)
- The three "easy" bills have been isolated and passed, leaving only contentious bills (moderate evidence, LR ≈ 0.7)

Net likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.3 × 0.4 × 0.6 × 0.7 × 1.2 × 1.1 ≈ 0.07, strongly favoring the hypothesis that no additional bills will be enacted.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 3 bills with small probability at 4-5 bills, I apply the net likelihood ratio of 0.07 for additional bills:

- The probability of exactly 3 bills increases substantially
- The probability of 4+ bills decreases dramatically
- The posterior mean shifts down slightly from ~3.1 to ~3.02
- The variance decreases further, with even more concentration at exactly 3 bills

This update reflects that the evidence strongly reinforces the expectation that no additional appropriations bills will be enacted before January 1, 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a "Christmas miracle" deal where leadership surprises with a quick passage of non-controversial bills
- The NDAA or other must-pass legislation could serve as a vehicle for additional appropriations bills
- I might be overweighting the importance of the January 30 deadline and underweighting other political incentives

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A small package of 2-3 additional bills (Defense, Energy & Water, Financial Services) could be negotiated as a pre-holiday accomplishment
- A sudden crisis could force action on a specific appropriations bill (e.g., Homeland Security)

After considering these alternatives, I still find them unlikely but will adjust my distribution slightly to account for these possibilities, increasing the probability of 4-6 bills from near-zero to a small but meaningful chance.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of appropriations bills enacted before the end of the calendar year. A relevant base rate can be derived from the historical behavior of the U.S. Congress in similar situations.

The most appropriate reference class is **fiscal years where a Continuing Resolution (CR) is in place that extends funding into late January of the next calendar year.** In these situations, the primary action-forcing deadline is removed from December. Combined with the strong norm of a holiday recess, legislative activity on contentious items like appropriations typically ceases.

Based on the research report and general knowledge, the base rate for enacting *additional* full-year appropriations bills between early December and January 1st under such a CR is extremely low. In the vast majority of these cases (estimated at >90%), zero additional bills are passed. Therefore, my prior distribution for the final number of enacted bills is sharply peaked at the current number, which is 3.

*   **Prior Distribution (Mode/Median):** 3 bills.
*   **Prior Spread:** Very narrow, with a >90% probability mass on exactly 3 bills, and a small probability of 4 or more.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns almost perfectly with the base case, and the differences that do exist tend to reinforce the base rate expectation of inaction.

*   **Similarities:** A CR is in place until January 30, 2026, removing any year-end deadline pressure. It is early December, and the holiday recess is imminent. The easiest, least controversial bills have already been passed.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Recent Major Shutdown:** The government just endured a month-long shutdown. This likely leads to legislative exhaustion and a decreased appetite for further high-stakes fiscal battles before the holidays, strengthening the case for inaction.
    *   **Isolation of Contentious Bills:** By passing the three easiest bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA), Congress has isolated the nine most difficult and partisan bills (e.g., Labor-HHS, Homeland Security, Defense). This makes it *harder* to find a path forward for any of them before the next major deadline, as there are no "sweeteners" left to facilitate compromise.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence overwhelmingly points towards the number of enacted bills remaining at 3 through the end of the year.

*   **(↓ Large) CR Deadline of January 30, 2026:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. Deadlines are the primary driver of legislative action. The absence of a deadline before December 31 makes it highly probable that no further action will be taken. This evidence makes the "0 additional bills" outcome many times more likely than any other.
*   **(↓ Large) Holiday Recess:** This is a powerful structural and social force. There is immense pressure for members to return to their districts, and leadership is highly unlikely to force them to stay in Washington to negotiate contentious bills without a forcing mechanism like a deadline.
*   **(↓ Moderate) Post-Shutdown Political Dynamics:** The recent shutdown was resolved by passing the easiest bills and punting the difficult ones. This indicates the path of least resistance is to defer conflict, a pattern that is very likely to continue through the holiday season.
*   **(↑ Small) Recent Bipartisan Compromise:** The fact that a deal was reached in November to pass three bills shows that compromise is not impossible. However, this is weak evidence for future action, as it was achieved on non-controversial items under the duress of a shutdown. It does not suggest a similar compromise is likely on harder bills in the absence of a deadline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior was already heavily concentrated at 3 bills. The evidence acts as a strong confirmation of this prior.

*   **Prior:** P(Total=3) ≈ 90%; P(Total>3) ≈ 10%.
*   **Likelihoods:** The combined likelihood of the evidence (Jan 30 deadline, holiday recess, remaining bills are the hardest) given "0 additional bills" is far greater than the likelihood of that evidence given ">0 additional bills".
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution becomes even more sharply peaked at 3. The evidence strongly suggests that the base rate holds and that the probability of inaction is very high. I will adjust my final probability of the outcome being exactly 3 to be around 89%, allowing for a small but non-trivial chance (around 10%) of a single additional bill being passed in a surprise scenario. This acknowledges the tail risk without deviating from the overwhelming evidence. The posterior median remains 3, but the upper tail is slightly fatter than the prior might suggest, accounting for unpredictable political events.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is highly confident that the number will be 3. What is the best argument against this?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible alternative is that leadership wants to show more progress and clear the decks before 2026. They could identify the "next easiest" bill (e.g., Financial Services, Energy & Water) and attach it to another "must-pass" legislative vehicle, like the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is often finalized in December. This could result in the total number becoming 4.
*   **Plausibility:** This is possible but unlikely. Attaching appropriations to the NDAA is often controversial and can threaten the passage of the defense bill itself. Given the post-shutdown exhaustion, leadership is more likely to prefer a "clean" NDAA and defer all appropriations fights until the January deadline.
*   **Adjustment:** My distribution already accounts for this. I have placed a 10% probability on the outcome being 4, which I believe adequately covers this primary alternative scenario. A scenario where two or more additional bills are passed is exceedingly unlikely and falls into the remaining 1% of my distribution. My forecast is not that an outcome of 4 is impossible, but that it is a significant outlier against the structural incentives for inaction. The resulting percentiles reflect this by having the central 80% of the distribution at 3, with the P90 capturing the tail risk of the outcome being 4.
