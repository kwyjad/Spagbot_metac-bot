### **Reference class & base rates**

1.  **MP Departures in any Parliament:** Historically, floor-crossings, resignations, or shifts to independent status are infrequent. In the 44th Parliament (2021-2025), there were approximately 10 such events (resignations, deaths, one expulsion) over four years among 338 MPs. This suggests a rough base rate of ~2.5 events per year, or about a 0.06% chance of an event for any given MP in a given month. In a ~1.5 month window (Nov 17-Dec 31), this implies a low single-digit percentage chance. *Limitation: This class is too broad and ignores the specific context of a new, contentious minority government.*
2.  **MP Departures in Minority Parliaments:** Minority governments are inherently less stable and create higher incentives for political maneuvering. The Martin minority (2004-2006) saw a high-profile floor crossing (Belinda Stronach) that saved the government on a confidence vote. The Harper minorities (2006-2011) also saw defections. The base rate in these periods is significantly higher than in majority governments, perhaps 2-3x the general rate, suggesting a mid-to-high single-digit percentage chance. *Limitation: Still doesn't capture the extreme leverage of being just 1-2 seats from a majority.*
3.  **MP Departures during a "Majority-Making" Window:** The most specific, but data-poor, reference class is a minority government being within 1-2 seats of a majority, creating a powerful incentive for the governing party to poach opposition members. This has occurred rarely in Canadian history. The Stronach crossing is the key example. This suggests that when the conditions are this specific, the probability of an event is substantial, possibly in the 20-40% range for a short, high-stakes period like a budget vote.

### **Recent developments (timeline bullets)**

*   **2025-11-06** Matt Jeneroux (Conservative) resigns under pressure. **↑** — Demonstrates the Conservative party is actively trying to suppress dissent, which can backfire and accelerate the departure of other unhappy MPs. It confirms high-level talks are occurring.
*   **2025-11-05** Chris d'Entremont (Conservative) crosses the floor to the Liberals. **↑** — Establishes a "permission structure" for other disaffected Conservatives. It proves the Liberals are actively recruiting and making attractive offers, and reduces the government's seat deficit from 3 to 2.
*   **2025-11-04** The Liberal minority government tables its first budget. **↑** — Creates a high-stakes confidence vote, forcing decisions and providing a clear deadline for any potential floor-crosser to maximize their leverage and impact.
*   **2025-04-28** A federal election results in a Liberal minority, just 3 seats short of a majority. **↑** — Sets the stage for the current instability by creating a razor-thin margin where individual MPs hold immense power.

### **Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)**

1.  **Liberal Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The motivation for the governing Liberals is immense. A stable majority eliminates the need for constant negotiation and the threat of defeat on confidence votes. They can be expected to use powerful incentives (e.g., cabinet positions, parliamentary secretary roles, significant riding-specific funding, policy concessions) to entice opposition MPs.
2.  **Conservative Caucus Disunity (Large ↑):** The provided background explicitly cites d'Entremont's disagreement with Pierre Poilievre's leadership. This suggests an existing ideological or stylistic rift within the Conservative caucus. Where one MP is openly disaffected, others likely are quietly.
3.  **Political Contagion/Momentum (Moderate ↑):** D'Entremont's defection and Jeneroux's resignation create a "cascade" or "domino" effect. The topic is now front-of-mind for MPs and the media. Other wavering MPs may see this as their best opportunity to act while they have maximum leverage and are not alone.
4.  **Budget Vote Leverage (Moderate ↑):** The budget is the most critical confidence vote. An MP's decision to cross the floor, become independent, or resign has maximum political impact just before this vote, increasing the value of their "political asset" and the incentives the government might offer.
5.  **Conservative Party Discipline (Moderate ↓):** The "consequences" threatened against Jeneroux show the Conservative leadership is aware of the risk and is actively working to enforce discipline. This threat could intimidate other potential defectors into staying in line, effectively quashing the rebellion.
6.  **Parliamentary Calendar (Small ↑):** The House of Commons typically rises for the Christmas break in mid-December. This creates a soft deadline. Any MP wishing to make a move before year-end would likely do so before the House rises to maximize media attention and political impact.

### **Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)**

*   **Razor-Thin Margin:** The government is precisely two seats from a majority. This is not a typical minority situation; it's a tipping-point scenario where every single seat has outsized strategic importance.
*   **A Cluster of Events:** The base rate assumes random, independent events. Here, we have two departures in two days, strongly suggesting a correlated, non-random process driven by a specific, acute cause (e.g., a coordinated Liberal effort, a major Conservative caucus blow-up).
*   **New Leadership Dynamics:** The scenario involves a new Prime Minister (Carney) who may have a "honeymoon" period and be seen as a more appealing alternative for disaffected opposition members compared to a long-tenured leader.
*   **Explicit Ideological Driver:** Unlike many resignations for personal reasons, the d'Entremont defection was explicitly framed as a rejection of the Opposition Leader's ideology, signaling a potentially deep and systemic fissure within the Conservative party.

### **Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)**

*   **Prior:** Starting from the "contentious minority government" reference class, a prior of ~15% seems plausible for an event in a ~6-week window. (Equivalent n ≈ 6, with 1 "yes").
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   D'Entremont's floor crossing: **↑ Large**. Confirms active recruitment and a permission structure.
    *   Jeneroux's forced resignation: **↑ Large**. Confirms the stakes are high, talks are happening, and party discipline might backfire.
    *   Government is 2 seats (not 3+) from a majority: **↑ Large**. Dramatically increases the incentive structure for the Liberals.
    *   Explicit ideological split cited as the cause: **↑ Moderate**. Suggests the problem is not isolated to one MP.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is recent, powerful, and mutually reinforcing. It points to a specific, acute political crisis, not a background rate of attrition. The posterior should move sharply upward from the prior, likely more than doubling it.

### **Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)**

*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Unusually long or unscheduled Conservative caucus meetings.
    *   Media reports or rumors naming other potentially disaffected Conservative MPs.
    *   The Prime Minister or senior cabinet ministers making unexpected visits to Conservative-held ridings.
    *   Statements from the Conservative whip's office emphasizing caucus unity.
    *   An MP from the Conservative "moderate" wing missing key votes or being absent from Parliament.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A strong, unified public statement from the entire Conservative caucus supporting the leader.
    *   The budget passing with support from another party (e.g., NDP or Bloc Québécois), reducing the Liberals' need for Conservative defectors.
    *   The House of Commons rising for the holiday break without further incident.
    *   Key "moderate" Conservative MPs giving media interviews strongly denouncing floor-crossing.

### **Caveats & pitfalls**

*   **Fictional Scenario:** This analysis is based on a fictional scenario; real-world actor behavior could differ from the archetypes presented.
*   **Short Resolution Window:** The Dec 31 deadline is tight. A deal could be struck in December but not announced until January, which would resolve this question as "No." The timing of announcements is a key uncertainty.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most important information (the state of negotiations, the true level of caucus dissent) is held by a very small number of political insiders and is not public.
*   **Definition of "Resign":** The resolution criteria include resignation. An MP could resign for purely personal or health reasons unrelated to the political situation, which would still trigger a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Successful Counter-Pressure:** The Conservative party's efforts to maintain discipline might succeed more effectively than anticipated, completely halting the momentum.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for an MP departure is low, but this situation is highly anomalous. The combination of a government just two seats from a majority, a recent successful defection, and signs of significant internal opposition dissent creates powerful momentum for at least one more departure before year-end.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we'll follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for MP departures in minority parliaments is higher than in majority governments due to inherent instability. Historical data suggests a mid-to-high single-digit percentage chance for such events in minority governments. Given the specific context of a minority government just two seats short of a majority, a prior probability of around 15% seems reasonable. This accounts for the increased likelihood of political maneuvering in such a scenario.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically sees more defections and resignations due to instability and political maneuvering.
   - Differences: The government is only two seats away from a majority, creating a unique incentive structure for both the governing party and potential defectors. Recent events, such as a floor crossing and a resignation, suggest heightened activity and pressure within the political landscape.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Chris d'Entremont's floor crossing**: This event increases the probability as it demonstrates active recruitment by the Liberals and sets a precedent for other MPs.
   - **Matt Jeneroux's resignation**: Indicates internal Conservative Party tensions and potential for further defections, increasing the likelihood.
   - **Liberal minority government tabling its budget**: Creates a high-stakes environment, increasing the likelihood of defections as MPs may leverage their positions.
   - **Conservative Party discipline efforts**: While intended to prevent defections, such efforts can backfire, potentially increasing the likelihood of further departures.

   The likelihood ratios for these pieces of evidence suggest a significant increase in the probability of another MP defecting or resigning.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 15%, the evidence strongly suggests an increased likelihood of defections. The combination of recent defections, high-stakes political environment, and internal party tensions suggests a substantial increase in probability.
   - Applying Bayes' Rule conceptually, the posterior probability is likely to more than double, moving into the 30-40% range.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The forecast should account for the possibility of successful Conservative discipline efforts and the short resolution window.
   - Alternative scenarios: The possibility of the budget passing with support from another party, reducing the need for defections, should be considered.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence and the unique political context, the probability remains high, but caution is warranted due to potential countermeasures by the Conservative Party.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential counterarguments, the final calibrated probability reflects the heightened likelihood of another MP defecting or resigning before 2026.

Final: 35%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate base rate for MP defections or resignations in a ~3-week window (Dec 9-31, 2025).

The most relevant reference class is "MP departures during a 'majority-making' window" - when a minority government is just 1-2 seats away from a majority. This is a rare situation in Canadian politics, but creates powerful incentives for the governing party to recruit opposition members.

From the research report, the base rate for general MP departures is about 2.5 events per year across 338 MPs, or roughly 0.06% per MP per month. However, in minority parliaments, this rate increases 2-3x. And in the specific "majority-making window" scenario, the probability jumps substantially to 20-40% for a short period.

Given that we're looking at a 3-week window (about 0.7 months), and considering the specific high-stakes context, I'll start with a prior of approximately 15%.

**Prior probability: 15%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a minority government situation where individual MPs have outsized influence
- There's an upcoming critical confidence vote (budget)
- There are ideological tensions within the opposition party

**Key differences:**
- The government is extremely close to a majority (just 2 seats away)
- There's already been a very recent defection (d'Entremont) and resignation (Jeneroux)
- These events happened just over a month ago, creating momentum
- The Conservative Party has explicitly threatened "consequences" for defectors
- Mark Carney is a new PM with potential "honeymoon" appeal
- We're in a compressed timeframe (3 weeks) with the holiday break approaching

These differences significantly increase the likelihood compared to the general base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Chris d'Entremont's defection (Nov 5)**
- P(E|H): Very high. If more defections are coming, we'd expect to see initial defections.
- P(E|~H): Moderate. Could be an isolated case.
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately high (>2)
- This evidence increases probability significantly.

**Evidence 2: Matt Jeneroux's resignation (Nov 6)**
- P(E|H): Very high. If more defections are coming, we'd expect to see initial movements.
- P(E|~H): Low. Two major departures in two days suggests a pattern, not isolated events.
- Likelihood ratio: High (>3)
- This evidence increases probability substantially.

**Evidence 3: Jeneroux was reportedly in talks with Carney's office**
- P(E|H): Very high. Active recruitment by the PM's office suggests a coordinated strategy.
- P(E|~H): Low. This indicates systematic outreach, not just opportunistic recruitment.
- Likelihood ratio: High (>3)
- This evidence increases probability substantially.

**Evidence 4: Conservative Party threatening "consequences"**
- P(E|H): High. Such threats can backfire and accelerate departures of disaffected members.
- P(E|~H): Moderate. Could also successfully suppress defections.
- Likelihood ratio: Moderate (>1.5)
- This evidence moderately increases probability.

**Evidence 5: Time elapsed since initial defections (over a month)**
- P(E|H): Moderate. If more defections were imminent, they might have happened sooner.
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high. The longer the period without new defections, the more stable things appear.
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly below 1 (<1)
- This evidence slightly decreases probability.

**Evidence 6: Approaching holiday break**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high. Creates a natural deadline for action before year-end.
- P(E|~H): Moderate. MPs might wait until after holidays for major decisions.
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly above 1 (>1)
- This evidence slightly increases probability.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176), I'll update based on the key pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 & 2 (combined): Recent defection and resignation**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: ~3 (combined effect)
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 3 = 0.528
- Posterior probability: 0.528 / (1 + 0.528) = 34.6%

**Update on Evidence 3: Active recruitment by PM's office**
- Prior odds: 0.528
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.5
- Posterior odds: 0.528 × 2.5 = 1.32
- Posterior probability: 1.32 / (1 + 1.32) = 56.9%

**Update on Evidence 4: Conservative threats of consequences**
- Prior odds: 1.32
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- Posterior odds: 1.32 × 1.5 = 1.98
- Posterior probability: 1.98 / (1 + 1.98) = 66.4%

**Update on Evidence 5: Time elapsed since initial defections**
- Prior odds: 1.98
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.9
- Posterior odds: 1.98 × 0.9 = 1.782
- Posterior probability: 1.782 / (1 + 1.782) = 64.1%

**Update on Evidence 6: Approaching holiday break**
- Prior odds: 1.782
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.1
- Posterior odds: 1.782 × 1.1 = 1.96
- Posterior probability: 1.96 / (1 + 1.96) = 66.2%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 66%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of the two recent departures. They could be isolated incidents rather than the start of a trend.
- The Conservative Party's disciplinary measures might be more effective than I've estimated.
- The holiday period might reduce political activity more than I've accounted for.
- The Liberals might secure budget support from another party (NDP or Bloc), reducing their need to poach Conservative MPs.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would be around 40%, arguing that:
1. The initial defections were the most vulnerable MPs
2. The Conservative Party has now implemented stronger controls
3. The remaining MPs have demonstrated loyalty by not defecting yet
4. The holiday period will delay any potential movements until January

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, the fundamental dynamics remain powerful:
1. The Liberals are just 2 seats from a majority, creating enormous incentives
2. The explicit ideological split cited by d'Entremont suggests deeper fractures
3. The threats against Jeneroux indicate the Conservative leadership is genuinely worried
4. The holiday deadline creates a natural inflection point for action

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the possibility that the Conservative Party's discipline efforts might be more effective than I initially estimated, and that the holiday period might delay some potential defections until January.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific context, the evidence, and potential biases, I believe there is a strong but not overwhelming probability that another Canadian MP will defect or resign before 2026.

Final: 62%

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is the departure of a Canadian MP (by resignation, floor-crossing, or becoming an independent) within a specific 45-day window (Nov 17 to Dec 31, 2025) under highly unusual political circumstances.

- A broad base rate, using the average number of MP departures per year (~2.5), would suggest a probability of around 25-30% for at least one event in any 45-day period. However, this is too general as it doesn't account for the political context.
- A more appropriate reference class is "MP departures during a contentious minority government where the governing party is on the cusp of a majority." Historical examples, like the Belinda Stronach floor-crossing in 2005 which saved the Martin government's budget, are the most relevant precedent. These situations are rare but create intense pressure and incentives for such events.
- Based on this specific but data-poor reference class, a higher-than-average base rate is warranted. I will select a prior probability of **30%** for an MP departure occurring in this high-stakes window. This reflects that such an event is not the norm, but the conditions are ripe for it.

Prior Odds: 30% probability corresponds to `0.30 / (1 - 0.30) = 0.43`, or approximately 1-to-2.3 odds against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is highly analogous to the 2005 Stronach precedent (a Liberal minority government needing votes from the opposition Conservatives to survive a budget vote). However, there are key differences that likely increase the probability:

- **Momentum:** The Stronach crossing was a single event. Here, we have a cluster of two events in two days (d'Entremont's defection and Jeneroux's forced resignation) just before the resolution window opens. This suggests a "contagion" effect or a wider, systemic issue within the Conservative caucus, rather than an isolated incident.
- **Proximity to Majority:** The goal is not just to survive a single vote, but for the Liberals to achieve a stable majority government by recruiting just two more MPs. This provides a much larger and more permanent incentive for the government to make extremely generous offers.
- **Explicit Cause:** The defection was explicitly linked to ideological disagreement with the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre. This signals a potentially deep fissure that could affect multiple MPs, not just one person's ambition.

These factors suggest the underlying probability is even higher than in the historical base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will treat the situation as of the start of the resolution window (Nov 17) as my updated prior, and then evaluate new evidence since then.

- **Initial Evidence (The Nov 5-6 Cluster):** The defection and forced resignation are powerful evidence that a caucus rebellion is underway. This evidence would be far more likely if another departure were imminent (P(E|H) is high) than if the problem were isolated and contained (P(E|~H) is low). This cluster of events dramatically increases the probability from the base rate.
- **New Evidence (Passage of Time):** The current date is December 9. More than three weeks (22 days) of the 45-day resolution window have passed with no further departures. This is significant negative evidence. The initial momentum appears to have stalled. This lack of a follow-up event is more likely if the Conservative party successfully quelled the rebellion and no further departures are coming (P(E|~H) > P(E|H)). This evidence must decrease the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 30% (Odds = 0.43).
2.  **Update for the Nov 5-6 Cluster:** This evidence is very strong. A likelihood ratio of 3.0 seems reasonable (i.e., this cluster of events is 3 times more likely if another departure is coming than if it isn't).
    -   *Intermediate Odds* = Prior Odds × LR = 0.43 × 3.0 = 1.29.
    -   *Intermediate Probability* = 1.29 / (1 + 1.29) ≈ 56%.
    -   So, as of November 17, the probability of an event in the coming 45 days looked to be around 56%.
3.  **Update for the Passage of Time:** We now have the new evidence that 22 days have passed with no event. We can update the 56% probability. Assuming a constant daily probability of an event, the probability of at least one event in the remaining 23 days, given none in the first 22, is mathematically lower.
    -   A 56% chance over 45 days implies a daily event probability of ~1.8%.
    -   The probability of no event in 23 days would be `(1 - 0.018)^23 ≈ 66%`.
    -   Therefore, the probability of at least one event in the remaining 23 days is `1 - 0.66 = 34%`.

The passage of time without a further incident is strong evidence that the crisis may have been contained, significantly reducing the probability from its peak in mid-November. The posterior probability is now approximately 35%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 35% could be wrong. The best alternative forecast is likely lower, perhaps 15-20%.

-   **Plausible Alternative:** The Conservative party's disciplinary actions (the "consequences" threatened to Jeneroux) were highly effective. They made a ruthless example of one MP, successfully intimidated any other waverers, and have since restored caucus unity. The d'Entremont/Jeneroux events were not the start of a cascade but the entirety of a short, failed rebellion. The lack of any news for a month is strong proof of this.
-   **Rebuttal:** While plausible, this view may underestimate the depth of the ideological split and the immense motivation of the Liberal government. Negotiations for such a high-stakes move are complex and secret; a deal could have been finalized and is simply waiting for the moment of maximum political impact to be announced (e.g., the day of the budget vote). The underlying tensions that caused the first two departures have likely not disappeared.

My 35% forecast attempts to balance these competing forces: the high potential for an event due to the political context, tempered by the lack of any new developments for several weeks.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial conditions for a defection or resignation are extremely strong, suggesting a probability well above the historical base rate. The cluster of events in early November pushed this probability over 50%. However, the subsequent month of inactivity is significant counter-evidence, suggesting the immediate crisis may have been contained. The remaining window is short, but the upcoming budget vote provides a powerful deadline and moment of leverage. Balancing these factors, the probability of another MP departing before January 1, 2026, is substantial but less than likely.

Final: 35%
