### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Any Game of the Year (GOTY) Nominee at The Game Awards (TGA):** Since 2014, there have been 6 nominees per year. The base rate for any given nominee winning is approximately **1 in 6, or ~17%**. This is a broad, uninformative prior assuming all nominees have an equal chance.
2.  **Critically Acclaimed (Metacritic 90+) AAA Action-Adventure/RPG:** Of the 10 TGA GOTY winners (2014-2023), 9 fall into the Action-Adventure or RPG genres. All 10 have had Metacritic scores of 89 or higher, with 8 of 10 scoring 93+. This suggests a base rate of **~80-90%** that the winner will be a highly-rated AAA game from one of these two genres.
3.  **Game with the Most Nominations:** In recent years, the game with the most nominations has a strong, but not perfect, track record. *The Last of Us Part II* (2020), *Elden Ring* (2022), and *Baldur's Gate 3* (2023) all led in nominations and won GOTY. However, in 2018, *Red Dead Redemption 2* led nominations, but *God of War* won. The base rate for the most-nominated game winning is roughly **~60-70%** in any given year.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-12-08] Source articles confirm the full list of TGA 2025 nominees. ↑↑ (Clair Obscur) — The Wikipedia source explicitly states *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* leads with thirteen nominations, a historically strong indicator of critical success and jury favor.
*   [2025-12-08] Sources confirm *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* and *Death Stranding 2: On the Beach* as GOTY nominees. ↑ (Clair Obscur, DS2), ↓ (Others) — Specific media mention elevates their profile. The lack of explicit mention for the other four titles in the provided snippets is a weak negative signal.
*   [2025-12-07] IGN article highlights TGA as a major platform for announcements. Neutral — This confirms the event's prestige but does not favor any specific nominee. It reinforces the importance of the award being decided.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Critical Acclaim (Metascore/Opencritic):** The 90% jury vote is composed of global media outlets. High aggregate review scores are a prerequisite for nomination and a powerful driver for winning. (Large)
2.  **Number of Nominations:** Leading in total nominations indicates broad critical appeal across multiple categories (e.g., Art, Narrative, Score, Direction), which strongly correlates with the overall "best experience" criteria for GOTY. (Large)
3.  **Developer Pedigree & Prestige:** A respected developer (e.g., Kojima Productions for *DS2*, Supergiant for *Hades II*) can generate significant goodwill and media attention, influencing jurors who value auteur-driven projects. (Moderate)
4.  **Genre Bias:** The jury has historically favored large-scale, narrative-driven, third-person Action-Adventure and RPG titles over other genres like platformers or pure indie games. (Moderate)
5.  **Innovation and "The Conversation":** Games that push boundaries, innovate on mechanics, or dominate the cultural conversation (e.g., *Elden Ring*'s open world, *Baldur's Gate 3*'s player agency) often develop a winning narrative. (Moderate)
6.  **Public Vote:** At only 10% of the total, this is a minor factor. It can serve as a tie-breaker or slightly boost a game with a massive, passionate fanbase (*Hades II*, *Silksong*), but it is unlikely to overturn a strong jury consensus. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **New IP Dominance:** It is highly unusual for a new IP from a newly-established studio (Sandfall Interactive for *Clair Obscur*) to lead the nomination count. This suggests the game is an exceptional breakout success, bucking the trend of established franchises dominating.
*   **Strength of Indie Sequels:** The presence of two sequels to genre-defining indie games (*Hades II*, *Hollow Knight: Silksong*) is a significant feature of this year's field. While an indie has never won GOTY, these are arguably the strongest contenders from that space in TGA history.
*   **Auteur Sequel Divisiveness:** *Death Stranding 2* is a sequel to a game that was critically acclaimed but also highly polarizing. Its success with the jury will depend on whether it refined its unique mechanics for broader appeal or doubled down on its niche aspects.
*   **Lack of a Clear Rockstar/Naughty Dog-style Contender:** The field lacks a title from a studio that has historically dominated the awards (e.g., Naughty Dog, Rockstar, Santa Monica Studio), potentially making the race more open than in years like 2018 or 2020.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A uniform prior of ~17% for each of the six nominees, with an equivalent n=6, reflecting the "Any Nominee" reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑↑↑ Large) *Clair Obscur*'s 13 nominations is the single most powerful piece of evidence, strongly aligning with the "most-nominated game wins" reference class.
    *   (↓ Moderate) *Hades II* and *Hollow Knight: Silksong* are indie games. The base rate for this category winning GOTY is zero, representing a significant historical barrier.
    *   (↑ Small) *Death Stranding 2* benefits from the "Kojima factor" and high production values, making it a credible prestige pick.
    *   (↓ Small) *Donkey Kong Bananza* is likely a platformer, a genre that has historically underperformed in the GOTY category.
    *   (↓ Small) *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*, as a sequel to a more niche, "hardcore" RPG, may lack the broad, universal appeal of recent winners like *Elden Ring* or *Baldur's Gate 3*.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior probability should shift decisively in favor of *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*. Its probability should increase substantially, making it the clear favorite. *Death Stranding 2* remains a viable, but distant, second. The other four candidates should see their probabilities significantly reduced.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
Given the resolution is in two days, indicators are extremely short-term:
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Influential journalists/jurors on social media hinting at a surprise or a consensus pick.
    *   Sudden, sharp movements in any available prediction or betting markets toward a specific game.
    *   Leaks from TGA rehearsals or production staff (unlikely but possible).
    *   Early awards from other publications (e.g., IGN, Gamespot) coalescing around one title.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Social media discourse from jurors emphasizing a "split vote" or "tough choice," which could open the door for an upset.
    *   A sudden surge in public support/social media campaigns for a non-favorite, which could signal a stronger-than-expected 10% public vote influence.
    *   Key media figures expressing disappointment or mixed feelings about a frontrunner post-embargo.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Hypothetical Sources:** The analysis relies on the provided sources being accurate representations of the 2025 landscape. The information, especially the nomination count, is the linchpin of this forecast.
*   **Assumption of Nomination:** The analysis assumes all six listed games are the final GOTY nominees. The provided sources only explicitly confirm two, which is a potential data gap.
*   **"God of War" Scenario:** A critically beloved game can still win GOTY over a game with more nominations (e.g., *God of War* over *Red Dead Redemption 2* in 2018). If *Death Stranding 2* or *Hades II* achieved a higher average Metascore and a stronger narrative, an upset is possible.
*   **Jury Composition Shift:** The global jury of TGA is large and its composition can change year-to-year. A significant shift in voting outlets could alter historical patterns and genre preferences.
*   **The 10% Public Vote:** While small, a highly concentrated public vote for a fan-favorite like *Silksong* or *Hades II* combined with a fractured jury vote could theoretically produce a surprise winner.

**Final Research Summary:** The evidence, particularly the provided source stating *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* leads with a commanding 13 nominations, makes it the overwhelming favorite. This aligns with historical data where the most-nominated game often wins, positioning it far ahead of plausible but distant challenger *Death Stranding 2* and the high-risk, high-reward indie contenders.

To forecast which game will win the 2025 Game of the Year Award, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: Base rate of ~60-70% as it leads with the most nominations, a strong historical indicator of success.
- **Death Stranding 2: On the Beach**: Base rate of ~17% as a nominee with a respected developer and potential critical acclaim.
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Base rate of ~17% as a nominee, but likely lower due to genre bias against platformers.
- **Hades II**: Base rate of ~17% as a nominee, but lower due to indie status.
- **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Base rate of ~17% as a nominee, but lower due to indie status.
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: Base rate of ~17% as a nominee, but lower due to niche appeal.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Clair Obscur**: Similar to past winners with most nominations; different as a new IP.
- **Death Stranding 2**: Similar to past winners with high production values; different due to polarizing predecessor.
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Different due to genre bias.
- **Hades II** and **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Different due to indie status.
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: Different due to niche appeal.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Clair Obscur**: High likelihood of winning given nomination count (P(E | H) very high).
- **Death Stranding 2**: Moderate likelihood due to developer prestige (P(E | H) moderate).
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Low likelihood due to genre bias (P(E | H) low).
- **Hades II** and **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Low likelihood due to indie status (P(E | H) low).
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: Low likelihood due to niche appeal (P(E | H) low).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **Clair Obscur**: Prior odds of 0.7/(1-0.7) = 2.33; strong evidence increases odds significantly.
- **Death Stranding 2**: Prior odds of 0.17/(1-0.17) = 0.20; moderate evidence increases odds slightly.
- **Others**: Prior odds of 0.17/(1-0.17) = 0.20; weak evidence decreases odds.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- Consider potential overconfidence in **Clair Obscur** due to new IP status.
- Consider alternative scenarios where **Death Stranding 2** or an indie game wins due to critical acclaim or public vote influence.

### 6. Final Normalization
- Adjust probabilities to sum to 100%, considering evidence and base rates.

### 7. Output Format
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 65%  
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 20%  
Donkey Kong Bananza: 5%  
Hades II: 4%  
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 3%  
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 3%  
(sum ~100%)

# Analysis of 2025 Game of the Year Award Contenders

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Looking at the options, I need to establish appropriate base rates for each game:

**Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**
- Base rate: 35%
- Rationale: The research report indicates it leads with 13 nominations, and historically, the most-nominated game has approximately a 60-70% chance of winning GOTY. However, as a new IP, I'll adjust this downward slightly.

**Death Stranding 2: On the Beach**
- Base rate: 25% 
- Rationale: AAA sequel from renowned director Hideo Kojima. The original was polarizing but critically acclaimed. AAA narrative-driven games from established auteurs have historically performed well.

**Hades II**
- Base rate: 15%
- Rationale: Sequel to a critically acclaimed indie game that was previously nominated. Supergiant Games has strong industry respect, but indie games historically face challenges winning the top award.

**Hollow Knight: Silksong**
- Base rate: 10%
- Rationale: Highly anticipated indie sequel with a passionate fanbase. Similar to Hades II, but with a slightly lower prior due to genre (metroidvania vs. roguelike action).

**Donkey Kong Bananza**
- Base rate: 7.5%
- Rationale: Nintendo platformers, while popular, rarely win GOTY. The genre has historically underperformed in this category.

**Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**
- Base rate: 7.5%
- Rationale: Niche historical RPG sequel. The first game had a dedicated following but wasn't a mainstream hit. This genre/style has lower historical precedent for winning.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to historical patterns:**
- The nominees represent a mix of AAA and indie titles
- There's a balance of sequels and new IPs
- The genres represented (action-adventure, RPG, platformer) align with historical nominee patterns

**Key differences:**
- Clair Obscur is a new IP leading in nominations, which is unusual
- Two major indie sequels (Hades II and Silksong) are in contention, suggesting stronger indie representation
- No game from traditionally dominant studios like Naughty Dog, Rockstar, or Santa Monica Studio
- The field appears more open than in some previous years

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence: Clair Obscur has 13 nominations**
- P(E|H): If Clair Obscur is the winner, it would very likely lead in nominations (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If Clair Obscur is not the winner, it would be unusual but not unprecedented for it to lead in nominations (~30%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 in favor of Clair Obscur winning

**Evidence: Death Stranding 2 is explicitly mentioned as a nominee**
- P(E|H): If DS2 is the winner, it would certainly be a nominee (100%)
- P(E|~H): If DS2 is not the winner, it would still be a nominee (100%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1:1 (neutral)

**Evidence: Historical genre bias toward narrative-driven action-adventure/RPGs**
- P(E|H): If Clair Obscur or Death Stranding 2 wins, they would likely fit this pattern (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If another game wins, it might not fit this pattern as strongly (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 in favor of Clair Obscur or Death Stranding 2

**Evidence: Indie games have never won GOTY at The Game Awards**
- P(E|H): If Hades II or Silksong wins, this would break the pattern (0%)
- P(E|~H): If they don't win, this maintains the pattern (100%)
- Likelihood ratio: Strong evidence against Hades II and Silksong

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update for Clair Obscur based on its nomination count:
- Prior odds: 35/65 = 0.538
- Likelihood ratio: 3
- Posterior odds: 0.538 × 3 = 1.615
- Posterior probability: 1.615/(1+1.615) = 0.618 or ~62%

For Death Stranding 2, considering the genre bias and Kojima's reputation:
- Prior odds: 25/75 = 0.333
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- Posterior odds: 0.333 × 1.5 = 0.5
- Posterior probability: 0.5/(1+0.5) = 0.333 or ~33%

For Hades II, considering the indie game historical disadvantage:
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (negative evidence)
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.5 = 0.088
- Posterior probability: 0.088/(1+0.088) = 0.081 or ~8%

Similar downward adjustments apply to the remaining games based on their genres and historical patterns.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be overweighting the "most nominations" heuristic. In 2018, God of War beat Red Dead Redemption 2 despite the latter having more nominations.
- The public vote (10%) could be more influential if there's a split jury vote and strong public sentiment for an indie darling like Silksong.
- I may be underestimating Hades II - the original Hades was extremely well-received and came close to breaking the indie ceiling.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Death Stranding 2 could be a masterpiece that refines the original's divisive elements, making it more broadly appealing while maintaining its artistic vision.
- Silksong has been anticipated for years - this pent-up demand could translate to an unusually strong public vote component.
- Donkey Kong could be a revolutionary platformer that transcends genre limitations.

After consideration, I'll slightly reduce Clair Obscur's probability and redistribute some weight to the alternatives.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting the probabilities to account for red team considerations and ensuring they sum to 100%:

- Clair Obscur: 58%
- Death Stranding 2: 22% 
- Hades II: 9%
- Hollow Knight: Silksong: 6%
- Donkey Kong Bananza: 3%
- Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 2%

## 7. Final Forecast

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 58%
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 22%
Hades II: 9%
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 6%
Donkey Kong Bananza: 3%
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 2%
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate initial base rate is to assume all six games listed are the official nominees for Game of the Year. Since 2017, The Game Awards has featured six nominees in this category. Without any further information, each nominee would have an equal chance of winning.

*   **Base Rate**: The probability of any single nominee winning is 1 in 6, or approximately **16.7%**. This serves as a uniform prior for each of the six options before considering specific evidence.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities**: The award structure (90% jury, 10% public vote) and the typical mix of genres (AAA action-adventure/RPG, high-profile sequels, potential indie darlings) are consistent with previous years.
*   **Differences**: The key unusual factor highlighted in the research is a new IP from a new studio (*Clair Obscur*) reportedly leading the nomination count by a large margin. This is a departure from years often dominated by established AAA studios like Rockstar or Naughty Dog. Additionally, the presence of two sequels to genre-defining indie games (*Hades II*, *Hollow Knight: Silksong*) makes the field of challengers particularly strong in that category.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence for how they shift probabilities from the 16.7% base rate.

*   **Evidence 1: *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* leads with 13 nominations.**
    *   This is the single most powerful piece of evidence provided. Historically, the game with the most nominations has a very high chance of winning GOTY (e.g., *Baldur's Gate 3*, *Elden Ring*, *The Last of Us Part II*). This indicates broad and deep critical acclaim across multiple facets of game design (art, music, narrative, direction), which aligns perfectly with the criteria for GOTY.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment**: The probability of a game leading with a commanding 13 nominations *given that it wins GOTY* is very high. The probability of it having that many nominations *given that it does not win* is much lower. This creates a very high likelihood ratio in favor of *Clair Obscur*.

*   **Evidence 2: Developer Pedigree and Genre.**
    *   ***Death Stranding 2***: Benefits from the "auteur" status of Hideo Kojima, a highly respected figure among critics. This makes it a plausible prestige pick.
    *   ***Hades II***: Supergiant Games is a critical darling, and the original *Hades* was a GOTY nominee. This gives it significant credibility. However, the historical base rate for an indie game winning is 0%, which is a strong negative factor.
    *   ***Hollow Knight: Silksong***: Similar to *Hades II*, it has immense fan hype but faces the same "indie barrier."
    *   ***Donkey Kong Bananza***: Platformers have historically struggled to win against epic RPGs and Action-Adventure games.
    *   ***Kingdom Come: Deliverance II***: As a sequel to a more niche "hardcore" RPG, it may lack the broad critical consensus of recent winners.

*   **Evidence 3: Explicit Mention as Nominee.**
    *   The report explicitly mentions *Clair Obscur* and *Death Stranding 2* as nominees. This slightly increases their salience but is weak evidence compared to the nomination count, as all six options are assumed to be nominees for this forecast.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
Let's perform a conceptual update for the frontrunner, *Clair Obscur*.

1.  **Prior**: P(Clair Obscur wins) = 16.7% (Odds of 1:5 or 0.2).
2.  **Evidence**: Leads with 13 nominations. The base rate for the most-nominated game winning is cited as ~60-70%. Let's use this to estimate a likelihood ratio. The chance of the winner being the most-nominated is high (~60%), while the chance of a non-winner being the most-nominated is low. This suggests a strong likelihood ratio, perhaps around 6:1 or higher.
3.  **Posterior Update**:
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.2 × 6 = 1.2
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 1.2 / (1 + 1.2) = 1.2 / 2.2 ≈ 55%

This single piece of evidence dramatically shifts the probability for *Clair Obscur* from 16.7% to over 50%. The remaining probability must be redistributed among the other contenders, with each being pushed down from the initial 16.7% prior. *Death Stranding 2* remains the most plausible AAA challenger due to its pedigree, while *Hades II* is the strongest dark horse, despite the historical indie disadvantage.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the single data point of *Clair Obscur*'s 13 nominations. Is this overconfidence? The main risk is a "God of War vs. Red Dead Redemption 2" scenario (2018), where a game with fewer nominations but a more cohesive and emotionally resonant experience wins. *Death Stranding 2*, as an auteur-driven project, is the most likely candidate to fit this role. Another risk is underestimating the potential for a breakthrough indie win; if *Hades II* is a transcendent masterpiece, it could defy history. To account for these possibilities, I will keep the probabilities for *Death Stranding 2* and *Hades II* significant, rather than assigning almost all probability to the frontrunner. I have capped *Clair Obscur* at 55% instead of 60-70% to reflect this uncertainty and the potential for an upset.

### 6. Final Normalization
The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the relative strengths and weaknesses of each candidate, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **Clair Obscur (55%)**: The overwhelming favorite based on the strongest available predictive data (nomination count).
*   **Death Stranding 2 (22%)**: The most credible AAA challenger, banking on developer prestige and the potential for an upset.
*   **Hades II (12%)**: The strongest indie contender with a real, albeit historically unprecedented, path to victory.
*   **Hollow Knight: Silksong (5%)**: A beloved indie, but likely has a lower chance than *Hades II* given the latter's predecessor was a recent GOTY nominee.
*   **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (3%)** & **Donkey Kong Bananza (3%)**: Long shots due to genre and likely narrower appeal compared to the frontrunners.

The final probabilities are normalized and sum to 100%.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 55%
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 22%
Hades II: 12%
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 5%
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 3%
Donkey Kong Bananza: 3%
