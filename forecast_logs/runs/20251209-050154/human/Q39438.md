### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the statutory basis of the dispute, specifically the key language and historical application of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)?
    *   What are the primary legal arguments for and against the President's authority to impose these specific tariffs under IEEPA? This includes both the general power to impose tariffs and the specific nexus between the tariffs and the declared emergencies.
    *   What is the relevant Supreme Court precedent regarding (a) presidential power in foreign affairs/national security and (b) broad delegations of authority from Congress to the executive (e.g., the Major Questions Doctrine)?
    *   How might the jurisprudential leanings of the current Supreme Court justices (textualism, originalism, institutionalism, views on executive power) influence their approach to this case?
    *   What is the significance of the lower court rulings, particularly the split in reasoning between the Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit and the D.C. District Court?
    *   What are the procedural implications of the expedited review, and how does the timeline affect the likelihood of a 2025 ruling?

2.  **Propose Search Queries:**
    *   `"International Emergency Economic Powers Act" text and legislative history`
    *   `IEEPA "deal with" "unusual and extraordinary threat" legal analysis`
    *   `Dames & Moore v. Regan IEEPA analysis`
    *   `Trump v. Hawaii Supreme Court deference foreign policy`
    *   `West Virginia v. EPA "major questions doctrine" explained`
    *   `Justice Gorsuch nondelegation doctrine administrative state`
    *   `Chief Justice Roberts statutory interpretation narrow grounds`
    *   `Supreme Court certiorari before judgment implications`
    *   `SCOTUS argument to decision timeline expedited cases`

3.  **Synthesize Key Findings:**
    *   The core legal dispute hinges on whether IEEPA's broad grant of authority to "regulate" foreign commerce to "deal with" a national emergency encompasses the power to impose tariffs, a power Congress has typically delegated through more specific trade statutes.
    *   There are two distinct legal challenges: (1) a categorical challenge that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs at all (*Learning Resources*), and (2) an as-applied challenge that these specific tariffs lack a sufficient nexus to the declared emergencies (*V.O.S. Selections*).
    *   The Supreme Court faces a conflict between two powerful jurisprudential currents: its historical deference to the President in foreign affairs (*Trump v. Hawaii*) and its recent, conservative-led skepticism of broad executive authority over major economic questions (*West Virginia v. EPA*).
    *   The different justifications for the "trafficking tariffs" (plausibly linked to a national security threat) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (based on a more novel "trade deficit" emergency) provide the Court a clear path to a split or "Mixed" ruling.
    *   The expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling highly likely, significantly reducing the probability of the "No 2025 ruling" option.

4.  **Draft Comprehensive Answer:**
    *   (The following brief is the output of this step).

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major SCOTUS Cases on Presidential Foreign Affairs/National Security Powers:** In cases where the President acts under a broad congressional delegation in the realm of foreign policy or national security, the Court has historically shown significant deference. A key recent example is *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), which upheld the travel ban. In this reference class, the executive branch wins a clear majority of the time.
    *   **Base Rate (for "Tariffs lawful"):** 60-70%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class prioritizes the national security and foreign commerce aspects of the case, where judicial deference is highest.
2.  **Major SCOTUS Cases on Broad Statutory Delegation (Major Questions Doctrine):** In recent years, the Court has increasingly scrutinized executive actions that have vast economic and political significance, requiring a clear statement from Congress to authorize such actions. Key examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022). In this class, the executive branch often loses.
    *   **Base Rate (for "Tariffs unlawful"):** 60-70%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class views the imposition of a sweeping tariff regime as a major economic question that IEEPA's general language may not be clear enough to support.
3.  **SCOTUS Review of Lower Court Unanimity:** When the Supreme Court reviews a case where multiple lower courts have ruled in the same direction (here, against the government), it often affirms, but reversals are not uncommon, especially on ideologically charged or high-stakes issues. The unanimity below, however, signals that the government's legal position is on weaker-than-average footing.
    *   **Base Rate (for "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling"):** 55-65%.

**Limitation:** This case sits at the direct intersection of reference classes #1 and #2, which point in opposite directions. This tension is the central dynamic of the case and suggests that a simple base rate from either class is likely misleading. The conflict itself elevates the probability of a "Mixed ruling" or a narrow, statutory ruling.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms ruling against tariffs (7-4) — ↓ Tariffs lawful — A key appellate court, en banc, found the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority. The split decision, however, shows the government's arguments have some traction.
*   **2025-09-03** Government seeks Supreme Court review of *V.O.S. Selections* — (neutral) — An expected procedural step following the adverse appellate court ruling.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule — ↓ No 2025 ruling; ↑ Other options — The Court's speed signals the issue's importance and makes a ruling by year-end highly probable. It commits the Court to a merits decision.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Deference to Executive in Foreign Affairs:** A powerful, long-standing doctrine that the President has primary authority and expertise in foreign policy and national security. Justices may be hesitant to second-guess a national emergency declaration. (Large driver for **Tariffs lawful**).
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine/Nondelegation Concerns:** A growing counter-current, particularly among conservative justices, holding that Congress must speak exceptionally clearly when delegating authority over issues of vast economic and political significance. A nationwide tariff regime fits this description. (Large driver for **Tariffs unlawful**).
3.  **Statutory Textualism:** The outcome may hinge on the precise meaning of IEEPA's text. Does "regulate" commerce include imposing tariffs? Does the tariff action "deal with" the declared threat? This focus on text could lead to a narrow ruling. (Moderate driver for **Tariffs unlawful** or **Mixed ruling**

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we need to evaluate the probabilities for each option using Bayesian reasoning. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to the executive branch in matters of foreign policy and national security, as seen in cases like *Trump v. Hawaii*. This suggests a base rate of 60-70% for the executive's actions being upheld.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Recent trends, particularly the Major Questions Doctrine, indicate skepticism towards broad executive actions without clear congressional authorization, as seen in *West Virginia v. EPA*. This suggests a base rate of 60-70% for the executive's actions being struck down.

- **Mixed ruling**: Given the complexity of the case and the possibility of the Court finding some tariffs lawful and others not, a base rate of 55-65% is reasonable, considering the split nature of the lower court rulings.

- **Other ruling**: Historically, the Supreme Court rarely issues rulings that do not address the merits in high-profile cases, especially when expedited. A base rate of 10-20% is appropriate.

- **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule and the Court's commitment to a decision make this unlikely. A base rate of 5-10% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- The current case involves both national security and major economic questions, placing it at the intersection of the two reference classes. This tension suggests a higher likelihood of a mixed ruling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Lower court rulings**: Both the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court ruled against the tariffs, suggesting a higher likelihood of the Supreme Court finding them unlawful. This evidence decreases the probability of "Tariffs lawful" and increases "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

- **Federal Circuit affirmation**: The Federal Circuit's affirmation of the lower court's decision, albeit with a split, further supports the likelihood of the tariffs being found unlawful.

- **Expedited Supreme Court review**: The expedited schedule suggests the Court sees the issue as urgent, increasing the likelihood of a 2025 ruling and decreasing the probability of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds (0.65) × Likelihood ratio (0.3) = Posterior odds (0.195). Posterior probability = 0.195 / (1 + 0.195) ≈ 16%.

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds (0.65) × Likelihood ratio (0.7) = Posterior odds (0.455). Posterior probability = 0.455 / (1 + 0.455) ≈ 31%.

- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds (0.6) × Likelihood ratio (0.5) = Posterior odds (0.3). Posterior probability = 0.3 / (1 + 0.3) ≈ 23%.

- **Other ruling**: Prior odds (0.15) × Likelihood ratio (0.1) = Posterior odds (0.015). Posterior probability = 0.015 / (1 + 0.015) ≈ 1.5%.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds (0.075) × Likelihood ratio (0.05) = Posterior odds (0.00375). Posterior probability = 0.00375 / (1 + 0.00375) ≈ 0.4%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of the Court issuing a narrow ruling focused on statutory interpretation, which could increase the likelihood of a mixed ruling.

- Evaluate the potential for political dynamics to influence the decision, given the high-profile nature of the case.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%: Adjusted probabilities are consistent with the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 16%  
Tariffs unlawful: 31%  
Mixed ruling: 23%  
Other ruling: 1.5%  
No 2025 ruling: 0.4%  

(Sum ~100%)

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Tariffs lawful (25% prior):**
- Historical deference to executive power in foreign affairs and national security (e.g., Trump v. Hawaii)
- Conservative-leaning court (6-3) might favor presidential authority
- IEEPA grants broad emergency powers to regulate commerce

**Tariffs unlawful (40% prior):**
- Lower courts unanimously ruled against the tariffs (both Court of International Trade and DC District Court)
- Federal Circuit affirmed 7-4 against the tariffs
- Recent Supreme Court skepticism of broad executive authority (Major Questions Doctrine)

**Mixed ruling (25% prior):**
- The Court often seeks narrow, compromise positions in politically charged cases
- Two distinct types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provide natural splitting point
- Different legal theories in lower courts suggest multiple avenues for partial rulings

**Other ruling (5% prior):**
- Procedural dismissals are relatively rare in expedited cases granted cert
- Court has shown willingness to reach merits in similar high-profile cases

**No 2025 ruling (5% prior):**
- Expedited schedule with November arguments strongly suggests 2025 ruling
- Court granted cert specifically to resolve quickly

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other national security cases, involves presidential claims of emergency powers
- Similar to other major questions cases involving economic significance
- Follows pattern of expedited review for urgent national issues

**Key differences:**
- Unusual intersection of trade policy and national security
- Two distinct legal theories challenging the tariffs
- Expedited review of consolidated cases from different courts
- Particularly broad application of IEEPA to impose sweeping tariffs

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Lower courts unanimously ruled against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 (Supreme Court often reverses, especially in executive power cases)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 (Strong signal of legal weakness in government's position)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.6 (Suggests legal vulnerabilities but room for nuance)

**Evidence: Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.4 (The dissent provides some legal foundation)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.7 (Strong but not unanimous signal)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.6 (Split reasoning suggests potential compromise)

**Evidence: Different legal theories in lower courts**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 (Multiple theories of invalidity)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.5 (Convergent outcomes despite different reasoning)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.8 (Perfect setup for splitting the difference)

**Evidence: Expedited review granted**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.1 (Very unlikely given expedited schedule)
- P(E|Other options) = 0.6 (Court intends to resolve on merits)

**Evidence: Two distinct types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal)**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.4 (Both could be upheld)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.4 (Both could be struck down)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.8 (Natural dividing line for a split decision)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs:

**For Tariffs lawful:**
- Prior odds: 25/75 = 0.33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 0.43 = 0.14
- Posterior probability: 0.14/(1+0.14) ≈ 12%

**For Tariffs unlawful:**
- Prior odds: 40/60 = 0.67
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.4 = 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 2.0 = 1.34
- Posterior probability: 1.34/(1+1.34) ≈ 57%

**For Mixed ruling:**
- Prior odds: 25/75 = 0.33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.5 = 1.2
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 1.2 = 0.4
- Posterior probability: 0.4/(1+0.4) ≈ 29%

Now updating on the existence of two distinct types of tariffs:

**For Tariffs lawful:**
- Prior (from above): 12%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.6 = 0.67
- Posterior odds: 0.14 × 0.67 = 0.09
- Posterior probability: 0.09/(1+0.09) ≈ 8%

**For Tariffs unlawful:**
- Prior (from above): 57%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.6 = 0.67
- Posterior odds: 1.33 × 0.67 = 0.89
- Posterior probability: 0.89/(1+0.89) ≈ 47%

**For Mixed ruling:**
- Prior (from above): 29%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.4 = 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.41 × 2.0 = 0.82
- Posterior probability: 0.82/(1+0.82) ≈ 45%

For the expedited review evidence:

**For No 2025 ruling:**
- Prior: 5%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.6 = 0.17
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.17 = 0.009
- Posterior probability: 0.009/(1+0.009) ≈ 1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the Court's tendency toward compromise in politically charged cases
- The conservative majority might be more deferential to executive power than recent Major Questions cases suggest
- The Court could find a procedural way out despite the expedited schedule

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs (national security) but strike down the reciprocal tariffs (trade deficit)
- The Court might focus narrowly on statutory interpretation of IEEPA rather than broader constitutional questions
- Political considerations might influence the timing of the decision

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly increase "Mixed ruling" probability given the natural dividing line between tariff types
- Slightly decrease "No 2025 ruling" given the expedited schedule
- Maintain relatively low "Tariffs lawful" given unanimous lower court rulings

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming:
- Tariffs lawful: 8%
- Tariffs unlawful: 45%
- Mixed ruling: 45%
- Other ruling: 1%
- No 2025 ruling: 1%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 8%
Tariffs unlawful: 45%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 1%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

This case sits at the intersection of two conflicting legal doctrines, making a single base rate inappropriate. I will synthesize priors from two relevant reference classes:

1.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Supreme Court shows significant deference to the President in this domain (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*). This class suggests a high probability for the government winning, forming a prior for "Tariffs lawful."
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** In recent years, the Court's conservative majority has consistently curbed executive authority on issues of vast economic significance without explicit congressional authorization (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*). This class suggests a high probability for the government losing, forming a prior for "Tariffs unlawful."

The direct conflict between these two principles is the central feature of the case. This tension suggests that neither a simple "lawful" nor "unlawful" ruling is a foregone conclusion and elevates the probability of a nuanced or split decision. Therefore, I will start with a diffuse prior that reflects this conflict:

*   **P(Tariffs lawful):** 35%
*   **P(Tariffs unlawful):** 35%
*   **P(Mixed ruling):** 20%
*   **P(Other ruling):** 5%
*   **P(No 2025 ruling):** 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The case involves a President invoking national security to justify a major policy with foreign and domestic implications, similar to past deference cases. It also involves a broad interpretation of a statute to enact a policy with massive economic consequences, similar to recent Major Questions Doctrine cases.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is the existence of two distinct tariff regimes with different justifications:
    1.  **"Trafficking tariffs"** (on Mexico, Canada, China) are linked to a traditional national security threat (drug smuggling). This claim fits more comfortably within the "foreign affairs deference" framework.
    2.  **"Reciprocal tariffs"** (on most trading partners) are based on the novel emergency of "trade deficits." This claim fits squarely into the "major economic question" framework where the Court has recently been highly skeptical of executive power.
*   This structural difference provides the Court a clear path to "split the baby," treating the two tariff regimes differently.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Two distinct tariff regimes.**
    *   This evidence strongly increases the likelihood of a **Mixed ruling**. It provides a logical basis for the Court to apply different legal standards to different parts of the challenged policy, allowing it to simultaneously show deference on national security while reining in executive power on economic policy.
    *   P(E1 | Mixed) is high. P(E1 | Lawful or Unlawful) is lower. This evidence shifts probability mass towards "Mixed ruling."

*   **Evidence 2: Unanimous lower court outcomes against the tariffs, but with different reasoning.**
    *   The fact that both the Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit and the D.C. District Court ruled against the government is strong evidence against the "Tariffs lawful" option.
    *   The differing legal rationales—one categorical (*Learning Resources*: IEEPA never allows tariffs) and one as-applied (*V.O.S. Selections*: these specific tariffs lack a sufficient nexus)—give the Supreme Court multiple paths to an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling. This reinforces the weakness of the government's position.
    *   The 7-4 split in the Federal Circuit shows the government's arguments are not frivolous and have convinced several appellate judges, which slightly mitigates the signal of the loss and provides a roadmap for a potential reversal.

*   **Evidence 3: Expedited Supreme Court review.**
    *   The Court granting certiorari on an expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025 makes a ruling before the end of the year highly probable.
    *   This dramatically decreases the probability of **No 2025 ruling**.
    *   It also slightly decreases the probability of an **Other ruling** (like a procedural dismissal), as the Court's speed signals its intent to resolve the important substantive legal question.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Initial Priors:** P(Lawful): 35%, P(Unlawful): 35%, P(Mixed): 20%, P(Other): 5%, P(No ruling): 5%.
2.  **Update for Expedited Schedule:** The expedited schedule makes a 2025 decision very likely. I will significantly reduce "No 2025 ruling" to 3% and slightly reduce "Other ruling" to 3%. I will redistribute the freed-up 4% proportionally to the three merits outcomes.
    *   *Intermediate Probabilities:* P(Lawful): ~37%, P(Unlawful): ~37%, P(Mixed): ~20%, P(Other): 3%, P(No ruling): 3%.
3.  **Update for Substantive Evidence:** The dual nature of the tariffs provides a compelling path for a compromise, which is characteristic of the Roberts Court in major cases. This strongly boosts **Mixed ruling**. The adverse lower court rulings and the momentum of the Major Questions Doctrine strongly boost **Unlawful** relative to **Lawful**. A complete win for the government seems like the least likely merits outcome. The central contest is between a complete loss for the government ("Unlawful") and a partial loss ("Mixed"). These two outcomes seem roughly equally plausible.

    *   I assess that the evidence makes "Mixed ruling" and "Tariffs unlawful" the two most likely, and roughly co-equal, outcomes. A "Mixed" ruling resolves the doctrinal tension neatly. An "Unlawful" ruling would be a powerful continuation of the Court's recent trend on administrative power. A full "Lawful" ruling would require the Court to ignore this trend entirely in favor of executive deference, which seems less likely.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast places "Lawful" as a distant third. Could I be underestimating the power of national security deference? The Court in *Trump v. Hawaii* was very deferential. A majority could decide that once the President declares an emergency under IEEPA, the Court's role is minimal. This is a real possibility, especially given the 4 dissents on the Federal Circuit. Therefore, the probability of "Lawful" should not be negligible.

Conversely, am I over-weighting the "Mixed" compromise scenario? The conservative majority might prefer a cleaner, more sweeping ruling that IEEPA simply does not authorize tariffs, setting a clearer precedent against broad delegations of congressional power. This would lead to a simple "Unlawful" ruling.

Considering these points, I believe my assessment of "Mixed" and "Unlawful" as the two front-runners is sound, as they represent the two most plausible paths for the current Court: a tailored, compromising path or a bold, doctrine-reinforcing path. I will keep them closely matched. I will assign a non-trivial probability to "Lawful" to account for the possibility of extreme deference.

### 6. Final Normalization

After weighing the conflicting legal doctrines, the specific facts of the case, and the procedural posture, I arrive at the following distribution:

*   **Tariffs unlawful** and **Mixed ruling** are the most probable outcomes, reflecting the tension between the Major Questions Doctrine and executive deference. The two distinct tariff regimes make a mixed ruling a very plausible compromise.
*   **Tariffs lawful** is a less likely but still possible outcome, contingent on the Court prioritizing executive power in foreign affairs above all else.
*   **Other ruling** and **No 2025 ruling** are tail risks, made less likely by the Court's decision to expedite the case.

My final probabilities are:

Tariffs lawful: 18%
Tariffs unlawful: 38%
Mixed ruling: 38%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 3%
