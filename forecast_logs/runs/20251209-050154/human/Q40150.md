To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the U.S. conducting military attacks in foreign countries without a direct threat to U.S. interests is relatively low. Historically, the U.S. has engaged in military actions primarily when there is a direct threat to national security or significant geopolitical interests. Given the context of Nigeria, a reasonable base rate might be around 5%, reflecting the rarity of such actions without direct provocation or strategic necessity.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The U.S. has previously engaged in military actions in regions with significant terrorist activity, especially when there is a perceived threat to U.S. interests or allies.
   - Differences: Nigeria, while facing internal conflicts, does not pose a direct threat to U.S. national security. The situation is more about internal strife and religious violence, which typically does not trigger U.S. military intervention unless there are broader geopolitical implications.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Trump's Statements**: The President's public statements and orders to the DoD to prepare for possible action increase the likelihood of intervention. However, such rhetoric does not always translate into action, especially given the potential international backlash and lack of direct U.S. interests.
     - Likelihood Ratio: Moderate increase (e.g., 1.5x) due to the President's statements.
   - **International and Domestic Constraints**: The U.S. faces significant international and domestic constraints on military action, especially in a country like Nigeria, where the implications could be complex and costly.
     - Likelihood Ratio: Decrease (e.g., 0.5x) due to these constraints.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 5% / 95% = 0.0526
   - Likelihood ratio = 1.5 (Trump's statements) × 0.5 (constraints) = 0.75
   - Posterior odds = 0.0526 × 0.75 = 0.03945
   - Posterior probability = 0.03945 / (1 + 0.03945) ≈ 3.8%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast might underestimate the impact of political rhetoric, especially under a President known for unconventional decisions.
   - Alternative Scenario: A significant escalation in violence against Christians could increase domestic pressure for intervention, though this remains speculative.
   - Adjustments: Given the potential for unexpected political decisions, a slight increase in probability might be warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unexpected political actions, the final probability is adjusted slightly upwards to account for these factors.

Final: 5%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a base rate, I'll consider how often the US has conducted military attacks in African countries in recent decades, particularly in response to terrorist threats or humanitarian concerns.

The US has conducted military operations in:
- Somalia (ongoing counterterrorism operations)
- Libya (2011 intervention, plus limited strikes afterward)
- Mali (support operations)
- Niger (advisory and support roles)
- Cameroon (advisory and support roles)

However, direct US military attacks in African nations have been relatively limited. The US typically prefers:
- Supporting local forces
- Intelligence sharing
- Drone strikes in specific cases
- Limited special operations

Given that we have less than a month until the resolution date (January 1, 2026), and considering the historical frequency of US military attacks in African nations, I'll set a base rate of approximately 5%.

Prior probability: 5% (1:19 odds against an attack)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Nigeria faces terrorist threats (Boko Haram, ISWAP) similar to other African nations where the US has provided support
- The US has security interests in regional stability
- The US has historically preferred supporting local forces rather than direct intervention

**Differences from base case:**
- President Trump has explicitly threatened military action, which is unusual and significant
- The threat specifically mentions religious persecution (Christians), adding a domestic political dimension
- Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and a major regional power, making intervention more consequential than in smaller nations
- The timeline is extremely short (less than a month until 2026)
- Trump's second administration may have different foreign policy approaches than previous administrations

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit threat of military action**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US were planning to attack, such threats would likely precede action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Trump has made threats that weren't followed by military action before
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence increases the probability significantly

**Evidence 2: The extremely short timeframe (less than a month)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Military operations typically require planning time
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - The short timeframe makes non-action more likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence decreases the probability significantly

**Evidence 3: The severity of the situation in Nigeria**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - The situation is serious but has been ongoing for years
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Many serious situations don't trigger US military intervention
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: US historical preference for supporting local forces rather than direct intervention**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Direct attacks are less common than support operations
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Non-intervention aligns with historical patterns
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375
- This evidence decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:19 (5%)

Update on Trump's explicit threat:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1/19 × 3.0 = 3/19 ≈ 0.158
- Posterior probability = 0.158/(1+0.158) ≈ 13.6%

Update on extremely short timeframe:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.158 × 0.25 = 0.0395
- Posterior probability = 0.0395/(1+0.0395) ≈ 3.8%

Update on severity of situation:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0395 × 1.2 = 0.0474
- Posterior probability = 0.0474/(1+0.0474) ≈ 4.5%

Update on US historical preference:
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0474 × 0.375 = 0.01778
- Posterior probability = 0.01778/(1+0.01778) ≈ 1.7%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's willingness to take dramatic action in his second term
- The religious persecution angle could create stronger domestic political pressure than I've accounted for
- Limited strikes or special operations might occur without public announcement
- The US might have intelligence about imminent threats that would justify immediate action

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A very limited drone strike or special forces operation could occur, which would technically count as a "military attack"
- The US might conduct a joint operation with Nigerian forces that could be classified as US military action
- A rapidly deteriorating situation could prompt emergency action

Given these considerations, my probability of 1.7% seems too low. The possibility of limited strikes or special operations that would technically qualify as "military attacks" deserves more weight, especially given Trump's explicit threats.

## 6. Final Forecast

Adjusting for the red team considerations, I'll increase my forecast from 1.7% to 4%.

Final: 4%
