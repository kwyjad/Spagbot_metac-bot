### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Controversial Social Policy Changes in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA):** The NDAA is a "must-pass" annual bill, making it a target for attaching controversial policy changes. However, leadership often strips such provisions to ensure the bill's primary function (funding the military) is not jeopardized. The base rate for a controversial social policy provision surviving the conference committee process after failing in previous years is low, likely in the **10-20% range** per two-year congressional session. This is based on historical examples like attempts to repeal "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" before its eventual success.
2.  **Major Amendments to the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA):** Significant changes to the MSSA are rare. The system has remained largely unchanged for decades. Since the end of the draft in 1973 and the reinstatement of registration in 1980, no fundamental changes to *who* must register have been enacted. The base rate of such a change in any given 2-year period is very low, arguably **<5%**.
3.  **Policies with Bipartisan Elite Support but Strong Grassroots Opposition:** This policy fits a class where military leadership, national security experts, and establishment figures in both parties agree on a course of action, but a vocal coalition of social conservatives and anti-war progressives opposes it. Such initiatives often stall for years due to legislative inertia and electoral risk. The base rate for overcoming this specific political alignment within a short timeframe like two years is low, estimated at **15-25%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2024-07-31** S.4881 introduced to repeal the MSSA entirely. ↓ — This offers an alternative path for opponents, muddying the debate away from expansion towards abolition, making a "Yes" resolution less likely.
- **2024-06-20** News reports confirm the SASC-passed FY25 NDAA includes female registration, while the House version proposes automatic male registration. ↔︎ — This repeats the pattern of previous years, setting up a predictable conflict in the conference committee where the provision is likely to be stripped.
- **2023-01-12** CRS report confirms the provision for female registration was again removed from the final FY23 NDAA. ↓ — Reinforces the strong precedent of failure. The political coalition blocking the change proved effective for a second consecutive year.
- **2022-12-07** News reports indicate the provision requiring women to register was dropped from the final FY23 NDAA. ↓ — Demonstrates the persistent and successful opposition, primarily from House Republicans, making future success less likely without a significant political shift.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Legislative Inertia in the NDAA Process (Large ↓):** The path of least resistance for passing the massive, must-pass NDAA is to remove controversial items. Given this provision has been a sticking point for years, it is a prime candidate for removal during conference committee negotiations to ensure the bill's passage.
2.  **Ideologically Diverse Opposition (Large ↓):** A powerful "strange bedfellows" coalition of social conservatives (who oppose women in combat roles on principle) and anti-war progressives (who oppose expanding any draft infrastructure) creates a significant blocking coalition, particularly in the House.
3.  **Military and Establishment Support (Moderate ↑):** The Department of Defense, the NCMNPS commission, and many senior congressional leaders (like Sen. Jack Reed) support the change on grounds of equity and military readiness. This ensures the issue is repeatedly introduced.
4.  **Latent Constitutional Pressure (Moderate ↑):** The legal justification for male-only registration (*Rostker v. Goldberg*, 1981) is widely seen as obsolete since women are now eligible for all combat roles. The Supreme Court's 2021 denial of cert explicitly deferred to Congress, implying that if Congress fails to act, the Court may eventually be forced to strike down the current law.
5.  **Focus on Abolition as an Alternative (Small ↓):** A growing caucus argues for abolishing the Selective Service entirely rather than expanding it. This diverts energy from the "expand to women" debate and provides political cover for those who don't want to vote for the expansion.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Explicit Judicial Deference:** Unlike many policy debates, the Supreme Court has directly signaled that (a) the current law is on thin ice constitutionally, but (b) it will wait for Congress to act. This puts the onus entirely on a gridlocked legislative branch, making judicial action unlikely before the 2026 deadline.
- **Repeated, Recent Failures:** The reference class of "controversial NDAA amendments" is broad. This specific provision has failed in the exact same manner for multiple consecutive years (FY22, FY23), strengthening the case that the status quo is a powerful equilibrium.
- **Lack of Public Salience:** Unlike DADT repeal, which had significant public advocacy, there is no major grassroots movement pushing for women to be included in the draft. The pressure is almost entirely top-down from the defense establishment.
- **Divided Government:** With a politically divided and often gridlocked Congress, passing any controversial legislation is exceptionally difficult. The dynamics that caused the provision to fail in 2021 and 2022 remain largely in place.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Based on the reference classes (especially repeated NDAA failures), a reasonable prior for this change occurring in a ~2-year window would be low, around **15%** (equivalent n ≈ 10).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - (↓ Large) Repeated failure of the provision to pass in the FY22 and FY23 NDAAs demonstrates the strength of the blocking coalition.
    - (↓ Moderate) The opposition is a durable, ideologically diverse coalition, making it hard to overcome with simple partisan bargaining.
    - (↔︎ Small) Continued inclusion in the Senate version of the NDAA is merely status quo and not new positive evidence; it's the expected start of a process that has previously failed.
    - (↑ Small) The Supreme Court's 2021 statement adds a background pressure, but its deference means it's not an immediate forcing function.
- **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the mechanisms for failure. The posterior probability should be revised downwards from the initial prior. The repeated failures are a powerful signal that the political will to overcome the final legislative hurdles is absent.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - Key House Republican leaders (e.g., Speaker, House Armed Services Committee Chair) publicly endorse including the provision in the final NDAA.
    - A federal appeals court strikes down the male-only draft, forcing the Supreme Court to take up the case sooner than expected.
    - A major geopolitical crisis that significantly increases the perceived likelihood of a draft.
    - The provision survives the House-Senate conference committee for the FY2025 NDAA.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - The provision is stripped from the FY2025 NDAA during conference negotiations (highly likely).
    - The "abolish the draft" movement gains significant co-sponsors or public support from party leadership.
    - The final FY2025 NDAA passes without the provision, leaving only one more legislative cycle before the deadline.
    - Polling shows the issue is unpopular in key swing districts ahead of an election.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Resolution Timing:** The law must *take effect* before Jan 1, 2026. A bill passed in late 2025 could easily have an effective date in 2026, which would resolve this question as "No."
- **Lame-Duck Session Politics:** A post-election lame-duck session could provide an opportunity to pass controversial legislation that members would not support otherwise. This introduces a small amount of unpredictability.
- **Judicial Action is a Wild Card:** While SCOTUS has deferred, a lower court ruling could change the timeline and force their hand, though the judicial process is typically slow.
- **Definition of "Required":** The resolution criteria are clear, but any ambiguity in a new law's text could complicate resolution. The focus must be on a legally binding requirement for women to register that is in effect.

**Final Research Summary:** The proposal to require women to register for Selective Service has consistent establishment support but has failed repeatedly against a powerful and ideologically diverse opposition in Congress. The path of least resistance is to continue stripping this provision from the annual defense bill, making a "Yes" resolution before 2026 highly unlikely.

To forecast the probability of women being required to register for US Selective Service before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for significant amendments to the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) is very low, estimated at less than 5% per two-year congressional session. This is due to the historical rarity of such changes since the end of the draft in 1973 and the reinstatement of registration in 1980.
- **Rationale:** The MSSA has remained largely unchanged for decades, and previous attempts to include women in the draft have consistently failed. This historical context provides a strong basis for a low prior probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past attempts to amend the MSSA, where provisions to include women have been introduced but ultimately removed from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) during conference negotiations.
- **Differences:** The Supreme Court's 2021 statement deferring to Congress adds a layer of constitutional pressure, but this is not an immediate forcing function. Additionally, the introduction of a bill to repeal the MSSA entirely (S.4881) adds complexity to the legislative landscape.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Repeated Failures (↓ Large):** The consistent removal of the provision from the NDAA in previous years strongly suggests a low likelihood of success. The blocking coalition remains effective.
- **Ideologically Diverse Opposition (↓ Moderate):** The coalition of social conservatives and anti-war progressives continues to oppose the change, reducing the probability of passage.
- **Continued Inclusion in Senate NDAA (↔︎ Small):** This is expected and does not provide new positive evidence.
- **Supreme Court's Statement (↑ Small):** While it adds background pressure, it does not significantly alter the legislative dynamics.
- **Focus on Abolition (↓ Small):** The push to abolish the Selective Service diverts attention from expanding it to include women.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** 5% (0.05 in probability form)
- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - Repeated failures and opposition suggest a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1, reinforcing the low probability.
- **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
  - Given the strong evidence against the change, the posterior probability remains low, likely around 3-4%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden political shift or a lame-duck session passing the provision.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A geopolitical crisis or a court ruling could force legislative action, though these remain unlikely within the timeframe.
- **Adjustment:** Considering these factors, a slight upward adjustment to account for tail risks is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of women being required to register for US Selective Service before 2026 is estimated at 5%.

Final: 5%

# Will women be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on appropriate reference classes:

- **Legislative changes to Selective Service**: Since the reinstatement of registration in 1980, there have been no fundamental changes to who must register. This suggests a very low base rate (<5%) for such changes in any 2-year period.

- **Controversial provisions in the NDAA**: The specific provision requiring women to register has been included in Senate versions but removed in final bills for both FY22 and FY23. This pattern of inclusion followed by removal establishes a precedent.

- **Policies with bipartisan elite support but grassroots opposition**: These typically face significant hurdles, with a success rate of perhaps 15-25% in a 2-year window.

Considering these reference classes and giving more weight to the specific history of this provision, I'll set a prior of **15%** that women will be required to register for Selective Service before 2026.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The issue continues to follow the established pattern: inclusion in Senate NDAA drafts followed by removal in conference committee
- The same coalition of social conservatives and anti-war progressives continues to oppose expansion
- Military leadership and establishment figures maintain support for the change

**Key differences:**
- Time is running out - with only about one year left before the deadline, there are fewer legislative opportunities remaining
- The Supreme Court has explicitly deferred to Congress on this issue, creating a background constitutional pressure
- A new alternative approach (complete repeal of MSSA) has emerged as S.4881, potentially complicating the debate

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Repeated removal from final NDAA bills (FY22, FY23)**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, it's somewhat unlikely (~30%) we would see this consistent pattern of removal
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, this pattern is highly likely (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Continued inclusion in Senate versions (including FY25)**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect continued inclusion in drafts (~95%)
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we might still see continued inclusion (~70%) as the debate continues
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Introduction of S.4881 to repeal MSSA entirely**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, it's moderately likely (~50%) that alternative approaches would emerge
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, it's highly likely (~80%) that alternative approaches would gain traction
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Supreme Court's explicit deference to Congress**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, this judicial stance is very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, this stance is still fairly likely (~70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.29
- This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (repeated removal from final bills):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.33 = 0.058
- Posterior probability: 0.058 / (1 + 0.058) ≈ 5.5%

Second update (continued inclusion in Senate versions):
- Prior odds: 0.058
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36
- Posterior odds: 0.058 × 1.36 = 0.079
- Posterior probability: 0.079 / (1 + 0.079) ≈ 7.3%

Third update (introduction of repeal bill):
- Prior odds: 0.079
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 0.079 × 0.63 = 0.050
- Posterior probability: 0.050 / (1 + 0.050) ≈ 4.8%

Fourth update (Supreme Court deference):
- Prior odds: 0.050
- Likelihood ratio: 1.29
- Posterior odds: 0.050 × 1.29 = 0.065
- Posterior probability: 0.065 / (1 + 0.065) ≈ 6.1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the recent failures and underestimating the possibility of a breakthrough in the final year
- The Supreme Court could change its stance if a new case reaches it
- A major geopolitical crisis could rapidly change the political calculus

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A lame-duck session after the 2024 election could provide political cover for passing controversial legislation
- A compromise version (e.g., requiring registration but with different service options) could emerge
- The issue could become part of a larger political bargain in a divided government

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 15-20%, arguing that:
1. Constitutional pressure will eventually force action
2. Military readiness concerns could become more salient with global tensions
3. The pattern of inclusion in Senate versions shows persistent institutional support

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome the demonstrated pattern of legislative failure. The blocking coalition has proven effective repeatedly, and with limited legislative windows remaining before 2026, the path to success is increasingly narrow.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the probability that women will be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026 is low. The consistent pattern of removal from final legislation, the diverse opposition coalition, and the limited time remaining all point to a continuation of the status quo.

I will adjust my final estimate slightly upward from my calculated 6.1% to account for possible scenarios I may have underweighted, such as judicial intervention or geopolitical catalysts.

Final: 8%

```md

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use a combination of reference classes provided in the research report:

1.  **Controversial Social Policy Changes in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA):** Such provisions often fail. The base rate for a controversial provision surviving the NDAA conference process after previous failures is low, estimated at 10-20% per two-year congressional session.
2.  **Major Amendments to the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA):** The MSSA is a historically stable law. Fundamental changes to who must register are very rare, with a base rate well below 5% in any given two-year period since 1980.
3.  **Policies with Bipartisan Elite Support but Strong Grassroots Opposition:** This political dynamic often leads to legislative stalemate. The base rate for such policies overcoming this opposition in a short timeframe is low, around 15-25%.

Synthesizing these, a reasonable prior for this change passing within a roughly two-year window is low. The repeated failures of this specific provision suggest we should be at the lower end of these ranges. I will select an initial prior probability of **10%**.

*   **Prior P(H):** 10%
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.10 / 0.90 = 1/9

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to the base case of a controversial NDAA amendment. However, there are key differences that make a "Yes" outcome less likely than the base rate suggests:

*   **Repeated, Recent Failures:** This specific provision was stripped from the final NDAA in the FY2022 cycle and the FY2023 cycle. This establishes a strong precedent and suggests the political equilibrium is stable against this change.
*   **Explicit Judicial Deference:** In 2021, the Supreme Court explicitly deferred to Congress, removing the immediate threat of a court order that might force legislative action. This allows congressional gridlock to persist.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The prompt specifies the current date is November 9, 2025. With a resolution deadline of January 1, 2026, there are fewer than two months remaining. This means the provision must be included in the FY2026 NDAA and the bill must be passed, signed, and take effect within this extremely narrow window. This is a significant deviation from a typical legislative timeline.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence, assuming the context of forecasting from November 9, 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Repeated failures in FY22, FY23, FY24, and FY25 NDAA cycles.** (Inferred for FY24/FY25, as the question is still open in late 2025).
    *   P(E | H): The probability of seeing four consecutive failures, only for the measure to pass at the last possible second, is extremely low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing four consecutive failures if the measure was never going to pass is very high. This is the expected pattern of a failed policy initiative.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This evidence drastically decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: A durable, ideologically diverse opposition coalition.**
    *   P(E | H): For the law to pass, this coalition's opposition would need to be overcome. Its existence makes success less likely.
    *   P(E | ~H): This coalition's existence is the primary explanation for why the law would fail to pass.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Favors ~H (< 1). This is the core mechanism explaining the repeated failures.

*   **Evidence 3: Persistent establishment and military support.**
    *   P(E | H): This support is a necessary condition for the law to pass.
    *   P(E | ~H): This support is also consistent with failure, as it explains why the issue is repeatedly introduced despite its inability to pass.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Close to 1. This is status-quo evidence that doesn't significantly alter the odds, as it has been a constant factor during previous failures.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will start with the 10% prior and update based on the overwhelming evidence of repeated failure.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1/9 (10% probability).
*   **Update for Repeated Failures:** The fact that this provision has failed in at least four consecutive legislative cycles (FY22, FY23, FY24, FY25) is the most powerful piece of evidence. Each failure reinforces the strength of the opposition and the stability of the status quo. A simple model where the odds of success are halved after each failure would proceed as follows:
    *   After FY22/FY23 failures: Probability drops from ~10% to ~3-4%.
    *   After inferred FY24/FY25 failures: The probability drops further to the ~1-2% range.
*   **Update for Time Constraint:** With less than two months left, any legislative delay (a common feature of the NDAA process) could cause the effective date to slip past the January 1, 2026 deadline, causing a "No" resolution even if the bill passes. This adds an additional, significant hurdle.

Combining these factors, the posterior probability must be very low. The initial 10% prior is reduced dramatically by the strong, consistent evidence of failure. The final, critical time constraint further reduces the already small chance of success.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario for "Yes":** The most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution would be a "Christmas miracle" in the final days of the 2025 legislative session. A grand bargain in the FY2026 NDAA conference committee could trade this provision for another high-priority item. This might be enabled by a shift in the political landscape following the 2024 elections, which is unknown but possible.
*   **Critique of Low Forecast:** My forecast might be underestimating the persistence of the defense establishment or the possibility of a post-election lame-duck session in 2024 having changed the political calculus in a way that set up a 2025 success. However, for that to be true, something fundamental would have had to change to break a well-established multi-year pattern.
*   **Rebuttal:** The "strange bedfellows" coalition of social conservatives and anti-war progressives is exceptionally difficult to break with normal political horse-trading. The path of least resistance, especially under a tight deadline, is to strip the controversial provision to ensure the main bill passes. The four prior failures are a testament to this dynamic.
*   **Adjustment:** My updated probability in the 1-2% range seems sound. I will set my final forecast slightly above this to account for the small, un-modeled possibility of a major political surprise.

### 6. Final Forecast

The probability of this change occurring was low to begin with, given the historical stability of the MSSA and the political dynamics. The subsequent and repeated failures of the provision to pass in multiple consecutive NDAA cycles provide overwhelming evidence that the political coalition blocking it is stable and effective. Forecasting from November 9, 2025, with less than two months to the deadline, the chances are exceptionally slim. The only remaining path is a last-minute inclusion in the FY2026 NDAA, which would require overcoming the same obstacles that have prevented its passage for four straight years, all while on a highly compressed timeline. This scenario is highly improbable.

Final: 2%
