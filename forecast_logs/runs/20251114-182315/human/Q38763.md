### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Voluntary moratoria on core commercial R&D by for-profit tech companies.** Historically, for-profit companies in a competitive race rarely, if ever, voluntarily halt their primary research and development. Pauses typically occur in response to regulatory mandates, catastrophic failures, or overwhelming public backlash, not pre-emptively. The "Pause Giant AI Experiments" letter in 2023 had no discernible effect on the frontier labs. **Base rate: <1%**.
2.  **Industry-wide pauses on controversial scientific research.** The 1975 Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA is the most cited parallel. It led to a temporary, voluntary pause by academics and government-funded researchers to establish safety guidelines. However, it was driven by the public/academic sector in a less intensely competitive and commercialized environment. Applying this to a hyper-competitive, multi-trillion-dollar corporate race is a stretch. **Base rate: ~5-10%**, but with low applicability.
3.  **Company-specific feature rollout pauses for safety.** Companies like Google and Meta have paused the rollout of specific features (e.g., facial recognition tools, generative AI image features) due to safety, bias, or PR issues. These are pauses on *products*, not on the core, underlying R&D and training of next-generation models. This is a weak analogy. **Base rate: >20% for feature pauses, but <5% for core R&D pauses.**

*Limitations*: The current AI development landscape is novel due to the perceived existential risk, the concentration of capability in a few private labs, and the explicit safety missions of some of the key actors (especially Anthropic). These factors suggest historical base rates may be less predictive than usual.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** OpenAI states it treats superintelligence risks as potentially catastrophic and advocates for shared safety standards. **(↑)** — Acknowledges severe risk, which is a precondition for a safety pause, but frames it as a reason for *managed* progress, not a halt.
*   **2025-10-29** OpenAI's roadmap reveals plans for "AI research interns" by 2026 and "full-blown AGI researchers" by 2028. **(↓↓)** — This is a clear, aggressive, long-term roadmap for capability acceleration, making a voluntary pause seem antithetical to their stated strategy.
*   **2025-10-28** OpenAI announces a strategic shift to creating a comprehensive AI platform, supported by massive infrastructure like "Stargate." **(↓↓)** — Signals deep commitment to scaling and platform dominance, a strategy that a pause would directly undermine. Billions in infrastructure investment create immense pressure to continue.
*   **2025-07-22** A leaked OpenAI roadmap details plans to create a universal "super-assistant" powered by next-gen models (O2, O3) by 2026. **(↓↓)** — Reinforces the intense commercial and competitive drive to accelerate, not pause, development to capture the market.
*   **2025-06-16** Sam Altman predicts AI will generate "novel insights" by 2026, framing a competitive race with Google and Anthropic. **(↓)** — Publicly setting ambitious capability targets for 2026 signals a focus on winning the race, not on pausing it.
*   **2024-07-19** Google DeepMind showcases a broad portfolio of scaling research at ICML, focusing on efficiency and responsibility. **(↓)** — The focus is on *responsible scaling*, not pausing. This implies a belief that safety can be co-developed with progress, not that progress must stop for safety.
*   **2024-05-15** Google DeepMind unveils Project Astra, a real-time, multimodal AI agent, demonstrating a major push for next-gen capabilities. **(↓)** — A major public demonstration of progress that intensifies the competitive landscape, making it harder for any single actor to pause.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Competitive & Commercial Pressure (Large, ↓):** The primary driver is the race for market dominance and technological leadership. Pausing unilaterally would cede a significant advantage to competitors, a risk that investors and executives are extremely unlikely to take without an overwhelming reason.
2.  **Emergence of a Concrete, Alarming Capability (Large, ↑):** The discovery of a dangerous, unalignable, and potentially autonomous capability during internal testing is the most plausible trigger for a pause. This would have to be a "red line" event that convinces the leadership that the risks of proceeding outweigh the risks of pausing.
3.  **Regulatory Threat (Moderate, ↑):** A credible threat from major governments (e.g., US, UK, EU) to impose a mandatory, indefinite, and much harsher shutdown could incentivize a lab to announce a "voluntary" pause as a more palatable, controllable alternative.
4.  **Internal Safety Team Rebellion (Moderate, ↑):** A mass resignation of a high-profile safety team (e.g., Anthropic's safety board, OpenAI's alignment researchers) coupled with a public warning could create enough pressure (PR, regulatory, internal) to force a temporary pause.
5.  **National Security Imperative (Moderate, ↓):** Governments, particularly the US, may view AI leadership as a national security priority (e.g., vs. China). They could privately or publicly discourage any pause that might cede this advantage.
6.  **Catastrophic Public Accident (Moderate, ↑):** A major, widely publicized disaster directly attributable to a frontier model could shift public opinion and the risk calculus of the labs, forcing a pause to prevent severe regulatory backlash.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Safety Missions:** Unlike nearly any historical technology company, Anthropic was founded explicitly on AI safety principles, and OpenAI has a charter that prioritizes humanity's benefit over profit. This creates a non-zero internal "kill switch" that is absent in the base class.
*   **Existential Risk Framing:** The potential downside is framed by many insiders and experts not as market loss or PR damage, but as a global catastrophic or existential risk. This dramatically raises the stakes and could justify actions (like a pause) that are unthinkable in normal commercial contexts.
*   **Concentrated Ecosystem:** The frontier of AI is controlled by just 3-4 key players. This makes coordination (or a cascading failure of nerve) more plausible than in a diffuse market. A pause by one could give "cover" for another to follow.
*   **Nascent Governance Structures:** The existence of government bodies like the US and UK AI Safety Institutes creates a formal channel for risks to be evaluated and for pressure to be applied, a feature not present in prior tech races.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in ~1.5 months (by Jan 1, 2026). This means a pause would have to be triggered by an event that occurs almost immediately. The inertia of current roadmaps and projects is immense, making a sudden stop in such a short timeframe very unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (~5%) based on the reference class of voluntary moratoria in competitive commercial environments being exceptionally rare.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓ Large) All recent company communications (roadmaps, product announcements, CEO predictions) point to a strategy of aggressive acceleration and competition.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The framing of "responsible scaling" by labs like DeepMind indicates a cultural preference for solving safety in parallel with development, not by stopping it.
    *   (↑ Small) The labs' public acknowledgements of catastrophic risk and the existence of internal safety teams/charters provide a structural reason why this time *could* be different, slightly increasing the odds over the historical base rate.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (<2 months) means the immense inertia of current training runs and strategic plans would have to be overcome by a sudden, powerful event.
*   **Net effect:** The overwhelming weight of recent evidence points strongly against a pause. The posterior should be significantly lower than the already-low prior. The structural factors that make a pause *possible* are not supported by any recent event-based evidence.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   High-profile resignations from the safety/alignment teams of any of the three labs, especially if accompanied by public warnings.
    *   Leaked internal documents describing the unexpected emergence of dangerous capabilities in a model currently in training.
    *   A joint statement from the US and UK AI Safety Institutes calling for a temporary halt on training next-generation models.
    *   Sudden, unexplained cancellation of a major upcoming model release or developer conference.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a new, larger funding round for any of the three labs.
    *   Launch or announcement of a next-generation model (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4, Gemini-2).
    *   New major enterprise or government contracts that depend on continued capability scaling.
    *   Hiring announcements for roles focused on scaling, efficiency, and performance of large models.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** What constitutes "safety reasons"? A company could pause a training run due to technical failures (e.g., persistent divergence) but frame it publicly as a "pause for safety review" for PR benefits. This could trigger a "Yes" resolution.
*   **"Certain Size" is Vague:** The threshold for the training run size is not specified. A lab could pause runs above a very high, currently unused threshold (e.g., 10^28 FLOP) as a symbolic gesture, which would technically resolve the question "Yes" without meaningfully slowing down.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The primary trigger for a pause—an internal safety red line—would be a private event. We would only learn of it if the company chose to disclose it. They have strong incentives to handle such issues internally without a public pause.
*   **Short Timeline:** With less than two months to resolution, the probability is dominated by the status quo. There is very little time for any of the "UP" mechanisms (regulatory pressure, emergence of new capabilities) to manifest and force a decision.

**Final Research Summary:**
The probability of a voluntary pause is extremely low. Intense competitive, commercial, and strategic pressures create massive inertia towards accelerating development, a trend confirmed by all recent roadmaps and announcements. A "Yes" resolution would likely require a sudden, shocking event, such as the discovery of a critical, undeniable safety flaw, which is a tail risk within the short remaining timeframe.

To forecast the probability of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announcing a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for voluntary moratoria on core commercial R&D by for-profit tech companies is historically very low, especially in competitive environments. The reference class suggests a base rate of less than 1% for such pauses. Given the competitive nature of AI development and the lack of historical precedent for voluntary pauses in similar contexts, we will start with a prior probability of 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that it involves highly competitive, for-profit companies with significant commercial incentives to continue development. However, it differs in the explicit safety missions of some companies (e.g., Anthropic) and the framing of AI development as a potential existential risk, which could theoretically increase the likelihood of a pause. Despite these differences, the competitive pressures and recent developments suggest that these factors are not currently strong enough to significantly alter the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Recent Company Announcements (↓↓ Large):** OpenAI and others have announced aggressive roadmaps and infrastructure investments, indicating a strong commitment to continued development. This evidence strongly decreases the probability of a pause.
- **Acknowledgment of Risks (↑ Small):** Public acknowledgments of AI risks by companies slightly increase the probability, but are outweighed by their actions.
- **Short Time Horizon (↓↓ Large):** With less than two months remaining, the probability of a sudden, voluntary pause is very low due to the inertia of ongoing projects.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 1%, the overwhelming weight of evidence from recent announcements and the short time horizon suggests a significant decrease in probability. The likelihood ratios for the evidence are heavily skewed towards a decrease in probability.

- **Posterior Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 0.01 / 0.99
  - Likelihood ratio (based on evidence) is significantly less than 1, suggesting a strong decrease.
  - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (very small)
  - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds)

Given the evidence, the posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior, likely around 0.5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden, unforeseen event triggering a pause. However, the short timeline and current evidence strongly support a low probability.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major safety incident or regulatory pressure could change the landscape, but these are unlikely to manifest in the short timeframe.
- **Adjustments:** Given the strong evidence against a pause, no upward adjustment is warranted.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian update, the final forecast is:

Final: 0.5%

# Will OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announce a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for voluntary pauses on core R&D by leading AI companies specifically citing safety concerns.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Voluntary moratoria on core commercial R&D by for-profit tech companies in competitive markets: <1%
- Industry-wide pauses on controversial scientific research (e.g., Asilomar conference): 5-10%
- Company-specific feature rollout pauses for safety concerns: >20% for products, but <5% for core R&D

Given the unique nature of AI development and the explicit safety missions of some labs (especially Anthropic), I'll use a slightly higher base rate than the first reference class but lower than the second, as this is a commercial environment with intense competition.

**Prior probability: 5%**

This reflects the historical rarity of voluntary R&D pauses in competitive commercial environments, while acknowledging the unique safety concerns in AI.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Intense commercial competition between major players (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic)
- Significant financial investments and stakeholder expectations for continued progress
- Market pressure to maintain technological leadership
- Short-term commercial incentives that generally discourage pausing development

**Key differences:**
- AI labs have explicitly acknowledged existential risks from advanced AI
- Some labs (Anthropic, OpenAI) have founding charters that prioritize safety
- The concentration of frontier AI development in just 3-4 key players makes coordination more feasible
- The potential downside risk is framed as catastrophic/existential, not merely commercial
- Emerging governance structures (US/UK AI Safety Institutes) create formal channels for safety evaluation

These differences suggest a slightly higher probability than historical base rates, but the commercial pressures remain dominant.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent roadmaps and announcements from all three companies show aggressive scaling plans**
- P(E|H): If a pause were imminent, companies would likely be more cautious in their public roadmaps = 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no pause is planned, companies would continue aggressive roadmaps = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.95 = 0.21 (strong evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 2: OpenAI's roadmap reveals plans for "AI research interns" by 2026 and "full-blown AGI researchers" by 2028**
- P(E|H): If planning a pause, OpenAI would not publish such an aggressive timeline = 0.1
- P(E|~H): If no pause is planned, this roadmap makes sense = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (very strong evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 3: OpenAI announces "Stargate" infrastructure investment**
- P(E|H): If planning a pause, massive infrastructure investment would be delayed = 0.15
- P(E|~H): If no pause is planned, this investment is logical = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.15/0.95 = 0.16 (strong evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 4: All three companies frame safety as something to be developed alongside capabilities**
- P(E|H): If planning a pause, they would frame safety as requiring a halt = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If no pause is planned, this framing is expected = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (moderate evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 5: Extremely short time horizon (less than 2 months until resolution)**
- P(E|H): If a pause were to happen in this timeframe, we'd likely see warning signs already = 0.7
- P(E|~H): If no pause is planned, the current trajectory continues = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.95 = 0.74 (mild evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 6: Public acknowledgment of catastrophic risks by these companies**
- P(E|H): If planning a pause, public risk acknowledgment would be necessary = 0.9
- P(E|~H): If no pause is planned, risk acknowledgment can still occur = 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.7 = 1.29 (weak evidence for a pause)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (0.053), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (aggressive roadmaps):**
- Prior odds: 0.053
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.21 = 0.011
- Posterior probability: 0.011/(1+0.011) = 1.1%

**Update on Evidence 2 (OpenAI's specific timeline):**
- Prior odds: 0.011
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.011 × 0.11 = 0.0012
- Posterior probability: 0.0012/(1+0.0012) = 0.12%

This is becoming extremely low, so I'll adjust upward slightly to account for tail risks:

**Update on Evidence 6 (acknowledgment of risks):**
- Prior odds: 0.0012
- Likelihood ratio: 1.29
- Posterior odds: 0.0012 × 1.29 = 0.0015
- Posterior probability: 0.0015/(1+0.0015) = 0.15%

**Update on Evidence 5 (short time horizon):**
- Prior odds: 0.0015
- Likelihood ratio: 0.74
- Posterior odds: 0.0015 × 0.74 = 0.0011
- Posterior probability: 0.0011/(1+0.0011) = 0.11%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a sudden, alarming capability discovery that triggers an emergency pause
- The definition of "pause for safety reasons" could be met by a symbolic gesture rather than a genuine halt
- A regulatory threat could emerge suddenly, prompting a "voluntary" pause to preempt harsher measures
- A high-profile safety team resignation with public warnings could create enough pressure for a pause

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A lab might announce a pause on a specific type of training run (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback at scale) while continuing other types
- A lab might pause training above an extremely high threshold that they weren't planning to reach soon anyway
- A lab might frame a technical failure or resource constraint as a "safety pause" for PR benefits

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability slightly upward to account for these tail risks and definitional ambiguities. The Manifold market is at 2.6%, which is higher than my calculation but still very low.

I'll adjust my final probability to 1%, which acknowledges these tail risks while still reflecting the overwhelming evidence against a pause in the next two months.

## 6. Final Forecast

The probability of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announcing a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026 is extremely low. All recent evidence points to accelerating development rather than pausing it. The competitive dynamics, commercial pressures, and explicit roadmaps make a voluntary pause highly unlikely in the short remaining timeframe.

While there are structural factors that make a pause theoretically possible (safety missions, acknowledgment of risks), there is no concrete evidence suggesting any of these companies are moving in that direction. The extremely short time horizon (less than 2 months) further reduces the probability, as it would require a sudden, dramatic event to trigger such a decision.

Final: 1%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is **voluntary moratoria on core commercial R&D by for-profit technology companies in a highly competitive race**. Historically, such events are exceptionally rare. Companies are driven by market share, investor returns, and competitive advantage, all of which are directly undermined by pausing core research. The 2023 "Pause Giant AI Experiments" letter, despite its prominent signatories, had no discernible impact on the actions of these labs, reinforcing the strength of these incentives.

Based on this reference class, the prior probability of such a pause is extremely low. I will set the initial prior at **2%**. This is higher than a pure historical base rate (<1%) to account for the unique context of AI, where key actors (especially Anthropic and OpenAI) have explicit safety missions and publicly acknowledge potential catastrophic risks, making this situation different from past tech races. In odds form, this is 2:98, or approximately 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   **Intense Competition:** The race between OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic for AI dominance is a classic, high-stakes technology race, creating immense pressure to accelerate, not pause.
*   **Commercial Imperatives:** All three companies have massive financial backing and are developing commercial products. A pause would cede ground to competitors and delay returns on billions in investment.

**Differences:**
*   **Existential Risk Framing:** Unlike previous technologies, the potential downside is framed by insiders as a global catastrophic risk. This could justify actions, like a pause, that would be unthinkable in a normal commercial context.
*   **Unique Corporate Structures:** Anthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation, and OpenAI's charter prioritizes safety over profit. These structures create internal mechanisms for a pause that are absent in the base case of a typical corporation.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves before January 1, 2026. As of mid-November 2025, this leaves only about six weeks. Corporate inertia is immense; enacting a major strategic shift and announcing it publicly in such a short window is highly improbable without a sudden, dramatic trigger. This short timeline is the most significant factor pushing the probability down.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several key pieces of evidence, nearly all of which point against a pause.

*   **Evidence:** A consistent stream of announcements regarding aggressive, long-term roadmaps (OpenAI's "super-assistant" by 2026, "AGI researchers" by 2028), massive infrastructure investment (Stargate), and major capability demonstrations (Google's Project Astra).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H))**: This evidence is far more likely if no pause is planned (P(E|~H) is high) than if a pause is imminent (P(E|H) is low). The likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability from the prior. It shows a clear strategic commitment to acceleration.

*   **Evidence:** The framing of "responsible scaling" by labs like Google DeepMind.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: This narrative—that safety can and should be co-developed with advancing capabilities—is the primary alternative to a pause. It is much more likely to be the public stance if no pause is planned. The likelihood ratio is less than 1.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence:** The short time remaining until resolution (~6 weeks).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: A pause is a low-probability event in any given month. The chance of it occurring in this specific, very short window is much lower than it occurring over a longer period (e.g., a full year).
    *   **Impact:** This structural factor strongly **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a 2% prior, the overwhelming evidence of strategic acceleration and the extremely short timeline provide a strong update downwards. If the only path to a "Yes" was a genuine, internally-driven pause due to a newly discovered existential threat, the probability would be well below 1%. However, other scenarios must be considered.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My initial analysis, focused on a "genuine" safety crisis, might be too narrow. A "Yes" resolution could be triggered by other means:

*   **The "Symbolic Pause" Scenario:** A lab could announce a pause on training runs above a currently unachievable threshold (e.g., 10^28 FLOP). This would cost nothing, serve as a positive PR move to preempt regulation, and technically resolve the question "Yes".
*   **The "Technical Glitch as Safety Pause" Scenario:** A major training run could fail for purely technical reasons. The company could choose to frame the necessary downtime as a "voluntary pause for safety review," turning a technical problem into a PR win.
*   **Anthropic as a Wildcard:** Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy might contain specific, non-public triggers that could be met, forcing them to pause even if it's commercially disadvantageous.

These alternative paths are more plausible within the short timeframe than a fundamental strategic reversal. A technical issue or a decision to make a PR move could happen suddenly. These possibilities prevent the forecast from being near-zero and are likely why the community forecast (2.6%) is not lower. These scenarios raise the probability back into the low single digits.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such a pause is extremely low. The overwhelming evidence from company roadmaps and the intense competitive pressure points strongly against a pause. The very short time remaining until January 1, 2026, makes a genuine strategic shift highly unlikely.

However, the possibility of a "Yes" resolution via a symbolic PR move, the clever framing of a technical failure, or a unique action by Anthropic provides a plausible, albeit low-probability, path to "Yes". These scenarios are less constrained by corporate inertia. Balancing the strong evidence against a pause with the plausibility of these alternative resolution paths, I assess the probability to be very low, but not negligible.

Final: 2%
