### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Interstate Wars Since 1945:** A broad reference class. These wars have a median duration of over a year, but many become protracted conflicts lasting 5-10 years. Ceasefires are common, but durable, comprehensive ceasefires that resolve the underlying conflict are not. A study of interstate wars ending between 1946 and 1997 found that only ~25% ended in a formal settlement/ceasefire within three years of onset; most ended in decisive military victory or petered out into low-intensity conflict.
    *   **Base Rate (Range):** 15-30% chance of a stable ceasefire within 3 years of a major invasion.
2.  **Wars Involving a Great Power vs. a Smaller State over Territory:** This is a more specific class (e.g., Soviet-Afghan War, Vietnam War, Chechen Wars). These conflicts are often long and attritional, as the great power has vast resources but the smaller state has high motivation and often external support. Ceasefires often fail because the great power is unwilling to accept anything less than its core objectives, and the smaller state is fighting for survival.
    *   **Base Rate (Range):** 10-20% chance of a stable ceasefire within 3 years. The great power often prefers to grind out a victory or install a compliant regime rather than accept a negotiated stalemate.
3.  **Post-Soviet Frozen Conflicts:** This class includes conflicts like Transnistria, Abkhazia/South Ossetia, and the Donbas (2014-2022). Russia has a track record of engineering ceasefires (e.g., Minsk I & II) that freeze the conflict on terms favorable to it, creating protracted instability and de facto control without a formal peace treaty. These ceasefires often do not hold perfectly but can reduce violence significantly.
    *   **Base Rate (Range):** 40-50% chance of a *de facto* ceasefire being reached, but the 30-day, all-fronts stability requirement of this question is a much higher bar than was met in these historical cases.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*As of 2025-10-18, the recency guideline emphasizes the last 6 months.*
- **[2025-09-25]** US announces further drawdown of military aid to Ukraine, tying future lethal aid to "demonstrable progress in anti-corruption and a commitment to a negotiated settlement." — ↑ — This significantly increases pressure on Kyiv to negotiate, as its military capacity is directly threatened by the loss of its primary backer.
- **[2025-08-15]** Russia concludes a major summer offensive, capturing the remainder of Donetsk Oblast but suffering heavy casualties and failing to take key hubs like Kharkiv or Zaporizhzhia. — ↓ — Moscow's continued pursuit of maximalist military goals, despite high costs, indicates a preference for battlefield gains over immediate negotiation.
- **[2025-07-20]** A European Union summit results in a new €30 billion aid package for Ukraine, but leaders express "grave concern" over the war's duration and economic toll. — ↔︎ — The aid helps Ukraine continue fighting (↓), but the political language signals waning long-term appetite and a desire for a settlement (↑).
- **[2025-06-05]** Reports from Turkish and Saudi diplomatic channels suggest back-channel "talks about talks" are occurring, but both Kyiv and Moscow deny any formal negotiations. — ↑ — The existence of back-channels, even if informal, is a necessary precondition for any future ceasefire agreement.
- **[2025-05-10]** Ukrainian President Zelenskyy reiterates that a just peace is impossible without the full restoration of Ukraine's 1991 borders, but omits prior mentions of war crimes tribunals as a precondition. — ↔︎ — Publicly maintaining a maximalist stance (↓) while subtly softening preconditions (↑) suggests a potential, albeit slight, increase in diplomatic flexibility.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **US Policy Shift:** The Trump administration's clear pivot away from unconditional support for Ukraine is the single largest driver. By restricting aid, Washington can effectively force Kyiv to the negotiating table on unfavorable terms. (Size: Large)
2.  **Battlefield Stalemate & Attrition:** If both sides conclude they cannot achieve their objectives militarily without incurring unsustainable losses in manpower and equipment, the relative appeal of a ceasefire increases. (Size: Large)
3.  **Ukrainian Political Will:** The ability of the Ukrainian government to accept and sell a ceasefire that almost certainly involves ceding territory is a major hurdle. Domestic political backlash could make any deal impossible. (Size: Large)
4.  **Russian Strategic Calculation:** Putin's regime must weigh the benefits of cementing current gains via a ceasefire against the possibility of a total military victory if it waits longer for Ukrainian support to collapse entirely. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **European Cohesion & Support:** Europe's ability (or inability) to fill the military and financial gap left by the US directly impacts Ukraine's leverage and timeline for resistance. A fractured Europe accelerates the timeline for a forced ceasefire. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Unprecedented External Pressure on the Defender:** Unlike many historical conflicts where a smaller state's backers remained steadfast, the primary patron (USA) is now actively and publicly leveraging aid to compel negotiations. This is a significant departure from the reference class.
- **Existential Stakes for Ukraine:** This is not a limited border war; for Ukraine, it is a war for national survival and sovereignty. This makes concessions, particularly on territory, far more difficult than in typical interstate conflicts.
- **Nuclear Overhang:** The conflict involves a nuclear-armed great power, which constrains the level of direct intervention from other powers and creates a powerful incentive for all parties to avoid uncontrolled escalation, potentially making a frozen conflict more palatable than total war.
- **Personalization of the Conflict:** The war is deeply tied to the political survival of Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This personal investment can be an obstacle to compromise, as any deal seen as a "loss" could be politically fatal.
- **High Bar of Resolution Criteria:** The requirement for a *bilateral*, *comprehensive* ceasefire that holds for *30 days* across *all fronts* is exceptionally strict. Many historical "ceasefires" in the reference classes were partial, frequently violated, and would not have met this question's criteria.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** A prior of **~20%** seems appropriate, derived from the reference classes of protracted interstate wars and great power conflicts, which suggest a low probability of a stable, negotiated end within this timeframe. (Equivalent n≈10).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - US policy shift creating immense pressure on Kyiv: **↑ (Large)**
    - Russia's continued pursuit of military objectives and maximalist rhetoric: **↓ (Large)**
    - High bar of the 30-day, all-fronts resolution criteria: **↓ (Moderate)**
    - Signs of military exhaustion on both sides after costly offensives: **↑ (Moderate)**
    - Ukraine's existential motivation and domestic political constraints against concessions: **↓ (Moderate)**
- **Net effect:** The evidence points in conflicting directions. The massive upward pressure from the US policy shift is the dominant new factor. However, it is counteracted by Russia's unchanged ambitions and the sheer difficulty of implementing a ceasefire that meets the strict resolution criteria. The posterior should move **moderately upwards** from the low prior, but likely remain below 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - A high-profile US "special envoy" for Ukraine is appointed and travels to Kyiv and Moscow.
    - Public statements from Ukrainian officials begin to frame "painful compromises" as necessary.
    - Russia halts major offensive operations without having achieved a clear strategic objective.
    - A third-party mediator (e.g., Turkey, Saudi Arabia, China) announces a formal summit.
    - Significant reduction in the daily intensity of fighting along the entire front line.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Russia launches a new, large-scale offensive targeting a major city like Kharkiv or Odesa.
    - The US Congress passes a bipartisan bill guaranteeing Ukraine aid, overriding the administration.
    - Zelenskyy or another high-level official makes a prominent "no compromise on territory" speech.
    - A major new long-term European military aid package is successfully implemented.
    - Reports of a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive that retakes significant territory.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Definition of "Stood for 30 days":** A ceasefire could be announced but immediately violated by skirmishes. The resolution depends on "reliable sources" not reporting a breakdown, which can be ambiguous. A low-level "frozen conflict" might not qualify.
- **Deception and Diplomatic Maneuvering:** Either side could feign interest in a ceasefire to regroup and re-arm (an "operational pause") with no genuine intent of it holding.
- **Internal Political Shocks:** The analysis assumes regime stability in both Moscow and Kyiv. A sudden change in leadership (e.g., Putin's health, a coup, Ukrainian elections) would dramatically alter all calculations.
- **Black Swan Events:** Unforeseen events, such as a major escalation involving a NATO country or a catastrophic failure of a key infrastructure element (like a nuclear plant), could instantly override all existing drivers.
- **Focus on "Bilateral":** The criteria specify the "majorities of combatants." This could be complicated by paramilitary or volunteer units on either side who might not adhere to a formal agreement, potentially jeopardizing the resolution.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a qualifying ceasefire has increased substantially due to the shift in US policy, but Russia's preference for a military solution and the high political cost of concessions for Ukraine remain formidable barriers to a stable agreement.

To forecast the probability of a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a stable ceasefire within three years of a major invasion, based on historical data from interstate wars and great power conflicts, is approximately 20%. This is derived from the reference classes of protracted interstate wars and great power conflicts, which suggest a low probability of a stable, negotiated end within this timeframe.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The conflict is a protracted interstate war involving a great power (Russia) and a smaller state (Ukraine), fitting the reference class.
   - Differences: The unprecedented external pressure from the US on Ukraine to negotiate, the existential stakes for Ukraine, and the nuclear overhang are significant deviations from typical cases. These factors could either increase or decrease the likelihood of a ceasefire.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - US policy shift creating immense pressure on Kyiv: Increases the probability (large impact).
   - Russia's continued pursuit of military objectives: Decreases the probability (large impact).
   - High bar of the 30-day, all-fronts resolution criteria: Decreases the probability (moderate impact).
   - Signs of military exhaustion on both sides: Increases the probability (moderate impact).
   - Ukraine's existential motivation and domestic political constraints: Decreases the probability (moderate impact).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 20% probability translates to odds of 1:4.
   - The evidence is mixed, with significant upward pressure from the US policy shift but countered by Russia's military ambitions and the high bar for resolution. The net effect is a moderate upward adjustment from the prior.
   - Posterior odds are adjusted based on the likelihood ratios, resulting in a probability that remains below 50% but higher than the initial 20%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The high bar for resolution and the complexity of the conflict suggest caution in overestimating the probability.
   - Alternative scenarios: A sudden change in leadership or a major geopolitical shift could drastically alter the situation.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a low-level frozen conflict that does not meet the resolution criteria.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, the final calibrated probability of a bilateral ceasefire occurring before 2026 is estimated.

Final: 35%

# Will there be a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict that holds for at least 30 days across all fronts before 2026.

Looking at the reference classes provided:
- Interstate Wars Since 1945: 15-30% chance of stable ceasefire within 3 years
- Wars Involving Great Power vs. Smaller State over Territory: 10-20% chance within 3 years
- Post-Soviet Frozen Conflicts: 40-50% chance of a de facto ceasefire, but the 30-day stability requirement is a higher bar

Given that we're looking at a timeframe from now (October 2025) until the end of 2025 (about 2.5 months), and considering the specific requirements (bilateral, comprehensive, 30-day stability across all fronts), I'll select a base rate of **15%**. This is on the lower end of the interstate war reference class, adjusted downward for the short timeframe remaining and the strict criteria.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other interstate wars, this conflict involves territorial disputes and sovereignty issues
- As with other great power conflicts, there's asymmetry in resources but high motivation from the smaller state
- Similar to post-Soviet frozen conflicts, Russia has incentives to create a favorable frozen situation

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented external pressure on Ukraine from its primary backer (US)
- Existential stakes for Ukraine make concessions particularly difficult
- Nuclear dimension creates unique escalation constraints
- The personal political stakes for both Putin and Zelenskyy
- The extremely high bar for resolution (bilateral, comprehensive, 30-day stability)
- Very short timeframe remaining in 2025 (only about 2.5 months)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: US policy shift and aid drawdown (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If a ceasefire were to occur, US pressure would likely be a key factor
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with US pressure, other factors could prevent a ceasefire
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Russia's summer offensive capturing Donetsk but failing elsewhere (August 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Partial success might satisfy Russia enough to pause
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Continued military operations suggest Russia prefers battlefield solutions
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.57 (moderately decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Back-channel "talks about talks" (June 2025)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Such channels would be necessary precursors to any ceasefire
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Back-channels often exist without leading to agreements
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Zelenskyy's subtle softening of preconditions (May 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Some flexibility would be needed for a ceasefire
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Public rhetoric often differs from private negotiating positions
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15:85 (0.15/(1-0.15) = 0.176)

First update (US policy shift):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 1.8 = 0.317
- Posterior probability = 0.317/(1+0.317) = 24.1%

Second update (Russia's offensive):
- Posterior odds = 0.317 × 0.57 = 0.181
- Posterior probability = 0.181/(1+0.181) = 15.3%

Third update (Back-channel talks):
- Posterior odds = 0.181 × 1.6 = 0.290
- Posterior probability = 0.290/(1+0.290) = 22.5%

Fourth update (Zelenskyy's softening):
- Posterior odds = 0.290 × 1.2 = 0.348
- Posterior probability = 0.348/(1+0.348) = 25.8%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 26%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the impact of US pressure on Ukraine's decision-making
- The 30-day stability requirement is extremely strict and may be harder to achieve than I've accounted for
- The short timeframe (2.5 months) severely limits the window for negotiation, agreement, and 30 days of stability
- The Manifold market is at 10.4%, suggesting I may be overconfident

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would emphasize:
- Russia's continued military operations suggest no interest in a ceasefire
- Ukraine's existential stakes make meaningful concessions politically impossible
- The 30-day stability requirement is unlikely to be met even if a ceasefire is declared
- The remaining timeframe is too short for the complex diplomatic process

This view might put the probability closer to 10-15%.

**Adjustment:**
Given the extremely short timeframe remaining in 2025, the strict 30-day stability requirement, and the community forecast being significantly lower, I should adjust my estimate downward. The most critical factor is the time constraint - even if negotiations accelerated dramatically, implementing and maintaining a 30-day ceasefire before year-end would be challenging.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, especially the short timeframe remaining in 2025 and the strict criteria for resolution, I adjust my forecast downward from 26% to 18%.

Final: 18%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
-   **Base Rate Identification:** The most appropriate reference class is "Wars Involving a Great Power vs. a Smaller State over Territory." Historical examples include the Soviet-Afghan War and the Chechen Wars. These conflicts are characterized by their protracted, attritional nature and the difficulty of reaching a stable, negotiated settlement.
-   **Reasoning:** This class captures the core dynamics of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict: a major power (Russia) seeking to impose its will on a smaller, highly motivated state (Ukraine) over fundamental issues of territory and sovereignty. Data from this class suggests such wars rarely end in a negotiated ceasefire within a few years. The research report suggests a 10-20% chance of a stable ceasefire within 3 years. Given the war will be entering its fourth year in 2025, the lower end of this range is a suitable starting point.
-   **Initial Prior:** I will set the prior probability P(H) at **15%**. This reflects the inherent difficulty of achieving a lasting ceasefire in this type of conflict.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
-   **Similarities:** The conflict aligns with the base case in its attritional nature, the clear power asymmetry, and the involvement of external backers for the smaller state.
-   **Differences:**
    -   **US Policy Shift:** The most significant deviation from the base case is the active, public pressure being applied by Ukraine's primary military backer (the United States) to compel negotiations. In many historical precedents, support for the smaller state was more steadfast. This dramatically increases the likelihood that Ukraine will be forced to the negotiating table.
    -   **Strict Resolution Criteria:** The requirement for a bilateral ceasefire that holds perfectly for 30 days across all fronts is an exceptionally high bar. Many historical "ceasefires" were partial or frequently violated and would not meet this standard. This significantly decreases the probability of a "Yes" resolution compared to the base rate of "a ceasefire."
    -   **Existential Stakes:** For Ukraine, this is a war for national survival, making territorial concessions—a likely component of any ceasefire—politically and socially toxic, thus acting as a powerful barrier to an agreement.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence provided in the research report, which is dated October 18, 2025.

-   **Evidence 1: US Drawdown of Military Aid (Sep 2025).** This is the single most important piece of evidence. It creates immense, direct pressure on Kyiv to negotiate.
    -   P(E | H) is high: A ceasefire (H) is far more likely to occur in a world where Ukraine's main ally is forcing its hand.
    -   P(E | ~H) is lower: Without this pressure, the status quo of continued fighting (~H) is more likely to persist.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio is significantly > 1.** This evidence **strongly increases** the probability.

-   **Evidence 2: Russia's Continued Military Objectives (Aug 2025 Offensive).** Russia continues to pursue battlefield gains, indicating a preference for a military solution over a negotiated one.
    -   P(E | H) is low: If Russia were about to agree to a stable ceasefire (H), it would be less likely to be simultaneously launching costly offensives.
    -   P(E | ~H) is high: Continued offensives are highly consistent with a world where no stable ceasefire is reached (~H).
    -   **Likelihood Ratio is < 1.** This evidence **decreases** the probability.

-   **Evidence 3: The High Bar of the Resolution Criteria.** This is a structural feature of the question, not an event.
    -   This feature makes the "Yes" world a very small and specific outcome. Many potential agreements (e.g., a "Minsk III" with low-level skirmishes) would fail to meet the 30-day, all-fronts standard.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio is significantly < 1.** This structural factor **strongly decreases** the probability of a "Yes" resolution.

-   **Evidence 4: Back-channel Talks and Softening Rhetoric (May-June 2025).** These are necessary preconditions for a deal but are weak signals on their own.
    -   P(E | H) is high, as these are expected precursors to a deal.
    -   P(E | ~H) is also reasonably high, as such talks can occur for long periods without success.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio is slightly > 1.** This evidence **slightly increases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
-   **Prior:** 15% (Odds: 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176)
-   **Update 1 (US Pressure):** The immense pressure from the US is a game-changer. Let's model this with a strong likelihood ratio of 3.0.
    -   Posterior Odds = 0.176 * 3.0 = 0.528
    -   Posterior Probability ≈ 34.5%
-   **Update 2 (Russian Intransigence & High Bar):** These two factors are powerful counterweights. Russia may see Ukrainian weakness as a reason to press its advantage, not negotiate. The strict criteria make any deal fragile. Let's combine these for a strong downward update with a likelihood ratio of 0.3.
    -   Posterior Odds = 0.528 * 0.3 = 0.158
    -   Posterior Probability ≈ 13.7%
-   **Update 3 (Minor Diplomatic Signals):** The back-channel talks provide a slight nudge upwards. Let's use a likelihood ratio of 1.2.
    -   Posterior Odds = 0.158 * 1.2 = 0.19
    -   Posterior Probability ≈ 16%

-   **Summary:** The final posterior probability lands in the mid-teens. The powerful upward pressure from the US policy shift is almost entirely negated by Russia's likely unwillingness to stop while it has the advantage and the extreme difficulty of any ceasefire meeting the strict 30-day, all-fronts resolution criteria.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Alternative Forecast:** A higher forecast (~30%) might be justified if one believes the US leverage is absolute and can compel both Ukraine to accept and Russia to see the wisdom in locking in its gains now rather than risking a long, costly war of occupation. This view assumes a higher degree of rationality and de-escalatory desire than has been demonstrated.
-   **Critique of My Forecast:** My forecast of ~16% might be too high. The Manifold market is at 10.4%, suggesting the crowd is even more skeptical. The primary reason for skepticism is the 30-day hold requirement. A ceasefire could be signed, but spoilers, miscalculations, or deliberate provocations could easily lead to a violation within 30 days. The short timeline (the ceasefire must be implemented by Dec 31, 2025) is another major obstacle.
-   **Adjustment:** The combination of the very high bar for resolution and the very short remaining time window are powerful arguments for a lower probability. I will adjust my forecast downward from the calculated 16% to better reflect these severe constraints, landing closer to the market consensus but still acknowledging the powerful, novel evidence of the US policy shift.

### 6. Final Forecast
The prospect of a ceasefire has been made more plausible by the significant shift in US policy, which is applying direct pressure on Ukraine to negotiate. However, this is counteracted by Russia's continued pursuit of military objectives and, most importantly, the exceptionally strict resolution criteria. A ceasefire must be bilateral, comprehensive, and hold without a breakdown for 30 days—a standard that historical ceasefires in the region have rarely met. The short timeline remaining in 2025 further constrains the possibility. The net effect is that the powerful new upward pressure is largely cancelled out by these immense hurdles.

Final: 14%
