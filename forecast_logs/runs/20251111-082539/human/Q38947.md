### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical frequency of the Insurrection Act's invocation?** This establishes the reference class and a raw base rate.
*   **Q2: Under what conditions has the Act been invoked historically?** This helps compare the current context to past precedents (e.g., riots, civil rights enforcement, natural disasters).
*   **Q3: What are the primary legal, political, and institutional constraints on its use?** This identifies the key friction points and downward pressures (e.g., role of military leadership, courts, Congress, public opinion).
*   **Q4: What is Donald Trump's specific stated intent and history regarding the Act?** This is crucial for understanding the primary actor's motivations and how they differ from the reference class. This involves analyzing his first term and the provided (hypothetical) 2025 sources.
*   **Q5: What specific events or scenarios in the current (hypothetical 2025) context could trigger an invocation?** This identifies the key mechanisms and leading indicators, drawing from the provided sources (protests, border control, state non-compliance).

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1 & Q2:** `history of Insurrection Act invocations US`, `list of presidents who used Insurrection Act`, `last time Insurrection Act was used`, `Insurrection Act use civil rights era`, `Insurrection Act LA riots 1992`.
*   **Q3:** `legal checks on Insurrection Act`, `Posse Comitatus Act vs Insurrection Act`, `military refusal of unlawful order`, `Mark Milley Insurrection Act 2020`, `political cost of invoking Insurrection Act`.
*   **Q4 & Q5:** `Trump Insurrection Act George Floyd protests`, `Project 2025 Insurrection Act plans`, `Trump statements on using military domestically`, `Trump plans for mass deportations`, `using military for border control legality`. (Note: The provided sources are the primary basis for the 2025 scenario).

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Historical Use:** The Act has been used dozens of times since 1792, but its use has become extremely rare in the post-Civil Rights era. The last major, widely-acknowledged invocation was by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 for the LA riots. Before that, it was used by Eisenhower and Kennedy to enforce desegregation. The modern (post-1960s) base rate for any given year is very low.
*   **Constraints:** The Act grants the President vast discretion. Legal challenges are typically slow and occur after deployment. The most significant constraints are non-statutory: (1) political backlash from the public and Congress, and (2) institutional resistance from a military leadership culturally and legally averse to domestic law enforcement (Posse Comitatus ethos).
*   **Trump's Stance:** During his first term, Trump seriously considered invoking the Act in June 2020 amid the George Floyd protests but was reportedly dissuaded by senior officials like Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. The provided 2025 sources, combined with real-world reporting on Project 2025, indicate a clear, pre-meditated intent to use the Act more proactively in a second term, specifically for suppressing protests, overriding local authorities, and effecting mass deportations. The administration would likely be staffed with personnel selected for their willingness to execute such orders.
*   **Potential Triggers (per sources):** The provided 2025 sources highlight three main pathways: (1) large-scale, persistent protests against administration policies; (2) direct defiance by state or city officials (e.g., refusing to cooperate with federal immigration agents); (3) a self-declared crisis at the southern border, framed as an "invasion" to justify military intervention for deportations.

**4. Drafting the Brief:**

With the synthesized information, I will now construct the research brief following the required format, focusing on the short ~1.5-month horizon from November 11, 2025, to January 1, 2026.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Post-WWII Presidential Years (1945-2024):** In this ~80-year period, there have been approximately 3-4 major, unambiguous invocations (e.g., Little Rock 1957, Ole Miss 1962, LA Riots 1992). This suggests a base rate of roughly one invocation per 20-25 years, or an **annual probability of 4-5%**. This class captures the modern political and military context but may understate the probability given a uniquely motivated actor.
*   **Years of Major Domestic Unrest:** The Act is almost exclusively considered or used during periods of significant, violent civil unrest that overwhelm local capacity (e.g., 1960s riots, 1992 LA riots). Such years are rare themselves. If we estimate one such year every 10-15 years, and the Act is used in ~25% of them, this yields a low **annual base rate of 1.5-2.5%**. This class is useful for conditioning on a specific trigger.
*   **Limitations:** Both reference classes are based on presidents operating within established political and institutional norms. The current situation involves an actor who has explicitly planned to challenge these norms and staff his administration accordingly, suggesting the historical base rate is likely a floor, not a central estimate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-10] Legal experts publicly warn that invoking the Act to bypass courts would be "flatly illegal," signaling a high-cost legal and political battle would ensue. (↓) — Highlights the significant friction and backlash the administration would face, a key deterrent.
*   [2025-10-07] President Trump explicitly states he would consider using the Insurrection Act if courts or local officials obstruct troop deployments to cities. (↑↑) — A direct, public, and conditional threat, moving the possibility from theoretical to a stated policy option.
*   [2025-06-09] An executive order directs a review of using the Act for "operational control" of the southern border, framing migration as an "invasion." (↑) — Shows premeditation and an effort to build a legal/rhetorical justification for a novel use of the Act.
*   [2024-10-01] The Project 2025 agenda, which heavily influenced the administration's transition, explicitly details plans to use the Insurrection Act to suppress dissent. (↑) — Establishes that the current consideration is not ad-hoc but part of a long-term, pre-vetted plan.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Large-scale civil unrest:** A major protest, riot, or series of disruptive events that overwhelms local law enforcement is the most historically common and politically defensible trigger. (Large)
*   **State/local defiance:** A governor or mayor directly refusing a federal directive (e.g., on immigration enforcement) could be framed as "insurrection" or obstructing federal law, providing a pretext. (Large)
*   **Personnel in key positions (DoD/DOJ):** The presence of loyalists willing to draft and execute the orders, bypassing traditional institutional resistance, is a critical enabler. (Large)
*   **Institutional friction:** Resistance from uniformed military leadership and civil servants at the Pentagon, who are culturally and legally averse to domestic deployment, remains a powerful brake. (Moderate-Large)
*   **Political calculation:** The perceived political cost (public backlash, congressional action, damage to international standing) versus the perceived gain (projecting strength, achieving a policy goal) is a key factor for the President. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Intent:** Historically, the Act was a reactive tool for unforeseen, explosive events. The current context involves a proactive, pre-planned desire to use the Act to enforce policy (immigration) and preemptively manage dissent.
*   **Targeted Staffing:** Unlike in 2020, the administration has been staffed with individuals selected for their loyalty and willingness to execute controversial orders, aiming to neutralize the institutional friction that previously constrained the President.
*   **Broadened Justification:** The Trump administration is attempting to expand the definition of "insurrection" to include non-violent policy obstruction by local governments and to frame high migration as an "invasion," justifications with no modern precedent.
*   **Public Rhetoric:** No modern president has so openly and repeatedly threatened to use the Act as a tool of first or second resort against political opponents and defiant jurisdictions.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the historical reference class, would be low, perhaps centered at **5%** (equivalent n of ~20, representing one invocation in 20 presidential years).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Explicit, pre-meditated plans (Project 2025) and staffing choices designed to overcome historical constraints.
    *   (↑ Large) The President's own public statements in October 2025, creating a clear conditional threat.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The formal effort to create a new justification for its use at the border.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The certainty of extreme political, legal, and potentially institutional backlash, which still serves as a significant deterrent.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests a radical departure from the conditions that produced the historical base rate. The posterior should move **significantly upward** from the low single-digit prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A specific, large-scale protest event that dominates the news cycle for 48+ hours.
    *   A governor (e.g., of California or Texas) publicly announcing non-compliance with a federal order.
    *   Leaked memos or reports from DOJ/DoD preparing legal justification for an invocation.

To forecast the probability of President Trump formally invoking the Insurrection Act before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical frequency of the Insurrection Act's invocation in the post-WWII era is approximately 3-4 times over 80 years, suggesting a base rate of about 4-5% annually. This reflects the modern political and military context.
   - Given the unique circumstances and motivations of the current administration, this base rate likely represents a lower bound rather than a central estimate.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a president with the authority to invoke the Act, similar to past instances.
   - Differences: The current administration has a proactive intent to use the Act, with plans and staffing choices designed to overcome historical constraints. This is a significant departure from past reactive uses.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Explicit Plans and Staffing (↑ Large):** The administration's premeditated plans and staffing choices increase the likelihood of invocation compared to historical norms.
   - **Public Statements (↑ Large):** President Trump's public statements about considering the Act if obstructed by courts or local officials further increase the likelihood.
   - **Legal and Political Backlash (↓ Moderate):** The potential for significant backlash serves as a deterrent, though it may be less effective given the administration's intent.
   - **Efforts to Justify Use at the Border (↑ Moderate):** Attempts to create new justifications for the Act's use at the border also increase the likelihood.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 5%, the evidence suggests a significant increase in probability due to the administration's proactive stance and explicit threats.
   - The likelihood ratios for the evidence are high, indicating a strong departure from the historical base rate.
   - Posterior probability is adjusted upward significantly from the prior, reflecting the increased likelihood of invocation.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The forecast accounts for the unique motivations and plans of the current administration, which are not typical of past presidents.
   - Tail risks and alternative scenarios: The possibility of unforeseen events or changes in political dynamics could affect the probability.
   - Best alternative forecast: A lower probability might be plausible if one assumes the institutional and political constraints will ultimately prevent invocation.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and adjustments for unique circumstances, the final calibrated probability reflects a significant increase from the historical base rate.

Final: 25%

# Will President Trump formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act in the roughly 1.5-month period from November 11, 2025 to January 1, 2026.

The most appropriate reference class is the historical frequency of Insurrection Act invocations in the modern era:

- Post-WWII (1945-2024): The Act has been invoked approximately 3-4 times in ~80 years (Little Rock 1957, Ole Miss 1962, LA Riots 1992)
- This suggests a base rate of roughly 4-5% per year
- For a ~1.5 month period, this would translate to roughly 0.5-0.6% as a raw time-proportional base rate

However, this base rate needs adjustment because:
1. The question asks about a specific president (Trump) with unique characteristics
2. We have specific contextual information about his administration's plans
3. The time period is not randomly selected but occurs after specific preparatory actions

Given these factors, I'll use a prior of **3%** for this specific 1.5-month period, which is higher than the time-proportional historical rate but still conservative given the short timeframe.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to historical base case:**
- The constitutional and legal framework remains the same
- The military still maintains institutional separation from domestic law enforcement
- Political costs of military deployment on US soil remain high

**Key differences from historical base case:**
- Unlike previous presidents, Trump has explicitly stated he would consider using the Act (October 7, 2025 statement)
- The administration has proactively prepared legal groundwork via executive orders (June 9, 2025)
- Project 2025 indicates a premeditated plan to use the Act, unlike the reactive use in historical cases
- The administration appears to have staffed key positions with loyalists willing to execute such orders
- The definition of "insurrection" is being expanded to include non-violent policy obstruction

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit statement about using the Insurrection Act (October 7, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Trump plans to invoke the Act, the probability of making such a statement is very high (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump does not plan to invoke the Act, the probability of making such a statement is moderate (~30%) as it could be a threat without follow-through
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Executive order directing review of using the Act for border control (June 9, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Trump plans to invoke the Act, the probability of such preparatory legal work is very high (~95%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump does not plan to invoke the Act, the probability of such preparatory work is still moderate (~40%) as it could be posturing
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Project 2025 detailed plans for using the Insurrection Act**
- P(E|H): If Trump plans to invoke the Act, the probability of it being in Project 2025 is high (~80%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump does not plan to invoke the Act, the probability of it being in Project 2025 is still substantial (~50%) as it could be aspirational
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Legal experts warning of illegality (October 10, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Trump plans to invoke the Act, such warnings would be very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump does not plan to invoke the Act, such warnings would still be likely (~70%) given his statements
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 5: Short timeframe (only ~1.5 months remaining in 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Trump plans to invoke the Act before 2026, the probability of doing so in this specific window is moderate (~40%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump does not plan to invoke the Act before 2026, this timeframe is irrelevant (100%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.4
- This evidence decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with the prior of 3% (odds of 3:97 or approximately 1:32):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Trump's explicit statement):**
- Prior odds: 1:32
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3:32 or approximately 1:10.7
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+10.7) ≈ 8.5%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Executive order for border control):**
- Prior odds: 1:10.7
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 2.4:10.7 or approximately 1:4.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+4.5) ≈ 18.2%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Project 2025 plans):**
- Prior odds: 1:4.5
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 1.6:4.5 or approximately 1:2.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+2.8) ≈ 26.3%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Legal experts' warnings):**
- Prior odds: 1:2.8
- Likelihood ratio: 1.3
- Posterior odds: 1.3:2.8 or approximately 1:2.15
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+2.15) ≈ 31.7%

**Update on Evidence 5 (Short timeframe):**
- Prior odds: 1:2.15
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4
- Posterior odds: 0.4:2.15 or approximately 1:5.4
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+5.4) ≈ 15.6%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting Trump's statements, which could be political posturing rather than genuine intent
- The institutional resistance from the military might be stronger than accounted for
- The short timeframe significantly limits the probability - major triggering events might not occur in this window
- Legal challenges could preemptively deter an invocation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Trump might prefer to wait until after January 1, 2026 to invoke the Act, perhaps after building more public support
- He might find alternative legal mechanisms that achieve similar goals without the political cost of the Insurrection Act
- The administration might be focused on other priorities in its early months

**Best alternative forecast:**
A much lower probability (5-10%) could be justified by emphasizing:
1. The extremely short timeframe (only ~1.5 months)
2. The historical rarity of invocations
3. The significant political and institutional costs
4. The possibility that Trump's statements are primarily rhetorical

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, the evidence of explicit preparation and stated intent is unusually strong compared to historical cases. The administration appears to have specifically prepared for this action, unlike previous administrations.

**Adjustment:**
Given the red team considerations, particularly the very short timeframe, I should adjust my estimate downward from 15.6% to approximately 12%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the historical base rate, the specific evidence regarding Trump's statements and preparations, and the constraints of the short timeframe, I arrive at a final probability of 12%.

Final: 12%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is the formal invocation of the Insurrection Act by a US President. To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of post-WWII presidential years (1945-2024).

*   **Reference Class**: In this ~80-year period, there have been approximately 3-4 major, unambiguous invocations (e.g., Eisenhower in 1957 for Little Rock, Kennedy in 1962 for Ole Miss, George H.W. Bush in 1992 for the LA riots).
*   **Calculation**: This frequency suggests roughly one invocation every 20-25 years. This yields an annual base rate of 1/25 to 1/20, or 4% to 5%.
*   **Prior**: I will select a prior probability of **4.5%** for a generic president invoking the Act in a generic year. In odds form, this is approximately 0.045 / 0.955 ≈ 0.047, or about 1-to-21 against.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation, as described in the research report, differs from the historical base case in several critical ways that suggest the prior is likely too low.

*   **Similarities**: The context involves potential triggers that are historically consistent with the Act's use, such as civil unrest and defiance of federal authority by local officials.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Intent**: Historically, presidents have used the Act reactively and as a last resort. The evidence suggests the Trump administration has a *proactive* and *pre-meditated* plan to use it as a primary tool to enforce policy (e.g., immigration) and suppress dissent.
    *   **Personnel**: The administration is described as having been staffed with loyalists specifically to overcome the institutional resistance from the Department of Defense and Department of Justice that constrained Trump in his first term. This systematically removes a key historical "guardrail."
    *   **Justification**: The administration is actively working to expand the definition of "insurrection" to include non-violent policy obstruction and to frame migration as an "invasion," creating a wider range of potential pretexts than past presidents would have considered.

These differences indicate a fundamental departure from the conditions that produced the low historical base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report. Let H be the hypothesis that Trump invokes the Act before 2026, and ~H be the alternative.

*   **Evidence 1: Project 2025 plans and targeted staffing.**
    *   This evidence of pre-meditation and removal of institutional barriers is far more likely if the administration intends to use the Act (P(E|H) is high) than if it does not (P(E|~H) is low). This could be posturing, but such detailed preparation is a strong signal.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Trump's public statements threatening to use the Act (Oct 2025).**
    *   A president planning to use such a power would likely issue public warnings to prepare the political ground (P(E|H) is high). However, presidents also make threats as a bluff to achieve compliance without action (P(E|~H) is moderate).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Efforts to create a new justification (border "invasion").**
    *   This shows the administration is actively creating the pretext for a specific, novel use of the Act. This is a preparatory step you would expect to see if they plan to invoke it (P(E|H) is high).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 4: Warnings from legal experts and political backlash.**
    *   This highlights the significant costs of invocation. This friction is a key reason the Act might *not* be used. The warnings themselves are expected whether the act is invoked or not, given the public rhetoric. This evidence slightly reinforces the deterrents.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Slightly less than 1. This evidence slightly decreases the probability by emphasizing the known constraints.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will update the prior based on the combined weight of the evidence. The evidence of proactive planning, targeted staffing, and public intent is so strong that it largely overwhelms the low historical base rate.

A conceptual model is useful here:
**P(Invoke) = P(Trigger Occurs) × P(President Invokes | Trigger)**

1.  **P(Trigger Occurs)**: The question covers the remaining ~50 days of 2025. A "trigger" could be large-scale protests or a governor's defiance. Crucially, the administration is also working to create its own trigger by framing the border situation as an "invasion," a crisis it can declare at will. The probability of a suitable pretext arising or being created in this timeframe is therefore quite high. I estimate this at **50%**.
2.  **P(President Invokes | Trigger)**: Given a plausible trigger, the decision is not automatic. The political and institutional costs would be immense, creating a powerful incentive to hesitate or use a less extreme tool (e.g., federalizing the National Guard). Despite the administration's preparations, this remains a significant barrier. I estimate the probability of following through, even with a pretext, at **40%**.

**Posterior Calculation**: P(Invoke) = 0.50 (P(Trigger)) × 0.40 (P(Invoke|Trigger)) = **20%**.

This posterior reflects a significant increase from the 4.5% annual base rate, driven by the unique and specific evidence about this administration's intent and capabilities.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 20% could be too high if the administration's rhetoric is primarily a political bluff to intimidate opponents, and they would ultimately balk at the catastrophic political fallout of actually using active-duty troops on US soil. They might prefer less extreme measures to achieve their goals.

Conversely, my forecast could be too low. I may be underestimating the administration's willingness to create a crisis and overestimating the remaining institutional friction. If the key cabinet members are completely loyal, the primary check on presidential power is gone, and the probability given a trigger could be much higher than 40%. The 20% forecast attempts to balance the administration's clear intent against the still-powerful, albeit weakened, constraints.

The 20% figure feels like a reasonable synthesis, acknowledging that this is a radical situation while stopping short of assuming the most extreme outcome is inevitable.

### 6. Final Forecast

The final forecast reflects the low base rate being heavily updated by strong evidence of specific intent, planning, and personnel choices that make an invocation of the Insurrection Act far more likely than in any typical presidential year.

Final: 20%
