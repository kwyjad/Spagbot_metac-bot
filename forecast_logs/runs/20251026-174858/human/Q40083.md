### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasting Panel**

**To:** Lead Statistician
**From:** Research Desk
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Subject:** Forecast Update: US National Debt on December 31, 2025

This brief analyzes the probability of the US national debt remaining under $38.5 trillion by year-end 2025. The analysis focuses on the short-term trajectory of debt accumulation given the current fiscal environment.

### Reference class & base rates
The time horizon is approximately two months (66 days). Therefore, the most relevant reference classes are short-term debt increases, not long-term annual trends.

1.  **Post-COVID (2022-2025) 66-Day Debt Increases:** In the period of elevated deficits following the main pandemic response, the US has experienced consistent, rapid debt growth. From Jan 1, 2023 (~$31.45T) to Oct 23, 2025 (~$38.0T), the debt increased by ~$6.55T over 21.75 months, an average of ~$301B per month, or ~$662B per 66-day period. **Base Rate (Yes): ~20%**. This class suggests the debt is more likely than not to exceed the $500B available headroom.
2.  **Post-Debt Ceiling Resolution Periods (2023, 2025):** A more specific reference class involves periods immediately following a debt limit suspension. During these times, the Treasury borrows heavily to replenish its cash balance (TGA) and settle obligations deferred via "extraordinary measures." In the two months following the June 2023 resolution, debt surged by over $1 trillion. The current period mirrors this, with debt rising $1.7T since the July 2025 suspension. **Base Rate (Yes): <5%**. This class points to exceptionally high borrowing rates that would easily surpass the question's threshold.

*Limitations:* These reference classes are based on a recent, volatile fiscal regime. The sample size for post-debt-ceiling periods is very small, but the mechanism is well-understood and consistent.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The resolution is ~2 months away; this timeline focuses on the last 6 months.

*   **2025-07-XX:** Debt ceiling raised/suspended. (↑) — Unlocks Treasury's ability to borrow, initiating a period of rapid debt issuance to replenish the Treasury General Account (TGA).
*   **2025-08-13:** US public debt hits a record $37 trillion. (↑) — Demonstrates the rapid pace of accumulation following the debt ceiling resolution.
*   **2025-10-17:** Treasury confirms a $1.8 trillion deficit for Fiscal Year 2025. (↑) — Reinforces the high underlying structural rate of borrowing, averaging ~$4.9B/day.
*   **2025-10-22:** A recent government shutdown is cited as exacerbating debt accumulation. (↑) — Shutdowns can disrupt the timing of revenues and outlays, often leading to a catch-up in borrowing once resolved.
*   **2025-10-23:** US national debt surpasses $38 trillion. (↑) — The most critical data point. The debt increased by $1 trillion in just over two months, an average of ~$15-16B per day.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **TGA Replenishment:** Following the July 2025 debt ceiling suspension, the Treasury is aggressively issuing debt to restore its cash balance to target levels. This is the primary driver of the recent surge. (Size: Large, but effect diminishes as target is reached).
2.  **Structural Deficit:** The underlying mismatch between federal spending (entitlements, defense, etc.) and revenues. The FY2025 deficit of $1.8T establishes a high baseline borrowing requirement of nearly $5B/day. (Size: Large).
3.  **Interest Costs:** With a large debt stock and elevated interest rates, payments on the debt are a significant and growing component of federal outlays, creating a feedback loop that drives further borrowing. (Size: Moderate).
4.  **Timing of Outlays and Receipts:** Federal cash flows are lumpy. Large payments for Social Security, Medicare, and defense contracts occur at the start of the month, while major tax receipts are concentrated around quarterly deadlines. This creates significant daily volatility. (Size: Small, on a 2-month total).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Debt Ceiling Event:** Unlike an "average" period, we are in the direct aftermath of a debt ceiling resolution. This context makes the extreme borrowing of the past few months a predictable, mechanistic process of TGA replenishment, not a random fluctuation.
*   **Accelerated Pace:** The recent accumulation of $1 trillion in just over two months is explicitly noted in sources as the fastest outside the COVID-19 pandemic. This rate is far above the long-term average.
*   **High Baseline Deficit:** The $1.8 trillion deficit for FY2025 is historically large for a period without a major recession or war, indicating that even after TGA replenishment slows, the underlying rate of borrowing will remain substantial.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** With only ~$500B of headroom and 66 days remaining, the outcome is highly sensitive to the daily burn rate. The current rate is 3-5 times higher than what would be required to stay under the limit.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the broader reference class of post-COVID debt growth, a forecaster might start with a moderately low prior for "Yes" (e.g., P(Yes) = 20%, equivalent n=5).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓↓ Large) The debt increased by $1 trillion between August and October 2025. This recent, high-velocity trend is the single most powerful piece of evidence against the resolution being "Yes".
    *   (↓↓ Large) The mechanistic driver is the post-debt-ceiling TGA replenishment, a pattern seen in prior instances that leads to exceptionally high short-term borrowing.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The confirmed $1.8T structural deficit for FY2025 ensures a high floor for borrowing even if TGA-related issuance slows.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the recent high rate of borrowing is not an anomaly but a predictable consequence of current fiscal operations. The posterior probability of "Yes" should be revised significantly downward to a very low value.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES - debt stays under $38.5T):**
    *   Daily Treasury Statements showing average net borrowing consistently below $7.5B/day for a multi-week period.
    *   Treasury announces its TGA cash balance target has been reached ahead of schedule, signaling a sharp reduction in new debt issuance.
    *   Unexpectedly strong Q4 economic data leading to a surge in corporate and individual tax receipts.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO - debt exceeds $38.5T):**
    *   Daily Treasury Statements showing average net borrowing remains above $10B/day through November.
    *   Announcement of any supplemental spending package (e.g., disaster relief, foreign aid) before year-end.
    *   The Treasury's Quarterly Refunding Announcement indicates continued large auction sizes for notes and bonds.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Daily Volatility:** The "Debt to the Penny" figure can swing by tens of billions of dollars day-to-day due to the timing of cash flows. The trend over several days is more important than any single report.
*   **Year-End Accounting:** Fiscal operations around the end of the calendar year can sometimes involve unusual transactions that affect the debt level on a specific day like Dec 31.
*   **Data Source:** The resolution depends solely on the Treasury's "Debt to the Penny" dataset for Dec 31, 2025. No other source matters.
*   **Political Unpredictability:**

To forecast whether the US national debt will be under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate is derived from historical data on US debt growth, particularly focusing on short-term increases post-debt ceiling resolutions. The most relevant reference class is the post-debt ceiling periods, where debt growth is rapid due to Treasury actions to replenish cash reserves. Historically, these periods have seen significant debt increases, suggesting a low probability of the debt remaining under $38.5 trillion.

- **Base Rate (Yes):** Less than 5%. This is based on the rapid borrowing observed in similar periods, where debt surged by over $1 trillion in a short time frame.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to past post-debt ceiling periods, characterized by aggressive borrowing to replenish the Treasury General Account (TGA).
- **Difference:** The current fiscal environment includes a high structural deficit and elevated interest costs, which exacerbate borrowing needs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Debt Increase Rate:** The debt has increased by $1 trillion in just over two months, averaging $15-16 billion per day. This is a strong indicator that the debt will exceed $38.5 trillion.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very low likelihood of staying under $38.5 trillion given this evidence.
- **TGA Replenishment:** The Treasury is aggressively issuing debt to restore cash balances, a known driver of rapid debt accumulation.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly suggests exceeding the threshold.
- **Structural Deficit:** The FY2025 deficit of $1.8 trillion implies a high baseline borrowing rate.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Supports the expectation of exceeding $38.5 trillion.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 5% (Yes) / 95% (No) = 1:19
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the evidence, the likelihood of exceeding $38.5 trillion is much higher than staying under.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:19 × (very low likelihood of staying under) = significantly lower than 1:19
- **Posterior Probability:** The probability of staying under $38.5 trillion is revised downward to a very low value.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider scenarios where debt growth slows unexpectedly, such as a sudden economic boom increasing tax revenues or a policy intervention reducing spending.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where the Treasury achieves its TGA target early, reducing borrowing needs. However, given current trends, this is unlikely.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strong evidence against staying under $38.5 trillion, the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian updating, the probability of the US national debt being under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025, is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Forecasting the US National Debt on December 31, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I need to determine whether the US national debt will remain under $38.5 trillion by December 31, 2025, which is approximately 66 days from the current date (October 26, 2025).

The most appropriate base rate comes from examining recent debt growth patterns, particularly in the post-COVID era and following debt ceiling resolutions:

- According to the research report, from January 2023 to October 2025, the debt increased by ~$6.55T over 21.75 months, averaging ~$301B per month or ~$662B per 66-day period.
- More specifically, in post-debt ceiling resolution periods, debt has surged rapidly. After the June 2023 resolution, debt increased by over $1 trillion in two months.

Given that we're currently in a post-debt ceiling resolution period (since July 2025), and we need to determine if the debt will increase by less than $500B in 66 days (from ~$38T to under $38.5T), I'll use a base rate of 5%.

**Prior probability (P(H) = 5%)** that the debt will remain under $38.5 trillion.
**Prior odds = 0.05/0.95 = 0.053**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We're in a post-debt ceiling resolution period, which historically leads to accelerated borrowing
- The US continues to operate with large structural deficits
- Interest costs remain a significant driver of debt accumulation

**Differences from base case:**
- The current pace of debt accumulation is exceptionally high, even compared to historical post-debt ceiling periods
- The research report notes the debt has increased by $1 trillion in just over two months (August-October 2025), described as "the fastest accumulation outside the pandemic"
- The FY2025 deficit of $1.8 trillion establishes a baseline borrowing requirement of nearly $5B/day
- The recent debt increase rate of $25 billion per day (as mentioned in the background) is 3-5 times higher than what would be required to stay under the limit

These differences suggest the current situation is even more extreme than the base case, which would further reduce the probability.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Recent debt accumulation rate**
- The debt has grown by $400 billion in the past month (~$25 billion per day)
- P(E|H): The probability of seeing this rate if the debt will stay under $38.5T is very low, perhaps 0.1
- P(E|~H): The probability of seeing this rate if the debt will exceed $38.5T is very high, perhaps 0.9
- Likelihood ratio = 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Post-debt ceiling TGA replenishment**
- Since the debt ceiling was raised in July, the debt has jumped by $1.7 trillion
- P(E|H): The probability of this rapid post-ceiling increase if the debt will stay under $38.5T is low, perhaps 0.2
- P(E|~H): The probability of this rapid increase if the debt will exceed $38.5T is high, perhaps 0.8
- Likelihood ratio = 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: FY2025 deficit of $1.8 trillion**
- This establishes a baseline borrowing requirement of nearly $5B/day
- P(E|H): The probability of this deficit level if the debt will stay under $38.5T is moderate, perhaps 0.4
- P(E|~H): The probability of this deficit level if the debt will exceed $38.5T is high, perhaps 0.7
- Likelihood ratio = 0.4/0.7 = 0.57
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's update our prior with the strongest piece of evidence first:

**Update with Evidence 1:**
- Prior odds = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio = 0.11
- Posterior odds = 0.053 × 0.11 = 0.00583
- Posterior probability = 0.00583/(1 + 0.00583) = 0.0058 or 0.58%

**Update with Evidence 2:**
- Prior odds = 0.00583
- Likelihood ratio = 0.25
- Posterior odds = 0.00583 × 0.25 = 0.00146
- Posterior probability = 0.00146/(1 + 0.00146) = 0.00145 or 0.145%

**Update with Evidence 3:**
- Prior odds = 0.00146
- Likelihood ratio = 0.57
- Posterior odds = 0.00146 × 0.57 = 0.00083
- Posterior probability = 0.00083/(1 + 0.00083) = 0.00083 or 0.083%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence that the debt will exceed $38.5 trillion by December 31, 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Let's critically evaluate this forecast:

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent trends. The Treasury might have front-loaded its borrowing immediately after the debt ceiling resolution, and the pace could slow significantly.
- There could be unexpected fiscal developments: a sudden surge in tax receipts, emergency spending cuts, or accounting changes that temporarily reduce the reported debt.
- Year-end accounting practices might affect the debt level specifically on December 31.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Treasury could announce that its TGA cash balance target has been reached, significantly reducing new debt issuance.
- An unexpected economic boom in Q4 could lead to higher tax revenues.
- Political pressure might lead to temporary measures to slow debt accumulation before year-end.

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my extremely low probability upward somewhat. While the evidence strongly suggests the debt will exceed $38.5 trillion, I should account for the possibility of unexpected developments or changes in borrowing patterns.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe there is a very low probability that the US national debt will remain under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025. The current rate of debt accumulation, the post-debt ceiling borrowing pattern, and the large structural deficit all point strongly toward exceeding this threshold.

However, to account for uncertainty and possible changes in borrowing patterns, I'll adjust my final probability to 1%.

Final: 1%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether the US national debt will increase by less than approximately $500 billion over a 66-day period (from October 26 to December 31, 2025). The most relevant reference class is not long-term historical averages, but rather short-term debt accumulation in similar fiscal environments.

The research report identifies a highly specific and relevant reference class: **periods immediately following a debt ceiling suspension**. In these periods, the Treasury borrows aggressively to replenish its cash balance (the Treasury General Account, or TGA), leading to a temporary but massive surge in debt. This occurred after the June 2023 resolution and is occurring now, after the July 2025 resolution. In both cases, debt surged by over $1 trillion in about two months.

Based on this reference class, the probability of the debt increasing by *less* than $500 billion is extremely low. I will set a conservative prior probability P(H) for "Yes" at **5%**. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:19 in favor of the debt exceeding the threshold.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns perfectly with the chosen reference class. We are in the middle of the predictable post-debt-ceiling-suspension borrowing surge. The primary mechanism described in the base case—TGA replenishment—is the main driver of the current high rate of debt accumulation. There are no significant differences that would suggest a deviation from this pattern; if anything, the high underlying structural deficit makes the situation even more acute than in past instances.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that the debt will be under $38.5T. Let ~H be the alternative.

*   **Evidence 1: Recent Rate of Debt Accumulation.** The debt has recently increased by ~$400 billion in the last month (a rate of ~$13.3B/day) and by $1 trillion since mid-August (a rate of ~$15-16B/day). To stay under the $38.5T threshold, the average daily increase for the next 66 days must be less than $7.58B/day ($500B / 66 days).
    *   **P(Evidence | H):** The probability of observing a current borrowing rate of $13-16B/day if the rate is about to average less than $7.58B/day is very low. It would require an immediate and drastic slowdown.
    *   **P(Evidence | ~H):** The probability of observing this rate if the debt is on track to surpass the threshold is very high. The current trend is simply continuing.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)):** This ratio is much less than 1, meaning this evidence strongly disconfirms H.

*   **Evidence 2: High Structural Deficit.** The confirmed FY2025 deficit is $1.8 trillion. This establishes a high *floor* for borrowing, averaging ~$4.9B/day.
    *   **Analysis:** This structural borrowing alone will consume $325B ($4.9B * 66 days) of the available $500B headroom. This leaves only $175B for all other borrowing, including the ongoing TGA replenishment and interest payments, over the 66-day period. This is an average of just $2.65B/day for non-structural borrowing, a fraction of the recent pace.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence also makes H less likely, as it severely constrains the fiscal space available to remain under the threshold.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:19 (P(H) = 5%).
*   **Update:** The evidence of the extremely high current borrowing rate is powerful. Let's assign a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/10 to this evidence.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds = (1/19) × (1/10) = 1/190.
*   **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is calculated as Odds / (1 + Odds).
    *   P(H | Evidence) = (1/190) / (1 + 1/190) = 1/191 ≈ 0.52%.

The calculation shows that after accounting for the recent, rapid debt growth, the probability of staying under $38.5T falls to less than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong. The most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution is an abrupt and immediate halt to the TGA replenishment borrowing. If the Treasury's cash target was just reached, borrowing could suddenly fall to the structural floor of ~$5B/day. In this case, the total increase would be ~$325B, keeping the debt under $38.5T.

However, this requires a sharp, un-signaled change from the trend of the last few months, where borrowing has been consistently high. While this "sudden stop" scenario is possible, it is not the most probable outcome. The momentum of current fiscal operations is immense. Therefore, while the probability is not zero, it should remain very low. I will adjust my final probability slightly upward from the calculated 0.52% to account for this tail risk.

### Final Forecast
The combination of a highly relevant base rate (post-debt-ceiling surges) and overwhelming evidence of a continued high borrowing rate makes it extremely unlikely that the national debt will increase by less than $500 billion in the next 66 days. The structural deficit alone consumes most of the available headroom. The path to "No" only requires the current, powerful trend to continue, while the path to "Yes" requires a sudden and dramatic reversal of this trend.

Final: 1%
