### Reference class & base rates
-   **Major Bipartisan U.S. Presidential Initiatives:** Programs like PEPFAR, the Peace Corps, and PMI itself, which were launched with presidential backing and secured broad, long-term bipartisan support. These programs are exceptionally durable. The base rate of termination for such a program in any given year is extremely low, likely **<1%**. They become embedded in the federal budget and foreign policy establishment.
-   **U.S. Foreign Aid Programs Targeted for Cuts/Elimination:** Programs specifically named by an administration as targets for elimination or major restructuring. This is a more relevant class. Historically, even when targeted (e.g., USAID by the Reagan and Clinton administrations, various programs by Trump's first term), complete elimination is rare due to Congressional resistance and bureaucratic inertia. The base rate of actual termination within a year of being targeted is perhaps **10-20%**.
-   **Federal Programs Whose Lead Implementing Agency is Dissolved:** This is the most specific and alarming reference class. When a parent agency is dismantled, its subsidiary programs face an existential crisis. While rare, the base rate of a program ceasing to exist as a distinct entity in this scenario is very high, plausibly **>75%** within the first year of the dissolution.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-01-20] EO 14169 signed, targeting USAID for "reevaluation and realignment." — ↑ — Signals high-level executive intent to disrupt the status quo of foreign aid, directly impacting PMI's lead agency.
-   [2025-02-01] PEPFAR granted a waiver from the foreign aid pause; PMI was not. — ↑ — This differential treatment strongly suggests PMI is not considered a protected, essential program by the new administration, unlike its sister initiative.
-   [2025-02-23] Mass layoffs begin at USAID, PMI's implementing agency. — ↑↑ — Directly degrades the operational capacity of PMI, making it difficult or impossible to execute its mission regardless of funding status.
-   [2025-10-16] KFF report notes the "dissolution of USAID" and cancellation of global health awards, including for malaria. — ↑↑↑ — This is the most powerful evidence, indicating PMI's parent structure is being eliminated and its specific activities are being cancelled.
-   [2025-11-23] PMI's official website (pmi.gov) is offline, showing an error. — ↑ — A strong public-facing signal that the program is no longer being actively maintained or is being deliberately dismantled.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Executive Hostility & Action:** The President is using executive orders and administrative actions to dismantle USAID and halt program activities. This is the primary driver and has a **large** effect, as it can happen much faster than legislative change.
-   **Congressional Power of the Purse:** Congress appropriates funds for PMI. Its continued, bipartisan support is the main force for PMI's survival. However, this is a slower-moving lever and may not be able to counteract swift executive action. Its effect is **large** but potentially delayed.
-   **Operational Incapacitation:** By firing staff and dissolving the parent agency (USAID), the administration can make it impossible for PMI to function, effectively terminating it even if the law authorizing it remains on the books. This is a **large** and immediate driver.
-   **Bureaucratic & Legal Resistance:** The federal bureaucracy and potential legal challenges (e.g., over the Impoundment Control Act) can slow or block executive actions. This is a counteracting force, but its effectiveness is uncertain. Effect size is likely **small to moderate** against a determined executive.
-   **Waiver Process:** The existence of a waiver process (used by PEPFAR) provides a potential, though so far unused, path to survival for PMI. The failure to secure a waiver is a key part of the negative story. This driver is currently pushing the probability up and has a **moderate** effect.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Pace and Severity of Executive Action:** Unlike past attempts to reform foreign aid, the actions described (mass layoffs, agency dissolution) are exceptionally swift and severe, far exceeding the norms of the "Targeted Foreign Aid Programs" reference class.
-   **Targeting the Implementing Agency:** The strategy is not just to defund PMI, but to eliminate its entire operational structure (USAID). This is a more fundamental attack than typical budget battles.
-   **Differential Treatment vs. PEPFAR:** The explicit protection of PEPFAR while PMI is left exposed is a crucial distinction. In the past, major global health initiatives were often treated as a bloc; this selective targeting is a new and ominous development.
-   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in just over a month. This short window heavily favors the impact of rapid executive actions over the slower, deliberative processes of Congress, which is the main potential savior for the program.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with the "Major Bipartisan Initiative" class, suggesting a very low prior (<5%) of termination. This reflects a strong belief in the program's historical durability (equivalent n ≈ 20).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑↑↑ (Very Large) The reported dissolution of USAID and cancellation of malaria awards is a direct blow to PMI's existence.
    -   ↑↑ (Large) The mass layoffs at USAID cripple the program's ability to function, a de facto termination.
    -   ↑ (Moderate) The lack of a waiver, in contrast to PEPFAR, signals specific negative intent.
    -   ↓ (Moderate) The program's long history of bipartisan Congressional support and successful outcomes is a strong countervailing force, but its influence is slow.
-   **Net effect:** The recent, severe, and targeted evidence of administrative dismantling overwhelmingly outweighs the program's historical resilience. The posterior should move dramatically upward, from a very low base to a high probability of "Yes".

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Official White House or State Dept. press release announcing the termination or merger of PMI.
    -   A Continuing Resolution for FY2026 funding that explicitly zeroes out or reallocates the PMI budget line.
    -   Reports of PMI country directors or key CDC staff being reassigned or terminated.
    -   PMI's functions are formally transferred to another office (e.g., a diminished bureau within the State Dept), satisfying the "consolidation" resolution criterion.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A specific waiver for PMI is announced, similar to PEPFAR's.
    -   A successful lawsuit is filed that places a temporary restraining order on the dissolution of USAID or the firing of its staff.
    -   Prominent Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress issue a strong, joint statement vowing to protect PMI and use legislative means to do so.
    -   The pmi.gov website is restored.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The program could become a "zombie"—existing legally on paper but with no staff or funding to operate. This would likely count as "ceasing to exist" under the resolution criteria ("no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization"), but there could be ambiguity.
-   **Information Asymmetry:** The scenario describes a chaotic situation within the government. Accurate, timely public reporting on the exact administrative status of a specific program like PMI may be difficult to obtain.
-   **Reversal Risk:** A significant political backlash or a "Christmas compromise" in Congress could lead to a sudden reversal, though this seems unlikely given the administration's trajectory.
-   **Fictional Scenario Constraints:** This analysis is entirely dependent on the provided fictional background. It assumes the sources are accurate representations of the situation and that no other unstated events have occurred.

**Final Research Summary:** PMI, a historically resilient and bipartisan program, is facing an acute existential threat from targeted executive action aimed at dismantling its parent agency, USAID. The evidence of operational incapacitation and lack of protection strongly suggests it will cease to exist as a distinct entity before the deadline.

To forecast the probability of the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection:** The most relevant reference class is "U.S. Foreign Aid Programs Targeted for Cuts/Elimination," with a base rate of 10-20% for termination within a year of being targeted. This reflects historical resistance to complete elimination despite targeting.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the severity of the current situation, we start with the higher end of this range, 20%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** PMI is a U.S. foreign aid program currently targeted for cuts, similar to past programs.
- **Differences:** The current situation involves more severe actions, such as the dissolution of USAID, which is unprecedented compared to typical budget cuts or restructuring.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **EO 14169 and USAID Targeting:** Signals strong executive intent to disrupt PMI. Likelihood ratio is high, increasing probability.
- **PEPFAR Waiver, PMI Not:** Indicates PMI is not prioritized for protection. Likelihood ratio is moderate, increasing probability.
- **Mass Layoffs at USAID:** Severely impacts PMI's operational capacity. Likelihood ratio is very high, significantly increasing probability.
- **Dissolution of USAID and Cancellation of Awards:** Direct evidence of PMI's potential termination. Likelihood ratio is extremely high, greatly increasing probability.
- **PMI Website Offline:** Public signal of program dismantling. Likelihood ratio is high, increasing probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 20% probability translates to odds of 0.25.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Combined evidence suggests a very high likelihood ratio, conservatively estimated at 10.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.25 (prior odds) × 10 (likelihood ratio) = 2.5.
- **Posterior Probability:** 2.5 / (1 + 2.5) = 0.714, or 71.4%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of Congressional intervention or legal challenges delaying or reversing actions.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A bipartisan Congressional effort could restore PMI funding or operations, though this seems unlikely given the short time frame.
- **Adjustment:** Given the rapid executive actions and lack of immediate counteractions, the probability remains high.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the severe and targeted actions against PMI, the probability of it ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, is high.

Final: 71%

# Will the President's Malaria Initiative program cease to exist before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I need to identify an appropriate reference class for this question. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) is:
- A major bipartisan U.S. global health initiative (created in 2005 under President Bush)
- Currently targeted by a presidential administration for potential elimination
- Operated by USAID, which is undergoing mass layoffs and apparent dissolution

The most relevant reference class is "U.S. foreign aid programs specifically targeted for elimination by a presidential administration while their implementing agency is being dismantled." This is a narrow but highly relevant class.

Given the evidence provided, I'll start with a prior probability of **75%** that PMI will cease to exist before January 1, 2026. This reflects:
- The extreme rarity of complete elimination of established bipartisan initiatives (which would suggest a low base rate)
- Counterbalanced by the unprecedented targeting of its implementing agency (USAID)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- PMI is a long-established program with bipartisan support, like other durable foreign aid initiatives
- It has demonstrated effectiveness (credited with saving ~940,000 lives)
- It operates in multiple countries with established infrastructure

**Key differences:**
- The implementing agency (USAID) is actively being dissolved, with mass layoffs reported
- Unlike PEPFAR (a similar initiative), PMI has not received a waiver from EO 14169
- PMI's website is already offline, suggesting active dismantling
- The timeline is extremely short (resolution by January 1, 2026 - just over a month away)
- The Kaiser Family Foundation explicitly notes no waivers have been announced for PMI

These differences significantly increase the probability of PMI ceasing to exist compared to the typical durability of such programs.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Executive Order 14169 targeting USAID**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If PMI is to cease existing, an executive order targeting its parent agency would be expected
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if PMI survives, such an order might exist but with PMI receiving a waiver
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.2
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 2: PEPFAR received a waiver but PMI did not**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If PMI is to be eliminated, we'd expect it not to receive protection
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If PMI were to survive, it would likely receive similar protection to PEPFAR
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Mass layoffs at USAID**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Elimination of staff is consistent with program termination
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.1) - It would be extremely difficult for PMI to continue with its implementing agency gutted
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.5
- This evidence strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: PMI website offline**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Programs being eliminated often have their online presence removed
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Operational programs typically maintain functioning websites
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 75% (odds of 3:1), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence: the mass layoffs at USAID.

Prior odds = 0.75/0.25 = 3
Likelihood ratio = 9.5
Posterior odds = 3 × 9.5 = 28.5
Posterior probability = 28.5/(1+28.5) ≈ 0.966 or ~97%

This is extremely high, so I should consider if I've overestimated the likelihood ratio or if there are countervailing factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- Congressional intervention could save PMI despite executive action
- PMI could be transferred to another agency (CDC, State Department) rather than eliminated
- Legal challenges might block the dissolution of USAID
- The short timeframe (about 5 weeks) might not be enough for complete elimination

**Alternative scenarios:**
- PMI could become a "zombie program" - technically existing but non-functional
- A last-minute compromise in December budget negotiations could preserve PMI
- International pressure could force a reversal of the decision

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for PMI's survival would be that Congress, with bipartisan support for malaria prevention, includes specific language in a year-end spending bill to protect PMI and transfer it to another agency. This could result in a ~40% chance of survival.

**Rebuttal:**
Given the reported dissolution of USAID is already underway, the offline website, and the explicit lack of a waiver (unlike PEPFAR), the operational capacity of PMI appears to be already severely compromised. Congressional action would likely come too late to prevent the de facto cessation of PMI as a distinct organization.

After considering these factors, I should adjust my extremely high posterior probability downward somewhat to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and potential counterarguments, I assess that the President's Malaria Initiative will very likely cease to exist before January 1, 2026. The combination of:
- Executive Order 14169 targeting USAID
- Mass layoffs at USAID already underway
- Lack of a waiver (unlike PEPFAR)
- PMI's website being offline
- The short timeframe remaining (about 5 weeks)

All strongly suggest that PMI will cease to exist, either through formal termination, de facto operational collapse, or consolidation into another entity where it loses its distinct identity.

Final: 92%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Reference Class:** Major, bipartisan U.S. presidential initiatives, particularly in foreign aid. This class includes programs like PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), the Peace Corps, and PMI itself.
*   **Reasoning:** These programs are established with significant political capital and tend to build deep, long-lasting support across both political parties due to their perceived success and humanitarian impact. They become embedded in the U.S. foreign policy and global health apparatus.
*   **Initial Prior:** The base rate of such a program being terminated in any given year is exceptionally low. I will set the prior probability P(H) of PMI ceasing to exist in the given timeframe at **2%**. This reflects a strong assumption of durability. In odds form, this is 1:49 against termination.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** PMI fits the reference class perfectly. It was created by a Republican president (George W. Bush), has been robustly funded and supported through subsequent Democratic and Republican administrations for 20 years, and has a strong track record of success.
*   **Differences:** The current situation deviates dramatically from the base case. The primary difference is the nature and severity of the threat. Instead of a typical budget dispute, PMI is threatened by the targeted dismantling of its parent and implementing agency, USAID. This is a far more acute and existential threat than political headwinds or funding cuts alone. Furthermore, the speed of the executive actions described is unusual, and the short time horizon until resolution (just over one month) gives slower-moving institutions like Congress very little time to react.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence provided in the scenario:

*   **Evidence 1: PEPFAR granted a waiver, PMI was not.** This is extremely strong evidence. It demonstrates selective intent by the administration. They are protecting one major global health initiative while leaving another exposed. This differential treatment is much more likely if there is a specific plan to terminate PMI (P(E | H) is high) than if PMI's future were secure (P(E | ~H) is very low). This evidence strongly increases the probability of termination. **Likelihood Ratio >> 10.**
*   **Evidence 2: Mass layoffs at USAID and reports of its "dissolution".** This is a direct attack on PMI's operational capacity. A program cannot function without its implementing agency and staff. The KFF report stating USAID is being "dissolved" and malaria awards are being "cancelled" is almost a direct confirmation that the termination process is underway. This evidence is extremely likely if PMI is ceasing to exist (P(E | H) ≈ 1) and almost impossible if it were to survive (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0). **Likelihood Ratio is extremely high.**
*   **Evidence 3: The pmi.gov website is offline.** This is a public-facing signal that the program is no longer being actively maintained. While technical errors can happen, in the context of the other evidence, it strongly corroborates the narrative of dismantlement. This is much more likely if the program is being terminated than if it is operating normally. **Likelihood Ratio > 5.**

The primary evidence against termination is PMI's long history of bipartisan Congressional support. However, this is a static factor representing the program's inertia. The new evidence describes dynamic actions that are actively overcoming that inertia. Congress's ability to act decisively in the ~5 weeks before the resolution date is the main source of uncertainty.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:49 (P=2%).
*   **Step 1: Update with the PEPFAR waiver evidence.** The singling out of PMI is a powerful signal. A conservative likelihood ratio of 20 seems appropriate.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1/49) × 20 ≈ 0.41.
    *   New Probability ≈ 0.41 / (1 + 0.41) ≈ 29%.
*   **Step 2: Update with USAID dissolution/layoffs and the website being down.** This evidence is overwhelming. It describes the direct mechanisms of termination being executed. The likelihood of these events occurring if PMI were to survive is vanishingly small. I will apply a combined likelihood ratio of 50 to this cluster of evidence, which is likely an underestimate of its true weight.
    *   Final Posterior Odds = 0.41 × 50 = 20.5.
    *   **Final Posterior Probability** = 20.5 / (1 + 20.5) ≈ **95%**.

The evidence is so strong that it completely overwhelms the low prior probability, driving the posterior to a very high value.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible path to a "No" resolution is a last-minute Congressional intervention. Congress could attach a rider to a must-pass spending bill (like a Continuing Resolution to avoid a government shutdown) that explicitly funds PMI and legally blocks the administration from dismantling it or its parent agency.
*   **Plausibility:** This is possible but difficult. The timeline is very short (late November to end of December), a period often characterized by legislative gridlock. Furthermore, the executive actions described (layoffs, cancelling awards) may have already rendered PMI non-operational, meeting the resolution criteria ("no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization") even if funding is restored on paper.
*   **Blind Spots:** Am I underestimating the power of bureaucratic inertia or the potential for successful legal challenges to halt the firings? While possible, these are slow processes, and the question resolves on January 1, 2026. The executive branch has a significant advantage in creating facts on the ground quickly.
*   **Conclusion:** The risk of a last-minute save by Congress or a legal stay is real but small, perhaps in the 2-5% range. My forecast of 95% seems to account for this appropriately. The evidence points toward a rapid, *de facto* termination that is already well underway.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial base rate for a successful, bipartisan program like PMI being terminated is very low. However, the specific evidence presented—the differential treatment compared to PEPFAR, the direct dismantling of its parent agency USAID, the cancellation of its awards, and the offline website—is overwhelming. This cascade of negative indicators points to a swift and deliberate termination by the executive branch. The short time horizon to the resolution date makes a successful counter-action by Congress or the courts highly unlikely. Therefore, the probability that the program will cease to exist is very high.

Final: 95%
