### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent U.S. responses to localized New World Screwworm (NWS) outbreaks.** The most relevant case is the 2016 NWS outbreak in the Florida Keys. The USDA confirmed the first case in late September 2016 and declared the outbreak eradicated by late March 2017, a duration of approximately **6 months**. This class suggests a moderately high probability of resolution within a similar timeframe. The current ban began in May 2025, so a 6-month clock would have ended in November 2025.
2.  **U.S. livestock import suspensions due to other major animal diseases.** Bans related to diseases like Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) are often much longer, lasting years. For example, the BSE-related ban on Canadian cattle lasted from 2003 to 2005. This class suggests a low base rate. However, NWS is a parasitic insect, not a viral/prion disease, and its eradication method (Sterile Insect Technique) is well-established and targeted, making this a weaker analogy.
3.  **Short-term trade disruptions at the U.S.-Mexico border.** The U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade relationship is vast but frequently subject to short-term (days to a few months) disruptions over specific issues (e.g., phytosanitary concerns with avocados, tomatoes). These are typically resolved quickly due to immense economic pressure. This class suggests a high base rate for resolution within a few months.

**Reasoning:** The Florida NWS outbreak (Class 1) is the most analogous case. It involves the same pest and the same lead agency (USDA). Applying its ~6-month timeline to the current May 2025 ban suggests resolution should be imminent. However, the failed reopening in July introduces a significant complication. A blended base rate, leaning heavily on Class 1 but tempered by the complexity of an international border, might suggest a **60-70% chance of resolution within an 8-month period** (i.e., by Jan 2026).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-11** Initial suspension of Mexican cattle imports by USDA. — ↓ — The starting point of the ban.
*   **2025-07-07** U.S. briefly reopens the border to Mexican livestock. — ↑ — Demonstrated a rapid path to reopening was possible and that criteria were initially met.
*   **2025-07-09** U.S. reimposes the suspension after a new NWS case is detected. — ↓ — A major setback. It revealed surveillance/eradication gaps and likely made USDA far more cautious, raising the bar for a second reopening.
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary Rollins states she is "pleased with Mexico's efforts" and that "every day... we get a little bit closer." — ↑ (small) — Positive, cooperative tone from the ultimate decision-maker, but avoids any concrete timeline, suggesting a resolution is not yet certain or scheduled.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **NWS Eradication Progress:** The primary driver. This involves Mexico's ability to successfully deploy the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), conduct effective surveillance, and demonstrate to USDA/APHIS that the pest is contained and no longer a threat to U.S. livestock. **(Large impact)**
2.  **Economic Pressure:** The U.S. beef industry, particularly feedlots in the Southwest, relies on feeder cattle from Mexico. The ban disrupts supply chains and raises costs. Mexican cattle producers lose their primary export market. This creates powerful lobbying pressure on both governments to find a solution. **(Moderate impact)**
3.  **USDA/APHIS Risk Assessment & Bureaucracy:** The decision to reopen is not just political; it's a technical process run by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). They must be satisfied with the data from Mexico and complete their own risk assessments. The failed July reopening likely made this process more stringent. **(Moderate impact, primarily as a source of delay)**
4.  **Regionalization Agreement:** Rather than a full reopening, the U.S. could agree to accept cattle from Mexican states certified as NWS-free. Negotiating and implementing such an agreement is a key mechanism for a partial or full reopening. **(Moderate impact)**
5.  **Political & Diplomatic Relations:** The overall health of the U.S.-Mexico relationship can influence the speed and cooperativeness of the response. Secretary Rollins' positive comments suggest relations on this issue are currently constructive. **(Small impact, unless relations sour)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Pre-existing Eradication Infrastructure:** Unlike a novel outbreak, the U.S. and Mexico have a long-standing joint commission (COMEXA) for NWS eradication. The technology (SIT) and cooperative frameworks are already in place, which should accelerate the response compared to a typical new disease.
*   **The "False Start" in July:** The brief reopening and immediate re-closure is highly unusual. This creates a "once bitten, twice shy" dynamic, likely raising the evidentiary bar for the USDA and making them more risk-averse than in the baseline Florida case.
*   **International Border Complexity:** The Florida outbreak was domestic. This case involves two sovereign nations, requiring data sharing, trust in foreign reporting, and diplomatic coordination, adding layers of potential delay not present in the reference class.
*   **Scale of Economic Interdependence:** The volume of cross-border cattle trade is immense (over 1 million head annually), creating far greater economic pressure for a swift resolution than the localized Florida case.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~65% on "Yes" seems plausible, anchored on the 6-month timeline from the analogous Florida NWS case (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Pre-existing, sophisticated joint eradication infrastructure (COMEXA) and proven technology (SIT) are in place.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Intense, mutual economic pressure on both U.S. and Mexican industries to resume trade.
    *   ↑ (Small): Positive, albeit non-committal, public statements from the USDA Secretary in early November.
    *   ↓ (Large): The failed July reopening demonstrates high USDA sensitivity to risk and likely created a much higher, more cautious standard for proof of eradication.
    *   ↓ (Small): The deadline is less than 45 days away, leaving little room for bureaucratic or scientific delays, especially over the holiday period.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is mixed. The powerful positive drivers (infrastructure, economics) are countered by the significant negative signal of the July failure and the ticking clock. The net effect should likely be a **moderate downward revision** of the prior. The initial optimism from the reference class is tempered by the demonstrated caution of the key actors.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official USDA/APHIS announcement of a technical meeting with Mexico's SENASICA to review eradication data.
    *   Press releases from SENASICA detailing a significant period (e.g., 30+ days) with zero new NWS detections in northern Mexico.
    *   Leaked reports or industry chatter about a "regionalization" plan being finalized, allowing imports from specific NWS-free states.
    *   USDA announcing it is sending a technical verification team to Mexico.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official report or credible rumor of a new NWS case detected in a northern Mexican state.
    *   Public statements from U.S. cattlemen's associations expressing frustration with the lack of a timeline.
    *   USDA officials making non-committal or evasive statements when asked about a reopening date in late November/early December.
    *   Silence from all parties through the first two weeks of December.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Binary Resolution:** The question resolves "No" if the reopening happens on January 2, 2026. The outcome is highly sensitive to last-minute bureaucratic delays, even if a political decision is made in December.
*   **Holiday Slowdown:** The U.S. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year holidays fall within the remaining period, which can significantly slow down government administrative processes.
*   **"Gotcha" Risk:** The single largest risk is a repeat of the July event—a surprise detection of a new NWS case just as a reopening seems imminent, which would immediately reset the clock.
*   **Data Asymmetry:** We are reliant on public statements. The true progress of eradication efforts in Mexico is known only to a small group of officials. Public statements may be overly optimistic for diplomatic reasons.

**Final Research Summary:** Strong structural factors, including established eradication technology and immense economic pressure, favor a reopening before 2026. However, the USDA's demonstrated risk aversion after the failed July reopening has raised the bar for success, and with less than 45 days remaining, the timeline is extremely tight, leaving no room for error or delay.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant historical reference is the 2016 New World Screwworm (NWS) outbreak in the Florida Keys, which was resolved in approximately 6 months. Given that the current ban began in May 2025, a similar timeline would suggest a resolution by November 2025. However, the failed reopening in July 2025 complicates this. A blended base rate, considering the Florida case and the complexities of international trade, suggests a prior probability of about 65% for reopening by January 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Both involve NWS and the USDA as the lead agency, with established eradication methods (Sterile Insect Technique).
- **Differences:** The current situation involves international coordination, which adds complexity and potential delays. The failed reopening in July indicates heightened caution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Pre-existing Eradication Infrastructure:** The presence of COMEXA and SIT increases the likelihood of successful eradication. This evidence increases the probability.
- **Economic Pressure:** Strong economic incentives for both countries to resolve the issue quickly. This evidence increases the probability.
- **USDA Secretary's Positive Comments:** While non-committal, they suggest progress. This evidence slightly increases the probability.
- **Failed July Reopening:** Indicates a higher standard for reopening, suggesting increased caution. This evidence decreases the probability.
- **Time Constraint:** Less than 45 days remain, with potential holiday delays. This evidence decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 65% probability translates to odds of 0.65 / 0.35 ≈ 1.86.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** 
  - Positive evidence (infrastructure, economic pressure, comments) suggests a moderate increase.
  - Negative evidence (failed reopening, time constraint) suggests a moderate decrease.
- **Net Effect:** The positive and negative evidence roughly balance out, leading to a slight downward adjustment from the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The tight timeline and potential for unexpected delays (e.g., new NWS cases) suggest caution.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A new NWS case or bureaucratic delays could prevent reopening.
- **Adjustment:** Given the risks and uncertainties, a conservative adjustment downward is warranted.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is moderately high but tempered by recent setbacks and time constraints.

Final: 60%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes:

**Most relevant reference class**: The 2016 New World Screwworm (NWS) outbreak in Florida Keys
- Duration: ~6 months from detection to eradication (September 2016 to March 2017)
- This suggests a timeline of about 6 months for NWS eradication

**Secondary reference class**: U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade disruptions
- These typically resolve within a few months due to economic pressures
- However, animal disease-related bans can last longer than other trade disruptions

**Tertiary reference class**: Major animal disease import bans (like BSE)
- These can last years, but NWS is different as it's a parasitic insect with established eradication methods

Given these reference classes, and considering the current ban began in May 2025 (with a brief reopening in July), I'll set a prior of **65%** that the ban will be lifted before 2026. This is primarily based on the Florida NWS timeline, adjusted for the international complexity.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Same pest (New World Screwworm)
- Same lead agency (USDA/APHIS)
- Established eradication technology (Sterile Insect Technique)
- Pre-existing cooperative framework (COMEXA) for NWS eradication

**Key differences**:
- International border complexity vs. domestic Florida case
- The failed July reopening attempt (showing higher caution)
- Much larger economic scale (over 1 million cattle annually)
- Only about 45 days remain until the resolution deadline
- Holiday season (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year) falls within the remaining period

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring reopening before 2026**:

1. **USDA Secretary's positive statement (November 4)**
   - P(E|H): ~0.8 (If reopening is imminent, we'd expect positive statements)
   - P(E|~H): ~0.4 (Even if reopening isn't imminent, diplomatic language might be positive)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
   - This moderately increases probability

2. **Pre-existing eradication infrastructure**
   - P(E|H): ~0.9 (If reopening will happen soon, established systems would be a key factor)
   - P(E|~H): ~0.7 (Even without reopening, these systems would still exist)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
   - This slightly increases probability

3. **Economic pressure from both countries**
   - P(E|H): ~0.9 (If reopening happens, economic pressure would be a major driver)
   - P(E|~H): ~0.7 (Economic pressure exists regardless, but might not overcome other factors)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
   - This slightly increases probability

**Evidence against reopening before 2026**:

1. **Failed July reopening attempt**
   - P(E|H): ~0.3 (If reopening happens soon, the July failure would be an anomaly)
   - P(E|~H): ~0.8 (If reopening doesn't happen soon, the July failure would be indicative)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.375
   - This significantly decreases probability

2. **Short timeframe remaining (45 days)**
   - P(E|H): ~0.4 (If reopening happens soon, the tight timeline would be overcome)
   - P(E|~H): ~0.8 (If reopening doesn't happen soon, the timeline would be a key constraint)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
   - This moderately decreases probability

3. **Holiday season bureaucratic slowdowns**
   - P(E|H): ~0.5 (If reopening happens soon, it would overcome holiday delays)
   - P(E|~H): ~0.7 (If reopening doesn't happen, holiday delays would contribute)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.7
   - This slightly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 65% (odds of 65:35 or about 1.86:1)

First update on the failed July reopening:
- Prior odds: 1.86:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 0.375 = 0.6975:1
- Posterior probability: 0.6975/(1+0.6975) ≈ 41%

Second update on the short timeframe remaining:
- Prior odds: 0.6975:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.6975 × 0.5 = 0.34875:1
- Posterior probability: 0.34875/(1+0.34875) ≈ 26%

Third update on USDA Secretary's positive statement:
- Prior odds: 0.34875:1
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.34875 × 2.0 = 0.6975:1
- Posterior probability: 0.6975/(1+0.6975) ≈ 41%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 41%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting the failed July reopening. If that was due to a single isolated case that has since been contained, reopening could happen faster.
- I might be underestimating the economic and political pressure to reopen before year-end.
- The USDA Secretary's statement that "every day we get closer" could indicate more progress than I'm accounting for.

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A regionalization approach could be implemented, allowing cattle from certain Mexican states deemed NWS-free to be imported before 2026.
- The USDA might have already scheduled verification visits that haven't been publicly announced.
- Holiday bureaucracy might be expedited given the economic importance.

**Counterarguments**:
- The July reopening failure likely created extreme caution at USDA, making them unwilling to risk another false start.
- If significant progress had been made, more concrete statements about timelines would likely be forthcoming.
- The lack of specific indicators (like announced verification visits) this late in the year is telling.

After this red-teaming, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 45%, acknowledging I may be slightly underweighting the economic and political pressures for a quick resolution.

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the U.S. response to previous New World Screwworm (NWS) outbreaks. The 2016 NWS outbreak in the Florida Keys is the best modern analogue. In that case, the USDA confirmed the first case in late September 2016 and declared the pest eradicated by late March 2017, a duration of approximately six months.

The current ban was imposed on May 11, 2025. A six-month timeline would suggest a resolution around mid-November 2025. The question asks for resolution before January 1, 2026, which is about 7.5 months after the ban began. Based purely on the Florida timeline, the probability of resolution within 7.5 months would be very high.

However, this situation involves an international border, which adds complexity compared to a domestic outbreak. This suggests a slightly longer timeline might be expected. A reasonable starting point, or prior, would be to anchor on the 6-month domestic resolution time but temper it for international complexity, suggesting a resolution within 7-8 months is likely but not certain.

Let's set the initial prior probability at **60%**. This reflects the high likelihood suggested by the most relevant reference case, with a discount for the added cross-border variable.
Prior Odds = 0.60 / (1 - 0.60) = 1.5.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities to the Florida (2016) base case:**
*   The pest is the same (New World Screwworm).
*   The lead U.S. agency making the decision is the same (USDA/APHIS).
*   The primary eradication technology is the same (Sterile Insect Technique - SIT).

**Key Differences:**
*   **International Border:** This is the most significant difference. A domestic outbreak gives the USDA full control over surveillance and response. Here, the USDA must rely on data and actions from its Mexican counterpart (SENASICA), adding layers of diplomatic, bureaucratic, and verification delays.
*   **Failed Reopening:** The border was reopened on July 7 and re-closed just two days later. This "false start" is a critical deviation from the base case. It indicates that the initial assessment was flawed and will make the USDA far more risk-averse and cautious about a second reopening.
*   **Economic Scale:** The economic pressure is far greater. The U.S.-Mexico cattle trade is worth over a billion dollars annually and is a critical supply chain for the U.S. beef industry. This creates a much stronger incentive for a rapid resolution than the localized Florida outbreak.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the key evidence and its impact on the 60% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The failed reopening in July 2025.**
    *   P(E | H): How likely is a "false start" given the ban is lifted before 2026? It's somewhat unlikely. A quick, successful resolution would more likely follow a smooth process. A hiccup suggests underlying problems.
    *   P(E | ~H): How likely is a "false start" given the ban is *not* lifted before 2026? It's very likely. A failed reopening is a strong indicator of a persistent or poorly understood problem that would cause a long-term ban.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H) / P(E|~H) is significantly less than 1. This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability. It creates a "once bitten, twice shy" dynamic at the USDA, raising the standard of proof required for a new reopening.

*   **Evidence 2: The remaining timeline is short and includes holidays.**
    *   As of mid-November, less than 45 days remain. This period includes the U.S. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's holidays, which typically slow government administrative processes.
    *   P(E | H): For a reopening to occur, all technical verification and administrative approvals must be completed within this short, interrupted window. This is possible, but tight.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the ban is not lifted, it is very likely that no announcement would be made with 45 days to go. Silence is the default.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. The shrinking timeline is evidence against a resolution occurring within the period. This **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Immense, mutual economic pressure.**
    *   P(E | H): The powerful U.S. beef lobby and Mexican cattle producers are pushing for a resolution. This pressure is a primary driver that would make a pre-2026 reopening happen.
    *   P(E | ~H): For the ban to continue despite this pressure, the biosecurity risk must be perceived by the USDA as extremely high, overriding economic concerns.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence **increases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the update from the **Prior Odds of 1.5 (60%)**.

1.  The strongest piece of new evidence is the failed July reopening. This suggests the problem is more complex than the baseline and has made the USDA highly cautious. This warrants a significant downward update. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 0.4 to represent this strong negative signal.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 1.5 × 0.4 = 0.60.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 0.60 / (1 + 0.60) = 37.5%.

2.  Now, let's account for the immense economic pressure, which pushes in the other direction. This is a strong positive factor. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 1.5.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.60 × 1.5 = 0.90.
    *   This brings the probability to 0.90 / (1 + 0.90) = 47.4%.

3.  Finally, we must consider the tight, holiday-filled timeline. This is a logistical hurdle that makes a "Yes" outcome less likely. Let's apply a small negative update with a likelihood ratio of 0.8.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.90 × 0.8 = 0.72.
    *   Final Posterior Probability = 0.72 / (1 + 0.72) ≈ 42%.

The initial optimism from the 6-month base rate is significantly eroded by the demonstrated complexity of this specific case (the July failure) and the logistical constraints of the calendar.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 42% could be too low if the economic and political pressure is so immense that it forces the USDA to accelerate its processes and accept a slightly higher level of risk than I'm modeling. It's possible that all the necessary verification work has already been completed behind the scenes and an announcement is imminent. A "regionalization" agreement, allowing imports from certified NWS-free states, could also be a faster path to a partial reopening that would resolve the question "Yes".

Conversely, my forecast could be too high. The July failure might indicate a much more widespread or persistent NWS problem in Mexico than is publicly known. The USDA's institutional imperative is to prevent the re-introduction of a devastating pest into the U.S. livestock population; they will not be rushed. The risk of being wrong a second time is career-ending for the officials involved. This institutional caution, especially heading into a holiday period, could easily push the final sign-off into January 2026.

The balance of these risks suggests a probability below 50% is appropriate. The path to "No" (delay) is the path of least resistance for a cautious bureaucracy, while the path to "Yes" requires active effort and alignment from all parties within a tight timeframe.

### Final Forecast
The forecast is based on a strong but not perfectly analogous base rate (the 2016 Florida outbreak). This base rate is adjusted downward significantly due to the major negative signal of the failed July reopening, which has increased the level of caution and the burden of proof required by the USDA. The very tight timeline, which includes major holidays, further constrains the window for action. While strong economic pressure creates a powerful incentive for resolution, it may not be enough to overcome the institutional risk aversion and logistical hurdles before the end of the year.

Final: 42%
