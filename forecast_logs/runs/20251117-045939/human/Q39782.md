### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Longest Field Goal per NFL Season (2010–2024):** This is the most direct reference class. Over the last 15 seasons, the longest field goal has ranged from 57 to 66 yards. The median is 61 yards, and the average is 61.1 yards. There is a clear upward trend; the average longest kick from 2020–2024 was 62 yards. This class suggests a baseline expectation in the low 60s.
    *   *Limitations:* This historical data does not account for the significant rule change regarding kicking balls implemented in 2025, nor the demonstrated new level of kicker talent.
2.  **All-Time Longest Regular Season Field Goals (pre-2025):** This class focuses on the extreme tail of the distribution. Before this season, the record was 66 yards (2021), preceded by 64 yards (2013), and several 63-yard kicks. This class establishes the plausible upper bounds of performance under previous conditions, suggesting that kicks of 64+ yards are rare, black-swan-type events.
    *   *Limitations:* This class is a small sample of outliers and may not reflect the new "normal" for maximum distances given recent changes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-02** Cam Little sets a new NFL record with a 68-yard field goal. — ↑ (large) — Establishes a new, high benchmark for the season's longest kick and confirms that the potential shown in preseason is translating to official games.
*   **2025-10-03** (approx.) Reports note that while 50+ yard kicks are more frequent, the overall accuracy from that range is not higher than in 2024. — ↓ (small) — Suggests the K-ball rule change may affect the maximum possible distance for a perfect strike more than it improves average long-range accuracy.
*   **2025-09-29** (approx.) Through Week 4, two field goals of 64 and 65 yards are made, in addition to other long kicks. — ↑ (moderate) — Indicates a league-wide increase in both attempts and successes at extreme distances early in the season, suggesting a new environment for kickers.
*   **2025-08-09** Rookie Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. — ↑ (large) — Demonstrates that a 70-yard distance is physically achievable in game conditions by a current NFL kicker, even if it didn't count officially.
*   **2025-03-25** (approx.) The NFL approves a rule change allowing teams to practice with their designated "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. — ↑ (moderate) — Creates a new mechanism for kickers to "break in" balls, potentially making them fly farther.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Kicker Specialization & Talent:** Kickers are increasingly specialized athletes with access to better coaching and biomechanical analysis. The emergence of a talent like Cam Little, with a demonstrated 70-yard range, significantly raises the ceiling. (Size: Large)
2.  **Rule Change (K-Balls):** The 2025 rule allowing kickers to prepare K-balls all week is a major new factor. A "broken-in" ball is widely believed to be softer and have better flight characteristics, enabling greater distance on a well-struck kick. (Size: Large)
3.  **Environmental Conditions:** High altitude (Denver), warm weather, and the controlled environment of a dome reduce air density and resistance, adding several yards to a kick's potential distance. The probability of a new record increases if a top kicker has an opportunity in these conditions. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Coaching Philosophy & Analytics:** Increased acceptance of analytics has made coaches more aggressive in attempting long field goals, especially at the end of a half or game when a miss has minimal negative consequences. This increases the number of opportunities for a record-breaking kick. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Game Situation:** A record attempt is almost exclusively a low-risk, end-of-half/game scenario. The specific confluence of field position, time remaining, and score is required to even attempt a kick of 65+ yards. (Size: Small, but acts as a necessary gatekeeper)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **A New Record Already Exists:** The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the reference class because the all-time NFL record has already been broken (68 yards). The forecast is no longer about *if* the old record of 66 yards will be broken, but if the *new* record of 68 will be surpassed.
*   **A New, Game-Changing Kicker:** The reference period did not include Cam Little, a rookie who has proven he has a 70-yard range in game-like conditions and has already set the NFL record. His presence alone changes the probability distribution for the maximum possible distance.
*   **Systemic Rule Change:** Unlike previous seasons, a structural change (the K-ball rule) is in effect for all 32 teams. This creates a league-wide environment more conducive to long-distance kicks, rather than relying solely on an individual kicker's talent or favorable weather.
*   **Early Season Precedent:** The high frequency of 64+ yard kicks in the first month of the season, culminating in the 68-yard record, suggests a step-change in what is considered a makeable distance, not just a single outlier event.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around 62-63 yards, based on the 2020-2024 reference class, with a right-skewed tail extending towards the old record of 66. Equivalent n might be ~10-15 observations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) A new NFL record of 68 yards has already been set this season.
    *   (↑ Large) A specific kicker (Cam Little) has demonstrated a 70-yard range in preseason and holds the new 68-yard record.
    *   (↑ Moderate) A new rule allows kickers to "break in" K-balls, which is a plausible mechanism for increased distance.
    *   (↑ Small) Multiple other kicks of 64+ yards have been made this season, suggesting a league-wide trend.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to a significant upward revision. The posterior distribution should be centered much higher than the prior, with its mode likely at 68 yards and a substantial probability mass on values of 69 yards or greater.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any field goal attempt of 65+ yards, even if missed.
    *   Games played by strong-legged kickers (Little, Tucker, etc.) in Denver or in domes.
    *   Coach/kicker interviews explicitly mentioning a willingness to attempt a record-breaking kick if the situation arises.
    *   Favorable weather forecasts (warm, low wind, no precipitation) for games in opportune locations.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The current record of 68 yards holding through the end of the regular season.
    *   Key long-range kickers (e.g., Cam Little) suffering injuries.
    *   A streak of misses on attempts over 60 yards, potentially making coaches more conservative.
    *   Worsening weather conditions across the league as the season moves into December and January.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Small Sample Size of Attempts:** Record-breaking attempts are extremely rare. The final outcome depends on a handful of opportunities materializing over the rest of the season.
*   **Role of Luck:** A kick of 68+ yards requires not just skill but also a perfect strike, ideal ball contact, and favorable wind/weather at that exact moment. This element of randomness is high.
*   **The Record is Already High:** Surpassing a 68-yard kick is a monumental challenge. While a 69 or 70-yard kick is plausible, the marginal difficulty increases significantly with each yard. The season may have already seen its peak.
*   **Uncertainty of K-Ball Effect:** The precise impact of the "broken-in" K-balls is still anecdotal. Its actual effect on distance may be smaller than perceived, or it may have already produced its maximum impact with the 68-yarder.

**Final Research Summary:** The 2025 season represents a paradigm shift for long-distance field goals, driven by a major rule change and the emergence of a kicker with a demonstrated 70-yard range. With the NFL record already broken at 68 yards, the final longest kick of the season is highly likely to be at or above this new benchmark.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the longest field goals per NFL season from 2010 to 2024, with a median of 61 yards and an average of 61.1 yards. The recent trend (2020–2024) shows an average of 62 yards, indicating a slight upward trend. This base rate is chosen because it reflects historical performance and trends in field goal distances.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that it involves NFL field goals, but it differs significantly due to the new rule allowing kickers to practice with K-balls and the emergence of a kicker like Cam Little, who has demonstrated the ability to kick 70 yards. These differences suggest a shift towards longer possible field goals.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Cam Little's 68-yard field goal sets a new benchmark, suggesting longer kicks are more likely (↑ large).
   - The preseason 70-yard kick by Cam Little indicates that such distances are achievable (↑ large).
   - The K-ball rule change potentially increases kick distances (↑ moderate).
   - The frequency of 64+ yard kicks early in the season suggests a league-wide trend (↑ moderate).
   - The lack of increased accuracy for 50+ yard kicks compared to 2024 suggests that while longer kicks are possible, they are not necessarily more accurate (↓ small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 62-63 yards, the evidence strongly supports an upward shift. The new record of 68 yards and the potential for 70-yard kicks suggest a posterior distribution centered around 68-69 yards, with a significant probability of reaching or exceeding 70 yards.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes the possibility of a new record-breaking kick in favorable conditions (e.g., high altitude, dome stadiums). The potential for injuries or conservative coaching could limit attempts. However, given the current evidence, the likelihood of a record-breaking kick remains high.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the evidence and Bayesian updating, the forecasted percentiles for the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season are as follows:

P10: 66  
P20: 67  
P40: 68  
P60: 69  
P80: 70  
P90: 71

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two key reference classes to establish my prior:
- **Recent NFL seasons (2020-2024)**: The average longest field goal per season was 62 yards
- **All-time longest field goals**: Before 2025, the record was 66 yards (Justin Tucker, 2021)

For my prior distribution, I'll center around 63 yards with a right-skewed distribution extending to 67 yards, reflecting the historical pattern where each season typically produces at least one exceptional kick near the all-time record.

Mean: 63 yards
Median: 62 yards
Standard deviation: ~2.5 yards

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The physical limitations of human kicking ability remain constant
- Game situations that allow for extremely long attempts remain relatively rare
- Environmental factors (altitude, weather) continue to play a similar role

**Key differences:**
- The 2025 K-ball rule change allows kickers to practice with game balls all week
- A new record of 68 yards has already been set this season by Cam Little
- Little demonstrated a 70-yard capability in preseason
- Multiple 64+ yard kicks have already occurred early in the 2025 season

These differences strongly suggest a significant upward shift in the distribution.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Cam Little's 68-yard regular season record (very strong, LR ≈ 10:1 favoring 68+ yards)
- Little's 70-yard preseason kick (moderate, LR ≈ 3:1 favoring 68+ yards)
- K-ball rule change (moderate, LR ≈ 2:1 favoring higher values)
- Multiple 64+ yard kicks early in season (moderate, LR ≈ 2:1 favoring higher values)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- No improvement in overall 50+ yard accuracy rates (weak, LR ≈ 1.2:1 favoring status quo)
- Physical limitations of kicking (moderate constraint on extreme values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 63 yards, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on Cam Little's 68-yard record:**
- Prior: centered at 63 yards
- Likelihood: strongly favors 68+ yards (LR ≈ 10:1)
- Posterior: shifts significantly upward, with median around 68 yards

This single piece of evidence dramatically shifts the distribution because:
1. It's already happened this season (so P(longest kick ≥ 68) = 1)
2. It establishes a new proven capability level

After incorporating the additional evidence (70-yard preseason kick, rule change, multiple long kicks), the posterior distribution becomes:
- Centered at 68-69 yards
- Right-skewed with significant probability mass at 70-71 yards
- Left-bounded at 68 yards (since we know this has already occurred)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting Cam Little's preseason 70-yarder, which occurred under less pressure
- I might be underestimating the rarity of perfect conditions needed for record kicks
- The season is only partially complete; weather will worsen in December/January

**Alternative perspective:**
A more conservative forecast would argue that 68 yards is already exceptional, and the probability of exceeding it this season is modest. The physical limitations of kicking suggest diminishing returns for each additional yard.

**Tail risks:**
- Upside: Perfect scenario in Denver's altitude with a strong-legged kicker could produce a 71-72 yard kick
- Downside: None below 68 yards since this has already occurred

After this consideration, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for uncertainty in the extreme upper range.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 69
P80: 70
P90: 71

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the longest field goal made in each of the most recent NFL seasons. According to the research report, the average longest kick from 2020–2024 was 62 yards, with the all-time record prior to 2025 being 66 yards (set in 2021). This suggests a prior distribution centered around 62-63 yards, with a strong right skew where values above 66 are exceptionally rare. The variance is relatively small, with most seasons' longest kicks falling between 60 and 64 yards.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the historical reference class for several reasons:
*   **Rule Change:** A new rule allows teams to practice with their designated "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. This is a plausible physical mechanism for increasing maximum kicking distance, as a "broken-in" ball may have better flight characteristics.
*   **Demonstrated New Ceiling:** A rookie kicker, Cam Little, made a 70-yard field goal in the preseason. This provides concrete evidence that the achievable distance for at least one kicker under game-like conditions is significantly higher than the old record.
*   **Existing New Record:** The most critical difference is that the all-time NFL record has *already been broken* during the 2025 season. Cam Little kicked a 68-yard field goal on November 2nd. This means the longest field goal of the season cannot be less than 68 yards, fundamentally changing the problem from "What will the longest kick be?" to "Will the new 68-yard record be broken again?"

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The historical base rate is almost entirely superseded by the powerful evidence from the current season.

*   **Evidence 1: New NFL record of 68 yards.** This is the single most important piece of information. It sets a hard floor for the final value. The question is now about the probability distribution for values of 68 or greater. This evidence has an overwhelming likelihood ratio in favor of a much higher forecast compared to the prior.
*   **Evidence 2: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick.** This strongly suggests that the 68-yard record is not an unassailable fluke. It makes a 69 or 70-yard kick a plausible outcome, not just a theoretical possibility. This evidence dramatically "fattens" the right tail of the distribution, making outcomes of 69+ yards much more likely than they would be otherwise.
*   **Evidence 3: Multiple 64+ yard kicks early in the season.** This indicates that the increase in kicking distance is a league-wide phenomenon, likely driven by the K-ball rule change, and not just isolated to one kicker. This increases the number of potential kickers who might get an opportunity to break the new record.
*   **Counter-Evidence: Worsening Weather.** The season is now in mid-November. For teams playing outdoors in northern climates, weather conditions will deteriorate, reducing the number of opportunities for record-breaking kicks. However, many games are still played in domes or warm-weather cities, mitigating this factor.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Our prior distribution centered around 62 yards is completely overwhelmed by the evidence. The new information effectively forces us to create a new posterior distribution conditional on the fact that the longest kick is already 68 yards.

*   **New Starting Point:** The distribution must have zero probability mass below 68 yards. The mode and median of the distribution must be at least 68.
*   **Estimating the Tail:** The core task is to estimate the probability that the 68-yard record is broken again in the remaining ~7 weeks of the regular season. Given the demonstrated 70-yard capability of Cam Little, the league-wide trend, and the number of games remaining in controlled environments, there is a significant chance of another record. I estimate a ~40% probability that the record is broken again.
*   **Posterior Shape:** I will model the posterior as a discrete probability distribution:
    *   P(Longest kick = 68 yards) = 60%
    *   P(Longest kick = 69 yards) = 25%
    *   P(Longest kick = 70 yards) = 10%
    *   P(Longest kick ≥ 71 yards) = 5%
*   This distribution has its median at 68 yards but incorporates the substantial possibility of a new record, anchored by the 70-yard preseason kick.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the idea that the factors driving longer kicks this season will persist and create another record-breaking opportunity.

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The 68-yard kick by Little was the "perfect storm"—an ideal situation with a perfectly struck, broken-in ball that is unlikely to be replicated. Coaches may become more conservative, and the increasing pressure of the playoff race could reduce willingness to attempt low-probability kicks. In this scenario, the record remains at 68, and my 40% estimate of it being broken is far too high.
*   **Rebuttal:** The K-ball rule is a systemic change affecting all 32 teams. The psychological barrier of the old 66-yard record has been shattered. With multiple kickers showing 60+ yard range, an opportunity for a record attempt could arise for someone other than Little. The 40% chance reflects a balance between the high potential demonstrated this year and the inherent difficulty and rarity of such an event.
*   **Adjustment:** The distribution seems reasonable. It correctly identifies 68 as the most likely outcome while giving significant weight to the very real possibility of a new record, primarily at 69 or 70 yards. No major adjustment is needed.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the posterior distribution where P(68)=60%, P(69)=25%, P(70)=10%, and P(≥71)=5%:
*   The cumulative probability P(≤68) is 60%.
*   The cumulative probability P(≤69) is 85%.
*   The cumulative probability P(≤70) is 95%.

This leads to the following percentiles.

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 68
P80: 69
P90: 70
