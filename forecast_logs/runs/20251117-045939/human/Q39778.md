### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the standard process for selecting a COP host, and what are the historical precedents for contested bids, especially within the Western European and Others Group (WEOG)?** This will help establish the base rate for consensus failure.
*   **Q2: What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the Australian bid?** This involves assessing its political narrative (co-hosting with Pacific nations), diplomatic support within WEOG, and Australia's current climate policy standing.
*   **Q3: What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the Turkish bid?** This requires understanding Turkey's motivation, its diplomatic leverage, its relationship with other WEOG members, and its climate credentials.
*   **Q4: What is the nature and intensity of the current deadlock?** This involves analyzing the most recent diplomatic exchanges and statements to gauge the likelihood of either side conceding.
*   **Q5: How plausible is the default option (Bonn, Germany)?** This question explores whether the default is a genuine possibility or merely a procedural threat, and what the implications of such an outcome would be for the parties involved.
*   **Q6: Who are the key decision-makers within WEOG, and what are their likely preferences?** Understanding the positions of influential members like the EU bloc, the US, and the UK is crucial to evaluating the pressure on the two bidders.

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `UNFCCC COP host selection process consensus`, `history of contested COP host bids`, `WEOG COP host rotation history`, `precedent for COP held in Bonn due to no consensus`.
*   **Q2:** `Australia COP31 bid support Pacific nations`, `EU position on Australia COP31 bid`, `Australia climate change policy 2025 NDC`, `support for Adelaide as COP31 host city`.
*   **Q3:** `Turkey COP31 bid rationale`, `Turkey climate policy Paris Agreement`, `Turkey geopolitical relations with EU`, `Turkey support within WEOG for COP31`.
*   **Q4:** `Australia Turkey COP31 negotiations`, `Erdoğan Albanese COP31 discussion`, `COP30 Brazil negotiations COP31 host`, `Turkey proposal co-host COP31`.
*   **Q5:** `UNFCCC secretariat procedure for default host`, `Germany position on hosting COP31`, `likelihood of COP31 in Bonn`.
*   **Q6:** `Western European and Others Group (WEOG) member list`, `US position on COP31 host`, `UK climate diplomacy COP31`, `EU statement on COP31 host selection`.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The core of this forecast is the tension between Australia's stronger narrative and broader support versus the procedural power of Turkey's veto in a consensus-based system. The provided sources, all dated within the last year and concentrated in November 2025, confirm a hard deadlock. Australia's bid, centered on amplifying the voices of climate-vulnerable Pacific nations, has strong diplomatic appeal. However, Turkey has invested significant political capital and, as of mid-November 2025, its President has personally rebuffed a request from the Australian Prime Minister to withdraw. This is not low-level diplomatic maneuvering; it is a firm stance from the highest level. The rejection of a Turkish-proposed compromise (co-presidency) by Australia indicates that neither side is willing to concede. This persistence significantly elevates the probability of the default outcome: the conference being held in Bonn, Germany. While Bonn is a "reluctant" host, it is the established procedural backstop for exactly this kind of diplomatic failure.

**4. Drafting the Comprehensive Answer:**

The synthesized findings will now be structured into the required brief format, focusing on the key mechanisms, recent evidence of the deadlock, and the implications for the probability of each outcome.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Contested Bids for Major UN Conferences:** It is not uncommon for multiple countries within a regional group to express interest in hosting. However, these contests are typically resolved through diplomatic negotiations well before a final deadline. A public, high-level deadlock lasting until the final decision-making conference (like COP30) is rare. In such rare cases of intractable disputes, failure to reach consensus becomes a significant possibility. A ballpark estimate might be: **Candidate A wins (45%), Candidate B wins (45%), Process fails/default option (10%)**.
*   **WEOG COP Host Selections:** The WEOG group hosts every five years. Past hosts include the UK (COP26), Spain (COP25, relocated from Chile), France (COP21), and Denmark (COP15). These are all core European nations. A bid from Australia (with the Pacific) or Turkey is atypical for this group. The base rate for a non-European WEOG member hosting is very low, making this situation unusual from the start.
*   **Limitations:** These base rates are rough estimates. The consensus mechanism is the critical feature; unlike a vote, it gives any single member a veto. This means a determined holdout can single-handedly force the default outcome, making historical precedents less reliable if the actors' motivations are sufficiently strong.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-17** Australia downplays a Turkish proposal for a shared presidency. **↓ Australia/Turkey, ↑ Germany** — This rejection of a compromise path signals the deadlock is hardening, making a consensus failure more likely.
*   **2025-11-15** Australia's Climate Minister travels to COP30 for an "eleventh-hour" push to secure the bid. **↑ Australia** — Shows Australia is still actively lobbying and believes it can win, but also highlights the urgency and difficulty.
*   **2025-11-14** A Guardian report details the "tug-of-war," framing Germany as a "reluctant" default host. **↑ Germany** — Reinforces that the default option is a real, albeit undesirable, outcome being actively discussed.
*   **2025-11-13** Turkey's President Erdoğan explicitly tells Australian PM Albanese he will not withdraw Turkey's bid. **↓ Australia, ↑ Turkey/Germany** — A direct, high-level refusal is a very strong signal that Turkey will not concede, making a consensus on Australia impossible unless Turkey reverses course.
*   **2025-09-08** The Australian government formally outlines its bid, emphasizing the partnership with Pacific nations. **↑ Australia** — This established the strong, climate-justice narrative of the Australian bid.
*   **2024-11-01** South Australia formally submits Adelaide's bid to the Commonwealth government. **↑ Australia** — This marked the official start of the sub-national and national commitment to hosting.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Consensus Requirement:** The single most important mechanism. Any WEOG member, including Turkey, can veto a proposal. This gives Turkey immense leverage, regardless of the number of countries supporting Australia. (Large)
*   **Geopolitical Support:** Australia likely has broader, albeit perhaps shallow, support from major WEOG players (e.g., US, UK, Canada, EU bloc) due to the compelling Pacific partnership narrative. Turkey's more complex relationships with the EU may limit its active support. (Moderate)
*   **High-Level Political Capital:** Both the Australian PM and the Turkish President are now personally invested. Backing down would be a domestic and international political loss, making concessions difficult. (Moderate)
*   **Narrative Strength:** Australia's "co-host with the Pacific" narrative is powerful and aligns with the COP's climate justice goals. Turkey's narrative is less distinct. This influences diplomatic preference but cannot override the consensus rule. (Moderate)
*   **Plausibility of Default:** The existence of a capable, pre-determined default host in Bonn (home of the UNFCCC secretariat) makes the "no consensus" outcome viable. It is not a catastrophic failure, but a procedural one. (Moderate)
*   **Diplomatic Linkages:** The dispute may be used by Turkey as leverage in unrelated diplomatic matters with Australia or other WEOG members. The true motivation for its intransigence is not fully public. (Potentially large, but uncertain).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Atypical Bidders:** Both Australia and Turkey are outside the typical European core of WEOG hosts, making this an unusual contest from the outset.
*   **Public and Protracted Deadlock:** Most hosting contests are resolved behind closed doors. This dispute has escalated to public, presidential-level statements of refusal just before the deadline, which is highly unusual.
*   **Innovative Co-Host Model:** Australia's proposal to co-host with Pacific Island nations is a novel approach, adding a unique political and moral dimension to its bid.
*   **Veto by a Geopolitically Distinct Member:** Turkey's unique geopolitical position and interests, differing from the core EU/Anglosphere members of WEOG, may be a key reason why typical diplomatic pressure to concede is failing.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, based on Australia's stronger narrative and likely broader support, would have favored Australia but acknowledged the risk of deadlock. E.g., **Australia 55%, Turkey 25%, Germany 20%** (equivalent n=10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ Australia (Large):** President Erdoğan's direct refusal to PM Albanese is a powerful piece of evidence that Turkey will not yield. This severely damages the path

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option based on the given context and research report.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the historical context of WEOG hosting, non-European hosts are rare. However, Australia's bid is strong, with a compelling narrative of co-hosting with Pacific nations. Prior probability: 30%.
- **Turkey**: Turkey is the only other official bidder from the WEOG group. Its geopolitical position and the President's firm stance suggest a strong commitment. Prior probability: 25%.
- **Germany**: As the default host city, Bonn, Germany, is always a fallback option if no consensus is reached. Prior probability: 20%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is unlikely as Australia is the primary bidder with Pacific nations as partners, not competitors. Prior probability: 5%.
- **Other**: This includes any unexpected outcome outside the main contenders. Prior probability: 20%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: Similar to past hosts in terms of diplomatic support but different due to the co-hosting model with Pacific nations.
- **Turkey**: Similar in being a WEOG member but different due to its geopolitical distinctiveness and firm stance.
- **Germany**: Similar as a default option, different due to the current deadlock making it more plausible.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely given the partnership model.
- **Other**: Unlikely unless a new bid emerges unexpectedly.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: The strong narrative and active lobbying increase its likelihood, but the deadlock reduces it. Likelihood: Moderate.
- **Turkey**: The President's refusal to concede increases its likelihood. Likelihood: High.
- **Germany**: The deadlock and procedural fallback increase its likelihood. Likelihood: High.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: No evidence supports this as a standalone bid. Likelihood: Low.
- **Other**: No current evidence supports an unexpected outcome. Likelihood: Low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 30/70. Likelihood ratio = Moderate/High. Posterior odds = Lower than prior.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 25/75. Likelihood ratio = High/Moderate. Posterior odds = Higher than prior.
- **Germany**: Prior odds = 20/80. Likelihood ratio = High/Moderate. Posterior odds = Higher than prior.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Prior odds = 5/95. Likelihood ratio = Low/High. Posterior odds = Lower than prior.
- **Other**: Prior odds = 20/80. Likelihood ratio = Low/High. Posterior odds = Lower than prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Consider the possibility of a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: Turkey or Australia might concede unexpectedly.
- **Adjustments**: Increase Germany's probability due to the deadlock.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the updated likelihoods.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 25%  
Turkey: 30%  
Germany: 35%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 5%  
Other: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the current deadlock, the strength of Turkey's position, and the procedural fallback to Germany.

# Forecasting COP 31 Host Country for 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option based on the WEOG rotation and historical patterns:

**Australia (Prior: 35%)**
- Australia has a formal bid with significant preparation
- Co-hosting with Pacific nations creates a compelling narrative
- Adelaide has been designated as the preferred host city with funding commitments

**Turkey (Prior: 35%)**
- Turkey has an official bid with Antalya as the likely host city
- As a WEOG member, Turkey has equal standing procedurally
- Turkey has invested political capital in this bid

**Germany (Prior: 20%)**
- Germany is the default host (Bonn) if consensus fails
- UNFCCC headquarters are in Bonn, making it a procedurally viable fallback
- Historical precedent exists for default hosting when consensus fails

**Another Pacific Island Nation (Prior: 5%)**
- While mentioned as co-hosts with Australia, they are not WEOG members
- No independent bid from a Pacific nation is mentioned
- Would require a procedural exception to the regional rotation

**Other (Prior: 5%)**
- Covers any other WEOG member stepping in late
- Accounts for potential procedural changes or unexpected developments
- Historically rare but not impossible

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The WEOG rotation is being followed as expected
- The process involves formal bids from member countries
- The decision requires consensus among WEOG members

**Key differences:**
- The deadlock appears unusually intense with high-level involvement (presidents/prime ministers)
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations is innovative
- Turkey's firm stance and rejection of compromise is atypical
- The timeline is compressed with "eleventh-hour" negotiations

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for Australia:**
- Strong narrative around Pacific partnership aligns with climate justice goals (P(E|H) high)
- Formal government commitment and funding from South Australia (P(E|H) high)
- Climate Minister actively lobbying at COP30 (P(E|H) moderate)
- Likely support from major WEOG players (US, UK, EU) (P(E|H) moderate)

**Evidence for Turkey:**
- President Erdoğan personally refused to withdraw the bid (P(E|H) very high)
- Proposed a compromise of co-presidency (P(E|H) high)
- Has procedural veto power in a consensus system (P(E|H) high)

**Evidence for Germany:**
- Described as a "reluctant" default host in recent reporting (P(E|H) high)
- The deadlock is hardening with compromise attempts failing (P(E|H) high)
- The consensus requirement makes this outcome increasingly likely (P(E|H) moderate)

**Evidence against Pacific Islands or Other:**
- No independent bids mentioned (P(E|~H) high)
- Would require procedural exceptions (P(E|~H) high)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

**Update for Australia:**
- Prior: 35%
- Key evidence: Erdoğan's direct refusal to Albanese
  - P(Refusal|Australia wins) = 0.1 (very unlikely to see this if Australia will win)
  - P(Refusal|Australia doesn't win) = 0.8 (highly likely to see this if Australia won't win)
  - Likelihood ratio = 0.1/0.8 = 0.125
- Prior odds: 0.35/0.65 = 0.538
- Posterior odds: 0.538 × 0.125 = 0.067
- Posterior probability: 0.067/(1+0.067) ≈ 6.3%

Additional evidence:
- Australia's rejection of Turkey's compromise proposal further reduces chances
- The "eleventh-hour" push suggests Australia recognizes its weakening position
- Adjust to ~15% accounting for possible diplomatic breakthroughs

**Update for Turkey:**
- Prior: 35%
- Key evidence: Turkey's proposal for shared presidency
  - This shows flexibility but also determination to remain involved
  - Likelihood ratio moderately favors Turkey
- Additional evidence: Presidential-level commitment suggests Turkey won't back down
- Adjust to ~25% accounting for potential diplomatic pressure from other WEOG members

**Update for Germany:**
- Prior: 20%
- Key evidence: Hardening deadlock and failed compromise attempts
  - P(Failed compromise|Germany hosts) = 0.9 (very likely to see failed compromise if Germany will host)
  - P(Failed compromise|Germany doesn't host) = 0.3 (less likely if consensus will be reached)
  - Likelihood ratio = 0.9/0.3 = 3
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 3 = 0.75
- Posterior probability: 0.75/(1+0.75) ≈ 43%

Additional evidence:
- The Guardian report explicitly framing Germany as a "reluctant" but real option
- The consensus mechanism giving Turkey effective veto power
- Adjust to ~50% given the intensity and high-level nature of the deadlock

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the significance of public statements, which could be negotiating tactics
- Diplomatic breakthroughs often happen at the last minute and behind closed doors
- The research doesn't provide insight into potential back-channel negotiations
- The consensus mechanism might be more flexible in practice than in theory

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could extract concessions in exchange for supporting Australia
- A third WEOG member could emerge as a compromise candidate
- The UNFCCC could modify procedures to break the deadlock
- The co-hosting model could evolve to include both Australia and Turkey

**Adjustments:**
- Increase Australia's probability slightly to account for possible last-minute diplomatic breakthroughs
- Maintain Germany's high probability given the structural advantage of being the default option
- Slightly increase "Other" to account for creative diplomatic solutions

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:

Australia: 18%
Turkey: 25%
Germany: 50%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 5%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 18%
Turkey: 25%
Germany: 50%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 5%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The appropriate base rate is the outcome of contested bids for hosting major UN conferences that require regional group consensus. While most bids are resolved diplomatically, a public and protracted deadlock is rare. In such rare cases, the failure to reach consensus becomes a significant possibility. A reasonable prior for a two-bidder contest with a default option would be:

*   **Bidder A (Australia): 45%** - Assumes a slightly stronger initial position due to narrative.
*   **Bidder B (Turkey): 40%** - A strong contender capable of blocking consensus.
*   **Default Option (Germany): 15%** - Represents the non-negligible chance of consensus failure.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation: 0%** - This is part of the Australian bid, not a separate one.
*   **Other: 0%** - No other bids have been tabled.

This prior reflects that a negotiated outcome is most common, but the consensus mechanism creates a real possibility of deadlock.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case differs from a typical base rate scenario in several critical ways:

*   **Consensus is a Veto:** The decision mechanism is not a majority vote but requires consensus. This gives Turkey, even if it has less widespread support, the power to block Australia's bid indefinitely, fundamentally increasing the probability of the default outcome (Germany).
*   **High-Level Political Commitment:** The dispute has escalated to direct communication between the Turkish President and the Australian Prime Minister. This level of personal political investment makes it much harder for either side to back down without losing face, hardening the deadlock.
*   **Atypical Bidders:** Both Australia and Turkey are on the geographic and political periphery of the traditional WEOG power base (Western Europe/North America). This may mean that standard diplomatic pressures are less effective, particularly on Turkey, which often pursues a foreign policy independent of the main WEOG bloc.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Several key pieces of evidence from the research report allow for updating the prior probabilities.

*   **Evidence A: Australia's bid is a partnership with Pacific nations.**
    *   This evidence has a high likelihood if Australia wins (P(E|H_Aus)), as it's the core of their popular narrative. It has a low likelihood if Turkey wins (P(E|H_Tur)). This evidence strongly increases Australia's probability *relative to Turkey's*.

*   **Evidence B: Turkey's President Erdoğan personally told Australia's PM Albanese that Turkey will not withdraw its bid (Nov 13, 2025).**
    *   This is extremely strong evidence. The likelihood of this direct, high-level refusal is **very low** if Australia is going to win (as it would require a swift and public reversal by Erdoğan).
    *   The likelihood of this evidence is **high** if Turkey wins OR if Germany wins (as this is the primary action that creates the deadlock leading to the default).
    *   This evidence dramatically decreases the probability of an Australian victory.

*   **Evidence C: Australia downplayed a Turkish proposal for a shared presidency (Nov 17, 2025).**
    *   This rejection of a compromise path has a **high likelihood** if the outcome is a continued deadlock resulting in Germany hosting.
    *   It has a **medium likelihood** if Australia believes it can still win outright.
    *   It has a **low likelihood** if a Turkish victory is imminent.
    *   This evidence reinforces the deadlock scenario, further increasing the probability for Germany.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update based on the strongest piece of evidence: Erdoğan's refusal.

*   **Prior Odds:** Let's consider Australia vs. Not-Australia (Turkey + Germany). The prior odds are 45 / (40 + 15) = 45 / 55 ≈ 0.82 to 1 in favor of Australia.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence (Erdoğan's refusal) is much more likely if Not-Australia wins than if Australia wins. Let's estimate it's at least 5 times more likely (a conservative estimate). The likelihood ratio P(E|~H) / P(E|H) is ~5.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × (1 / Likelihood Ratio) ≈ 0.82 / 5 ≈ 0.16.
*   **Posterior Probability:** This new odds of 0.16 corresponds to a probability for Australia of 0.16 / (1 + 0.16) ≈ 14%.

This shows a massive shift away from Australia. The remaining ~86% must be distributed between Turkey and Germany. The rejection of compromise by *both* sides (Evidence C) suggests the deadlock is the most stable outcome. Therefore, Germany's probability should increase the most, as it is the direct result of the deadlock. Turkey's probability also increases as they are demonstrating their resolve, but their path to achieving full consensus is difficult. This leads to a posterior where Germany is the most likely outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast places Germany as the most likely host. A key vulnerability in this forecast is underestimating the power of last-minute, backroom diplomacy at COP30.

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Major WEOG powers (US, EU, UK) could place immense diplomatic or economic pressure on Turkey to concede, perhaps in exchange for a significant concession on an unrelated issue. In this scenario, Australia would win. The public nature of Erdoğan's refusal makes this difficult, but not impossible.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2:** Australia, realizing its bid is doomed, could concede at the last minute to avoid the "embarrassment" of a consensus failure, handing the win to Turkey.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, the evidence of both sides rejecting compromises as of mid-November 2025 suggests that positions have hardened beyond the point of a simple concession. The path of least resistance for diplomats is to let the established default procedure take over. The "reluctant" host status of Germany is precisely for this scenario; it is the designed-in solution to an intractable problem.

Considering these alternatives, I will keep a non-trivial probability on both Australia and Turkey, but the deadlock-to-Germany path remains the central and most probable forecast.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updating process, the initial 45/40/15 prior shifts dramatically. Germany becomes the most probable outcome due to the intractable deadlock. Turkey is the second most likely, as they are the active party creating the block and could win if Australia concedes. Australia is now the least likely of the three, as it requires Turkey to reverse a high-level public statement. "Another Pacific Island Nation" and "Other" remain highly improbable.

*   **Germany:** 50% (The default outcome of a persistent deadlock)
*   **Turkey:** 30% (Could win if Australia concedes, or a grand bargain is struck)
*   **Australia:** 18% (Requires a major diplomatic reversal from Turkey)
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** 1% (Extremely unlikely to host separately from the Australian bid)
*   **Other:** 1% (No other bids are known or likely to emerge this late)

The sum is 100%.

### Output Format

Australia: 18%
Turkey: 30%
Germany: 50%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 1%
