### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent La Niña Winters (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23):** This class represents recent climate conditions under the same ENSO phase. During these years, global temperatures were suppressed relative to the long-term trend but still ranked among the warmest on record. The peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec were likely in the **0.8°C to 1.1°C** range above the 1991-2020 baseline. This class is useful for its similar primary driver (La Niña) but may underestimate the current baseline warmth.
2.  **Recent Record Warm Years (2023, 2024):** This class captures the upper bound of what is possible in the current climate. 2023, driven by a strong El Niño, set astounding records. The October 2023 monthly anomaly was +0.85°C, and daily peaks would have been significantly higher, likely in the **1.2°C to 1.5°C** range. This class is a poor direct match due to the opposing ENSO state but provides a ceiling for plausible outcomes.
3.  **All Nov/Dec periods in the ERA5 era (post-2015):** This class captures the modern, rapidly warming climate, averaging across different ENSO states. The average peak daily anomaly would fall between the other two classes, likely in the **1.0°C to 1.3°C** range. Its breadth is a strength, but it lacks specificity for the current La Niña conditions.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** CPC issues La Niña Advisory, confirming conditions are present and favored to continue through winter. ↓ — The primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period is officially in place and active.
*   **2025-11-13** Forecasts indicate a 61% chance of transition to ENSO-neutral in Jan-Mar 2026. ↓ — This suggests the La Niña's cooling influence will be at or near its peak during the Nov-Dec 2025 resolution period.
*   **2025-11-06** Copernicus reports October 2025 was the third-warmest on record (+0.70°C anomaly). ↓ — While still very warm, this is a significant step down from the record-shattering anomalies of 2023 (+0.85°C) and confirms a cooling trend relative to peak heat.
*   **2025-10-XX** Provided chart shows the 2025 daily anomaly (dark red line) tracking consistently below 2023 and 2024 levels in recent months. ↓ — Visual evidence corroborates that 2025 is on a cooler trajectory than the two previous record-setting years.
*   **2025-02-06** Copernicus reported January 2025 was the warmest on record despite an emerging La Niña. ↑ — This early-year data highlights the immense underlying warmth in the climate system, which can counteract La Niña's cooling effect.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** The dominant short-term driver. La Niña promotes cooling by bringing colder, deep ocean water to the surface in the equatorial Pacific. Its current presence is the primary downward pressure on the global anomaly. (Size: Moderate to Large).
2.  **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The inexorable upward trend in baseline temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions. This ensures that even a "cool" year by recent standards is exceptionally warm in the historical context. (Size: Large).
3.  **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of excess heat. Record-high OHC outside the equatorial Pacific acts as a massive heat reservoir, releasing warmth into the atmosphere and buffering the cooling effects of La Niña. (Size: Moderate to Large).
4.  **Short-term Weather Variability:** The question resolves on a *daily peak*. A specific weather pattern, such as a large-scale heatwave over a major landmass (e.g., Siberia, North America), can cause a significant short-term spike in the global average, independent of the broader climate state. (Size: Moderate).
5.  **Aerosols & Water Vapor:** The absence of a recent major stratospheric-aerosol-injecting volcanic eruption (like Pinatubo) removes a potential cooling factor. Lingering stratospheric water vapor from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption may still be exerting a minor warming influence. (Size: Small).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Tug-of-War Dynamics:** This period is defined by a conflict between a clear cooling signal (La Niña) and unprecedented background heat. Unlike the 2020-2022 La Niña, this event is occurring immediately after a powerful El Niño and in a world with significantly higher OHC.
*   **"Weak" La Niña:** Multiple sources describe the current event as "weak." This implies its cooling influence will be less potent than a moderate or strong event, allowing the underlying warming trend to play a more dominant role.
*   **Extreme Non-ENSO Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs):** As noted in early 2025 reports, SSTs in many ocean basins remain at or near record levels. This widespread marine warmth provides a strong floor for global air temperatures, limiting how much La Niña can cool the planet.
*   **Recency of Extreme Heat:** The climate system is still shedding the immense heat accumulated during the 2023-2024 El Niño. This thermal inertia means the atmosphere has not yet fully equilibrated to the new La Niña state.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be centered on the peak anomalies observed during the recent 2020-2022 La Niña period, but adjusted slightly upward for the background warming trend. A distribution centered around **1.05°C** with moderate confidence (equivalent n≈10) seems appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** Confirmed La Niña is present and active, with recent monthly data (+0.70°C) showing a clear cooling from 2023/2024 peaks.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The La Niña is consistently described as "weak," limiting its potential cooling power.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Record-high global OHC and widespread warm SST anomalies outside the Pacific are providing a strong, persistent warming pressure that counteracts the Pacific cooling.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Forecasts suggest La Niña's influence will be peaking during the resolution window, maximizing its cooling effect now.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly argues against a repeat of the extreme peaks of 2023. The posterior should be revised downwards from any prior anchored on recent record years. However, the weakness of the La Niña and the extreme background warmth suggest the peak will still be higher than a simple historical La Niña analogue would predict. The net effect is a modest downward revision from the prior, settling slightly below 1.0°C.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Weekly Niño 3.4 index values warming back towards -0.5°C, signaling a faltering La Niña.
    *   Copernicus/NOAA reports for November 2025 showing a monthly anomaly surprisingly high (e.g., >0.8°C).
    *   Development of a persistent, large-scale heat dome over a major northern hemisphere landmass.
    *   Positive (warm) SST anomalies in the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans strengthening further.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Weekly Niño 3.4 index values dropping further below -0.8°C, indicating a strengthening La Niña.
    *   A strongly positive Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), confirming a robust atmospheric response to the La Niña.
    *   Emergence of significant negative (cool) SST anomalies outside the equatorial Pacific.
    *   Anomalously widespread snow cover across the Northern Hemisphere.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The resolution is on the *highest single day*, which is subject to high-frequency weather "noise." A relatively cool month could still contain a single anomalous day due to specific weather patterns.
*   **Lagged System Response:** The full atmospheric cooling response to oceanic La Niña conditions can lag by several months. The timing of the peak cooling effect is uncertain.
*   **Data Latency and Revisions:** The Copernicus dataset used for resolution is a reanalysis product. Initial estimates may be revised. There is a lag of several days for daily data publication.
*   **Model Uncertainty:** While models agree on a weak La Niña, their projections for its precise evolution and atmospheric impact vary, introducing uncertainty into the forecast.
*   **Non-Linearity:** The climate is in an unprecedented state. The interaction between a weak La Niña and record OHC may not behave linearly or follow historical analogues perfectly.

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Recent La Niña winters (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23) provide a relevant base rate due to similar ENSO conditions. These years had peak anomalies in the range of 0.8°C to 1.1°C. Given the ongoing La Niña, this serves as a reasonable starting point.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Centered around 1.05°C with moderate variance due to the variability in La Niña strength and background warming.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current La Niña phase aligns with the base rate conditions.
   - **Differences:** The current La Niña is weaker, and the background warming trend is stronger, suggesting a potential upward shift from the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **La Niña Presence (↓ Large):** Confirms cooling influence, aligning with lower anomalies.
   - **Weak La Niña (↑ Moderate):** Limits cooling potential, suggesting higher anomalies.
   - **High Ocean Heat Content (↑ Moderate):** Provides warming pressure, counteracting La Niña.
   - **Recent Cooling Trend (↓ Small):** October 2025 data shows cooling from previous peaks.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Start with a prior centered at 1.05°C. The weak La Niña and high ocean heat content suggest an upward adjustment. The posterior mean shifts slightly below 1.0°C, reflecting the net effect of cooling and warming influences.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of extreme weather events causing spikes. The forecast should account for potential tail risks.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A stronger-than-expected La Niña or unexpected cooling events could lower the anomaly. Conversely, persistent heatwaves could raise it.
   - **Adjustment:** Ensure the forecast accounts for these scenarios by slightly widening the range.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the final percentiles are adjusted to reflect the balance of cooling and warming influences, while considering potential tail risks.

P10: 0.85  
P20: 0.90  
P40: 0.95  
P60: 1.00  
P80: 1.05  
P90: 1.10

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of recent La Niña years and the overall warming trend:

- **Recent La Niña periods (2020-2022)**: During these periods, peak daily anomalies in Nov-Dec were approximately 0.8-1.1°C above the 1991-2020 baseline.
- **Recent years (2023-2025)**: Even with 2025 tracking below 2023-2024, the underlying warming trend means we should expect higher temperatures than previous La Niña events.

Given these considerations, I'll use a prior centered at **1.05°C** with a moderate spread (σ ≈ 0.2°C), reflecting the uncertainty but acknowledging the strong warming trend even during La Niña conditions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're in a confirmed La Niña phase, similar to 2020-2022
- The question focuses on the same seasonal window (Nov-Dec)
- We're using the same measurement system (Copernicus)

**Differences from base rate:**
- The current La Niña is described as "weak" compared to some previous events
- 2025 follows immediately after extreme warmth in 2023-2024, with residual ocean heat content
- The background warming trend continues to push temperatures higher each year
- October 2025 was already the third-warmest October on record (+0.70°C)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
- Confirmed La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through the end of 2025 (strong downward pressure)
- 2025 temperature trend is already tracking below 2023-2024 levels in recent months (moderate downward pressure)
- La Niña's cooling influence is likely to be at its peak during the Nov-Dec period (moderate downward pressure)

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
- The La Niña is described as "weak," limiting its cooling effect (moderate upward pressure)
- Record-high ocean heat content outside the equatorial Pacific provides a warming buffer (moderate upward pressure)
- The long-term warming trend continues to elevate baseline temperatures (strong upward pressure)
- The resolution is based on the highest daily value, which can capture short-term spikes (moderate upward pressure)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 1.05°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

1. **Update for confirmed weak La Niña**: This should shift the distribution downward from recent record years, but not as much as a strong La Niña would. I'll adjust the mean down by about 0.1°C to 0.95°C.

2. **Update for 2025's current trajectory**: The fact that 2025 is already tracking as the third-warmest year with October at +0.70°C suggests we won't see the extreme peaks of 2023-2024. This reinforces the downward adjustment.

3. **Update for record ocean heat content**: This provides a floor for how low temperatures can go, even during La Niña. This moderates the downward adjustment, keeping the mean above 0.9°C.

After these updates, my posterior distribution has:
- Mean: approximately 0.95°C
- Spread: slightly narrower than the prior (σ ≈ 0.18°C)
- Shape: slightly right-skewed to account for potential short-term heat spikes

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the cooling power of La Niña if it strengthens unexpectedly
- I could be overestimating the persistence of background warmth from 2023-2024
- Daily peaks can be more volatile than monthly averages, creating more tail risk

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Lower scenario**: If La Niña strengthens and global weather patterns amplify its cooling effect, we could see peak anomalies closer to 0.7°C
- **Higher scenario**: A major heat dome over a large landmass during an otherwise cool period could create a short-lived spike above 1.2°C

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my distribution slightly to account for daily variability
- I should ensure my lower percentiles reflect the possibility of a strengthening La Niña

## 6. Final Percentiles

After careful consideration of the evidence and potential uncertainties, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 0.75
P20: 0.82
P40: 0.91
P60: 0.98
P80: 1.08
P90: 1.15

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the peak daily surface air temperature anomaly observed during the November-December periods of the recent "triple-dip" La Niña (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23). This reference class matches the primary short-term climate driver, La Niña, and reflects modern climate conditions.

- **Reference Class:** Peak daily anomaly in Nov/Dec during the 2020-2022 La Niña events.
- **Reasoning:** This class isolates the effect of the same ENSO phase in a climate that is already significantly affected by long-term warming. It provides a more specific starting point than a broader average of all recent years.
- **Distribution:** Based on the research report and historical data from that period, this class had peak daily anomalies roughly in the **0.8°C to 1.1°C** range. I will set a prior distribution centered around **1.0°C**, acknowledging the upward trend even within that period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The key similarity is the presence of La Niña conditions, which exert a cooling pressure on global average temperatures by bringing cooler deep-ocean water to the surface in the equatorial Pacific. This is the primary reason to expect anomalies to be lower than in the El Niño-driven year of 2023.
- **Differences:**
    1.  **Higher Baseline Warmth:** The long-term anthropogenic warming trend has continued. The baseline global temperature in 2025 is higher than it was in 2020-2022.
    2.  **Record Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The planet, particularly the oceans outside the equatorial Pacific, absorbed an immense amount of heat during the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño. This stored heat is now being released, acting as a powerful warming force that counteracts La Niña's cooling effect.
    3.  **"Weak" La Niña:** The current La Niña is consistently described as "weak." This implies its cooling influence will be less potent than the moderate events during the 2020-2022 period, allowing the underlying warming factors to have a greater relative impact.
    4.  **Thermal Inertia:** The climate system has not yet fully equilibrated from the recent extreme heat. There is a lag in the atmospheric response to the cooler ocean surface conditions.

These differences all strongly suggest that the 2025 anomaly, despite La Niña, will be higher than a typical value from the 2020-2022 base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence 1: Confirmed weak La Niña is present and expected to peak.** (Net effect: Moderate downward pressure from a neutral state, but upward pressure compared to a strong La Niña). This is the main cooling factor. Its presence makes the extreme peaks of 2023 (>1.3°C) highly unlikely. However, its "weak" nature makes the lower end of the base rate (e.g., 0.8°C) also less likely.
- **Evidence 2: October 2025 monthly anomaly was +0.70°C.** (Strong downward pressure vs. 2023). This is a concrete data point showing a significant cooling from the peak monthly anomalies of 2023 (+0.85°C in Oct 2023). Daily peaks are typically 0.2-0.4°C higher than the monthly average, suggesting a central tendency for the peak in the 0.9°C to 1.1°C range, which is consistent with my prior.
- **Evidence 3: Chart shows 2025 tracking below 2023 and 2024.** (Strong downward pressure vs. 2023/24). This visual evidence confirms that 2025 is on a cooler trajectory than the last two record-breaking years, reinforcing the impact of La Niña.
- **Evidence 4: Record warmth in early 2025 and high global OHC.** (Strong upward pressure vs. base rate). The fact that January 2025 was a record-warm month despite an emerging La Niña highlights the unprecedented background heat. This makes it very likely that the peak anomaly will land in the upper range of, or exceed, the 2020-2022 La Niña base rate.
- **Evidence 5: The question is for the *highest daily* peak.** (Increases variance). This introduces the factor of short-term weather variability. A single large-scale heatwave over a major landmass could cause a short-term spike in the global average, independent of the monthly trend. This widens the distribution, particularly the upper tail.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** A distribution centered at **1.0°C**, based on the 2020-2022 La Niña years.
- **Update:** I will update this prior with the key evidence. The "weak" nature of the La Niña and the extremely high background OHC are strong evidence that pushes the distribution upwards. This suggests the median should be higher than the 1.0°C prior. Let's shift the median to **1.06°C**. The concrete data from October (+0.70°C monthly) provides a strong anchor, preventing the forecast from going too high and confirming that we are well below 2023 levels. This trims the extreme upper tail. The daily peak nature of the question adds variance.
- **Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution is centered slightly higher than the 2020-2022 La Niña base rate. It has a median around 1.06°C. The distribution is constrained on the high end by the observed cooling relative to 2023 but has a fatter upper tail than a forecast for a monthly average would, due to weather variability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenario 1 (Lower):** The atmospheric response to La Niña is stronger or has a longer lag than anticipated, and the peak cooling effect manifests strongly in Nov/Dec. The high OHC outside the Pacific is less relevant than the direct cooling from the ENSO region. In this case, the peak anomaly could fall to the lower end of the 2020-2022 range, perhaps around **0.90°C**.
- **Alternative Scenario 2 (Higher):** The "weak" La Niña falters completely, or the background warmth from record OHC completely overwhelms its cooling effect. A persistent weather pattern (e.g., a heat dome over Siberia) could cause a significant spike. In this scenario, the peak could approach the levels seen in 2024, potentially reaching **1.25°C** or even higher.
- **Self-Correction:** My initial median might be slightly too conservative. The combination of a weak La Niña and record OHC is unprecedented. The system might be less sensitive to La Niña's cooling than in the past. I will ensure my upper percentiles reflect this significant upside risk, while the lower percentiles account for the possibility that La Niña's effect is more conventional. I will maintain a wide distribution to reflect this "tug-of-war" uncertainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution reflects the balance between a confirmed, but weak, La Niña providing a cooling influence, and the unprecedented background warmth from long-term trends and record ocean heat content providing a strong warming influence. The range is wide to account for weather variability and the uncertainty of how these competing forces will interact.
