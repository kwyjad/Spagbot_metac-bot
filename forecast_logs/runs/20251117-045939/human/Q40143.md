### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Major Hostility Periods in Gaza (2009, 2012, 2014, 2021):** Ceasefires in Gaza are frequently violated, leading to additional casualties. After the 2014 conflict, sporadic violence continued. In the month following the main ceasefire, dozens of deaths were reported from various causes, including unexploded ordnance (UXO) and isolated clashes. This suggests a base rate of **50-200 deaths** in the ~75 days following a major conflict, though this is a weak prior given the different scale.
2.  **Low-Intensity Conflict / Protracted Truce:** This class includes periods like the "calm" after the Second Intifada or long stretches between major Gaza wars. These periods are characterized by ongoing security operations, border clashes, and occasional rocket fire/airstrikes, but not full-scale invasion. The death rate is highly variable but could be estimated at **1-5 deaths per day** on average during flare-ups.
3.  **Post-Conflict Humanitarian Crises (e.g., Mosul, Raqqa):** In the months after major urban warfare ceases, "excess deaths" from disease, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and UXO can be substantial, often exceeding direct conflict deaths. Given the two-year duration of the war, Gaza's infrastructure is likely decimated. This reference class suggests a significant number of non-violent deaths, potentially **10-30 per day**, should be expected.

*Limitations:* The current situation follows a conflict far longer and more destructive than previous Gaza wars, suggesting historical base rates are likely too low. The humanitarian situation is likely unprecedented.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-10] Ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel takes effect. — **BASELINE** — Establishes the start date for the resolution period.
*   [2025-10-19] Israeli media reports military attacks in Gaza, citing ceasefire violations. — **↑** — Indicates the ceasefire is porous and both sides are willing to use force, setting the stage for continued casualties.
*   [2025-10-29] Al Jazeera reports over 100 Palestinians killed since the ceasefire began. — **↑↑** — This is the strongest piece of recent evidence. It establishes an initial, observed death rate of **~5.3 deaths per day** (100 deaths / 19 days), confirming the "fragile" nature of the truce.
*   [2025-09-24] EU announces a dual aid package, including €50 million in direct humanitarian aid. — **↓** — While positive, this aid is unlikely to immediately reverse the catastrophic public health situation and prevent deaths from disease or malnutrition in the short term.
*   [2025-07-11] Singapore announces initiatives for 2026 to support the Palestinian Authority (PA). — **↔** — Irrelevant for the forecast horizon. PA has no security control in Gaza, and the initiatives are for the future.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Ceasefire Collapse:** A full-scale breakdown returning to open warfare. This is the primary driver of a high-end outcome. (Large)
2.  **Tit-for-Tat Escalation:** The current dynamic of skirmishes, rocket fire, and retaliatory airstrikes continuing without escalating to full war. This maintains the current death rate. (Moderate)
3.  **Humanitarian System Failure:** Deaths from disease (e.g., cholera), malnutrition, and lack of access to critical medical care due to destroyed infrastructure. This is a persistent, high-floor driver. (Large)
4.  **Unexploded Ordnance (UXO):** Civilian deaths and injuries from encountering UXO during rubble clearing or daily life will be a steady source of casualties for months or years. (Moderate)
5.  **Israeli Security Operations:** Targeted raids or strikes against militant leaders or cells, even under a ceasefire, can lead to casualties (both targeted and civilian). (Small to Moderate)
6.  **Internal Palestinian Violence:** Potential for clashes between Hamas security forces and other factions or clans over resources and control in a power vacuum. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Destruction:** A two-year conflict implies a level of infrastructure collapse (hospitals, sanitation, housing) far exceeding the 2014 or 2021 wars, making the humanitarian crisis more severe and a larger driver of mortality.
*   **Protracted Timescale:** The conflict's length suggests both sides are more exhausted but also more entrenched. This could make the ceasefire more durable out of necessity, but also means the underlying grievances are deeper.
*   **Ambiguous Political Endgame:** The background materials focus on PA reforms and budget, but the PA has no de facto power in Gaza. This governance vacuum makes stabilization and aid distribution extremely difficult compared to past scenarios where some functional local authority existed.
*   **High Initial Casualty Rate:** The observation of >100 deaths in the first 19 days is a powerful signal that this "ceasefire" is substantively different from a true cessation of hostilities and is more akin to a shift to low-intensity conflict.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the "Low-Intensity Conflict" reference class, centered on a daily death rate of perhaps 2-3 deaths/day. Over the ~73-day period (Oct 10 to Jan 1), this suggests a prior centered around **150-220 deaths**.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The direct observation of >100 deaths in the first 19 days (~5.3/day) is a very strong signal that the initial prior is too low and the current state is more violent.
    *   **↑ (Large):** The two-year conflict duration implies a catastrophic humanitarian situation, significantly raising the expected number of non-combat "excess deaths."
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Reports of ongoing skirmishes and airstrikes confirm that the mechanisms for tit-for-tat escalation are active.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Pledges of international aid may slightly mitigate the humanitarian crisis, but the effect will be slow and marginal within the short forecast horizon.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should be revised significantly upward. The observed rate of ~5.3 deaths/day should be weighted heavily. A simple extrapolation (5.3 deaths/day * 73 days) yields ~387 deaths. The posterior should be centered in this range, perhaps slightly higher to account for potential escalations or worsening disease outbreaks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Assassination of a high-level political or military figure from either side.
    *   Large-scale rocket barrages from Gaza (more than 1-2 sporadic rockets).
    *   Israeli ground forces re-entering populated areas of Gaza.
    *   Official declaration by either side that the ceasefire is over.
    *   Reports of a major disease outbreak (e.g., cholera) from WHO or UN.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A sustained period (e.g., 7+ days) with zero reported casualties from airstrikes or clashes.
    *   Successful deployment of a neutral third-party monitoring force at the border.
    *   Re-opening of a major hospital to significant operational capacity.
    *   A joint statement by Israel and Hamas, mediated by a third party (e.g., Egypt, Qatar), reaffirming the ceasefire.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Reliability:** The resolution source is the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Its ability to accurately and promptly collect and report data in a post-war environment with collapsed infrastructure is a major source of uncertainty. The reported numbers could be undercounts or subject to delays.
*   **Attribution of Death:** The MoH data may not distinguish between combatants, civilians killed in strikes, deaths from UXO, or deaths from disease/malnutrition. The forecast must implicitly cover all sources of mortality reported by this single source.
*   **Ceasefire Collapse (Black Swan):** The primary risk is a sudden, complete breakdown of the ceasefire, which would render any forecast based on the current rate invalid. The question resolves on the day the ceasefire ends, so a collapse on Dec 15 would mean resolving on that day's numbers.
*   **Reporting Lags:** There may be a significant lag in discovering and reporting deaths. The number reported on Jan 1, 2026, might be revised later. The resolution criteria are tied to the number *on that day*.

**Final Research Summary:** The ceasefire is nominal; the situation is a low-intensity conflict with an observed death rate of over 5 Palestinians per day. The final number will likely be several hundred, driven by the continuation of this rate and a severe underlying humanitarian crisis, assuming the ceasefire does not collapse entirely.

To forecast the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza during the late 2025 ceasefire, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class:** The "Low-Intensity Conflict" reference class is most appropriate, given the ongoing skirmishes and airstrikes despite the ceasefire. This suggests a base rate of 1-5 deaths per day.
   - **Prior Mean/Median:** Centered around 2-3 deaths per day, leading to an initial estimate of 150-220 deaths over the 73-day period from October 10 to January 1.
   - **Variance:** Moderate, given historical variability in post-conflict periods.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation resembles past low-intensity conflicts with ongoing violence despite ceasefire agreements.
   - **Difference:** The unprecedented destruction from a two-year conflict and a high initial casualty rate (>100 deaths in 19 days) suggest a more severe situation than typical low-intensity periods.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **High Initial Death Rate:** >100 deaths in 19 days (~5.3/day) strongly suggests a higher ongoing rate than the prior.
   - **Humanitarian Crisis:** Severe infrastructure damage implies significant non-combat deaths from disease and malnutrition.
   - **Ongoing Skirmishes:** Reports of continued violence support a higher death rate.
   - **International Aid:** While positive, the impact on short-term mortality is likely limited.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** The observed rate of ~5.3 deaths/day is a strong signal, suggesting a shift upward from the prior. Extrapolating this rate over 73 days gives ~387 deaths.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Adjusted to reflect the higher observed rate and potential for escalation, centering around 400 deaths.
   - **Variance/Skew:** Increased to account for potential escalation or humanitarian deterioration.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the risk of ceasefire collapse or major disease outbreak, which could significantly increase deaths.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A sustained ceasefire with effective aid could reduce deaths, but current evidence suggests this is unlikely.
   - **Adjustment:** Incorporate tail risks by slightly widening the distribution to account for these possibilities.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the percentiles are as follows:

P10: 300  
P20: 350  
P40: 400  
P60: 450  
P80: 500  
P90: 550

# Forecasting Palestinian Deaths in Gaza During Late 2025 Ceasefire

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Low-intensity conflict periods in Gaza with a nominal ceasefire in place. Historical data suggests death rates of 1-5 Palestinians per day during such periods.

**Secondary reference class**: Post-major conflict periods in Gaza (after 2014, 2021 wars) where infrastructure was severely damaged. These periods saw approximately 50-200 deaths in the ~75 days following major hostilities.

**Tertiary reference class**: Post-conflict humanitarian crises in urban warfare zones (Mosul, Raqqa) where infrastructure collapse led to significant "excess deaths" from disease, malnutrition, and unexploded ordnance.

Given the observed data point of 100+ deaths in the first 19 days (~5.3/day), I'll center my prior on this rate. For a ~73-day period (Oct 10 to Jan 1), this suggests a prior centered around **387 deaths** (5.3 × 73), with substantial uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class**:
- Nominal ceasefire with continued violations (similar to past Gaza ceasefires)
- Ongoing security operations and retaliatory strikes
- Presence of unexploded ordnance causing civilian casualties
- Damaged infrastructure affecting healthcare access

**Key differences**:
- Unprecedented two-year conflict duration (much longer than previous Gaza wars)
- Far more extensive infrastructure destruction
- More severe humanitarian crisis (collapsed healthcare, water systems)
- Higher observed initial death rate (5.3/day vs. typical 1-3/day in past ceasefires)
- Governance vacuum with unclear political endgame

These differences suggest the death toll will likely be higher than historical base rates would predict.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1**: Over 100 Palestinians killed in first 19 days (~5.3/day)
- This is direct observational evidence of the current death rate
- Makes higher outcomes much more likely (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- Strongly suggests the ceasefire is nominal rather than effective

**Evidence 2**: Reports of ongoing military attacks and skirmishes
- Confirms the ceasefire is fragile and violations are occurring
- Makes higher outcomes somewhat more likely (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)

**Evidence 3**: Two-year conflict duration with catastrophic infrastructure damage
- Suggests higher non-combat "excess deaths" from disease, malnutrition
- Makes higher outcomes more likely (likelihood ratio ~2:1)

**Evidence 4**: International aid announcements (EU €50 million)
- May slightly mitigate humanitarian crisis
- Makes lower outcomes slightly more likely (likelihood ratio ~1:1.2)

**Evidence 5**: Current date is Nov 17, meaning 38 days have passed since ceasefire
- If the initial 100+ deaths in 19 days pattern continued, we'd expect 200+ deaths by now
- No evidence of major escalation since Oct 29 report
- Slightly favors the rate not accelerating (likelihood ratio ~1:1.1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 387 deaths (5.3/day × 73 days), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update 1**: The observed death rate of 5.3/day is already incorporated in my prior.

**Update 2**: The evidence of ongoing attacks and the two-year conflict duration with catastrophic infrastructure damage suggests the death rate could be higher or at least sustained.
- Prior: 387 deaths (5.3/day)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes
- Posterior: Shift upward to ~450 deaths (6.2/day)

**Update 3**: International aid and lack of reports of major escalation since Oct 29 slightly moderates this upward shift.
- Prior: 450 deaths
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1.1 favoring lower outcomes
- Posterior: Slight downward adjustment to ~430 deaths (5.9/day)

The posterior distribution is centered around 430 deaths, with significant uncertainty due to the potential for escalation or de-escalation.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting the initial 19-day period (100+ deaths) if that was an anomalous spike
- I haven't fully accounted for reporting lags or potential undercounting by the Palestinian MoH
- The forecast doesn't adequately model the probability of complete ceasefire collapse

**Alternative scenarios**:
1. **Significant de-escalation**: If international pressure leads to stricter ceasefire adherence, death rates could drop to 1-2/day for the remaining period, resulting in only ~200-250 total deaths.
2. **Major escalation**: A high-profile assassination or large rocket barrage could trigger renewed intense fighting, potentially causing 20-30 deaths/day and pushing the total to 700-1000+.
3. **Humanitarian crisis dominance**: If disease outbreaks occur due to collapsed infrastructure, death rates could increase substantially even without military escalation.

**Adjustments for overconfidence**:
- Widening my distribution to account for these scenarios
- Increasing the upper tail to reflect the asymmetric risk of escalation
- Acknowledging the resolution source (Palestinian MoH) may have data collection challenges

This forecast is for the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza between October 10, 2025, and the resolution date (January 1, 2026, or the day the ceasefire ends). The starting value on October 10 was 67,682. The final number is the reading on the resolution date minus this starting value.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** My prior is a blend of two reference classes: "Low-Intensity Conflict" and "Post-Conflict Humanitarian Crisis."
- **Reasoning:** The description of a "fragile" ceasefire with ongoing "skirmishes and airstrikes" fits the pattern of a low-intensity conflict, which historically sees 1-5 deaths per day in this region. However, the unprecedented two-year duration of the preceding war suggests a catastrophic failure of health, water, and sanitation infrastructure. This makes the "Post-Conflict Humanitarian Crisis" reference class, with its high toll from disease and malnutrition (potentially 10-30 excess deaths/day), a critical component of the prior.
- **Distribution:** Combining these, a reasonable prior for the 83-day period would be centered around 4-7 deaths per day from all causes, leading to a median of roughly 330-580 total deaths. The distribution would be wide and right-skewed, reflecting the high uncertainty and potential for escalation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves the same actors (Israel, Hamas) and tactical dynamics (airstrikes, border clashes) as previous post-ceasefire periods in Gaza.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the scale and duration of the preceding conflict. A two-year war implies a level of destruction far exceeding previous conflicts (e.g., 2014, 2021). This dramatically increases the expected number of deaths from secondary causes like disease, malnutrition, and lack of medical care, making historical base rates from shorter conflicts likely too low. The governance vacuum also complicates aid delivery and stabilization efforts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Primary Evidence:** The report on October 29 that over 100 Palestinians had been killed since the ceasefire began 19 days prior.
- **Likelihood Update:** This is a very strong piece of evidence that anchors the forecast. It establishes an observed initial death rate of approximately **5.3 deaths per day** (100 deaths / 19 days). This evidence makes low-end outcomes (e.g., <200 total deaths) extremely unlikely and provides a clear baseline for extrapolation. It strongly shifts the probability mass towards the middle and upper end of my prior distribution.
- **Other Evidence:** Reports of ongoing military attacks (↑) confirm the mechanism for continued violent deaths. The EU aid package (↓) provides a slight downward pressure on the humanitarian death toll, but its impact is likely to be slow and marginal within the short forecast window.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior(centered ~450, wide) × Likelihood(peaked at a rate of 5.3/day).
- **Update Step:** The evidence of a 5.3 deaths/day rate is highly informative. A simple extrapolation over the full 83-day period yields a central estimate of ~440 deaths (5.3 * 83). As the forecast is being made on November 17 (38 days into the period), the estimated death toll is already around 201 (5.3 * 38), which sets a firm floor for the forecast.
- **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution's median shifts to be very close to the simple extrapolation of the observed rate. I place the median at **450**. The distribution remains right-skewed due to the significant tail risks of a full ceasefire collapse or a major disease outbreak (e.g., cholera) that could cause the death rate to spike.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence/Anchoring:** My forecast is heavily anchored to the 5.3 deaths/day rate. This rate is based on the first 19 days and could have changed since. The lack of news between Oct 29 and Nov 17 is ambiguous—it could mean stabilization or simply a lack of reporting. I account for this by maintaining a wide distribution.
- **Alternative Scenario (Lower):** The initial violence could have been a temporary flare-up. If the situation stabilizes and the rate drops to ~2 deaths/day for the remainder of the period, the total would be around 300. This informs my P10.
- **Alternative Scenario (Higher):** The primary risk is a full ceasefire collapse or a severe humanitarian catastrophe. A return to open warfare, even for a week, could add hundreds of deaths. A major disease outbreak could similarly cause the daily rate to double or triple. This justifies a long right tail, with the P90 reaching 900.
- **Data Reliability:** The resolution source, the Palestinian Ministry of Health, faces immense challenges in data collection. The reported number may be an undercount and may not fully capture deaths from disease or malnutrition. My forecast is for the *reported* number, not the true number of fatalities.
