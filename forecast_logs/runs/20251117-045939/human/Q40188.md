### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. Animal Health Import Suspensions:** The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) frequently imposes and lifts import restrictions due to disease outbreaks. These can be highly targeted (e.g., a specific region for a specific product) or broad. Durations vary widely. For highly contagious diseases with significant economic risk, bans often last many months to years. For example, bans related to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) lasted for over a decade for some countries. Bans for Avian Influenza are more common and can be regional, often lasting 3-9 months after the last detection. The current NWS ban is national and covers a critical trade partner, placing it in a more serious category. **Base rate for lifting a serious, national-level ban within ~7-8 months (May 2025 - Dec 2025) is likely low, perhaps 20-30%.**
2.  **Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) Eradication Efforts:** The U.S. successfully eradicated NWS domestically, a process that took decades (1950s-1980s). It maintains a permanent sterile fly barrier zone in Panama. When outbreaks occur north of this barrier, the response is aggressive. A 2016 NWS outbreak in Florida Key deer took approximately 6 months to contain and declare eradicated. This involved quarantines and sterile fly releases. This case is more complex, involving a foreign partner and a much larger geographic area. **A 6-month timeline for a localized U.S. outbreak suggests a ~7.5-month timeline for a cross-border one is ambitious, supporting a base rate of <40%.**
3.  **U.S.-Mexico Agricultural Trade Disputes:** Trade frictions over agricultural products between the U.S. and Mexico are common (e.g., tomatoes, avocados, sugar). These are typically resolved through negotiation over weeks or months. However, those are primarily economic disputes. This is a phytosanitary issue, driven by scientific risk assessment, not just economic negotiation. Bureaucratic and biological timelines, not just political will, are the primary constraints. This suggests standard trade dispute timelines are not a good reference class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-14** New sterile fly *dispersal* facility opens in Tampico, Mexico. — ↑ — Improves logistical capability to release sterile flies in northeastern Mexico, the area of greatest concern.
*   **2025-11-13** USDA notes new *production* facilities in Texas and Metapa, Mexico, will not be operational until early and summer 2026, respectively. — ↓ — Signals that the core capacity to generate sterile flies—the primary eradication tool—will not be significantly scaled up within the resolution window.
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary states U.S. is "not ready" to lift the ban but is "pleased with Mexico's efforts." — ↓ — The official stance remains one of caution, indicating the criteria for reopening have not yet been met, despite positive cooperation.
*   **2025-10-20** USDA reports a 28% decrease in active NWS cases in Mexico since September 11. — ↑ — Shows that current joint efforts (e.g., dispersing 100 million sterile flies/week) are having a positive effect on containing the outbreak.
*   **2025-09-26** U.S. Secretary criticizes Mexico's handling of NWS after a detection near the border. — ↓ — Indicates significant U.S. concern and a lack of confidence in Mexico's control measures at that time, raising the bar for reopening.
*   **2025-09-21** Mexico confirms an NWS case in Nuevo León, less than 70 miles from the U.S. border. — ↓ — Dramatically increases the direct threat to the U.S. livestock industry, making USDA regulators extremely risk-averse.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Biological Timeline of Eradication:** The NWS life cycle is ~21 days. Eradication using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) requires sustained, overwhelming releases of sterile flies for multiple life cycles *after the last detection* to ensure no viable eggs remain. This is a slow, methodical process. (Size: Large)
2.  **Bureaucratic Risk Aversion:** The USDA was burned by the failed reopening on July 9, which lasted only two days. This institutional "scar tissue" will create immense pressure to be absolutely certain the problem is solved before trying again, likely demanding a prolonged period of zero detections. (Size: Large)
3.  **Logistical Capacity (Sterile Fly Production & Dispersal):** Eradication is a numbers game. The ability to produce and disperse billions of sterile flies is the main lever. The new Tampico *dispersal* facility helps, but the announcements that new *production* facilities are not due until 2026 is a major bottleneck. (Size: Large)
4.  **Effectiveness of Surveillance:** The U.S. must trust Mexico's (SENASICA's) surveillance and reporting. Any doubt about the accuracy or completeness of detection efforts will delay reopening. The September case near the border likely damaged this trust. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Economic Pressure:** The U.S. beef industry, particularly feedlots in the Southwest, relies on feeder cattle from Mexico. The ban is economically painful for stakeholders on both sides of the border, creating pressure for a swift resolution. However, this pressure is counter-weighed by the catastrophic economic risk of an NWS infestation in the U.S. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The "False Start":** Unlike most import bans, this one was briefly lifted and then immediately reimposed. This failed attempt significantly increases the political and institutional cost of another mistake, making regulators far more cautious than in a typical case.
*   **Extreme Proximity of Threat:** The detection of NWS less than 70 miles from the border is not typical for many disease-related bans, which often concern outbreaks thousands of miles away. This proximity elevates the perceived risk to the highest level, justifying extreme caution.
*   **Established Eradication Technology:** The tool to solve this problem—the Sterile Insect Technique—is well-understood and has been used successfully for decades. This is not a novel disease requiring new science, which could shorten the timeline compared to something like early BSE.
*   **Long-Term Infrastructure Timeline:** The public statements about new production facilities not being ready until 2026 provide an unusually clear (and negative) signal about the long-term nature of the required response, contrasting with situations where capacity can be surged more quickly.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~30% seems appropriate, based on reference classes of serious animal health import bans (often >6 months) and the complexity of a cross-border eradication effort. (Strength: n=10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The failed July reopening creates a powerful institutional bias toward caution and delay.
    *   (↓ Large) The explicit 2026 timelines for new sterile fly *production* capacity strongly suggest the full-scale response is not expected to be sufficient in 2025.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The September NWS detection so close to the U.S. border reset the risk calculus to a much higher level of perceived threat.
    *   (↑ Small) Recent progress, such as the 28% reduction in cases and the opening of a new *dispersal* facility, are positive but insufficient to overcome the major structural and biological delays.
    *   (↑ Small) Positive rhetoric from the USDA Secretary about cooperation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for reopening.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The structural constraints (production capacity) and institutional psychology (risk aversion from the July failure) are far more powerful than the recent tactical successes. The posterior should move significantly lower than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A USDA/APHIS announcement of a specific, multi-week period of zero NWS detections that would trigger a reopening.
    *   Multiple consecutive weeks of official reports from USDA/SENASICA confirming zero new cases in all northern Mexican states.
    *   Reports of successful "sentinel animal" programs showing no new infestations.
    *   Intense, public lobbying from major U.S. cattle industry groups (e.g., NCBA) claiming the risk is mitigated and demanding reopening.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any new NWS detection, particularly in a northern state like Nuevo León, Coahuila, or Tamaulipas.
    *   USDA officials publicly emphasizing the 2026 timeline for new facilities as part of their risk assessment.
    *   Negative reports on the efficacy of sterile fly releases or surveillance efforts.
    *   Any unrelated political or trade friction between the U.S. and Mexico that sours the cooperative atmosphere.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Asymmetry:** U.S. decisions rely heavily on data from Mexican authorities (SENASICA). Any delay, error, or lack of transparency in this reporting could mislead analysis.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** "Reopen" could mean a full resumption, or it could mean a partial, conditional reopening (e.g., only for cattle from NWS-free zones with enhanced inspection). The resolution criteria seem to imply a general resumption, but a limited reopening could be a political possibility.
*   **Political Override:** While unlikely for a major animal health risk, it's conceivable that intense economic or political pressure could lead to a decision that is not fully supported by a conservative technical risk assessment.
*   **Weather/Environmental Factors:** The NWS life cycle is temperature-dependent. An unusually warm or wet winter could affect fly activity and complicate eradication efforts, potentially extending the timeline.

**Final Research Summary:** The timeline for reopening cattle imports before 2026 is exceptionally tight. While recent progress in containment is positive, the biological realities of eradication, major logistical bottlenecks in sterile fly production not being resolved until 2026, and extreme institutional caution following a failed reopening in July make a "Yes" resolution highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for lifting a serious, national-level ban within 7-8 months is estimated to be low, around 20-30%. This is based on historical data of similar bans, such as those related to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Avian Influenza, which often last many months to years. Given the complexity and seriousness of the New World screwworm (NWS) issue, a prior probability of 30% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a serious animal health risk, similar to past bans that have lasted extended periods.
   - Differences: The failed reopening attempt in July and the proximity of the NWS threat to the U.S. border increase caution and risk aversion, suggesting a longer timeline than typical cases.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Failed July Reopening**: The likelihood of reopening given this failure is low, as it increases institutional caution. (Likelihood ratio < 1)
   - **2026 Timeline for Production Facilities**: Indicates a long-term response plan, decreasing the likelihood of reopening before 2026. (Likelihood ratio < 1)
   - **Recent Progress in Containment**: A 28% decrease in cases and new dispersal facilities are positive but insufficient to overcome major delays. (Likelihood ratio > 1 but weak)
   - **USDA Secretary's Positive Remarks**: Suggest cooperation but do not strongly indicate imminent reopening. (Likelihood ratio > 1 but weak)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 30% / 70% = 0.4286
   - Considering the evidence, particularly the failed reopening and 2026 production timeline, the likelihood ratios for reopening are predominantly less than 1, suggesting a decrease in probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Combined likelihood ratio (predominantly < 1)
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds)
   - Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The forecast should consider the possibility of rapid improvements in containment or political pressure leading to reopening.
   - Alternative Scenario: A partial reopening or conditional resumption could occur, but the question specifies a general resumption.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong negative evidence, the probability should be adjusted downward, but not to zero, to account for unforeseen positive developments.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is estimated to be low.

Final: 10%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico in the next ~6 weeks (from Nov 17, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026).

Looking at appropriate reference classes:
- Serious animal health import bans typically last many months to years
- The New World Screwworm (NWS) is a particularly concerning pest with significant economic implications
- Even localized NWS outbreaks (like the 2016 Florida case) took ~6 months to contain
- The current ban has already been in place for about 6 months (since May 2025)
- There was a failed reopening attempt in July that lasted only 2 days

Based on these factors, I'll set a prior of **25%** that the ban will be lifted before 2026. This reflects that:
- Most serious animal health bans last longer than 6-7 months
- The failed July reopening creates institutional caution
- Cross-border eradication efforts are more complex than domestic ones

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical animal health import bans:**
- Involves a serious pest with significant economic implications
- Requires scientific verification of containment
- Involves cooperation between two countries

**Key differences:**
- The failed July reopening attempt creates unusual caution
- The detection of NWS less than 70 miles from the U.S. border (Sept 2025) heightens risk perception
- The explicit timeline for new production facilities not being ready until 2026 suggests a longer-term approach
- The sterile insect technique is a proven method, which could potentially accelerate resolution

These differences generally suggest a lower probability than the base rate, particularly the failed reopening and the explicit 2026 timeline for new facilities.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Failed July reopening**
- P(E|H): If the border reopens by Jan 2026, how likely was the July failure? Moderately likely (0.5) - even if they're on track to reopen, early caution is reasonable
- P(E|~H): If the border remains closed, how likely was the July failure? Very likely (0.9) - indicates fundamental issues
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56 (evidence against reopening)

**Evidence 2: New production facilities not operational until 2026**
- P(E|H): If reopening occurs by Jan 2026, how likely would they announce new facilities for 2026? Unlikely (0.3) - suggests they don't expect full resolution until then
- P(E|~H): If no reopening by Jan 2026, how likely would they announce new facilities for 2026? Very likely (0.9) - consistent with longer timeline
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (strong evidence against reopening)

**Evidence 3: 28% decrease in active NWS cases since September**
- P(E|H): If reopening occurs, how likely would we see this progress? Very likely (0.9) - necessary condition
- P(E|~H): If no reopening, how likely would we see this progress? Moderately likely (0.6) - progress can occur without being sufficient
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.6 = 1.5 (modest evidence for reopening)

**Evidence 4: New sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico**
- P(E|H): If reopening occurs, how likely would this facility open? Likely (0.8) - supports eradication efforts
- P(E|~H): If no reopening, how likely would this facility open? Likely (0.7) - part of long-term strategy regardless
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.7 = 1.14 (very slight evidence for reopening)

**Evidence 5: September detection near U.S. border**
- P(E|H): If reopening occurs, how likely was this detection? Somewhat unlikely (0.4) - suggests ongoing risk
- P(E|~H): If no reopening, how likely was this detection? Likely (0.8) - explains continued caution
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5 (evidence against reopening)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 25:75 (0.33:1)

First update (failed July reopening):
- Posterior odds = 0.33 × 0.56 = 0.185
- Posterior probability = 0.185/(1+0.185) ≈ 15.6%

Second update (2026 facilities timeline):
- Posterior odds = 0.185 × 0.33 = 0.061
- Posterior probability = 0.061/(1+0.061) ≈ 5.7%

Third update (28% decrease in cases):
- Posterior odds = 0.061 × 1.5 = 0.092
- Posterior probability = 0.092/(1+0.092) ≈ 8.4%

Fourth update (new dispersal facility):
- Posterior odds = 0.092 × 1.14 = 0.105
- Posterior probability = 0.105/(1+0.105) ≈ 9.5%

Fifth update (September border detection):
- Posterior odds = 0.105 × 0.5 = 0.053
- Posterior probability = 0.053/(1+0.053) ≈ 5%

The evidence collectively suggests a very low probability of reopening before 2026, with the strongest negative factors being the explicit 2026 timeline for new facilities and the institutional caution following the failed July reopening.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating political/economic pressure to reopen despite scientific caution
- The 28% reduction in cases could accelerate more rapidly than expected
- There could be a partial, regional reopening for specific low-risk areas that would still count as "Yes"
- The USDA Secretary's positive comments about Mexico's efforts could signal more progress than is publicly documented

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might put the probability at 15-20%, arguing that:
- Economic pressure from U.S. cattle industry could force a faster reopening
- The sterile insect technique has worked quickly in other contexts
- Political considerations might override scientific caution
- A partial reopening for certain regions might be possible

**Rebuttal:**
- The failed July reopening creates enormous institutional risk aversion
- The explicit 2026 timeline for new production facilities strongly signals a longer-term approach
- The biological reality of NWS eradication requires multiple life cycles of monitoring
- The proximity of the September detection to the U.S. border heightens caution

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for political/economic pressure and the possibility of a partial reopening, but the core evidence still points to a low probability.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the evidence, particularly the explicit 2026 timeline for new facilities, the failed July reopening, and the biological realities of NWS eradication, I assess there is a 7% probability that the United States will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026.

Final: 7%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is the lifting of a major, national-level animal health import ban. The reference class should be similar situations.

*   **Reference Class 1: Serious U.S. Animal Health Import Bans.** The research report notes that bans for serious diseases like BSE can last for years, while more common ones like Avian Influenza often last 3-9 months. The current New World Screwworm (NWS) situation is described as serious, national-level, and involves a critical trade partner, placing it on the more severe end of the spectrum. The ban was imposed in May 2025, so a reopening before 2026 implies a total duration of about 7.5 months. A base rate for lifting a serious ban within this timeframe is likely below 50%. The report's suggestion of 20-30% seems reasonable.
*   **Reference Class 2: NWS Eradication Timelines.** A 2016 NWS outbreak in Florida, which was localized and entirely within U.S. control, took about 6 months to resolve. The current situation is more complex, involving a cross-border effort over a much larger area. This suggests a timeline longer than 6 months is probable.

Combining these, I will select a prior probability of **30%** for the ban being lifted before 2026. This acknowledges that a ~7.5-month resolution is possible but not the most likely outcome for a serious, complex outbreak. In odds form, this is 3:7.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has several unique features that distinguish it from a typical import ban scenario:

*   **The "False Start":** The USDA lifted the ban on July 7 only to reimpose it on July 9. This is highly unusual and creates significant "institutional scar tissue." The political and reputational cost of a second failure would be immense, making regulators extremely risk-averse and likely to demand a much higher standard of proof for eradication before attempting another reopening. This difference strongly suggests a longer-than-average timeline.
*   **Proximity of the Threat:** The detection of NWS less than 70 miles from the U.S. border in September makes the threat exceptionally immediate and severe. This elevates the risk calculus for the USDA, justifying extreme caution compared to an outbreak contained far from U.S. territory.
*   **Explicit Infrastructure Timelines:** There is an unusually clear signal about logistical capacity: new sterile fly *production* facilities are not expected to be operational until 2026. This implies that the primary tool for eradication is not expected to be at full strength within the resolution window.

These key differences, particularly the failed reopening and the production timeline, make this situation much more challenging than the base case, suggesting the initial 30% prior is likely too high.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the key evidence. Let H be the hypothesis that the border reopens before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: New sterile fly *production* facilities not operational until 2026.**
    *   P(E | H): It is very unlikely that authorities would publicly discuss a 2026 timeline for critical infrastructure if they believed the problem could be solved and the border reopened by the end of 2025.
    *   P(E | ~H): This announcement is very likely if the authorities anticipate a prolonged effort extending into 2026. It serves as a justification for the long-term strategy.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability of a 2025 reopening.

*   **Evidence 2: The failed reopening in July.**
    *   P(E | H): A prior failure makes a subsequent success within a short timeframe less likely due to the resulting institutional caution.
    *   P(E | ~H): The failure is a direct causal factor for a prolonged closure.
    *   **LR: < 1.** This evidence also decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Recent progress (28% decrease in cases, new *dispersal* facility).**
    *   P(E | H): Some tangible progress is a necessary precondition for any reopening.
    *   P(E | ~H): This level of progress is also consistent with a long, grinding eradication campaign that will not conclude by the end of the year. A 28% decrease is not eradication.
    *   **LR: > 1, but only slightly.** This is weak positive evidence, insufficient to overcome the major negative factors.

The net effect of the evidence is strongly negative. The structural and institutional factors pointing to a long delay are far more significant than the recent tactical successes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 3:7 (30% probability).
*   **Update with key evidence:** The most powerful piece of evidence is the 2026 timeline for new production facilities. This is a strong signal that the full capacity to fight the outbreak won't be available this year. Let's estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/5 for this evidence (i.e., this announcement is 5 times more likely if the ban continues into 2026 than if it ends in 2025).
    *   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
    *   Posterior Odds = (3/7) × (1/5) = 3/35
*   **Convert to Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = 3 / (3 + 35) = 3 / 38 ≈ 7.9%

The other evidence (failed reopening, proximity of threat) would push this even lower, while the recent progress would nudge it slightly higher. The net result is a posterior probability in the single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider how I could be wrong. The most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution would be a combination of two factors:
1.  **Rapid, Unexpected Success:** The current eradication efforts prove surprisingly effective, leading to a complete collapse of the NWS population in northern Mexico much faster than anticipated.
2.  **Political/Economic Override:** Intense pressure from the U.S. cattle industry forces a political decision to reopen the border, perhaps on a limited or conditional basis (e.g., only from certain certified NWS-free regions), even if the USDA's technical experts remain highly cautious.

However, the biological timeline for eradication is a hard constraint. The NWS life cycle is about 21 days. To declare an area free requires a sustained period of zero detections, typically covering at least three life cycles (~9 weeks). Given that it is mid-November, the window to achieve this, verify it, and complete the administrative process for reopening before December 31 is almost closed. The institutional caution from the July failure makes a politically rushed decision less likely. Therefore, while these alternative scenarios exist, they have a low probability of occurring. I will slightly increase my forecast to account for this tail risk.

### Final Forecast
The initial base rate of 30% is significantly reduced by overwhelming evidence. The failed reopening in July has created extreme institutional risk aversion. Most importantly, the public timeline indicating that new sterile fly production capacity will not be available until 2026 is a powerful signal that the response is viewed as a long-term effort. The biological and bureaucratic timelines required to certify eradication and lift the ban make a resolution in the next ~6 weeks highly improbable. After a small adjustment for tail risks, the final probability remains very low.

Final: 5%
