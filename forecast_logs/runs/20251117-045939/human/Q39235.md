### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2018-Present):** This is the most relevant class, as it accounts for the widespread availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine and improved therapeutic treatments (e.g., monoclonal antibodies), which fundamentally changed outbreak dynamics.
    *   **Data:**
        *   Kivu (2018-2020): 2,287 deaths (catastrophic outlier in a conflict zone)
        *   Équateur (2020): 55 deaths
        *   North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
        *   Équateur (2022): 5 deaths
    *   **Base Rate:** Excluding the Kivu outlier, the median number of deaths for a post-vaccine DRC outbreak is **~6 deaths**. Including the 2020 outbreak, a reasonable range for a "typical" contained outbreak is **5-60 deaths**. The Kivu outbreak represents a tail-risk scenario (~1% probability) driven by unique security challenges.
    *   **Limitations:** The dataset is small (n=4), making the statistics sensitive to single events. The Kivu outbreak's extreme scale demonstrates that context (e.g., conflict) can be a more powerful driver than technology.

2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present):** A broader but less relevant class due to major changes in medical countermeasures and response capacity.
    *   **Base Rate:** Historically, many outbreaks were small and self-limiting in remote areas, often with fewer than 50 deaths. However, several resulted in 150-300 deaths. This class is less useful for a specific point estimate but highlights that outbreaks can reach a medium scale even without the aggravating factors of the Kivu epidemic.
    *   **Limitations:** Pre-2018 data does not reflect current response capabilities, including vaccines, therapeutics, and institutional experience, making it a poor predictor for the current situation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province. — ↑ — The start of the event, establishing a non-zero death toll.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — ↑ — Early data shows significant transmission and a high case fatality rate (CFR), suggesting a virulent start.
*   **2025-10-19** Last known Ebola case reported (implied by Guardian source). — ↓↓↓ — This is the most critical data point, starting the 42-day (2 incubation periods) countdown to declaring the outbreak over.
*   **2025-11-05** CDC reports cumulative total of 64 cases and 45 deaths. — (neutral) — Establishes the current known scale. The increase from September reflects reporting lags, not uncontrolled spread after mid-October.
*   **2025-11-10** Guardian article states the country is "on the verge of overcoming" the outbreak, pending the 42-day clear period. — ↓↓ — Strong qualitative evidence from on-the-ground reporting that containment measures have been successful and the outbreak is ending.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed and Efficacy of Response (Large):** The primary driver of containment. Rapid case identification, contact tracing, and deployment of mobile labs and treatment centers can halt transmission. The DRC's "Ebola SWAT teams" are now highly experienced.
2.  **Ring Vaccination Strategy (Large):** Vaccinating contacts and contacts-of-contacts of confirmed cases creates a buffer of immunity, effectively breaking transmission chains. Its success is a key determinant of an outbreak's final size.
3.  **Security and Community Trust (Large):** As seen in the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak, the presence of armed groups and community mistrust can severely hamper response efforts, allowing the virus to spread unchecked. Kasaï Province is not facing a similar level of organized armed conflict.
4.  **Geographic and Population Factors (Moderate):** Outbreaks in dense, highly connected urban areas are harder to control than those in remote, rural settings. The specific location within Kasaï and its transport links are relevant.
5.  **Availability of Therapeutics (Moderate):** Monoclonal antibody treatments (e.g., Inmazeb, Ebanga) can significantly reduce the case fatality rate among those infected, directly lowering the final death toll.
6.  **Surveillance and Reporting (Small):** Delays or gaps in surveillance can allow hidden transmission chains to smolder. However, current systems are generally robust, making this a smaller driver unless a major failure occurs.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Location Context:** Unlike the catastrophic 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak, this outbreak is not in a region characterized by intense, long-running armed conflict. This is the single most important difference, enabling a more effective public health response.
*   **Advanced Institutional Experience:** This is the DRC's 16th outbreak. The national health ministry and its international partners (WHO, etc.) have a highly refined, battle-tested playbook for Ebola response, which appears to have been deployed effectively.
*   **Outbreak Trajectory:** The current outbreak has already exceeded the death toll of the very small 2021 and 2022 outbreaks (45 vs. 5-6). This suggests initial transmission was more significant, but it still falls well short of the larger historical outbreaks.
*   **Clear Containment Signal:** The information about the 42-day countdown starting on October 19 provides an unusually strong and early signal that the outbreak is already contained, a level of clarity often unavailable mid-outbreak.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the post-vaccine reference class (excluding the Kivu outlier) would be centered low, perhaps a Lognormal or Negative Binomial distribution with a median around 20-30 deaths and a long right tail (equivalent n of ~4 outbreaks).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The 42-day countdown since Oct 19 strongly indicates transmission has ceased.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The outbreak's location in a non-conflict zone (vs. Kivu) allowed for an effective response.
    *   (↑ Small) The current death toll of 45 is higher than the 5-6 deaths in the most recent outbreaks, anchoring the final number above that low baseline.
    *   (neutral) The CFR appears to be in the typical ~50-70% range, providing no unusual signal.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to the outbreak being over. The posterior distribution should collapse dramatically, becoming tightly concentrated just above the last reported death toll of 45. The probability of the final number exceeding 50-55 should be very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new confirmed or probable case reported before November 30, 2025 (which would reset the 42-day countdown).
    *   Reports of community resistance or attacks on healthcare workers in Kasaï.
    *   Detection of a linked case in a major urban center (e.g., Kananga) or a neighboring country.
    *   Official statements walking back optimistic assessments of containment.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The official declaration by the DRC Ministry of Health and WHO that the outbreak is over (expected around Nov 30, 2025).
    *   Weekly epidemiological reports from the WHO continuing to show zero new cases.
    *   Successful completion of follow-up monitoring for all known contacts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lags & Revisions:** The final death toll from the DRC Ministry of Health may be revised after the resolution date. The number "as of" Jan 1, 2026 might differ from a final historical tally.
*   **Definition of "Linked":** A death from a flare-up (e.g., from a survivor's relapse) could be considered part of this outbreak, potentially occurring after the main transmission chain has ended. This is a low-probability event but could add a few deaths.
*   **Reporting Accuracy:** The official numbers are the resolution criteria, but they may not capture every death, especially in remote areas. However, for forecasting, we are bound by the official report.
*   **Political Instability:** While Kasaï is not a major conflict zone, the DRC is politically fragile. Unforeseen instability could disrupt the final stages of the response and monitoring.

**Final Research Summary:**
The outbreak appears to be successfully contained, with the last known case occurring in mid-October. The final death toll is therefore expected to be very close to the 45 deaths reported as of early November, with only a small chance of a few additional deaths from existing cases or a localized flare-up.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province, DRC, before 2026, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2018-present), excluding the Kivu outlier. This accounts for the impact of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and improved treatments. The median number of deaths for these outbreaks is around 6, with a typical range of 5-60 deaths. The Kivu outbreak is an extreme outlier due to conflict, representing a tail-risk scenario.
   - Mean/Median: ~20-30 deaths (excluding Kivu), with a long right tail.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The outbreak is in the DRC, where the vaccine and treatments are available, and the health response is experienced.
   - Differences: The current outbreak has already resulted in 45 deaths, exceeding the typical small outbreak size, but it is not in a conflict zone like Kivu, allowing for a more effective response.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The 42-day countdown starting on October 19 suggests the outbreak is contained, making higher death tolls less likely.
   - The outbreak's location in a non-conflict zone supports containment, reducing the likelihood of a large-scale outbreak.
   - The current death toll of 45 anchors the forecast above the very small outbreak baseline but suggests containment.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Lognormal or Negative Binomial distribution centered around 20-30 deaths.
   - Evidence: The containment signals (42-day countdown, non-conflict zone) strongly suggest the outbreak is ending.
   - Posterior: The distribution becomes tightly concentrated around the current death toll of 45, with a low probability of exceeding 50-55 deaths.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks: A flare-up or reporting lag could slightly increase the death toll.
   - Alternative forecast: A scenario with additional deaths due to unforeseen factors, but this is unlikely given the containment signals.
   - Adjustments: The forecast accounts for potential small increases but remains centered around the current toll.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - The forecast reflects the expectation that the outbreak is nearly over, with a small chance of additional deaths.

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2018-present) as my primary reference class, as this accounts for modern response capabilities including vaccines and therapeutics:

- Kivu (2018-2020): 2,287 deaths (extreme outlier in conflict zone)
- Équateur (2020): 55 deaths
- North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
- Équateur (2022): 5 deaths

Excluding the Kivu outlier, the median is approximately 6 deaths, with a range of 5-55 deaths for typical contained outbreaks. Including the Kivu outbreak would dramatically skew the distribution, but it represents a tail risk (~1%) driven by unique security challenges.

The prior distribution is right-skewed (lognormal-like) with a median around 20-30 deaths and a long right tail to account for the possibility of larger outbreaks.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- Same country (DRC) with experienced response teams
- Same disease (Ebola virus)
- Same availability of vaccines and therapeutics
- Similar initial response mechanisms

**Key differences:**
- Current outbreak has already reached 45 deaths, higher than recent small outbreaks
- Unlike the catastrophic Kivu outbreak, Kasaï is not experiencing intense armed conflict
- We have unusually clear information that the last case was reported on October 19, 2025, starting the 42-day countdown to declaring the outbreak over

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- Already 45 confirmed deaths as of November 5, 2025 (strong evidence, +100% shift from prior median)
- Initial CFR appears high (~70% based on 45 deaths from 64 cases), suggesting virulence (weak evidence, +10%)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- Last known case reported on October 19, 2025, with no new cases for nearly a month (very strong evidence, -80% from unconstrained scenarios)
- Guardian reporting the country is "on the verge of overcoming" the outbreak (strong evidence, -50%)
- Absence of conflict in Kasaï Province allowing effective response (moderate evidence, -30%)
- No reports of spread to major urban centers or neighboring countries (moderate evidence, -20%)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered around 20-30 deaths with a long right tail, I need to update based on the strongest evidence:

1. **First update - current death toll:** The outbreak has already reached 45 deaths, which shifts the distribution rightward, eliminating the possibility of outcomes below 45.

2. **Second update - containment evidence:** The evidence that transmission has ceased (last case on October 19) dramatically collapses the right tail of the distribution. The 42-day countdown would end around November 30, 2025, well before our resolution date of January 1, 2026.

The posterior distribution becomes tightly concentrated just above the current 45 deaths. There remains a small probability of:
- A few additional deaths from existing cases not yet reported
- Late reporting of deaths that occurred earlier
- A small, contained flare-up before the end of 2025

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Data reporting lags could mean some deaths haven't been counted yet
- The outbreak could have spread to remote areas with poor surveillance
- Political instability could disrupt final monitoring
- Survivor relapses could cause small flare-ups

**Alternative forecast scenario:** 
A more pessimistic view might consider that previous outbreaks have sometimes seen late surges or hidden transmission chains. However, the specific evidence about the last case on October 19 strongly counters this concern.

**Tail risks:**
- Low probability (~1-2%) of a significant flare-up adding 10-20 more deaths
- Very low probability (~0.1%) of a major resurgence similar to the Kivu pattern
- Small chance (~5%) that final death toll revisions add 1-5 deaths

After considering these factors, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these possibilities.

Here is a full probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is **post-vaccine Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from 2018 to the present**. This class is most relevant because the widespread availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine and improved therapeutics have fundamentally altered outbreak dynamics, making pre-2018 data less comparable.

The data for this reference class includes:
*   Équateur (2020): 55 deaths
*   North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
*   Équateur (2222): 5 deaths

(The catastrophic 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak with 2,287 deaths is excluded from the central tendency of the prior, as it was driven by extreme armed conflict, a condition not present in Kasaï Province. It is instead treated as a tail-risk scenario.)

Based on the three non-conflict outbreaks, the median number of deaths is 6. The mean is 22. Given the small sample size, the prior distribution should be wide and right-skewed. A reasonable prior might have a **median of around 20 deaths**, with a significant spread, acknowledging that an outbreak could be contained with very few deaths (like in 2021/2022) or grow to a medium scale (like in 2020).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: The current outbreak is in the DRC, where experienced national and international response teams and medical countermeasures (vaccines, therapeutics) are available, just as in the reference class outbreaks.
*   **Differences**: The primary difference is the initial trajectory. With 45 deaths reported by early November, this outbreak has already surpassed the scale of the 2021 and 2022 outbreaks (5-6 deaths each) and is approaching the scale of the 2020 outbreak (55 deaths). This suggests that initial transmission before containment was more widespread. A crucial positive difference is the absence of the intense armed conflict that made the 2018 Kivu outbreak a catastrophic outlier.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Several key pieces of evidence from the research report allow for a significant update from the prior.

1.  **Current Death Toll is 45 (as of Nov 5):** This is a hard data point that acts as a floor for the forecast. It renders any outcome below 45 impossible and immediately shifts the entire probability distribution upwards, making the initial prior obsolete.
2.  **Last Known Case on October 19:** This is the most critical piece of evidence. An outbreak is typically declared over after 42 days (two 21-day incubation periods) with no new cases. This date starts that countdown. This is an extremely strong signal that transmission has been successfully interrupted. This evidence dramatically lowers the probability of a much larger final death toll, as the source of new infections appears to have been cut off.
3.  **Qualitative Reports of Success (Guardian, Nov 10):** The report that the country is "on the verge of overcoming" the outbreak corroborates the timeline data. It provides high-level confirmation from observers on the ground that containment measures are working and the situation is under control. This further strengthens the likelihood that the outbreak is effectively over.
4.  **Case & Death Count (64 cases, 45 deaths):** This implies a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of ~70%, which is within the expected range. As of Nov 5, there were 19 known infected patients who had not died. The final death toll will be 45 plus any subsequent deaths from this group, plus any deaths discovered through later data reconciliation. Given that the last case was on Oct 19, the clinical outcomes for most of these 19 patients are likely already determined by mid-November.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior**: A wide distribution with a median around 20 deaths.
*   **Update 1 (Hard Floor):** The observation of 45 deaths truncates the prior. The posterior must be entirely ≥ 45.
*   **Update 2 (Containment Signal):** The evidence that the last case was on Oct 19 is a powerful likelihood update. It suggests the process generating new cases has stopped. The posterior distribution should therefore collapse into a very narrow range just above the current count of 45. The remaining uncertainty comes from (a) the final outcome of the 19 patients who were alive on Nov 5, (b) potential for minor retrospective data revisions, and (c) the small chance of a new, previously undetected transmission chain.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The resulting posterior distribution is tightly concentrated. The median should be slightly above 45, perhaps around 47-48, to account for a small number of additional deaths from the existing cases. The distribution will have a long, but very thin, right tail to account for the low-probability risk of a flare-up.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

The primary risk to this forecast is that the "last known case" was not truly the last case. An undetected transmission chain could exist, which would reset the 42-day countdown and lead to a much higher death toll. This is the main scenario that could make the final number significantly larger. While the optimistic reports make this unlikely, it represents a key tail risk.

A second risk is a flare-up from a survivor, where the virus re-emerges and starts a new chain of transmission linked to the original outbreak. This is a known, though rare, phenomenon with Ebola.

To account for these risks, the forecast must include a right-skewed tail. While the most probable outcomes are clustered between 45 and 55, the distribution should assign a small but non-zero probability to outcomes in the 60s or higher. My final percentiles reflect this by having a tight central range (P20-P80) and a much wider upper range (P80-P90).
