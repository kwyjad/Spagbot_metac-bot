### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) under the Noboa Administration (2023-Present):** President Noboa has frequently used SoEs to address security and social crises. The January 2024 SoE was nationwide (24 provinces) for 60 days (later extended) against gang violence. This suggests a high propensity to use this tool and for broad geographic scope. The current SoE is for social protest. The base rate for a Noboa-declared SoE being extended beyond its initial 60-day term is roughly 1 in 2, based on the major security-related decrees.
2.  **Ecuadorian SoEs for Social Protests (2015-2025):** SoEs are a common government response to major indigenous-led protests (e.g., 2019, 2022). These typically last 30-60 days. Historically, they end not by expiration but through negotiated settlements after significant economic and social disruption. This class suggests the SoE's duration is tied to a political resolution, not a fixed timeline. The base rate for a protest-driven SoE lasting more than 60 days is low (~20%), as pressure for a deal usually mounts.
3.  **Constitutional Duration of SoEs:** The Ecuadorian Constitution (Art. 164) limits SoEs to 60 days, with one possible 30-day extension upon justification. The current SoE, declared Oct 4-6, will expire around Dec 4-6. The question is therefore not about its existence, but its renewal. The base rate of renewal for *any* SoE is context-dependent, but a plausible starting point is 30-40%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-10** Government officials reject initial calls for dialogue from protest leaders, demanding a cessation of roadblocks first. ↑ — Hardline stance reduces the likelihood of a swift negotiated end to the crisis, making an extension of the SoE more probable.
*   **2025-11-04** The Constitutional Court issues a preliminary statement reminding the executive that any extension of the SoE must be strictly justified and proportional. ↓ — Signals judicial oversight that could constrain the President's ability to renew the SoE, especially if protest activity wanes.
*   **2025-10-28** Clashes between protesters and security forces reported in Chimborazo and Cotopaxi, leading to several injuries and arrests. ↑ — Escalating violence provides the government with justification for maintaining and potentially extending the SoE to restore public order.
*   **2025-10-15** Major business associations publicly call for a resolution, citing over $50 million in daily losses from blocked transport routes. ↓ — Economic pressure on the government from its own allies increases the incentive to negotiate and lift the SoE.
*   **2025-10-06** SoE is expanded from 10 to 16 provinces, solidifying the government's security-focused response. ↑ — Demonstrates the government's commitment to a broad, forceful approach rather than a targeted or conciliatory one.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Government-Protester Negotiation:** The initiation and progress of formal talks between the Noboa administration and indigenous leaders (e.g., CONAIE) is the primary off-ramp. A breakthrough would lead to the SoE being lifted. (Large effect)
2.  **Protest Intensity & Persistence:** Sustained, widespread, and disruptive protests (roadblocks, clashes) provide the government with the rationale to extend the SoE. A significant de-escalation would weaken that rationale. (Large effect)
3.  **Noboa's Political Strategy:** The President's decision to frame the protests as "narco-terrorism" rather than a legitimate social movement suggests a preference for a security-based solution over negotiation, making an extension more likely. (Moderate effect)
4.  **Constitutional Court Approval:** The court must approve any 30-day extension. It could deny the request if it deems the situation no longer meets the constitutional threshold for an emergency, acting as a key check on executive power. (Moderate effect)
5.  **Economic Disruption:** The economic cost of the protests, particularly to key sectors like oil and exports, creates pressure from business elites on the government to find a rapid solution, which could involve lifting the SoE as part of a deal. (Moderate effect)
6.  **Conflation with Gang Violence:** The government could justify an extension by citing the ongoing general security crisis, even if the protests themselves subside, blurring the lines between the two issues. (Small effect)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Hardline Presidential Rhetoric:** Noboa's immediate and persistent framing of protesters as linked to foreign cartels is more confrontational than his predecessors (Moreno, Lasso), who, despite using SoEs, engaged in dialogue more readily. This reduces the probability of a quick negotiated settlement.
*   **Dual Crises:** Unlike past protest waves, this one occurs amidst an unprecedented nationwide security crisis involving powerful drug gangs. This gives the state greater latitude and public support for deploying security forces and maintaining emergency measures.
*   **Severe Fiscal Constraints:** The fuel subsidy cuts are not arbitrary policy but are driven by deep fiscal pressures. This gives the government less negotiating room to concede to the protesters' primary demand, pointing towards a more protracted conflict.
*   **Short Time Horizon to Renewal:** The resolution date (Dec 25) falls squarely within the potential 30-day renewal period. The key uncertainty is not the declaration of a *new* SoE, but the extension of the *current* one, making the Constitutional Court's role more pivotal than usual.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on 0 provinces, reflecting the base case that the initial 60-day SoE expires in early December as per the constitution. Give this an equivalent n of ~10, but with a fat tail allowing for the possibility of renewal in all 16 provinces.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's "narco-terrorism" framing and rejection of initial talks strongly suggest a preference for confrontation over negotiation, increasing the odds of renewal.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The ongoing, parallel security crisis with gangs provides a convenient and plausible pretext for extending the SoE.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The government's fiscal inflexibility on the core issue of subsidies makes a prolonged standoff more likely.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Strong economic pressure from business elites creates a powerful incentive for the government to de-escalate and find a solution.
    *   (↓ Small) The Constitutional Court's oversight provides a potential, but uncertain, brake on renewal.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points towards a renewal. The posterior should shift significantly upwards from a prior centered on 0. The most likely outcomes are now 0 (if a deal is struck or the court blocks renewal) or 16 (if renewed). The evidence makes the 16-province outcome much more probable than the prior suggested.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Government officials doubling down on rhetoric linking protesters to organized crime.
    *   CONAIE or other indigenous groups announcing a formal "national mobilization" or uprising.
    *   Failure of any third-party (e.g., Catholic Church, UN) mediation attempts.
    *   The formal submission of a decree to the Constitutional Court requesting a 30-day extension.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a formal, high-level negotiating table between the government and protest leaders.
    *   A significant, observable reduction in roadblocks and protest actions nationwide for several consecutive days.
    *   The government offering a compromise, such as a phased-in subsidy cut or compensation for specific sectors.
    *   A definitive ruling from the Constitutional Court against an extension.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The government could lift the SoE related to protests but immediately declare a new one in the same provinces for security/gang reasons. This would still count as an SoE on the resolution date.
*   **Partial Resolution:** The SoE might be renewed for a smaller subset of the 16 provinces—for example, only those with the most persistent unrest. The outcome is not necessarily binary (0 or 16).
*   **Holiday De-escalation:** The proximity to Christmas could create a powerful social incentive for a "truce," leading the government to let the SoE expire without renewal, even if the underlying issues are unresolved.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The government controls the official narrative on violence and security threats, which it will use to justify its actions to the public and the Constitutional Court.
*   **Unpredictable Shocks:** An unrelated event (e.g., a major gang attack, a political scandal) could dramatically shift the government's focus and calculations regarding the protests and the SoE.

**Final Research Summary:** The current state of emergency is constitutionally set to expire before the resolution date. However, the President's hardline stance, the government's fiscal inflexibility, and the broader security crisis make a 30-day renewal highly plausible, shifting the likely outcome from zero towards the current 16 provinces.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the historical use of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, particularly under President Noboa. Given the current SoE covers 16 provinces, and considering the constitutional limit and historical patterns, a reasonable prior is centered around 0 provinces (assuming the SoE expires without renewal), with a fat tail allowing for the possibility of renewal in all 16 provinces. The variance is high due to the uncertainty of renewal.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to past SoEs in that it involves significant social unrest and government response. However, it differs due to the dual crises of social protests and gang violence, which could justify an extension. The hardline stance of President Noboa also suggests a higher likelihood of renewal compared to historical norms.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Noboa's framing of the protests as linked to organized crime and the ongoing security crisis increase the likelihood of renewal (↑).
   - Economic pressure from business sectors and the Constitutional Court's oversight decrease the likelihood of renewal (↓).
   - The net effect of these factors suggests a higher probability of renewal than the base rate alone would indicate.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 0 provinces, the evidence of a hardline government stance and dual crises shifts the posterior distribution towards a higher number of provinces under SoE. The likelihood of renewal in all 16 provinces becomes more probable, though not certain.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes the possibility of a partial renewal or a new SoE declared for different reasons. The proximity to Christmas could also influence a temporary de-escalation. The best alternative forecast might suggest fewer provinces if negotiations progress or the court intervenes.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted distribution reflects a significant probability of renewal, with the most likely outcomes being 0 or 16 provinces under SoE. The percentiles are adjusted to account for the possibility of partial renewal or complete expiration.

P10: 0  
P20: 0

P60: 16

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a mixture of two reference classes:

1. **Constitutional timing of the current SoE**: The current SoE was declared on October 4-6, 2025 for 60 days, meaning it would expire around December 4-6, 2025. The constitution allows for one 30-day extension, which would cover December 25, 2025.

2. **Historical patterns of SoEs in Ecuador**: President Noboa has shown a pattern of using SoEs broadly, including a nationwide SoE in January 2024. For protest-related SoEs, there's approximately a 20-30% chance they extend beyond 60 days based on historical patterns.

My prior distribution is bimodal:
- ~70% probability centered on 0 provinces (SoE expires without renewal)
- ~30% probability centered on 16 provinces (full renewal of current SoE)
- Small probability mass for partial renewals (1-15 provinces)

The mean of this prior is around 5 provinces, with high variance due to the bimodal nature.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The constitutional constraints are the same (60 days + possible 30-day extension)
- Indigenous-led protests against economic policies follow historical patterns
- The government's security-focused response is consistent with past approaches

**Key differences:**
- Noboa's rhetoric is unusually confrontational, framing protesters as linked to cartels
- The dual crisis of protests and gang violence creates a more complex security environment
- The severe fiscal constraints limit the government's ability to compromise on subsidies
- The timing places December 25th squarely within the potential 30-day extension period

These differences suggest a higher likelihood of SoE extension than the historical base rate would indicate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring higher numbers (SoE extension):**
- Government officials rejecting dialogue calls (Nov 10) - Strong evidence (~2x likelihood for extension)
- Framing protests as "narco-terrorism" - Strong evidence (~2x likelihood)
- Clashes between protesters and security forces (Oct 28) - Moderate evidence (~1.5x likelihood)
- Expansion of SoE from 10 to 16 provinces (Oct 6) - Moderate evidence (~1.5x likelihood)
- Fiscal inflexibility on subsidies - Moderate evidence (~1.5x likelihood)

**Evidence favoring lower numbers (SoE expiration):**
- Constitutional Court's preliminary statement (Nov 4) - Moderate evidence (~1.5x likelihood for expiration)
- Business associations calling for resolution (Oct 15) - Moderate evidence (~1.5x likelihood)
- Holiday period potentially encouraging a "truce" - Weak evidence (~1.2x likelihood)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior (70% chance of 0 provinces, 30% chance of 16 provinces), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - Government's hardline stance and rejection of dialogue:**
- Prior: P(0) = 0.7, P(16) = 0.3
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x in favor of extension
- Posterior: P(0) ≈ 0.54, P(16) ≈ 0.46

**Second update - Framing protests as terrorism and ongoing violence:**
- Prior: P(0) ≈ 0.54, P(16) ≈ 0.46
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8x in favor of extension
- Posterior: P(0) ≈ 0.38, P(16) ≈ 0.62

**Third update - Economic pressure and Constitutional Court oversight:**
- Prior: P(0) ≈ 0.38, P(16) ≈ 0.62
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3x in favor of expiration
- Posterior: P(0) ≈ 0.45, P(16) ≈ 0.55

After these updates, my distribution has shifted significantly toward extension, with the mode now at 16 provinces rather than 0.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the government's rhetoric versus its practical incentives to resolve the crisis
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of partial renewals (only extending in the most troubled provinces)
- The Constitutional Court's role could be more decisive than I've estimated
- The Christmas holiday timing might create stronger social pressure for resolution

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The government could lift the protest-related SoE but immediately declare a new one for security reasons
- A sudden breakthrough in negotiations could occur in early December
- The government might strategically reduce the scope to only the most troubled provinces (5-8)

Adjusting for these considerations, I should increase the probability of partial renewals and slightly decrease the probability of full renewal.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary reference class is the constitutional duration of a State of Emergency (SoE) in Ecuador. The current SoE was declared on October 4-6, 2025, for a 60-day period. This means it is scheduled to expire around December 4-6, 2025. The resolution date for this question is December 25, 2025, which is after the scheduled expiration.

Therefore, the base rate or prior assumption is that the SoE will have ended, and the number of provinces under an SoE will be **0**.

A secondary reference class is the history of SoEs for social protests in Ecuador. The research report notes that these tend to end via negotiated settlements and that the base rate for a protest-driven SoE lasting more than 60 days is low (~20%). This reinforces a prior centered heavily on 0.

My prior distribution is thus strongly skewed, with approximately 70-80% probability mass on 0 provinces, and the remaining 20-30% probability on a renewal, which would most likely be for the same 16 provinces. This creates a bimodal prior with a primary mode at 0 and a much smaller mode at 16.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The SoE is a response to indigenous-led protests against government economic policy, similar to major protests in 2019 and 2022.
*   The constitutional framework limiting SoEs to 60 days with a potential 30-day extension remains the same.
*   Significant economic pressure from business groups to find a resolution is a recurring feature.

**Differences:**
*   **Presidential Stance:** President Noboa's rhetoric is significantly more confrontational than his predecessors', immediately framing the protests as "narco-terrorism." This reduces the likelihood of a swift, negotiated end that would typify the base case.
*   **Fiscal Inflexibility:** The subsidy cuts are driven by severe fiscal constraints, giving the government very little room to make concessions, which is the primary historical off-ramp for these crises. This points towards a more protracted conflict.
*   **Dual Crises:** This protest is occurring amidst an ongoing national security crisis with drug gangs. This provides the government with greater political cover and public justification for extending emergency measures, blurring the lines between social protest and national security.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the evidence against two main hypotheses: H0 (the SoE expires as scheduled, resulting in 0 provinces) and H1 (the SoE is extended, resulting in ~16 provinces).

*   **(↑) Noboa's Hardline Rhetoric & Rejection of Talks:** This evidence is highly consistent with H1. A leader intending to maintain a security-focused approach is more likely to use such framing. This strongly increases the probability of an extension.
*   **(↑) Fiscal Inflexibility:** The government's inability to easily concede on the core issue of subsidies makes a prolonged standoff more likely, which in turn makes an extension of the SoE more likely to manage continued unrest. This is strong evidence for H1.
*   **(↑) Escalating Clashes & Expansion to 16 Provinces:** The government's initial response was to escalate its security posture. Continued clashes provide the direct legal justification needed to request an extension from the Constitutional Court. This supports H1.
*   **(↓) Economic Pressure from Business:** Daily losses of over $50 million create a powerful incentive for the government to de-escalate and find a solution, which would involve lifting the SoE. This is the strongest piece of evidence supporting H0.
*   **(↓) Constitutional Court Oversight:** The court's reminder that an extension must be justified acts as a potential brake on the executive. However, given the ongoing violence and the broader security crisis, the government can likely construct a plausible justification, making this a weak factor supporting H0.

Overall, the evidence pointing towards a prolonged conflict and therefore an extension (H1) appears stronger than the evidence pointing towards a quick resolution (H0).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior placed a ~70% chance on 0 provinces (H0) and a ~30% chance on an extension (H1).

*   **Prior Odds (H1/H0):** 0.3 / 0.7 ≈ 0.43

The combined likelihood of the evidence (hardline stance, fiscal issues vs. economic pressure) strongly favors H1. The factors suggesting a prolonged conflict seem more structural and persistent than the factors pushing for a quick resolution. I estimate the combined likelihood ratio to be around 3-to-1 in favor of H1.

*   **Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
*   **Posterior Odds ≈** 0.43 × 3.0 = 1.29

This translates to a posterior probability for H1 (extension) of `1.29 / (1 + 1.29) ≈ 56%`.

My posterior distribution has shifted dramatically. The initial prior favored 0 provinces. The posterior now slightly favors an extension. The distribution is now strongly bimodal, with roughly a 45% chance of 0 provinces and a 55% chance of a renewed SoE. The most likely outcome for a renewed SoE is the full 16 provinces.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is centered on a binary outcome: the SoE either expires (0) or is fully renewed (16). I could be missing two key scenarios:

1.  **Partial Renewal:** The government could try a compromise, renewing the SoE only in the 4-5 provinces with the most intense protests to appease the Constitutional Court and business leaders. This would result in a number between 1 and 15.
2.  **The "Christmas Truce":** The proximity to the holidays (the SoE expires in early December) creates a powerful social and economic incentive for all parties to de-escalate. The government might let the SoE expire as a goodwill gesture, even if the core issues are unresolved. This strengthens the case for the 0-province outcome.

Considering these points, the probability of 0 provinces might be closer to 50%. The hardline stance of the government still makes a full renewal very plausible. The bimodal shape of the distribution (modes at 0 and 16) remains the most critical feature. I will simplify my forecast to reflect this primary tension, acknowledging that the intermediate values are less likely than the two main outcomes. My final distribution is approximately 50% mass at 0 and 50% mass at 16.

### 6. Final Percentiles

This bimodal distribution, with roughly half the probability mass at 0 and half at 16, translates to the following percentiles. The large jump between the 40th and 60th percentiles captures the core uncertainty of the forecast.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 16
P80: 16
P90: 16
