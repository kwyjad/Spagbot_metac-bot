### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major New Domestic Technology Reporting Regimes:** This class includes instances where the US government has imposed novel, mandatory reporting or monitoring requirements on the domestic use of a critical, dual-use technology sector. Examples include aspects of the Patriot Act for telecommunications or Know Your Customer (KYC) rules for finance. Such regimes are rare, typically prompted by a major crisis, and face significant industry opposition.
    *   **Base Rate:** 10-15%. A new legal/regulatory framework of this magnitude is not passed lightly. A rate of 1-2 such regimes per decade seems plausible, giving a ~10-20% chance over a 2-year forecast horizon.
2.  **Expansion of Export Controls to Domestic Monitoring:** This class considers cases where restrictions on selling technology to foreign adversaries (like the existing GPU export controls) evolve into requirements to monitor the use of that same technology within the US. This is an exceptionally rare progression.
    *   **Base Rate:** <5%. Historically, export control regimes focus on the point of sale and transfer, not post-sale domestic usage, which is seen as a much greater intrusion on private enterprise.
3.  **Implementation of Major AI Governance Proposals:** This class looks at the rate at which ambitious AI governance proposals (e.g., liability for model harms, licensing regimes, compute thresholds) are translated into binding law or regulation. To date, the conversion rate is very low.
    *   **Base Rate:** 5-10%. While there is significant discussion, concrete, costly, and legally binding domestic AI governance remains largely theoretical in the US.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-31** GPU Diplomacy article notes continued tightening of export controls and workarounds (Nvidia's H20 chip), but focuses on international alliances, not domestic reporting. (↓) — The policy focus remains external (export-oriented), not internal (domestic monitoring), even in recent analyses.
*   **2025-05-21** Nvidia CEO labels US export controls a "failure," citing they spur Chinese competition. (↓) — Strong industry criticism from a key player signals high resistance to further, more intrusive regulations like domestic usage reporting.
*   **2024-12-11** CSIS analysis of updated export controls confirms the focus remains on restricting exports of specific high-end chips (A100, H100, Blackwell) and manufacturing equipment to China. (↓) — Reinforces that the primary regulatory tool and target (export to China) has not fundamentally shifted towards domestic surveillance.
*   **2023-10-30** President Biden signs the Executive Order (EO) on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI. (↑) — This is the most significant event. It directs the Commerce Dept. to propose regulations requiring IaaS providers to report when a foreign person trains a large model. This establishes a clear precedent and intent for monitoring compute usage.
*   **2023-10-18** The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) updates and tightens the Oct 2022 export controls. (↔) — Shows the administration's willingness to act decisively and iteratively on chip-related national security, but still within the export control paradigm.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Executive Action via Commerce Department:** The Biden AI EO explicitly tasks the Commerce Department with rulemaking on compute reporting for IaaS providers. This is the most plausible and direct path to a "YES" resolution, bypassing Congress. (Size: Large)
2.  **National Security "Focusing Event":** A catastrophic event linked to an unregulated AI model (e.g., a sophisticated cyberattack, AI-enabled bioterrorism) could create immense, immediate pressure for a legislative or regulatory response, overriding industry objections. (Size: Large, but low probability)
3.  **Industry Lobbying and Resistance:** Tech companies (Nvidia, cloud providers, etc.) will likely oppose broad reporting mandates, citing innovation drag, compliance costs, and technical complexity. Their influence could delay, weaken, or kill proposed rules. (Size: Moderate to Large)
4.  **Legislative Gridlock:** The high bar for passing a new "law" in a polarized Congress, especially with a presidential election cycle (2024) in the middle of the forecast period, makes a legislative solution highly improbable. (Size: Large)
5.  **Technical and Definitional Hurdles:** Defining "large numbers of GPUs" and "large AI models" in a future-proof way is difficult. A technically flawed or easily circumvented rule may be abandoned in favor of other approaches. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Executive Focus:** Unlike past technologies, AI has received direct, sustained attention from the White House, culminating in the comprehensive 2023 EO. This creates a strong top-down push for regulation absent in typical base rate cases.
*   **Existence of a Clear Chokepoint:** The AI supply chain is uniquely concentrated around a few high-end GPU manufacturers (primarily Nvidia). This makes monitoring hardware purchasers a technically more feasible regulatory target than for more diffuse technologies.
*   **Shift from "Hardware" to "Capability":** The policy concern is not the chip itself, but the computational capability it enables. This shifts the regulatory logic from simply controlling exports to potentially monitoring how that capability is used, a key difference from past export control regimes.
*   **The IaaS Provider Precedent:** The EO's focus on IaaS providers creates a specific, ongoing regulatory process. The core question is whether this will expand to cover *all* purchasers of large GPU clusters, not just cloud companies servicing foreign clients.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., ~10%) based on the rarity of new domestic technology surveillance regimes and the high bar for passing new laws.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The 2023 Biden AI EO is a powerful piece of evidence, creating a specific regulatory track and demonstrating clear executive intent to monitor compute.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time remaining (2 months) and the lack of any passed legislation to date makes a *new law* from Congress virtually impossible.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The EO's focus is on IaaS providers reporting *foreign* users, which is narrower than the question's scope of *all purchasers* reporting their usage. The final rule may not expand beyond this.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Sustained industry resistance and criticism (e.g., from Nvidia's CEO) creates significant headwinds against a broad, costly mandate.
*   **Net effect:** The EO significantly increased the probability from the initial base rate. However, the high bar of "US law," the narrowness of the EO's specific directive, and the extreme time constraint mean the posterior should be revised sharply downwards. The most likely path (a Commerce Dept. rule) may not resolve as YES because it might not be fully implemented by the deadline or may

To forecast the probability of the US requiring purchasers of large numbers of GPUs to report their usage before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for the implementation of major new domestic technology reporting regimes is approximately 10-15%. This is based on historical instances where the US government has imposed novel, mandatory reporting or monitoring requirements on critical technology sectors. Such regimes are rare and typically prompted by significant crises, facing substantial industry opposition.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the rarity and the high bar for such regulatory changes, we start with a prior probability of 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a critical technology (GPUs for AI) with significant national security implications, similar to past cases where new reporting regimes were considered.
- **Differences:** Unlike past cases, there is a strong executive focus on AI regulation, as evidenced by the 2023 Executive Order (EO) on AI. This EO directs the Commerce Department to propose regulations for reporting compute usage, which is a significant step towards monitoring.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **2023 Executive Order (EO):** This EO is a strong piece of evidence indicating executive intent to monitor compute usage. It increases the likelihood of regulatory action (Likelihood ratio > 1).
- **Industry Resistance:** Strong opposition from key industry players like Nvidia decreases the likelihood of broad reporting mandates being implemented (Likelihood ratio < 1).
- **Time Constraint:** With only two months remaining until the deadline, the likelihood of new legislation being passed is very low (Likelihood ratio < 1).
- **Focus on IaaS Providers:** The EO's focus on IaaS providers reporting foreign users is narrower than the question's scope, which decreases the likelihood of a broad mandate (Likelihood ratio < 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the EO as a significant positive factor but weighed against strong industry resistance, narrow focus, and time constraints, the overall likelihood ratio is less than 1.
- **Posterior Odds:** 1:9 × Likelihood ratio (estimated < 1) results in lower posterior odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is adjusted downwards from the prior, reflecting the significant barriers to implementation.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The initial base rate might be too high given the strong industry resistance and narrow focus of the EO.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden national security event could drastically change the regulatory landscape, but this is low probability.
- **Best Alternative Forecast:** A forecast of around 5% might be plausible, considering the strong barriers and time constraints.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, the final probability is adjusted to reflect the low likelihood of implementation within the given timeframe.

Final: 5%

# Will the US require purchasers of large numbers of GPUs to report their usage before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several reference classes:

1. **Major new domestic technology reporting regimes**: Cases where the US government has imposed mandatory reporting requirements on critical dual-use technologies. These are rare and typically follow major crises.
   - Base rate: ~10-15% over a 2-year period

2. **Expansion of export controls to domestic monitoring**: Cases where foreign-focused restrictions evolve into domestic monitoring requirements.
   - Base rate: <5% (historically rare progression)

3. **Implementation of major AI governance proposals**: Rate at which ambitious AI governance proposals become binding law.
   - Base rate: 5-10% (low conversion rate to date)

Given the specific nature of this question, I'll use a weighted average of these reference classes, with more weight on the first and third classes. This gives us a prior probability of approximately **10%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Involves regulation of dual-use technology with national security implications
- Faces similar industry resistance to new compliance burdens
- Requires defining technical thresholds that are difficult to specify in regulation

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented executive focus on AI regulation (Biden's 2023 EO)
- Highly concentrated supply chain around few GPU manufacturers creates a feasible regulatory chokepoint
- Shift from hardware export control to monitoring computational capability usage
- Existing regulatory process focused on IaaS providers reporting foreign users

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Biden's 2023 Executive Order on AI**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If such a requirement were to be implemented, it would almost certainly build on this EO
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - The EO could exist without expanding to all GPU purchasers
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Focus on IaaS providers reporting foreign users only**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If broader requirements were coming, we'd expect less narrow focus
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This narrow focus is consistent with not expanding to all purchasers
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Extremely short time remaining (2 months until 2026)**
- P(E|H): Very low (~0.1) - If this were to happen, we'd expect more visible progress by now
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - The lack of visible progress is consistent with no implementation
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Industry resistance (e.g., Nvidia CEO's criticism)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Resistance could exist even if requirements were implemented
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Resistance makes non-implementation more likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63 (decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10%/90% = 0.11

Update on Evidence 1 (Biden's EO):
- Posterior odds = 0.11 × 2.25 = 0.25
- Posterior probability = 0.25/(1+0.25) ≈ 20%

Update on Evidence 2 (Narrow IaaS focus):
- Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0625
- Posterior probability = 0.0625/(1+0.0625) ≈ 5.9%

Update on Evidence 3 (Time constraint):
- Posterior odds = 0.0625 × 0.11 = 0.00688
- Posterior probability = 0.00688/(1+0.00688) ≈ 0.7%

Update on Evidence 4 (Industry resistance):
- Posterior odds = 0.00688 × 0.63 = 0.00433
- Posterior probability = 0.00433/(1+0.00433) ≈ 0.4%

This seems excessively low, suggesting I may have overweighted some evidence. Let me reconsider.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis may have several flaws:

1. **Overweighting time constraints**: While time is short, regulatory processes can move quickly in response to executive priorities.

2. **Underestimating existing regulatory pathways**: The Commerce Department already has a mandate from the EO that could be expanded without new legislation.

3. **Definition ambiguity**: The question asks about "purchasers of large numbers of GPUs" reporting "their usage" - this could be satisfied by rules narrower than what I initially considered.

4. **Community forecast**: The Manifold market shows 18.1%, suggesting I may be missing something or underweighting certain factors.

Given these considerations, I should adjust upward from my calculated 0.4%. The most compelling adjustment factor is the existing regulatory pathway through the Commerce Department, which could be expanded from IaaS providers to other large purchasers.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the evidence, and the red team analysis, I believe the probability is higher than my calculated 0.4% but still quite low given the time constraints and lack of visible progress toward implementation.

The most likely scenario for a "YES" resolution would be an expansion of the Commerce Department's existing regulatory process under the EO, but even this faces significant hurdles in the short timeframe remaining.

Final: 8%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the establishment of a new, significant domestic technology reporting requirement by the US government. A suitable reference class is "major new domestic technology surveillance/reporting regimes." Examples include parts of the Patriot Act for telecommunications or Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules in finance. These are rare, typically occurring once or twice a decade, and usually in response to a major crisis. For a forecast period of roughly two years (the original timeframe of the question), this suggests a base rate of approximately 10-20%. I will select a prior of **15%**, acknowledging that while such laws are rare, the intense focus on AI governance makes it more likely than for a randomly chosen technology.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with AI and GPUs has key differences from the general base case of new tech regulation:
*   **Similarities:** Like most proposed regulations, this faces significant industry resistance (as noted by criticism from Nvidia's CEO) and must navigate a slow and often gridlocked political system.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Unprecedented Executive Focus:** The Biden Administration's October 2023 Executive Order (EO) on AI created a specific, top-down directive for federal agencies to act on AI safety and security, including monitoring compute. This provides a powerful non-legislative pathway and a clear signal of intent, making action more likely than in the base case.
    *   **National Security Framing:** The issue is primarily framed as a national security risk (preventing adversaries from developing dangerous AI), which can accelerate political and regulatory action compared to purely economic or social concerns.
    *   **Technical Chokepoint:** The high-end AI chip market is dominated by a few companies, primarily Nvidia. This concentration makes tracking and regulating large purchases technically more feasible than for more diffuse technologies.

These differences, especially the EO, suggest the probability should be significantly higher than the 15% base rate, at least when viewed from the start of the forecast period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence, considering its impact on the initial prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The October 2023 AI Executive Order.** This EO directed the Commerce Department to propose regulations for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers to report when a foreign person trains a large AI model.
    *   P(E | H): If the US were to implement broad GPU usage reporting (H), it is very likely that a preceding step would be an EO establishing a framework for a narrower, related type of reporting. This evidence is highly consistent with H.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the US were not going to implement broad reporting (~H), it is still plausible they would implement this narrower rule targeting foreign access. However, creating this entire regulatory track makes ~H less likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1 (Strongly Positive):** This EO is the single strongest piece of evidence in favor of the event. It created a direct regulatory pathway that bypasses Congress. After this EO, the probability would have justifiably increased significantly.

*   **Evidence 2: The Timeline. The resolution date is Dec 31, 2025. Today is Oct 30, 2025.**
    *   There are only two months remaining in the forecast period.
    *   P(E | H): If a new law or regulation were to be implemented (H), it is extremely unlikely that the process would not be complete with only two months to go. Passing a new law through Congress is impossible in this timeframe. The federal rulemaking process (proposal, public comment, finalization) takes many months.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no such law is coming (~H), it is 100% certain that we would be in the current state of not having a finalized law.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (Extremely Negative):** This is the most decisive piece of evidence. The lack of a finalized rule or even a formal proposal for a *broad* rule at this late stage is overwhelming evidence against the event occurring through normal channels.

*   **Evidence 3: The Scope of Current Regulatory Action.** The EO and the subsequent proposed rule from the Commerce Department focus on IaaS providers reporting on *foreign* persons. The question asks about a requirement for *all purchasers* to report their usage.
    *   This indicates the current regulatory momentum is aimed at a narrower, more politically palatable target (foreign access) rather than a broad domestic surveillance regime. This makes the specific event in the question less likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1 (Moderately Negative):** The current path of regulation is not aimed at the target defined in the question.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with Prior:** P(H) = 15%. (Odds ≈ 1 to 5.7)
2.  **Update with EO:** The EO was a strong positive signal. Let's say it increased the odds by a factor of 3, bringing the probability to ~35% in late 2023. This aligns with the initial surge in community forecasts.
3.  **Update with Timeline:** This is the critical update. The probability of a new law or a standard regulation being finalized in the next two months is near zero. My initial analysis based on this would drive the probability down to 1-2%.
4.  **Reconciliation with Market Data:** The community forecast is around 18-21%. This is far higher than my analysis suggests. This discrepancy implies I might be underweighting a non-standard, low-probability path to resolution. The most plausible such path is an emergency executive action that bypasses the normal rulemaking process, perhaps using authority under an act like IEEPA, justified by a sudden national security crisis. While the probability of this path is low, it is not zero.

To account for this tail risk, which the market may be pricing in, I will assign a small but non-trivial probability to this "emergency action" scenario. The standard paths (legislation, normal rulemaking) have a <1% chance. The emergency path might have a 4% chance.

Therefore, my posterior probability is the sum of these mutually exclusive paths.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My initial analysis, focusing on standard procedure, yielded a forecast of <2%. The community forecast of ~20% forced me to consider what I was missing. The most likely blind spot is the potential for the executive branch to use emergency powers or a novel interpretation of existing authority to bypass the slow, standard processes. This is a low-probability but high-impact scenario. My final forecast is still very bearish compared to the community, reflecting my belief that the timeline is a massive, almost insurmountable obstacle and that the community is likely anchored on outdated information. However, by raising my forecast from <2% to 5%, I am acknowledging the "unknown unknowns" and the possibility of non-standard government action that the market may be correctly identifying as a non-zero risk.

### Final Forecast
The primary barrier to a "YES" resolution is the extremely short timeline of two months. Standard legislative and regulatory processes are far too slow to conclude by the deadline. The only plausible, albeit highly unlikely, path is a sudden, emergency executive action that bypasses these processes. The probability of such an event is very low. I assess the combined probability of all paths leading to a "YES" resolution to be small.

Final: 5%
