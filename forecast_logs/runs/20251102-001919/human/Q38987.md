### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New US presidential administrations repealing the Executive Orders (EOs) of their predecessors from the opposing party.** This is a very common practice in modern, polarized US politics. For example, upon taking office, President Trump signed numerous EOs to reverse Obama-era policies, and President Biden did the same to reverse Trump-era policies. The base rate of a prominent, politically-charged EO from a prior administration being rescinded or fundamentally altered by a new administration of the opposite party within the first year is high.
    *   **Base Rate Estimate:** 70-85%. This is based on the historical pattern of "pen-and-phone" reversals over the last several presidential transitions.
2.  **Major deregulatory actions by new Republican administrations.** Republican platforms consistently advocate for reducing regulatory burdens to spur economic growth. A new Republican administration typically prioritizes repealing regulations established by the previous Democratic one, especially those perceived as hindering business or innovation.
    *   **Base Rate Estimate:** 80-95%. This reflects a core tenet of the party's ideology and a consistent pattern of behavior (e.g., Reagan, G.W. Bush, Trump's first term).
3.  **Persistence of national security-related regulations across administrations.** Regulations with a strong national security justification can sometimes survive a presidential transition, as the underlying threats are often viewed as non-partisan by the defense and intelligence communities.
    *   **Base Rate Estimate:** 30-50%. This is lower because while the *concerns* may be bipartisan, the specific *regulatory approach* often is not. A new administration may agree with the threat assessment but prefer a different, less burdensome solution.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-25** Details of Trump's "America's AI Action Plan" released, emphasizing deregulation, infrastructure, and competition with China. — ↓↓ — The plan's focus is diametrically opposed to the precautionary, reporting-heavy framework of Biden's EO, indicating the old rules have been superseded.
*   **2025-07-23** President Trump signs Executive Order 14179, "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence." — ↓↓↓ — The title and stated purpose of this new EO are a direct repudiation of the regulatory approach in EO 14110, making it exceptionally unlikely the reporting requirements remain.
*   **2024-11-14** Post-election analysis predicts a new Trump administration will likely repeal Biden's AI Executive Order and relax AI regulations. — ↓ — This source, now validated by the July 2025 events, confirms that the intent to repeal was clear from the outset.
*   **2023-12-02** While campaigning, Donald Trump vows to "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order...on day one." — ↓↓ — This establishes a clear, public, and personal commitment from Trump to eliminate the very order that contains the reporting requirements.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Executive Authority (↓, Large):** EOs can be undone by subsequent EOs. This is the simplest and most direct mechanism. Trump has a documented history of using EOs to rapidly reverse the policies of his predecessor. The provided sources confirm he has already done so in this case by January/July 2025.
2.  **Deregulatory Ideology (↓, Large):** The prevailing view within the Trump administration and the broader conservative movement is that regulations stifle innovation and harm US competitiveness. The reporting requirements are a prime example of the "red tape" this ideology targets.
3.  **Focus on Competition with China (↓, Moderate):** The administration's stated AI policy is framed around "winning the race" against China. The argument is that burdensome reporting requirements for US companies slow them down, effectively giving an advantage to Chinese rivals who operate without such constraints.
4.  **National Security Concerns (↑, Moderate):** This is the primary driver for a "Yes" outcome. The Pentagon and intelligence agencies may privately lobby the administration to retain some form of oversight on cutting-edge AI development to prevent catastrophic risks (e.g., AI-assisted bioweapons, autonomous cyberattacks). This is the most plausible reason some form of reporting might survive, even if the original EO is repealed.
5.  **Anti-"Woke AI" / Censorship Narrative (↓, Large):** Trump has explicitly linked Biden's AI EO to censorship. This political framing makes the order a high-priority target for repeal, moving it beyond a simple policy disagreement into the realm of culture war politics, which commands significant energy in his administration.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Explicit and Repeated Repeal Vows:** Unlike a generic regulation, Trump personally and publicly promised to cancel this specific EO. This elevates its repeal from a standard administrative clean-up to a fulfilled campaign promise.
2.  **Existence of a Detailed Replacement Plan:** The provided sources show that the Trump administration didn't just repeal the old order; it implemented a comprehensive, alternative "AI Action Plan" with its own EOs. This plan's philosophy (deregulation, removing barriers) is fundamentally incompatible with the specific reporting requirements in question.
3.  **Novelty and Salience of AI Risk:** The national security risks from AI are novel and potentially existential. This could give security-focused advisors more leverage than in typical deregulatory debates (e.g., over environmental rules), creating a stronger-than-usual argument for keeping the rules. However, the evidence suggests this argument has not won out.
4.  **Specificity of Resolution Criteria:** The question requires an exact match of the reporting rules (FLOPs threshold, activities, weights, red-teaming). Even if a Trump administration implemented a lighter-touch reporting scheme for national security reasons, it would likely not meet these precise and comprehensive criteria, leading to a "No" resolution.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a base rate of new administrations reversing major EOs from their predecessor (~80% probability of repeal), the initial prior for "Yes" (the requirements remain) should be low, perhaps around 20% (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Trump's 2023 campaign promise to "cancel" the EO: ↓ (Large)
    *   The Nov 2024 analysis predicting repeal: ↓ (Moderate confirmation of intent)
    *   The July 2025 issuance of EO 14179 "Removing Barriers...": ↓↓ (Very Large, this is direct action confirming the promise)
    *   The details of the "AI Action Plan" focusing on deregulation and competition: ↓↓ (Very Large, this replaces the old framework entirely)
    *   The absence of any mention of the specific reporting requirements in the new plan: ↓ (Large, omission is strong evidence)
    *   The counter-argument from national security agencies: ↑ (Small, this force exists but appears to have been overridden by the political and ideological agenda)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is a cascade of strong updates in the same direction (down). The posterior probability for "Yes" should be revised significantly downward from the already low prior, likely into the very low single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   A major, publicly acknowledged AI-related national security incident or near-miss.
    *   Statements from the Secretary of Defense or Director of National Intelligence expressing grave concern about unregulated AI development.
    *   Leaked reports of the Commerce Department re-establishing a similar reporting framework under a new name, citing national security authorities.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   Official announcement of the formal rescission of EO 14110, if not already public.
    *   Public praise from AI industry leaders and venture capitalists for the administration's "pro-innovation" stance.
    *   White House officials explicitly mocking the Biden-era reporting rules as bureaucratic and ineffective.

### Caveats & pitfalls
1.  **Re-implementation Risk:** The administration could repeal EO 14110 but later re-implement functionally identical requirements under a different authority (e.g., a new national security directive). While unlikely to match the resolution criteria exactly, this is the most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution.
2.  **Definitional Specificity:** The resolution criteria are a very high bar. Any replacement regulation would need to include all three specific reporting elements (activities, weights, red-teaming) and the compute threshold. A watered-down version resolves "No."
3.  **Source Interpretation:** The analysis relies heavily on the provided future-dated sources. It assumes they are accurate descriptions of the policy landscape in mid-2025. The conclusion is contingent on this assumption.
4.  **Bureaucratic Inertia:** While an EO can be rescinded instantly, the underlying regulations and reporting mechanisms built by agencies (like the Department of Commerce) can have inertia. However, a determined White House can overcome this within a year.
5.  **Black Swan Event:** A catastrophic event (e.g., an AI-enabled terror attack) between now and Dec 31, 2025, could dramatically and unpredictably shift the political calculus, potentially leading to a snap re-imposition of strict regulations.

**Final Research Summary:**
The evidence provided, combined with established patterns of presidential transitions and party ideology, points overwhelmingly to

To forecast the probability of whether AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place in the US at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Estimate:** The base rate for a new administration from the opposing party repealing a predecessor's executive order is high, around 70-85%. This is based on historical patterns of executive orders being reversed by subsequent administrations, especially when there is a change in party control.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the high base rate of reversal, the initial prior probability that the reporting requirements will remain in place is low, around 20%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The situation is similar to past instances where new administrations have reversed executive orders from the previous administration, particularly when there is a change in party control.
- **Difference:** The specific focus on AI and national security might provide some resistance to change, but the evidence suggests this has not been a significant factor in this case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Trump's Campaign Promise:** Trump explicitly promised to cancel Biden's AI executive order. This is strong evidence against the requirements remaining (Likelihood ratio: very low for requirements remaining if Trump is elected).
- **Post-Election Analysis:** Predictions that a Trump administration would repeal the order further support the likelihood of repeal (Likelihood ratio: low for requirements remaining).
- **Issuance of EO 14179:** The issuance of a new executive order focused on deregulation and removing barriers is direct evidence of the repeal (Likelihood ratio: very low for requirements remaining).
- **National Security Concerns:** While there is a potential argument for maintaining some oversight due to national security, the evidence suggests this has not been prioritized (Likelihood ratio: slightly higher for requirements remaining, but not enough to outweigh other evidence).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 20% probability translates to odds of 1:4.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a repeal, with likelihood ratios significantly favoring the "No" outcome.
- **Posterior Odds:** Given the strong evidence against the requirements remaining, the posterior odds are much lower than the prior odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability for the requirements remaining is very low, likely in the low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a significant national security event that could shift priorities, but current evidence does not support this.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where national security concerns override the deregulatory agenda is possible but not supported by current evidence.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strong evidence and lack of significant counter-evidence, no major adjustment is necessary.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Based on the analysis, the probability that the AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected is very low.

Final: 3%

# Forecasting: AI Foundation Model Reporting Requirements Under Trump

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to estimate the probability that Trump, if elected in 2024, would maintain Biden's AI foundation model reporting requirements through the end of 2025.

The most relevant base rate is the frequency with which new presidents from opposing parties maintain their predecessor's executive orders, especially those related to regulation. Looking at recent transitions:

- When Trump took office in 2017, he rapidly reversed many Obama-era executive orders
- When Biden took office in 2021, he quickly reversed many Trump-era executive orders
- This pattern extends further back, with presidents typically using executive authority to undo predecessor policies they campaigned against

**Prior probability:** I estimate a base rate of approximately 15% that a politically salient executive order from a previous administration survives the first year of a new administration from the opposing party. This is especially true for regulatory requirements that the incoming president has specifically criticized.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This involves an executive order that can be unilaterally rescinded by a new president
- The order imposes regulatory requirements on industry, which Republican administrations typically seek to reduce
- Trump has explicitly campaigned against this specific executive order

**Differences from base case:**
- AI regulation has national security implications, which sometimes transcend partisan divides
- The reporting requirements specifically target dual-use foundation models with potential weapons applications
- The technology is rapidly evolving, potentially creating new security concerns by 2025

These differences might slightly increase the probability of retention compared to a typical regulatory executive order, but the explicit campaign promise to cancel this specific order is a strong countervailing factor.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit campaign promise**
- Trump stated on December 2, 2023: "When I'm reelected, I will cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order and ban the use of AI to censor the speech of American citizens on day one."
- P(E|H): If the requirements remain in place, it's very unlikely (~0.1) Trump would have made such a specific promise to cancel them
- P(E|~H): If the requirements are canceled, this statement is exactly what we'd expect (probability ~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability of the requirements remaining

**Evidence 2: Trump's historical approach to regulation**
- During his first term, Trump consistently prioritized deregulation across industries
- P(E|H): If the requirements remain, this would be inconsistent with his established governing philosophy (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If the requirements are canceled, this aligns perfectly with his established approach (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: National security implications of AI**
- The reporting requirements specifically target models that could enable weapons development or cyber attacks
- P(E|H): If requirements remain, it would likely be justified on national security grounds (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): Even if requirements are canceled, national security concerns about AI would still exist (~0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (Trump's explicit promise):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability: 0.019/(1+0.019) = 1.9%

Second update (Trump's regulatory approach):
- Prior odds: 0.019
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.019 × 0.33 = 0.006
- Posterior probability: 0.006/(1+0.006) = 0.6%

Third update (National security implications):
- Prior odds: 0.006
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 0.006 × 1.6 = 0.0096
- Posterior probability: 0.0096/(1+0.0096) = 0.95%

After considering all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the influence of the national security establishment in maintaining some oversight of AI development
- The specific requirements might be maintained but under a different executive order or framework
- Unforeseen AI-related security incidents between election and end of 2025 could change the calculus

**Alternative scenario:**
The most plausible alternative is that after initial repeal, a significant AI security incident occurs, prompting the administration to reinstate some form of oversight. However, even in this scenario, it's unlikely the exact same reporting requirements would be reinstated verbatim.

**Tail risks:**
- A major AI-enabled national security incident occurs before the end of 2025
- Intelligence agencies present compelling classified evidence that removing these requirements would create immediate security vulnerabilities

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low. I'll adjust upward slightly to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that if Trump is elected president in 2024, there is approximately a 3% chance that the AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place in the US at the end of 2025.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the reversal of a predecessor's Executive Orders (EOs) by a new US presidential administration from the opposing political party. This is a very common practice. For instance, President Trump reversed many of President Obama's EOs, and President Biden subsequently reversed many of President Trump's. These reversals are especially common for politically salient orders that impose regulatory burdens, as EO 14110 does on the AI industry.

Based on this historical pattern, the probability of a major EO from a prior administration being rescinded or fundamentally altered by a new administration of the opposite party is high. A reasonable estimate for such a reversal is around 80%. Therefore, the base rate for the requirements *remaining in place* (the "Yes" outcome for this question) is the complement.

*   **Prior Probability P(H):** 20% (where H is the event "the requirements remain in place").
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.20 / 0.80 = 1:4 in favor of the requirements being repealed.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The policy was enacted via Executive Order, which is the easiest presidential action for a successor to undo.
*   The policy imposes regulations on a major industry, a typical target for a Republican administration's deregulatory agenda.
*   The issue of AI regulation has become politically charged, increasing the likelihood that a new administration would want to make a statement by reversing the prior policy.

**Differences:**
*   **Explicit Repeal Promise:** Unlike a generic policy, Donald Trump has personally and publicly promised to "cancel" this specific EO. This elevates its repeal from a routine administrative action to the fulfillment of a specific, high-profile campaign promise, making repeal *more* likely than the base case.
*   **National Security Angle:** The EO is justified on national security grounds (e.g., preventing AI-assisted CBRN weapon design). Policies with a strong national security rationale sometimes have more bipartisan support and can survive transitions. This is the primary factor that makes the requirements *more* likely to remain than the base case.
*   **High Specificity of Resolution:** The question requires the *exact* reporting requirements (compute thresholds, types of information) to remain in place. A new administration could repeal the EO but implement its own, slightly different reporting scheme for national security reasons. Such a scenario would resolve "No," making a "Yes" outcome much more difficult to achieve than a simple continuation of "some regulation."

On balance, the explicit promise to repeal and the high bar of the resolution criteria are stronger factors than the general national security concerns, suggesting the probability should be even lower than the 20% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The research report provides several key pieces of evidence, including hypothetical future events that we must treat as given for this forecast.

*   **Evidence 1: Trump's Campaign Vow (Dec 2023):** "I will cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order...on day one."
    *   P(E | H): The probability of him making this specific, public vow if the requirements were to remain in place is very low. It would require him to break a clear promise.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of him making this vow if he intends to repeal the requirements is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H (repeal). This evidence significantly decreases the probability of "Yes".

*   **Evidence 2: New EO 14179 "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence" (July 2025):** The report states this new EO is signed by President Trump.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of a new EO with this title and deregulatory purpose being signed while the old, burdensome reporting requirements remain is extremely low. It's a direct contradiction.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is the exact mechanism one would expect to see for a repeal. The probability of this EO being signed, given the requirements are being removed, is extremely high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H. This is powerful evidence that drives the probability of "Yes" toward zero.

*   **Evidence 3: "America's AI Action Plan" (July 2025):** The report describes this new plan as emphasizing deregulation and competition with China.
    *   This provides the policy context. A framework focused on deregulation is fundamentally incompatible with the specific, precautionary reporting requirements of EO 14110.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the update process conceptually.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:4 against the requirements remaining.
2.  **Apply Evidence 1 (Campaign Vow):** This is a strong indicator of intent. It significantly lengthens the odds against the requirements remaining, perhaps to 1:40. This corresponds to a probability drop from 20% to ~2.5%.
3.  **Apply Evidence 2 & 3 (New EO and Action Plan):** This is not just intent; it is the described action of repeal and replacement. This evidence is nearly definitive. The likelihood of observing this action if the old rules remained is close to zero. Applying this evidence shifts the odds dramatically further. If the previous odds were 1:40, and this new evidence has a likelihood ratio of, say, 100:1 in favor of repeal, the new odds become 1:4000.
    *   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 4000) ≈ 0.025%.

The evidence provided in the research report, which describes events up to July 2025, is so conclusive that it drives the probability to be extremely low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is extremely low. What could make it wrong?

*   **The Strongest Case for "Yes":** The most plausible scenario for a "Yes" outcome is a "black swan" event. A catastrophic AI-related national security incident (e.g., an AI-enabled terrorist attack or a major cyberattack on critical infrastructure) could occur between July 2025 (when the repeal happens in the hypothetical timeline) and the resolution date of December 31, 2025. Such an event could trigger a political panic, forcing the Trump administration to perform an emergency reversal and reinstate the *exact* previous regulations as a stop-gap measure.
*   **Plausibility of this Scenario:** While a major AI incident is possible, the political reaction being the reinstatement of the *exact same rules* is less certain. Furthermore, such a catastrophic event occurring in that specific 5-month window is a low-probability event itself.
*   **Bureaucratic Inertia/Resistance:** Could the national security apparatus (DoD, Intelligence Community) quietly force the requirements to be maintained against the President's wishes? This is highly unlikely in a Trump administration known for its focus on presidential authority and its skepticism of the permanent bureaucracy. Even if they did, they would likely modify the rules, which would trigger a "No" resolution due to the specificity criteria.

Considering these tail risks, a probability of virtually zero is too confident. The "black swan" scenario, while remote, is the primary source of remaining uncertainty. A small, single-digit probability is appropriate to account for this possibility.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate strongly suggests a new administration would repeal this EO. Trump's specific, public promises to do so make it even more likely. The provided research report contains a timeline where the repeal and replacement with a deregulatory framework has already occurred by July 2025. This makes the probability of the requirements remaining in place by the end of 2025 exceptionally low. The only remaining uncertainty comes from the small possibility of a catastrophic event forcing a rapid policy reversal. I will assign a probability of 2% to account for this tail risk.

Final: 2%
