### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Peaceful, negotiated transfers of sovereignty of large, populated, autonomous territories between allied Western democracies (post-1945):** This is the most precise reference class. The base rate is effectively 0%. There are no modern precedents for a country like Denmark selling a self-governing territory and its population to an ally like the United States. This type of transaction is considered a relic of the colonial era and is contrary to modern principles of self-determination.
2.  **US acquisitions of foreign territory by purchase:** The US has a history of such purchases, including the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Florida Purchase (1819), the Gadsden Purchase (1854), the Alaska Purchase (1867), and the Danish West Indies (now the US Virgin Islands) in 1917. This class yields a non-zero base rate, but its relevance is extremely low. The last occurrence was over a century ago, in a vastly different geopolitical era before modern international norms of self-determination were established for such territories.
3.  **Serious public proposals for major territorial transfers between Western powers:** This class includes instances where the idea was floated but did not proceed to formal negotiations. President Trump's 2019 inquiry is the primary example. The base rate for such proposals advancing to *formal negotiations* is also near 0%, as the 2019 event itself failed immediately.

**Conclusion:** The relevant base rate is extremely low, bordering on zero. Historical analogs are from a pre-modern international system and are poor guides.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The question's horizon is very short (today is 2025-11-23, resolution is 2026-01-01). The most critical recent event is the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election. This brief assumes Donald Trump won the election and will be inaugurated in January 2025, as his personal interest is the sole originator of this question.

- **[2025-01-20] (projected)** Donald Trump inaugurated as US President. **(↑)** — The only significant actor known to be interested in this proposal now holds the executive power to pursue it, moving it from pure speculation to a remote possibility.
- **[2024-2025]** Continued US diplomatic and economic engagement in Greenland. **(↓)** — The US has focused on conventional diplomacy (e.g., consulate in Nuuk, aid packages) to counter Russian/Chinese influence, reinforcing a partnership model, not a purchase model.
- **[2024-2025]** Consistent statements from Greenlandic and Danish politicians emphasizing partnership and rejecting sales. **(↓)** — There has been no softening of the "absurd" and "not for sale" rhetoric from 2019. Any recent statement on the matter has reaffirmed this position.
- **[2025-11-01] (hypothetical)** No mention of Greenland purchase in Trump's transition team policy papers or initial foreign policy statements. **(↓)** — The lack of any preparatory work or signaling in the 10 months since inauguration suggests this is not a priority and no groundwork has been laid.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Donald Trump's Personal Interest & Transactional Worldview (Large ↑):** The primary, and arguably only, driver for a "Yes" outcome. His demonstrated willingness to break with diplomatic norms and view foreign relations in real estate terms makes the initial proposal conceivable.
2.  **Greenlandic Self-Determination & National Identity (Large ↓):** Greenland has a home-rule government and a strong independence movement. The political discourse is about achieving *more* sovereignty from Denmark, not transferring it to the US. A sale would be seen as a colonial act and is politically toxic.
3.  **Danish Political & Public Consensus (Large ↓):** There is zero political appetite in Denmark for selling Greenland. It would be viewed as an abrogation of responsibility and a national humiliation. Any government proposing this would likely fall.
4.  **US Strategic Interest in the Arctic (Small ↑):** Greenland is vital for US military posture (Pituffik Space Base) and for monitoring Russian/Chinese activity in the Arctic. This provides a *motive* for deeper US involvement, but a purchase is the most extreme and least likely method to secure these interests.
5.  **Greenland's Economic Dependence on Denmark (Small ↑):** Greenland receives an annual block grant from Denmark, constituting a large portion of its budget. A massive US offer could theoretically be framed as a path to economic independence, but this is a weak driver given the overwhelming political and cultural opposition.
6.  **International Norms & Precedent (Moderate ↓):** Such a transfer would be highly destabilizing to the post-WWII international order. It would be met with widespread condemnation and could set precedents that other powers (e.g., China, Russia) might exploit.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Inhabitant Agency:** Unlike the sparsely populated Alaska of 1867 or the colonial subjects of the Danish West Indies in 1917, Greenland has a distinct national identity, a democratically elected government, and a population that would demand a say in its future. Their consent is a prerequisite, and it is not forthcoming.
- **Nature of the Seller:** The Kingdom of Denmark is a stable, wealthy, modern social democracy and a NATO ally. It is not a state in distress or a colonial power looking to divest itself of a burdensome colony in the early 20th-century sense.
- **The Proposer's Style:** The proposal's origin is not from a deliberative state department process but from the unique transactional foreign policy approach of a single leader, Donald Trump. This makes it both more likely to be floated and less likely to be supported by the necessary diplomatic and political machinery.
- **Geopolitical Context:** The acquisition would occur in the context of great power competition in the Arctic. While this provides a strategic rationale, it also means that other forms of partnership and alliance-strengthening are more conventional and less disruptive tools of statecraft.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with a prior rooted in the "no modern precedent" reference class, suggesting a probability near zero (e.g., <0.5%). This reflects an "n" equivalent to observing hundreds of similar dyads (allied Western democracies with autonomous territories) with zero instances of such transfers.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **(↑ Large)** The presence of a US President with a known, personal, and unconventional interest in the topic. This is the single most important factor preventing the probability from being a true zero.
    - **(↓ Large)** The unified, absolute, and politically non-negotiable opposition from both the Greenlandic and Danish governments and populations. This is a structural barrier.
    - **(↓ Moderate)** The complete lack of any recent signaling, diplomatic groundwork, or public discussion to prepare for such a radical policy shift, even with a friendly US administration in power for nearly a year.
    - **(↓ Moderate)** The availability of simpler, more effective tools (diplomatic, economic, military agreements) for the US to secure its strategic interests in Greenland without the political fallout of a purchase.
- **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the near-zero prior. The single upward driver (Trump's interest) is powerful but is pitted against insurmountable structural, political, and cultural barriers. The posterior should remain extremely low, likely below 1%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
Given the extremely short timeline (resolution by 2026-01-01), any signal would need to be immediate and dramatic.

- **UP indicators:**
    - Public statements from President Trump or the Secretary of State explicitly mentioning a desire to open negotiations.
    - Appointment of a special envoy to Copenhagen or Nuuk with a mandate related to "the future status of Greenland."
    - Leaks of a formal, multi-billion dollar offer being prepared or transmitted to the Danish government.
    - An unforeseen, catastrophic economic crisis in Denmark that would make a US offer financially compelling (extremely unlikely).

- **DOWN indicators:**
    - The end-of-year holidays pass with no mention of the topic from any party.
    - US officials announce a new long-term strategic partnership or defense agreement with Denmark regarding Greenland, cementing the status quo.
    - Danish and Greenlandic leaders make preemptive statements in December 2025 ruling out any such discussions.
    - Continued silence on the issue from the White House.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Definitional Ambiguity of "Formal Negotiations":** While the term implies official, high-level talks, a low-level exploratory conversation could be mischaracterized or leaked to appear more significant than it is. The resolution criteria seem to require an official announcement, which mitigates this risk.
- **"Black Swan" Event:** The primary risk is underestimating the disruptive potential of a second Trump administration. An unpredictable, highly personalized offer could be made, bypassing all normal channels.
- **Assumption of Rationality:** This analysis assumes that Danish and Greenlandic political actors will continue to act according to their stated preferences and national interests. It does not account for potential coercion or unforeseen leverage the US might apply.
- **Information Gaps:** Secret, back-channel discussions are possible, though extremely unlikely to remain secret or progress to a formal announcement without any preceding public signals.
- **Election Assumption:** This entire brief is predicated on a Trump victory in 2024. If this assumption is incorrect, the probability is functionally zero.

**Final Research Summary:** The transfer of Greenland's sovereignty is a political impossibility due to the resolute opposition of the Greenlandic and Danish people and governments, which is rooted in modern principles of self-determination. The sole driver is the personal interest of a single US leader, which is insufficient to overcome these fundamental structural barriers, making the announcement of formal negotiations before 2026 an event of extremely low probability.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this event is derived from the reference class of "peaceful, negotiated transfers of sovereignty of large, populated, autonomous territories between allied Western democracies (post-1945)." The base rate for such events is effectively 0% as there are no modern precedents for such a transfer. This reflects the modern principles of self-determination and the lack of historical examples in the post-World War II era.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a large, autonomous territory (Greenland) under the sovereignty of a Western democracy (Denmark), similar to the reference class.
   - Differences: The unique factor here is the personal interest of a US President (Donald Trump) in acquiring Greenland, which is not a common driver in historical cases. However, the strong opposition from Greenlandic and Danish governments and the lack of any diplomatic groundwork make this situation align closely with the base case of no transfers.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Donald Trump's Interest (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H))**: Trump's interest slightly increases the probability, but the lack of any formal action or groundwork significantly limits its impact.
   - **Greenlandic and Danish Opposition (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H))**: The strong and consistent opposition from both Greenland and Denmark decreases the probability significantly.
   - **Lack of Diplomatic Groundwork (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H))**: The absence of any preparatory diplomatic actions or public statements further decreases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: Near 0% (effectively 0.005 or lower).
   - Likelihood ratio: The evidence overwhelmingly supports the status quo, with the opposition and lack of groundwork being strong negative indicators.
   - Posterior odds: Remain near 0% after considering the evidence.
   - Posterior probability: The probability remains extremely low, likely below 1%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The analysis considers the unique factor of Trump's interest but weighs it against substantial structural barriers.
   - Tail Risks: A sudden, unexpected geopolitical crisis or shift in Danish politics could alter the landscape, but these are highly unlikely within the short timeframe.
   - Alternative Forecast: A scenario where Trump makes a dramatic, public offer could increase the probability slightly, but without Danish and Greenlandic cooperation, it remains implausible.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the overwhelming evidence against the likelihood of formal negotiations and the short timeframe, the final probability remains extremely low.

Final: 0.5%

# Will the US and Denmark announce formal negotiations over the transfer of Greenland's sovereignty before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class of similar historical events. The most relevant reference class would be:

**Peaceful transfers of sovereignty of large, populated territories between Western democracies in the modern era (post-WWII)**

This reference class has essentially zero occurrences. There have been no cases where a Western democracy has sold or transferred a populated, autonomous territory to another Western democracy in the post-WWII era.

A slightly broader reference class might be:
**US territorial acquisitions by purchase**

This includes Louisiana Purchase (1803), Florida (1819), Gadsden Purchase (1854), Alaska (1867), and the US Virgin Islands (1917). However, all of these occurred in a completely different geopolitical era before modern norms of self-determination.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prior probability would be extremely low, around **0.1%**. This reflects the absence of any modern precedent and the fundamental incompatibility with contemporary international norms.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Greenland has strategic value to the US (as did Alaska and other historical purchases)
- The US maintains military presence in Greenland (Thule Air Base)
- The US has expressed interest in Greenland's natural resources

**Critical differences:**
- Modern international norms strongly oppose territorial transfers without population consent
- Greenland has home rule government with its own national identity and aspirations for independence
- Denmark is a wealthy, stable NATO ally, not a financially distressed or colonial power
- Greenland's population (mostly Inuit) has clear rights to self-determination under international law
- The proposal stems from a single US leader's personal interest, not a strategic consensus

These differences fundamentally alter the probability calculation, making it vastly less likely than historical territorial purchases.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Donald Trump's previous interest in purchasing Greenland**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were to be announced, Trump's previous interest would be highly expected (≈0.9)
- P(E|~H): Even without negotiations, Trump's previous interest exists (=1)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/1 = 0.9 (slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 2: Consistent Danish and Greenlandic rejection of the idea**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were to be announced, we would expect some softening of this position (≈0.1)
- P(E|~H): Without negotiations, continued rejection is expected (≈0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 ≈ 0.11 (strongly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: No preparatory diplomatic work or signals in 2025**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were imminent, we would expect to see preparatory signals (≈0.05)
- P(E|~H): Without negotiations, no signals is the expected state (≈0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 ≈ 0.05 (strongly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Very short timeframe remaining (only about 5 weeks until 2026)**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were to be announced, a compressed timeline is possible but unlikely (≈0.2)
- P(E|~H): Without negotiations, the short remaining time is expected (=1)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/1 = 0.2 (moderately decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.001/0.999 ≈ 0.001

Updating with Evidence 2 (Danish/Greenlandic rejection):
Posterior odds = 0.001 × 0.11 ≈ 0.00011
Posterior probability ≈ 0.00011/(1 + 0.00011) ≈ 0.011%

Updating with Evidence 3 (No diplomatic preparation):
Posterior odds = 0.00011 × 0.05 ≈ 0.0000055
Posterior probability ≈ 0.0000055/(1 + 0.0000055) ≈ 0.00055%

Updating with Evidence 4 (Short timeframe):
Posterior odds = 0.0000055 × 0.2 ≈ 0.0000011
Posterior probability ≈ 0.0000011/(1 + 0.0000011) ≈ 0.00011%

This extremely low probability reflects the combined weight of evidence against this outcome.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating Trump's willingness to make dramatic, unexpected diplomatic moves
- There could be secret back-channel discussions already underway
- A major geopolitical crisis could emerge in the next month that changes calculations
- Denmark might face an unforeseen economic crisis requiring immediate funds

**Alternative scenario:**
The most plausible alternative is that Trump makes a unilateral announcement expressing desire for negotiations, which Denmark immediately rejects. This wouldn't constitute "formal negotiations" but could create confusion.

**Adjustment:**
Given the possibility of truly unexpected events and the inherent uncertainty in human affairs, I should avoid probabilities that are effectively zero. A minimal probability floor of 0.05% seems appropriate.

## 6. Final Forecast

The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that formal negotiations over Greenland's transfer will not be announced before 2026. The combination of Danish and Greenlandic opposition, lack of diplomatic groundwork, extremely short timeframe, and fundamental incompatibility with modern international norms makes this outcome exceedingly unlikely.

Final: 0.05%

Here is my probabilistic reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the announcement of formal negotiations for the transfer of sovereignty of a populated, autonomous territory between two allied, developed, democratic nations.

The most appropriate reference class is "peaceful, negotiated transfers of sovereignty of populated, autonomous territories between allied Western democracies since World War II." The historical frequency of such events in this class is zero. The international order established after WWII, based on principles of self-determination, makes such transactions, which are reminiscent of the colonial era, politically and normatively unacceptable.

A broader, less relevant reference class is "US territorial purchases." The last such purchase was the Danish West Indies (now the US Virgin Islands) in 1917, over a century ago in a vastly different geopolitical era. This class is not a good guide for the present situation.

Given the complete lack of modern precedent, the base rate for such an event is extremely low. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **0.5%**. This reflects that the event is not a logical impossibility but is historically unprecedented in the modern world. In odds, this is 1:199.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case (the post-WWII international system) in that Denmark is a stable, wealthy NATO ally, and Greenland has a home-rule government with a strong national identity and aspirations for greater independence, not a transfer of sovereignty.

The primary difference, and the sole reason this question is being considered, is the specific interest of a single political leader, Donald Trump. His transactional approach to foreign policy and his public expression of interest in 2019 moves this from a purely hypothetical event to one that has at least been contemplated at the highest level of the US government. This unique factor makes the situation deviate from the standard base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that formal negotiations are announced before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Donald Trump's known personal interest.** (Assumed to be in power per the research report's framing).
    *   This is the primary driver for a "Yes" outcome. The probability of this event happening without his specific interest is virtually zero. Therefore, his interest is a necessary condition.
    *   P(E | H) is very high (≈1). P(E | ~H) is also high, as his interest doesn't guarantee success (as seen in 2019).
    *   The likelihood ratio is greater than 1. This evidence significantly increases the probability from the base rate of "any random year/president." It's the main reason the probability isn't 0.001%.

*   **Evidence 2: Unanimous and forceful rejection from Danish and Greenlandic political leadership.**
    *   In 2019, the idea was called "absurd" and Greenland was declared "not for sale." There has been no change in this stance. For negotiations to be announced, a complete political reversal would be needed in both Copenhagen and Nuuk.
    *   P(E | H) is very low. We would not expect to see continued, firm public rejection if a secret deal was about to be announced.
    *   P(E | ~H) is very high. This is the expected state of affairs if no negotiations are happening.
    *   The likelihood ratio is much less than 1, providing a strong update downwards.

*   **Evidence 3: The extremely short timeline.**
    *   The question resolves on January 1, 2026. The current date is November 23, 2025, leaving approximately five weeks.
    *   P(E | H) is extremely low. A diplomatic agreement of this magnitude would require extensive, secret groundwork over many months or years. To initiate and conclude this groundwork and then make a formal announcement in five weeks is almost inconceivable.
    *   P(E | ~H) is very high. The lack of any preceding rumors, leaks, or diplomatic signals is perfectly consistent with the event not occurring.
    *   The likelihood ratio is very close to zero, providing the strongest update downwards.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 0.5% (odds of 1:199), the evidence of Trump's interest is the only factor pushing the probability up. Let's say it makes the event 10-20 times more likely than under a generic president, moving the odds to roughly 1:10 (a ~9% probability).

However, this is completely overwhelmed by the countervailing evidence. The unified Danish/Greenlandic opposition is a massive structural barrier. More importantly, the five-week timeline makes the necessary political and diplomatic shifts virtually impossible. Any rational diplomatic process is already ruled out by the clock. The only remaining path is a sudden, shocking, "black swan" announcement. The probability of such a complex event, requiring the agreement of three separate governments (US, Denmark, Greenland), materializing out of nowhere in five weeks is minuscule. The downward updates from the political opposition and the timeline are severe, likely reducing the odds by a factor of 100 or more.

The final posterior probability must be very low, reflecting that a highly improbable alignment of political will and events would need to occur in an exceptionally short period.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary argument against my low forecast is that I am underestimating the disruptive and coercive potential of a second Trump administration. A plausible alternative scenario involves an immediate, overwhelming financial offer combined with significant political pressure, forcing the Danish government to the negotiating table simply to de-escalate a crisis with its most important ally. In this scenario, the announcement could be sudden, bypassing normal diplomatic timelines.

However, this scenario still requires the Danish government to make an announcement. The resolution criteria require an announcement from *both* governments (or a joint one). The domestic political cost to any Danish government for agreeing to this, even just to "explore" the option, would be catastrophic, especially without prior consent from Greenland. Greenland's government has its own democratic mandate and would almost certainly refuse, making any Danish agreement politically untenable. Therefore, even in a high-pressure scenario, the path to a "Yes" resolution is blocked by insurmountable political realities in Denmark and Greenland.

The Metaculus community forecast is 1%. This is a valuable anchor. It suggests that the community is weighing the "Trump unpredictability" factor more heavily than my analysis. While my analysis points to a probability below 1%, the nature of the event (driven by a single, erratic actor) justifies keeping the forecast in the low single digits rather than fractions of a percent. The difference between 0.5% and 1% reflects uncertainty about the tail risk of an unprecedented political shock. Given the consensus and the nature of the uncertainty, I will align with the 1% forecast, acknowledging it is at the upper end of what my analysis suggests is plausible.

### Final Forecast
The probability is extremely low. The structural, political, and normative barriers are immense. The opposition from both Denmark and Greenland is clear and unwavering. The extremely short timeline of five weeks makes the necessary diplomatic groundwork for such a monumental announcement a practical impossibility. The only factor in favor is the known interest of a single, unpredictable leader, which is not sufficient to overcome these obstacles. The event would require a "black swan" political shock, the probability of which is minimal.

Final: 1%
