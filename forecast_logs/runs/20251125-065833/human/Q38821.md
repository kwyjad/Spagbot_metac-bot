### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. Presidential Terms:** The power for a President to adjourn Congress has existed since the Constitution's ratification in 1788. In the ~235 years since, across 46 presidencies, this power has never been formally invoked.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0/46 presidencies, or effectively 0%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most direct and relevant reference class.
    *   **Limitations:** The sample size (N=46) is small. More importantly, this class doesn't account for the unique characteristics of the specific president, the current political environment, or the ideological frameworks influencing the executive branch, which may render historical precedent less predictive.

2.  **Instances of Presidents Threatening to Use Dormant Constitutional Powers:** Presidents have occasionally threatened to use or have explored the use of obscure or untested constitutional powers, often during periods of intense conflict with Congress (e.g., Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, Truman's seizure of steel mills). Most of these threats are not acted upon.
    *   **Base Rate:** Very low, perhaps in the 1-5% range.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the dynamic of executive-legislative conflict and the temptation to use "break glass in case of emergency" powers. President Trump himself threatened to use this specific power in April 2020.
    *   **Limitations:** Defining "threat" and "dormant power" is subjective, making a precise rate difficult to calculate. The political and legal consequences vary widely for each power.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-01] Report on planned reinstatement of "Schedule F" — ↑ — Signals a high priority on staffing the administration with loyalists, increasing the motive to bypass a potentially obstructionist Senate confirmation process for key appointments.
*   [2025-06-26] Aggressive budget proposal reallocating funds from State Dept to Defense — ↑ — Demonstrates a willingness to engage in high-stakes confrontations with Congress over fundamental powers, in this case, the "power of the purse."
*   [2025-02-22] Administration pursues revival of impoundment powers — ↑ — Establishes a pattern of leveraging expansive interpretations of Article II (unitary executive theory) to challenge congressional authority, making another such challenge more plausible.
*   [2025-01-13] Reports highlight Project 2025's influence on the administration — ↑ — Confirms that the administration is operating with an ideological playbook that explicitly advocates for consolidating and expanding presidential power over the federal government.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Senate Obstruction of Key Nominees (Large ↑):** This is the primary driver. If the administration feels its agenda is critically stalled by the Senate's refusal to confirm key personnel (e.g., a Cabinet secretary, Attorney General, or Supreme Court justice), the incentive to create a "recess" for appointments skyrockets.
2.  **Formal Disagreement Between House and Senate on Adjournment (Large ↑):** This is a necessary precondition. The President's authority is not unilateral; it can only be triggered if the two chambers pass conflicting adjournment resolutions. A divided Congress (e.g., Republican House, Democratic Senate) makes such a disagreement plausible.
3.  **Influence of Unitary Executive Theory Proponents (Moderate ↑):** The presence of advisors and legal staff who believe the President has broad, underutilized constitutional authority (as outlined in Project 2025) makes the administration more likely to consider and legally justify such a novel action.
4.  **Perceived Political/Judicial Vulnerability (Large ↓):** The certainty of a massive political firestorm and an immediate Supreme Court challenge is a powerful deterrent. If the administration believes the courts would rule against them or that the political cost (including from their own party) is too high, they will likely refrain.
5.  **Availability of Alternative Levers (Moderate ↓):** If the administration can achieve its goals through other means (e.g., installing "acting" officials, striking a deal with the Senate, using executive orders), the need to take this extreme step diminishes.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Presidential Style:** President Trump has a documented history of challenging long-standing political norms and expressing frustration with constitutional checks and balances, a significant deviation from all prior presidents in the reference class. He explicitly threatened to use this power in 2020.
*   **Organized Ideological Framework:** Unlike past administrations, the current one is heavily influenced by a detailed, publicly available playbook (Project 2025) that provides a pre-packaged intellectual and legal justification for aggressive assertions of executive power.
*   **Heightened Political Polarization:** The current level of partisan animosity makes a legislative standoff that could produce the necessary trigger (disagreement on adjournment) more likely than in many past eras.
*   **Constrained Recess Appointment Power:** The Supreme Court's 2014 ruling in *NLRB v. Noel Canning* narrowed the president's ability to make recess appointments during short "pro forma" sessions. This precedent, paradoxically, might incentivize a president to seek a more extreme method—like forcing a longer adjournment—to create the recess the Court requires.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** An extremely low prior, near 0%, reflecting zero historical instances in over two centuries (equivalent n≈45-50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The specific President's stated willingness to use this power and his demonstrated history of challenging institutional norms.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The administration's clear reliance on an ideological framework (Project 2025) that advocates for expanding executive authority.
    *   ↑ (Small): The current political environment, which is conducive to the kind of legislative gridlock that could trigger the clause.
    *   ↓ (Large): The immense and certain political and institutional backlash from Congress (including members of his own party), the media, and the public.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The high probability of an immediate, high-profile challenge at the Supreme Court, with an uncertain but likely unfavorable outcome.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides a substantial upward revision from a near-zero prior. However, the powerful constraints mean the posterior probability should remain low, likely in the single digits. The question is whether the unique pro-use factors outweigh the powerful, timeless deterrents.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   President Trump publicly names specific nominees being "illegally" or "unfairly" blocked by the Senate.
    *   White House officials or allies begin publicly discussing the President's Article II, Section 3 adjournment authority.
    *   The House and Senate leadership publicly spar over the date for a holiday or end-of-session adjournment.
    *   The House passes an adjournment resolution with a date different from one being considered in the Senate.
    *   Talk of needing to fill a crucial vacancy (e.g., at the DOJ or a national security post) during a congressional recess.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Senate confirms one or more of the administration's high-priority nominees.
    *   The House and Senate leadership announce a joint agreement on the legislative calendar and adjournment dates.
    *   Prominent Republicans in the Senate publicly warn against any attempt to force an adjournment.
    *   The White House successfully installs "acting" officials in key vacant positions, reducing the need for recess appointments.
    *   Focus shifts to a major legislative compromise or a different political battle.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **The Trigger is Not Unilateral:** The most common misconception is that the President can adjourn Congress at will. He cannot. The disagreement between the two houses is a hard-and-fast prerequisite. Forecasters must watch for this specific event.
*   **Defining "Formally Invoke":** The resolution criteria depend on "credible sources" reporting a formal invocation. A mere threat in a speech or social media post would likely be insufficient. This would probably require a formal communication to Congress or an executive proclamation.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Action:** The President may threaten to use the power as a negotiating tactic to pressure the Senate without any genuine intention of following through. Distinguishing a credible threat from a bluff is a key challenge.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** With the question resolving at the end of 2025, any such conflict would need to escalate and resolve very quickly, especially around the holiday recess period.
*   **Uncertain Judicial Response:** Because the power has never been used, its precise limits are untested. The Supreme Court's reaction is a major source of uncertainty that complicates the administration's strategic calculations.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for a President adjourning Congress is zero. However, President Trump's past threats and the administration's adherence to the expansive executive power theories of Project 2025 make it more plausible than for any predecessor, especially if a key nominee is blocked. The probability remains low due to the absolute requirement for a House-Senate disagreement and the certainty of a severe political and legal backlash.

To forecast the probability of President Trump formally invoking his authority under the Constitution to adjourn Congress before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Historically, no U.S. President has ever invoked the power to adjourn Congress since the Constitution's ratification in 1788. This gives us a base rate of 0% (0/46 presidencies).
- **Reasoning:** This is the most direct reference class, as it pertains specifically to the use of this constitutional power.
- **Limitations:** The historical base rate does not account for the unique characteristics of President Trump or the current political environment.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The constitutional power remains the same, and the requirement for a disagreement between the House and Senate is unchanged.
- **Differences:** President Trump has a history of challenging norms and has explicitly threatened to use this power. The current administration is influenced by Project 2025, which advocates for expanding executive power. The political environment is highly polarized, increasing the likelihood of a legislative standoff.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence 1:** President Trump's past threat to use this power and his norm-challenging behavior.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Increases probability. If Trump were to invoke this power, such behavior would be more expected (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
- **Evidence 2:** Influence of Project 2025, advocating for expanded executive authority.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Increases probability. The presence of this framework makes the invocation more plausible (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
- **Evidence 3:** Political polarization and potential for legislative gridlock.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Increases probability. A divided Congress makes the necessary trigger more likely (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
- **Evidence 4:** Political and judicial backlash.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Decreases probability. The certainty of backlash and legal challenges makes invocation less likely (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Near 0% (effectively 0%).
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence provides a substantial upward revision from a near-zero prior, but the powerful constraints mean the posterior probability should remain low.
- **Posterior Probability:** Given the evidence, the probability increases from the base rate but remains in the single digits due to significant deterrents.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must consider the unprecedented nature of the action and the strong deterrents.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of Trump using the threat as leverage without actual invocation.
- **Adjustments:** The probability should account for the unique factors of Trump's presidency but remain low due to the high barriers.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and constraints, the probability of President Trump formally invoking his authority to adjourn Congress before 2026 is estimated to be low, but not negligible.

Final: 5%

# Will President Trump formally invoke his authority under the Constitution to adjourn Congress before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate for this event is 0%, as the presidential power to adjourn Congress has never been used in American history since the Constitution was ratified in 1788. Across 46 presidencies spanning approximately 235 years, this constitutional power has remained dormant.

However, a strict 0% prior would be mathematically problematic for Bayesian updating, so I'll use a very small but non-zero prior of 0.5%. This reflects:
- The power exists constitutionally but has never been used (0/46 presidencies)
- Rare constitutional powers have occasionally been invoked for the first time (e.g., Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus)
- The need for a minimally informative prior that allows for updating

**Prior probability: 0.5%** (or odds of 1:199)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The constitutional power still requires the same triggering condition: a formal disagreement between House and Senate on adjournment
- The political and institutional costs of such an unprecedented action remain extremely high
- The Supreme Court would likely review such an action, creating legal uncertainty
- Most presidential threats to use extraordinary powers are not acted upon

**Key differences from base case:**
- President Trump has explicitly threatened to use this specific power before (in April 2020)
- The administration appears heavily influenced by Project 2025, which advocates expanding executive authority
- Current political polarization creates conditions where a House-Senate disagreement is more plausible
- Trump has demonstrated greater willingness than previous presidents to challenge institutional norms
- The Supreme Court's 2014 NLRB v. Noel Canning ruling limited recess appointments during pro forma sessions, potentially incentivizing more drastic measures

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Trump's prior threat to use this power in 2020**
- P(E|H): Very high (~90%) - If Trump were to invoke this power, his past threat makes perfect sense
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~10%) - Most presidents who threaten extraordinary powers don't follow through
- Likelihood ratio: ~9:1 in favor of invocation
- This significantly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Project 2025's influence on administration**
- P(E|H): High (~80%) - An administration planning to adjourn Congress would likely embrace Project 2025's expansive executive power theories
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~30%) - Many administrations adopt some controversial legal theories without taking this specific action
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7:1 in favor of invocation
- This moderately increases probability

**Evidence 3: Reports of Schedule F reinstatement plans**
- P(E|H): High (~75%) - An administration planning to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would likely also pursue Schedule F
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~40%) - Schedule F could be pursued independently without resorting to forced adjournment
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9:1 in favor of invocation
- This slightly increases probability

**Evidence 4: Pursuit of impoundment powers revival**
- P(E|H): High (~70%) - This shows a pattern of challenging congressional authority that aligns with adjournment power use
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~35%) - Many administrations push boundaries on spending authority without taking more drastic steps
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 in favor of invocation
- This slightly increases probability

**Evidence 5: Absence of House-Senate adjournment dispute (as of November 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very low (~5%) - For adjournment to occur, this dispute must exist, and we have no evidence it does
- P(E|~H): Very high (~95%) - Most Congresses function without such disputes
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:19 against invocation
- This significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 6: Limited time remaining in 2025**
- P(E|H): Low (~20%) - With only about a month left in 2025, the window is narrowing
- P(E|~H): High (~80%) - Most constitutional crises take time to develop
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:4 against invocation
- This moderately decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:199 (0.5%), let's update sequentially:

1. Trump's prior threat: 1:199 × 9:1 = 9:199 ≈ 4.3%
2. Project 2025 influence: 9:199 × 2.7:1 ≈ 24.3:199 ≈ 10.9%
3. Schedule F plans: 24.3:199 × 1.9:1 ≈ 46.2:199 ≈ 18.8%
4. Impoundment powers pursuit: 46.2:199 × 2:1 ≈ 92.4:199 ≈ 31.7%
5. Absence of House-Senate dispute: 92.4:199 × 1:19 ≈ 92.4:3781 ≈ 2.4%
6. Limited time remaining: 92.4:3781 × 1:4 ≈ 92.4:15124 ≈ 0.6%

Converting final odds to probability: 92.4/(92.4+15124) ≈ 0.6%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which a House-Senate dispute could emerge in December
- The administration might have strategic reasons to create such a dispute that aren't publicly visible yet
- I might be overweighting historical precedent in a uniquely norm-breaking administration
- The question resolves on formal invocation, not successful adjournment, lowering the bar

**Alternative forecast:**
A more aggressive forecast might argue for 3-5% probability, noting:
- Trump explicitly threatened this power before
- Project 2025 provides intellectual framework
- December often features contentious adjournment negotiations
- Only requires formal invocation, not success

**Rebuttal:**
- The constitutional trigger (House-Senate disagreement) remains a hard prerequisite
- With only a month left in 2025, the window is extremely narrow
- Even threatening this power would create enormous political backlash
- Republican senators would likely strongly oppose such a move

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of a rapidly developing situation in December, but maintain a low overall probability.

## 6. Final Forecast

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Base Rate Identification:** The most direct reference class is the history of the U.S. Presidency. The President's authority to adjourn Congress in the event of a disagreement between the two houses has existed since the Constitution's ratification in 1788. In the ~235 years and 46 presidencies since, this power has never been formally invoked.
*   **Reasoning:** This gives a raw historical frequency of 0/46, or 0%. For Bayesian purposes, a 0% prior is unworkable. A more robust prior can be estimated using Laplace's Rule of Succession, which suggests a probability of (0 successes + 1) / (46 trials + 2) = 1/48, or approximately 2.1%. A slightly more conservative approach, considering the sheer length of time without an occurrence, would be to set the prior even lower.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will set the initial prior at **1%**. This reflects the extreme rarity of the event (it has never happened) while allowing for the possibility that it could occur under unprecedented circumstances. In odds form, this is 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The fundamental deterrents that prevented all previous presidents from using this power remain. These include the certainty of a major constitutional crisis, immense political backlash from the opposition and likely from the president's own party in the Senate, and an immediate, high-stakes challenge at the Supreme Court with a high probability of an unfavorable ruling (as in the 9-0 *NLRB v. Noel Canning* decision on a related power).
*   **Differences:** The current situation differs from the historical base case in several critical ways:
    1.  **Unique Presidential Actor:** President Trump has a well-documented history of challenging long-standing political norms and has explicitly threatened to use this specific power in the past (April 2020). His willingness to operate outside of traditional constraints is a radical departure from all 45 of his predecessors.
    2.  **Ideological Framework:** The administration is heavily influenced by Project 2025, which provides a pre-packaged legal and philosophical justification for an aggressive and expansive use of executive power under the unitary executive theory. This lowers the "activation energy" for such a move.
    3.  **Political Polarization:** The current hyper-partisan environment makes a legislative standoff between a House and Senate of opposing parties more likely. This could create the necessary trigger for the power: a formal disagreement on the time of adjournment.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence 1: President Trump's character and past statements.** (Increases probability)
    *   This is the single most important piece of new evidence compared to the base case. The fact that he has already threatened to use this power makes it much more likely he would consider it again.
    *   P(E | H): High. If a president were to use this power, it is highly likely they would be a norm-breaking figure who had previously considered it.
    *   P(E | ~H): Low. A typical president who does not use the power would not have this specific profile.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence substantially increases the odds from the very low prior.

*   **Evidence 2: The existence of a formal trigger mechanism.** (Decreases probability)
    *   The President cannot act unilaterally. The power can only be invoked if the House and Senate formally disagree on an adjournment time. The Senate has well-established procedures (e.g., holding *pro forma* sessions) to prevent a formal recess and, by extension, can likely prevent a formal disagreement from occurring if it is determined to do so.
    *   P(E | H): 100%. The trigger is a necessary precondition.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. The trigger not occurring is the most likely state of affairs, as it requires a specific legislative failure or conflict that the Senate is motivated to avoid.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This functions as a strong constraint. The probability of the event cannot be higher than the probability of the trigger condition being met. I estimate the probability of the Senate failing to prevent this trigger, even in a high-stakes conflict, to be low.

*   **Evidence 3: The certainty of institutional backlash.** (Decreases probability)
    *   Invoking this power would trigger an immediate judicial challenge that would likely go to the Supreme Court, and a political firestorm that could alienate key Senate allies.
    *   P(E | H): Low. For the President to act, he would have to discount or believe he could overcome these immense deterrents.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very High. These deterrents are the primary reason no president has ever used the power.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This powerful, timeless evidence keeps the overall probability low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will use a scenario-based approach to synthesize the factors. The final probability is the product of the probabilities of each necessary step in the causal chain.

1.  **P(A): A high-stakes confirmation battle emerges** where the administration feels its agenda is existentially blocked. Given the administration's confrontational posture (reviving impoundment, Schedule F), this is plausible. Let's estimate P(A) = 70%.
2.  **P(B|A): The House and Senate formally disagree on adjournment.** This is the key bottleneck. The Senate is strongly incentivized and procedurally able to prevent this. However, in a chaotic political environment, a miscalculation or an inability to maintain discipline is possible. I estimate the probability of this specific trigger occurring, given the standoff, as low. Let's set P(B|A) = 20%.
3.  **P(C|A,B): President Trump decides to invoke the power**, given the standoff and the trigger. Given his personality and the ideological support from his advisors, he may see the ensuing crisis as a political benefit regardless of the outcome. The odds are significant that he would take the chance. Let's set P(C|A,B) = 60%.

*   **Posterior Probability P(H) = P(A) × P(B|A) × P(C|A,B)**
*   P(H) = 0.70 × 0.20 × 0.60 = 0.084

The resulting posterior probability is **8.4%**. This reflects a significant update from the ~1% prior, driven almost entirely by the unique characteristics of the specific president and his political project, but is still held low by the major structural and procedural obstacles.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 8% might be too high if I am underestimating the Senate's institutional self-preservation instinct. Even Republican senators would be loath to approve of a president unilaterally seizing their chamber's power to set its own calendar. The backlash from within the GOP could be a powerful deterrent that my model underweights.

Conversely, the forecast might be too low. I may be underestimating the potential for a crisis so severe (e.g., a vacancy at the head of the DOJ during a major investigation) that the President perceives he has no other choice. In such a scenario, he might be willing to risk the political and legal fallout. The 60% chance of him pulling the trigger, given the opportunity, might be too low for a president who thrives on creating and escalating conflict.

However, the procedural bottleneck remains the most significant factor. The Senate can likely prevent the trigger if it acts unanimously. The 20% probability I assigned to this trigger failing is the largest source of uncertainty. An 8% forecast seems to correctly balance the unprecedented willingness of the executive with the high procedural barriers.

### 6. Final Forecast
The historical base rate is effectively zero. However, the combination of a uniquely norm-breaking president, a ready-made ideological justification for executive overreach (Project 2025), and a hyper-partisan environment makes this event more plausible than at any point in U.S. history. The primary constraints are the necessity of a specific legislative trigger (a formal House-Senate disagreement on adjournment), which the Senate is empowered and motivated to prevent, and the massive political and judicial backlash that would ensue. Balancing these competing factors leads to a low but non-trivial probability.

Final: 8%
