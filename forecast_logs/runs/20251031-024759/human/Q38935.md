### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Historical H5N1 Human-to-Human (H2H) Transmission Events (2003-2024):** Since 2003, there have been over 900 confirmed human cases of H5N1 globally. Within this set, there have been only a handful of documented instances of limited, non-sustained H2H transmission, typically involving prolonged, close contact between family members. There has never been a documented case of efficient, sustained community transmission.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~0-1 reported limited H2H transmission clusters globally per year. This implies a very low probability (<5% per year) of any H2H event being reported.
    *   **Limitations:** This base rate is derived from a period when the primary transmission route was bird-to-human. The current situation with a large mammalian reservoir is novel and may render this historical rate less relevant.

2.  **Emergence of Novel Pandemic Influenza Viruses:** In the last 110 years, there have been four major influenza pandemics with sustained H2H transmission (1918, 1957, 1968, 2009).
    *   **Base Rate:** Roughly one pandemic-capable flu virus emerges every 25-30 years, for an annual probability of ~3-4%.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a very broad reference class. It includes different subtypes (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2) and doesn't account for the specific biological hurdles H5N1 faces. However, it provides an upper-bound context for how often a zoonotic flu successfully adapts for sustained human spread.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*The question's horizon is very short (today is 2025-10-31, resolution is 2026-01-01). The recency guideline emphasizes the last 6 months (approx. May 2025 - Oct 2025). The provided sources are used to construct this timeline.*

- **2025-07-25** PubMed study published, noting 46 human H5N1 cases in the US between March and October 2024. **(↑)** — This number, much higher than initially reported, confirms a significant rate of animal-to-human spillover, increasing the number of opportunities for viral adaptation in a human host.
- **2025-07-07** CDC confirms the risk to the general public remains low and that no known H2H spread has occurred with currently circulating viruses. **(↓)** — Despite widespread animal outbreaks and human exposures, the fundamental barrier to H2H transmission appears to be holding, according to official assessments.
- **2025-07-07** CDC notes it is monitoring thousands of people with animal exposures since March 2024. **(↑)** — Enhanced surveillance increases the likelihood that a rare H2H transmission event would be detected and reported, satisfying the resolution criteria.
- **2025-02-26** CDC update confirms continued response to the multistate outbreak in dairy cows and other animals. **(↔)** — The situation is persistent and ongoing. The lack of resolution of the animal outbreak maintains the underlying risk factor that has been present since 2024.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Viral Adaptation to Mammalian Hosts:** The primary driver. For efficient H2H transmission, the virus must acquire mutations (e.g., in the HA and PB2 genes) that allow it to bind to alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptors in the human upper respiratory tract and replicate efficiently at human body temperatures. The ongoing circulation in cattle provides a novel environment for such adaptations to arise. **(Large impact)**
2.  **Scale of the Mammalian Reservoir:** The number of infected cattle and the geographic scope of the outbreak directly influence the probability of a key mutation occurring. A larger, longer-lasting outbreak creates more "rolls of the dice" for the virus to evolve. **(Large impact)**
3.  **Frequency of Human Exposure:** The number of farm workers and associated individuals exposed to infected animals drives the rate of spillover events. Each human infection is a self-contained experiment for the virus to adapt to a human host. **(Moderate impact)**
4.  **Reassortment with Human Influenza Viruses:** If H5N1 infects a host (human or swine) simultaneously infected with a seasonal human flu virus, the viruses could swap genetic segments (reassort), potentially creating a new virus with both H5N1's novelty and a human flu virus's transmissibility. **(Large impact, but low probability event)**
5.  **Surveillance and Reporting Efficacy:** The question resolves on a *CDC report*. A genuine H2H event that is not detected or is detected in a country with slow reporting that the CDC doesn't pick up before the deadline would not trigger resolution. Conversely, heightened surveillance makes detection more likely. **(Moderate impact on resolution)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Unprecedented Mammalian Reservoir:** The historical base rate is built on bird-to-human transmission. The current outbreak features the first-ever large-scale, sustained transmission of HPAI H5N1 among a mammalian species (dairy cattle). This fundamentally changes the exposure landscape and evolutionary pressures on the virus.
- **Route of Human Infection & Symptoms:** Past H5N1 cases were often severe respiratory infections. The recent US cases linked to cattle have been predominantly mild, with conjunctivitis as a key symptom. This may suggest a different route of exposure (e.g., contact with contaminated milk) and a virus not yet adapted for respiratory spread.
- **Viral Clade:** The currently circulating virus is clade 2.3.4.4b, which has shown a proclivity for infecting a wide range of mammals but has not, to date, acquired the key known markers for efficient H2H transmission.
- **Post-COVID Surveillance Infrastructure:** Global genomic surveillance, public health monitoring, and rapid information sharing are significantly more advanced than during previous H5N1 scares in the 2000s. This increases the probability of detecting and characterizing a transmission event quickly.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start from a low prior based on the historical reference class (Class 1), suggesting H2H transmission is a rare event that has been a persistent but unrealized threat for over 20 years. This implies a strong prior against the event, equivalent to observing no sustained H2H transmission over n≈20 years.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **(↑ Large):** The establishment of a large, persistent mammalian reservoir in cattle is a structural break from the past, dramatically increasing opportunities for viral evolution and human spillover.
    - **(↑ Moderate):** The confirmed number of human cases (46+ by late 2024) is significant, providing many more chances for adaptation within human hosts than seen in previous years in any single country.
    - **(↓ Large):** Genetic analysis consistently shows the virus still lacks the key known adaptations for binding to human upper respiratory tract receptors, which remains the primary biological barrier.
    - **(↓ Small):** The mild, non-respiratory symptoms of recent human cases suggest the virus is not yet well-suited for the primary mode of human flu transmission (respiratory droplets/aerosols).
- **Net effect:** The evidence powerfully pushes the probability up from the historical base rate due to the game-changing nature of the cattle outbreak. However, the lack of observed genetic adaptation is a crucial counterweight. The posterior should be significantly higher than the historical prior, but likely still well below 50%, reflecting that the primary biological barrier remains intact for now.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
**UP indicators:**
- **Genetic Markers:** Any report of a sequenced H5N1 virus (from a human, cow, or other mammal) showing key adaptive mutations like PB2 E627K or HA Q226L.
- **Swine Infection:** Confirmed H5N1 outbreak in a commercial swine herd, as pigs are ideal "mixing vessels" for avian and human flu viruses.
- **Human Case Cluster:** Two or more human cases with a clear epidemiological link but no shared, direct animal exposure.
- **Change in Symptoms:** Reports of new human cases presenting with severe respiratory illness, rather than just conjunctivitis.

**DOWN indicators:**
- **Containment in Cattle:** Significant reduction in the number of new dairy herds testing positive for H5N1.
- **Continued Genetic Stability:** Ongoing genomic surveillance of animal and human isolates shows no new significant mutations related to human adaptation.
- **No New Human Cases:** A cessation of reported human spillover cases for a period of one month or more.
- **Effective Countermeasures:** Widespread, effective vaccination of cattle or poultry that demonstrably reduces viral circulation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Resolution Definition:** The outcome hinges specifically on a *CDC report* of H2H transmission *globally*. An event could occur and be confirmed by another country's health ministry (e.g., in Asia) but not be reported by the CDC before the Jan 1, 2026 deadline.
- **Detection Lags & Gaps:** Mild or asymptomatic cases in farm workers may go undetected, meaning H2H transmission could be occurring at a very low level without being discovered. The true number of human infections is almost certainly higher than reported.
- **Biological Uncertainty:** While specific mutations are known risk factors, the exact evolutionary path to efficient H2H transmission is not fully understood. The virus could find a novel solution.
- **Short Time Horizon:** With less than three months to resolution, the probability is heavily anchored by the current state. A major evolutionary jump is a low-probability event in any short timeframe. The question is less about *if* this will ever happen and more about *if it will happen in the next ~60 days*.

**Final Research Summary:** The unprecedented H5N1 outbreak in US dairy cattle has fundamentally increased the risk by creating massive opportunities for viral adaptation and

To forecast the probability of reported human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 globally before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The historical base rate for human-to-human (H2H) transmission of H5N1 is extremely low. Since 2003, there have been over 900 confirmed human cases globally, with only a handful of documented instances of limited, non-sustained H2H transmission. This suggests a base rate of less than 5% per year for any H2H event being reported. Given the short time frame until 2026, the base rate for this period is even lower, likely around 1-2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The current situation involves H5N1, a virus historically known for limited H2H transmission.
- The primary transmission route remains animal-to-human, similar to past outbreaks.

**Differences:**
- The current outbreak involves a large mammalian reservoir (dairy cattle), which is unprecedented and increases the potential for viral adaptation.
- Enhanced surveillance and reporting capabilities post-COVID-19 increase the likelihood of detecting and reporting H2H transmission.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Increased Opportunities for Adaptation (↑):** The large number of human cases (46+ by late 2024) and the mammalian reservoir increase the likelihood of viral adaptation. This evidence increases the probability.
- **Lack of Key Genetic Mutations (↓):** Genetic analyses show the virus lacks mutations necessary for efficient H2H transmission. This evidence decreases the probability.
- **Enhanced Surveillance (↑):** Increased monitoring and surveillance make it more likely that any H2H transmission would be detected and reported. This evidence increases the probability.
- **Mild Symptoms in Recent Cases (↓):** The mild nature of recent human cases suggests the virus is not yet adapted for respiratory transmission, decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a low prior probability (1-2%), we adjust based on the evidence:
- The increased opportunities for adaptation and enhanced surveillance suggest a higher probability than the base rate.
- However, the lack of key genetic mutations and mild symptoms counterbalance this increase.

Using a qualitative Bayesian update, the posterior probability is adjusted upwards but remains below 50%, reflecting the significant biological barriers still in place.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must consider the short time frame and the low probability of a major evolutionary jump within this period.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of undetected mild H2H transmission or a sudden genetic shift.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of key mutations and mild symptoms are strong counterarguments against a high probability.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final probability is adjusted to reflect the increased risk due to the mammalian reservoir and enhanced surveillance, while accounting for the significant biological barriers.

Final: 15%

# Will there be any reported human-to-human transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 globally before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish a prior based on historical data of H5N1 human-to-human transmission:

- Since H5N1 was first identified in humans in 1997, there have been very few confirmed instances of limited human-to-human transmission.
- The WHO has documented only a handful of probable H2H transmission events over ~25 years, primarily in family clusters with close, prolonged contact.
- No sustained or community H2H transmission has ever been documented.

Given this history, I'll use a base rate of approximately 4% per year for any limited H2H transmission being reported. This is derived from:
- Approximately 1 documented limited H2H transmission cluster per 5-7 years globally
- Adjusted slightly upward to account for possible undetected events

**Prior probability: 4% annually**

For our specific timeframe (from now until January 1, 2026 - approximately 2 months), the prior would be:
4% × (2/12) = 0.67%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- H5N1 still fundamentally lacks the genetic adaptations needed for efficient human transmission
- The biological barriers to H2H transmission remain significant
- Most human cases continue to be directly linked to animal exposure

**Key differences:**
- **Unprecedented mammalian reservoir:** The extensive spread in US dairy cattle creates a novel evolutionary environment for the virus, significantly increasing opportunities for adaptation.
- **Higher human exposure rate:** 46+ human cases in the US alone by late 2024 represents more spillover events than typically seen in a single country.
- **Enhanced surveillance:** Post-COVID surveillance systems are more robust, increasing the likelihood of detecting a rare H2H event.
- **Short timeframe:** With only 2 months until resolution, there's limited time for the necessary viral adaptations to emerge.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Unprecedented mammalian reservoir in cattle**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If H2H transmission occurs, it's highly likely to be preceded by extensive mammalian adaptation.
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even without H2H transmission, we would expect to see mammalian reservoirs, though perhaps not this extensive.
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 2: 46+ human cases in the US by late 2024**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Multiple human infections increase opportunities for viral adaptation.
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even without H2H transmission, we'd expect some human cases from animal exposure.
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 3: Lack of key genetic adaptations in current viral isolates**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If H2H transmission occurs soon, we would expect to already see some genetic shifts toward human adaptation.
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Without H2H transmission, we'd expect the virus to maintain its current genetic profile.
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Predominantly mild, non-respiratory symptoms in human cases**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - H2H transmission would likely involve respiratory symptoms.
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Without H2H adaptation, we'd expect the current pattern of mild, often ocular symptoms.
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.43
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 5: Very short timeframe remaining (2 months)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - H2H transmission would need to emerge and be detected in a very narrow window.
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Without H2H transmission, the short timeframe is irrelevant.
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.22
- Direction: Significantly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 0.67% for the 2-month period:

Prior odds = 0.0067 / (1 - 0.0067) ≈ 0.0067

Updating with Evidence 1 (mammalian reservoir):
Posterior odds = 0.0067 × 2.25 ≈ 0.015
Posterior probability ≈ 0.015 / (1 + 0.015) ≈ 1.5%

Updating with Evidence 2 (46+ human cases):
Posterior odds = 0.015 × 1.6 ≈ 0.024
Posterior probability ≈ 0.024 / (1 + 0.024) ≈ 2.3%

Updating with Evidence 3 (lack of genetic adaptations):
Posterior odds = 0.024 × 0.25 ≈ 0.006
Posterior probability ≈ 0.006 / (1 + 0.006) ≈ 0.6%

Updating with Evidence 4 (mild, non-respiratory symptoms):
Posterior odds = 0.006 × 0.43 ≈ 0.0026
Posterior probability ≈ 0.0026 / (1 + 0.0026) ≈ 0.26%

Updating with Evidence 5 (short timeframe):
Posterior odds = 0.0026 × 0.22 ≈ 0.00057
Posterior probability ≈ 0.00057 / (1 + 0.00057) ≈ 0.057%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a sudden genetic shift through reassortment with human influenza viruses.
- The CDC might report on H2H transmission that occurred elsewhere globally, even if detected after the fact.
- There could be undetected H2H transmission already occurring in settings with less robust surveillance.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A small family cluster with limited H2H transmission could be detected in a country with ongoing poultry outbreaks (e.g., Egypt, Indonesia) and reported by the CDC before January 2026.
- A reassortment event between H5N1 and seasonal influenza could occur in a co-infected individual, creating a novel virus with enhanced transmissibility.

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, my final probability should be slightly higher than the mechanical Bayesian calculation. The extremely short timeframe is the strongest limiting factor, but the unprecedented nature of the current outbreak warrants some caution against extreme confidence.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, I believe the probability of CDC-reported human-to-human transmission of H5N1 globally before January 1, 2026 is approximately 1%.

This reflects:
- The extremely short timeframe remaining (2 months)
- The unprecedented mammalian reservoir creating evolutionary opportunities
- The continued absence of key genetic adaptations for human transmission
- The robust surveillance systems that would likely detect any significant event

Final: 1%

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use the historical frequency of reported limited human-to-human (H2H) transmission of H5N1.
- **Reference Class:** Documented clusters of limited, non-sustained H2H transmission of H5N1 globally from 2003 to 2024.
- **Data:** Over this ~21-year period, there have been a "handful" of such events (e.g., in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan, China). Let's estimate this as roughly 5-10 clusters, for an average rate of about 0.25 to 0.5 events per year. I will use the lower end of this range for a conservative estimate.
- **Calculation:**
    - Annual rate (λ) = 0.25 events/year.
    - The question's remaining time horizon is very short: November and December 2025, which is 2 months or 1/6th of a year.
    - The expected number of events in this period is λt = 0.25 * (1/6) ≈ 0.042.
    - Using a Poisson distribution, the probability of at least one event is P(k≥1) = 1 - e^(-λt) = 1 - e^(-0.042) ≈ 0.041.
- **Initial Prior (P(H)):** I will set the initial prior probability at **4%**. This represents the chance of a reported H2H event in a typical 2-month period based on historical data before the cattle outbreak.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is fundamentally different from the historical base case.
- **Similarities:** The virus is still HPAI H5N1, and the primary biological barrier (the virus's preference for avian-like receptors) remains.
- **Differences:**
    1.  **Unprecedented Mammalian Reservoir:** The sustained, widespread outbreak in US dairy cattle is a paradigm shift. Historically, the reservoir was avian. A large mammalian reservoir provides a new, potentially more effective environment for the virus to acquire mutations that favor mammalian hosts, including humans.
    2.  **Increased Human Exposure:** The cattle outbreak has led to a higher number of documented human spillover cases (a study noted 46 in the US in 2024) than typically seen in one country over such a period. Each human infection is an opportunity for the virus to adapt.
    3.  **Enhanced Surveillance:** Post-COVID-19, global public health surveillance is more robust. The CDC is actively monitoring thousands of exposed individuals. This increases the likelihood that a rare H2H transmission event would be detected and reported, satisfying the resolution criteria.

These differences mean the historical base rate is likely a significant underestimate of the current risk.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that H2H transmission is reported before 2026.
Let ~H be the event that it is not.

- **Evidence 1 (Pro): Large, sustained mammalian (cattle) outbreak.**
    - This dramatically increases the number of viral replications in a mammalian environment and the number of human exposures. This is a plausible pathway to H2H adaptation.
    - The likelihood ratio P(E1|H) / P(E1|~H) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability.

- **Evidence 2 (Pro): Higher number of human spillover cases.**
    - More human infections provide more "experiments" for the virus to adapt within a human host.
    - The likelihood ratio P(E2|H) / P(E2|~H) is greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability.

- **Evidence 3 (Con): Virus still lacks key known genetic markers for H2H transmission.**
    - Despite over a year of circulation in cattle and numerous spillovers, genomic surveillance has not detected the key mutations (e.g., PB2 E627K) known to be associated with adaptation to humans.
    - The likelihood ratio P(E3|H) / P(E3|~H) is much less than 1. This is strong evidence against an imminent event and decreases the probability.

- **Evidence 4 (Con): Predominantly mild, non-respiratory symptoms (conjunctivitis) in recent human cases.**
    - Efficient H2H spread of influenza is primarily respiratory. The observed symptoms suggest a transmission route (e.g., contact with contaminated milk) that is not conducive to onward spread between people.
    - The likelihood ratio P(E4|H) / P(E4|~H) is less than 1. This evidence decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The evidence presents a strong conflict. The opportunity for adaptation has increased massively (Evidence 1 & 2), but the biological reality is that the virus has not yet been observed to take advantage of this opportunity (Evidence 3 & 4).

- **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 4%, so Odds = 0.04 / 0.96 ≈ 1/24.
- **Updating Step:**
    - The "opportunity" evidence (cattle reservoir, human cases) is a game-changer and might increase the odds by a large factor, perhaps 10x.
    - The "biological barrier" evidence (no key mutations, non-respiratory symptoms) is a powerful counterargument, suggesting the jump is very difficult. This might decrease the odds by a factor of 0.3x or 0.4x.
    - **Combined Likelihood Ratio:** Let's estimate a net likelihood ratio of 10 * 0.35 = 3.5. This reflects that the new risk environment is the dominant factor, but its effect is heavily tempered by the virus's lack of observed adaptation.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/24) × 3.5 ≈ 0.146.
- **Posterior Probability:** Odds / (1 + Odds) = 0.146 / 1.146 ≈ 0.127, or **13%**.

The very short 2-month time horizon is a critical constraint. Evolutionary events are stochastic. While the background risk is high, the probability of the necessary mutation, transmission, detection, and reporting all occurring in the next ~60 days remains low. The 13% figure reflects a significant increase over the base rate but correctly keeps the probability well below 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast hinges on the estimated likelihood ratio. Could the biological barrier be even stronger than I've assessed? Yes. After 1.5 years in cattle, the lack of adaptation is a very strong signal. This would push the probability down, closer to 5-8%.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A single, low-probability event could change everything overnight. For example, an outbreak on a pig farm could act as a "mixing vessel" for reassortment with a human flu virus. This tail risk justifies keeping the probability from being too low.
- **Community Sanity Check:** The Metaculus community median for this question is 10%. My calculated 13% is in the same ballpark, which provides some confidence. The community may be weighing the short time horizon and the lack of genetic adaptation slightly more heavily.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strength of the counter-evidence (no key mutations) and the extremely short timeline, I will adjust my forecast slightly downward from my calculated 13% to align more closely with the community and to better reflect the high bar for this event to occur in the next 60 days. A probability of 10% seems to strike the right balance.

### Final Forecast
The situation is unprecedented. The massive H5N1 reservoir in cattle has substantially increased the long-term risk of H2H transmission. However, for this short-term forecast (before 2026), this increased risk is counteracted by strong evidence that the virus has not yet acquired the necessary biological adaptations for efficient human spread, despite ample opportunity. The very short 2-month window makes the required sequence of events—mutation, transmission, detection, and official CDC reporting—unlikely, but not impossible. My final probability balances the heightened background risk against the lack of imminent biological triggers.
