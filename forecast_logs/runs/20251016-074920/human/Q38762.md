### Reference class & base rates
*   **New Financial Product Approval by Federal Regulators (e.g., CFTC/SEC):** The process for a novel financial product or a new exchange to gain approval from a federal body like the CFTC is typically lengthy, expensive, and rigorous, often taking multiple years. For entities with a prior history of non-compliance (like Polymarket), the bar is even higher. The base rate of an entity going from being sanctioned to fully approved within a 3-year period, let alone having this happen in the final months of a specific calendar year, is extremely low, likely **< 5%**.
*   **State-Level Legalization of New Gambling Forms (e.g., Online Sports Betting):** Since the repeal of PASPA in 2018, numerous states have legalized online sports betting. This process is legislative, state-by-state, and also takes 1-3 years on average from introduction to implementation. While a different regulatory path (state gaming commissions vs. federal CFTC), it serves as a useful reference for the speed of legalizing complex, regulated activities. The base rate for a specific company gaining nationwide access in a single year is effectively **0%**.
*   **Reversal of a Federal Regulatory Enforcement Action:** The likelihood of a federal agency like the CFTC completely reversing a major enforcement action (like the one against Polymarket) and granting full operational approval within a short timeframe without significant external pressure (e.g., a new law from Congress) is very low. The institutional bias is towards maintaining and justifying prior enforcement decisions. The base rate for such a reversal and subsequent approval within 2-3 years is likely **< 2%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-01 to 2025-10 (ongoing)**: No significant legislative proposals to legalize or create a bespoke framework for prediction markets have gained traction in the U.S. Congress. ↓ — The most direct path to legality, legislation, has seen no progress, making a 2025 resolution via this mechanism nearly impossible.
*   **2024-06-21**: The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the CFTC's decision to block Kalshi from offering markets on U.S. congressional elections. ↓ — This ruling strongly affirmed the CFTC's broad discretionary authority to reject event contracts it deems contrary to the public interest, setting a powerful negative precedent for any future applications.
*   **2024-05-15**: Polymarket raised $70 million in two funding rounds, with investors including Peter Thiel and Vitalik Buterin, signaling strong financial backing and ambition. ↑ — While not a legal development, significant funding provides resources for a potential protracted legal or lobbying battle, slightly increasing long-term odds but having minimal impact on the 2025 timeline.
*   **2023-present**: The lawsuit between the CFTC and PredictIt's operators (Aristotle Inc.) over the revocation of its no-action letter remains ongoing. ↓ — The CFTC's determined effort to shut down the long-running PredictIt market demonstrates its hostile stance toward politically-themed event contracts, a core offering for Polymarket.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **CFTC Approval (DCM/SEF License):** Polymarket or Manifold would need to apply for and be granted a Designated Contract Market (DCM) or Swap Execution Facility (SEF) license. This is the official, but extremely slow and arduous, path. Given Polymarket's history and the CFTC's current stance, this is a very high bar. (Large impact, very low probability).
*   **Congressional Legislation:** Congress could pass a law that explicitly legalizes and provides a regulatory framework for prediction markets, overriding the CFTC's current interpretation of the Commodity Exchange Act. (Large impact, extremely low probability in 2025).
*   **Favorable Court Ruling:** A landmark court decision could severely curtail the CFTC's authority to block prediction markets, forcing the agency to permit them. The recent Kalshi ruling makes this highly unlikely. (Large impact, very low probability).
*   **Change in CFTC Leadership/Policy:** A new administration or a change in commission leadership could lead to a philosophical shift in favor of prediction markets. However, personnel changes rarely translate to immediate, sweeping policy reversals within months. (Moderate impact, very low probability for 2025).
*   **CFTC No-Action Letter:** The CFTC could issue a no-action letter, similar to what PredictIt had, allowing limited operation for academic or other purposes. Given the revocation of PredictIt's letter, the agency is unlikely to issue a new one, especially to a previously-sanctioned entity. (Moderate impact, very low probability).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Prior Enforcement History:** Unlike a new, compliant entrant, Polymarket has a negative history with the CFTC, having been fined $1.4 million and ordered to cease US operations in 2022. This creates a significant and unusual barrier to re-engagement and approval.
*   **Federal vs. State Jurisdiction:** The reference class of sports betting is misleading. Sports betting is regulated as "gaming" at the state level. Prediction markets are currently classified as "swaps" or "commodities," falling under the stringent federal jurisdiction of the CFTC, a much more cautious and slower-moving regulator.
*   **Core Product Controversy:** The most popular prediction markets (e.g., on elections) are the very ones the CFTC has explicitly targeted as being potentially contrary to the public interest and akin to illegal "gaming," a much higher-stakes controversy than betting on a sports outcome.
*   **Manifold's Business Model:** Manifold currently operates on play-money ("mana"). A transition to real-money trading would require a complete corporate restructuring and a ground-up regulatory approval process, making a 2025 timeline virtually impossible.
*   **Compressed Timeline:** The question resolves at the end of 2025. With the current date being October 16, 2025, there are less than three months remaining. Regulatory and legislative processes of this magnitude are measured in years, not weeks.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<5%) based on the reference class of new financial product approvals, especially for entities with a negative regulatory history. The "equivalent n" is moderate, as the regulatory process is well-established and slow.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The D.C. Circuit's ruling in the Kalshi case strongly reinforces the CFTC's authority and anti-prediction market stance.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The CFTC's continued legal fight to shut down PredictIt signals a hardening, not a softening, of its position.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The complete absence of any legislative momentum in Congress for a statutory fix.
    *   ↓ (Large): The extremely short time remaining in 2025 makes any multi-stage regulatory or legislative process a practical impossibility.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is uniformly and strongly negative. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward from an already very low prior, approaching a floor near 0%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Polymarket or Manifold formally announces the submission of a DCM application to the CFTC.
    *   A bipartisan bill to create a framework for prediction markets is introduced in Congress.
    *   The CFTC unexpectedly settles the PredictIt case on terms favorable to the market.
    *   A surprise joint statement from Polymarket and the CFTC announcing a "path forward."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The CFTC issues a new investor alert warning about offshore prediction markets.
    *   A final court ruling is issued against PredictIt.
    *   Key congressional leaders publicly state opposition to federal legalization of event markets.
    *   The calendar turns to December 2025 with no progress on any front.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **"OR" Condition:** The question resolves "Yes" if *either* Polymarket *or* Manifold becomes legal. While both face long odds, their paths are distinct. Manifold's is arguably even less likely given its current structure.
*   **Definition of "Legally Offer":** This could be ambiguous. Does a highly restrictive no-action letter for academic purposes count? The spirit of the question implies broad public access, but the letter of the law might be met by a more limited agreement. This is unlikely but possible.
*   **Black Swan Event:** An unforeseen event, such as a massive geopolitical crisis where Polymarket's forecasts prove uniquely valuable, could theoretically trigger an emergency authorization, but this is speculative fiction at this point.
*   **Corporate PR vs. Legal Reality:** Polymarket is well-funded and may issue optimistic press releases about "engaging with regulators." These should be treated with extreme skepticism unless accompanied by official filings or CFTC statements.

**Final Research Summary:** The path to legal real-money operation in the US for either Polymarket or Manifold is blocked by a hostile regulator (CFTC), negative legal precedent, and the glacial pace of legislative/regulatory change. With less than three months left in 2025, a "Yes" resolution is exceptionally unlikely.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a new financial product or exchange gaining approval from a federal body like the CFTC is very low, especially for entities with a history of non-compliance. Given the context, the base rate for Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the US by the end of 2025 is likely less than 5%. This is based on historical frequencies of regulatory approvals and the specific challenges faced by these entities.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both Polymarket and Manifold face the same regulatory hurdles as other financial products seeking approval from federal regulators. The process is typically lengthy and rigorous.
   - Differences: Polymarket has a history of non-compliance, having been fined by the CFTC, which makes its case more challenging. Manifold operates on a play-money model, which would require a complete restructuring to transition to real-money markets.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **D.C. Circuit Court Ruling (Kalshi case)**: This ruling reinforces the CFTC's authority and decreases the likelihood of approval for prediction markets. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
   - **Polymarket's Funding**: While significant, this funding does not directly impact the regulatory approval process for 2025. Slightly increases the probability but not significantly.
   - **Ongoing PredictIt Lawsuit**: The CFTC's continued legal actions against PredictIt suggest a hardened stance against prediction markets, decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
   - **Lack of Legislative Progress**: No significant legislative proposals have been made, making a 2025 resolution unlikely. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of less than 5%, the evidence is overwhelmingly negative, with strong reinforcement of the CFTC's authority and no legislative progress. The posterior probability should be revised downward, approaching a floor near 0%.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (for each piece of evidence).
   - Given the uniformly negative evidence, the posterior probability is extremely low.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a sudden change in CFTC leadership or an unexpected legislative push, is necessary. However, these scenarios are highly unlikely given the current context.
   - The best alternative forecast might consider a slight increase in probability due to Polymarket's funding, but this is minimal given the regulatory hurdles.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the base rate, the negative evidence, and the lack of any significant positive developments, the probability of Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the US by the end of 2025 is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold become legal in the United States in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on the likelihood of prediction markets gaining legal status for real-money betting in the US within a specific timeframe.

The most appropriate reference classes are:
- New financial product approvals by the CFTC (especially for entities with prior sanctions)
- Reversal of federal regulatory enforcement actions
- Timeline for significant regulatory changes in financial markets

Based on these reference classes, I'll establish a prior of **3%**. This extremely low prior is justified because:
- Polymarket has a history of CFTC sanctions ($1.4M fine in 2022)
- The regulatory approval process for new financial products typically takes years
- The CFTC has shown consistent hostility toward prediction markets
- There is less than 3 months remaining in 2025 for this to occur

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The regulatory framework remains unchanged - prediction markets are still classified as "swaps" under CFTC jurisdiction
- The burden of proof for approval remains on the applicants
- The standard process (DCM/SEF licensing) would still apply

**Key differences:**
- **Negative:** Polymarket specifically has a prior enforcement action against it, making its path harder than a typical new entrant
- **Negative:** The recent D.C. Circuit Court ruling upholding the CFTC's decision to block Kalshi's election markets creates an even more hostile precedent
- **Negative:** The timeline is extremely compressed with only ~2.5 months remaining in 2025
- **Slightly positive:** Polymarket has secured significant funding ($70M), providing resources for legal/lobbying efforts

These differences, particularly the compressed timeline and negative precedents, suggest the actual probability should be even lower than the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: D.C. Circuit Court upheld CFTC's decision to block Kalshi (June 2024)**
- P(E|H): If prediction markets were to become legal, this ruling would be highly unlikely (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If prediction markets remain illegal, this ruling is very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Ongoing CFTC lawsuit against PredictIt**
- P(E|H): If prediction markets were to become legal, we'd expect this lawsuit to be settled favorably (~0.2)
- P(E|~H): If prediction markets remain illegal, this ongoing enforcement is expected (~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: No legislative momentum in Congress**
- P(E|H): If prediction markets were to become legal in 2025, we would expect to see legislative activity by now (~0.05)
- P(E|~H): If prediction markets remain illegal, the absence of legislation is expected (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Less than 3 months remaining in 2025**
- P(E|H): If prediction markets were to become legal in 2025, having only 2.5 months left is highly unlikely (~0.01)
- P(E|~H): If prediction markets remain illegal, the time constraint is irrelevant (~1.0)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01/1.0 = 0.01
- This evidence very strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3% (odds of 3:97 or 0.031):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Court ruling):**
- Prior odds: 0.031
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 0.11 = 0.0034
- Posterior probability: 0.0034 / (1 + 0.0034) = 0.0034 = 0.34%

**Update on Evidence 2 (PredictIt lawsuit):**
- Prior odds: 0.0034
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.0034 × 0.25 = 0.00085
- Posterior probability: 0.00085 / (1 + 0.00085) = 0.00085 = 0.085%

**Update on Evidence 3 (No legislation):**
- Prior odds: 0.00085
- Likelihood ratio: 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.00085 × 0.053 = 0.000045
- Posterior probability: 0.000045 / (1 + 0.000045) = 0.000045 = 0.0045%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Time constraint):**
- Prior odds: 0.000045
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01
- Posterior odds: 0.000045 × 0.01 = 0.00000045
- Posterior probability: 0.00000045 / (1 + 0.00000045) = 0.00000045 = 0.000045%

This extremely low probability (effectively 0%) reflects the overwhelming evidence against legalization occurring in the remaining months of 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Let me consider potential blind spots in my analysis:

**Potential paths I might be underestimating:**
1. **Emergency authorization:** A national security or economic crisis could theoretically prompt expedited approval, but this is extremely speculative.
2. **Limited no-action letter:** The CFTC could issue a highly restricted no-action letter for academic purposes, though this seems unlikely given their revocation of PredictIt's letter.
3. **Court injunction:** A surprise court ruling could temporarily allow operations, though recent precedent makes this highly unlikely.
4. **Definition ambiguity:** The question might resolve on a technicality if a very limited form of operation is permitted.

**Adjustments needed:**
While these scenarios are theoretically possible, they are all extremely low probability events, especially given the compressed timeline. I should maintain a non-zero probability to account for unknown unknowns, but it should remain extremely low.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming evidence against legalization in 2025, including:
- The hostile regulatory environment
- Negative legal precedents
- Absence of legislative momentum
- Less than 3 months remaining in the year
- Prior enforcement actions against Polymarket

I assess the probability at 0.1%, which represents the remote possibility of a completely unexpected development or black swan event.

Final: 0.1%

Answering based on the provided information and general knowledge as of October 16, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is the approval of a novel and controversial financial product by a U.S. federal regulator (like the CFTC), particularly for an entity with a prior history of non-compliance.
*   **Reasoning:** The process for gaining a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license or even a more limited no-action letter from the CFTC is notoriously slow, bureaucratic, and cautious. For a product type the CFTC has shown hostility towards (political markets) and for a company it has previously sanctioned (Polymarket), the hurdles are immense. The base rate for an entity going from being sanctioned to fully approved within a multi-year timeframe is very low, likely under 5%. Given the question is about a single calendar year, a reasonable starting prior for this happening in 2025 would be even lower.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will set a conservative prior probability of **3%**. This acknowledges that prediction markets have some high-profile supporters and financial backing, creating a non-zero chance of a breakthrough, while still reflecting the high barriers to entry and the slow pace of regulatory change. In odds, this is approximately 1-to-32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation involves seeking federal regulatory approval for a complex financial instrument, which aligns with the base case of new product approvals.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Negative Regulatory History:** Polymarket is not a new applicant; it was fined $1.4 million by the CFTC and ordered to cease U.S. operations in 2022. This makes its situation significantly more difficult than a typical applicant, pushing the probability down.
    *   **Hostile Regulatory Stance:** The CFTC's actions against PredictIt (revoking its no-action letter) and its successful defense against Kalshi's election markets demonstrate a clear and hardening policy against the core product offering of these platforms. This is a major headwind not present in all new financial product applications.
    *   **Manifold's Starting Point:** Manifold operates on play money. Transitioning to a real-money platform would require a complete corporate and compliance overhaul, making its path to legalization in 2025 even more improbable than Polymarket's.
    *   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The most critical difference is the date. As of October 16, 2025, less than three months remain in the year. Regulatory and legislative processes of this magnitude are measured in years, not weeks. This makes any standard approval process a practical impossibility.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: D.C. Circuit Court ruling upholding the CFTC's block on Kalshi's election markets (June 2024).**
    *   This ruling strongly affirms the CFTC's discretionary power to reject markets it deems against the public interest.
    *   P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is very low (<< 1). This evidence makes legalization *less* likely by strengthening the regulator's position.
*   **Evidence 2: Lack of any legislative progress in Congress.**
    *   The most direct path to legality would be a new law. By October 2025, the absence of any bill even approaching final passage means this path is closed for the year.
    *   P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is extremely low (<<< 1). This is very strong evidence *against* a 2025 resolution.
*   **Evidence 3: The current date is October 16, 2025.**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The time remaining is insufficient for any normal-course regulatory approval, rulemaking, or legislative process to conclude.
    *   P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is near zero. The probability of seeing "no public progress by mid-October" is extremely low if legalization were to happen by year-end, but almost certain if it were not. This evidence drastically reduces the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 3% probability = 3:97 odds (approx. 1:32).
*   **Updating with Evidence:** The evidence is uniformly and strongly negative. The Kalshi ruling confirms the CFTC's power and intent. The lack of legislation closes that avenue. Most importantly, the clock has nearly run out.
*   **Conceptual Update:** Let's focus on the timeline. The prior of 3% was for the entire year. Given that ~80% of the year has passed with only negative developments, the remaining probability must be a small fraction of the original. The combined negative evidence (legal precedent, regulatory hostility, legislative inaction, and the short timeline) effectively reduces the odds to a floor. The only remaining possibility is a "black swan" event, such as a sudden, pre-negotiated settlement and immediate approval, which is a tail-risk scenario.
*   **Posterior Probability:** The overwhelming negative evidence, especially the lack of time, forces the posterior probability down from an already low 3% to a value very close to zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible "Yes" scenario is that Polymarket, using its significant funding, has been in secret negotiations with the CFTC for a settlement that includes a path to operate legally. This deal could be announced suddenly. A new presidential administration (from the 2024 election) might have installed new CFTC leadership more favorable to this outcome.
*   **Rebuttal:** This is highly speculative. Federal agencies rarely operate with such speed and secrecy. A complete policy reversal from "hostile" to "permissive" would typically involve public comment periods and a much longer implementation timeline. We would have likely seen signals of such a major shift by October. The lack of any such signals makes this scenario extremely improbable.
*   **Conclusion:** The alternative scenario relies on a series of low-probability events occurring in a very short window. While not strictly impossible, it is exceptionally unlikely. My forecast should remain very low.

### 6. Final Forecast

The combination of a hostile and legally-empowered regulator (CFTC), a history of non-compliance (Polymarket), and an extremely short timeline (less than three months remaining in 2025) makes the legalization of either platform for real-money betting in the U.S. this year a remote possibility. The paths through regulation or legislation are effectively closed by the calendar. The only remaining chance is a sudden, unexpected event like a surprise settlement, the probability of which is minimal.

Final: 1%
