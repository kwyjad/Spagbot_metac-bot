### Reference class & base rates
*   **Major U.S. big-box retailers' post-pandemic operating models (2022-2025):** The overwhelming majority of large retailers (e.g., Target, Costco, Home Depot) that curtailed hours during the pandemic have not returned to pre-pandemic extended or 24/7 schedules. The base rate for a major chain reverting to a 24/7 model in this period is extremely low, likely <1%. This class is highly relevant as it reflects the current strategic consensus on balancing labor costs, security, and consumer behavior.
*   **Walmart's major operational policy reversals:** Historically, Walmart's significant, nationwide operational shifts (like the initial move to 24/7 service or the adoption of Walmart+) are deliberate, well-tested, and announced far in advance. A sudden reversal of a major, cost-saving policy like the elimination of 24/7 hours is rare. The base rate of such a reversal without a clear external shock or years of declining performance is very low, perhaps 5-10% over a multi-year period.
*   **Pre-2020 24/7 national retail chains:** Before the pandemic, Walmart was a primary member of a small class of businesses offering 24/7 service (along with some pharmacies and grocery chains like Meijer). While this shows it's *possible* for Walmart, the entire operational and economic environment has since shifted, making this reference class less predictive of future behavior.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-20** Walmart Q3 FY26 earnings call highlights strong e-commerce growth and raised sales guidance. ↓ — Strong financial performance without 24/7 hours reduces the incentive to undertake a costly, risky operational change. Management's focus is on digital growth and pricing.
*   **2024-04-26** Reports confirm Walmart continued its multi-year trend of closing underperforming stores in 2024, citing profitability and theft. ↓ — This demonstrates a strategic focus on optimizing profitability and security at the individual store level, which is directly at odds with the high costs and security risks of overnight operations.
*   **2024-03-25** Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner emphasizes efforts to lower grocery prices to pre-inflation levels. ↓ — Management's stated priority is on value and price competition, not on service extensions like operating hours. This diverts resources and attention away from a 24/7 initiative.
*   **2024-02-23** Walmart's FY2024 annual report shows continued strong revenue and net income growth. ↓ — The company is succeeding with its current operating model. There is no clear business case or financial pressure compelling a return to the pre-pandemic status quo.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Labor Costs & Availability (Large ↓):** Staffing overnight shifts is expensive (requiring wage premiums) and difficult. The current model provides significant, permanent labor cost savings, a major driver for maintaining reduced hours.
*   **Shrink & Security (Large ↓):** Overnight hours present a higher risk for theft ("shrink") with lower staff and customer presence. Given Walmart's explicit statements about closing stores due to theft, increasing this risk is a powerful deterrent.
*   **Operational Efficiency (Moderate ↓):** Closing stores overnight allows for uninterrupted, more efficient stocking, cleaning, and order fulfillment for online sales. This was a key operational benefit discovered during the pandemic that Walmart is unlikely to relinquish.
*   **Shift in Consumer Behavior (Moderate ↓):** The pandemic accelerated the adoption of e-commerce and curbside pickup. Customers who need to shop at 3 a.m. can now do so online. The demand for in-person overnight shopping has likely been permanently reduced.
*   **Competitive Pressure (Small ↑):** A competitor making a significant move to 24/7 could apply pressure. However, no major national competitor has done so, making this driver currently dormant.
*   **Logistical Implementation Timeline (Large ↓):** The resolution deadline is Jan 1, 2026. A decision to return a *majority* (>2,300) of stores to 24/7 would require months of planning, hiring, and training. Implementing this in the ~5 weeks remaining is logistically infeasible.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Mature E-commerce Channel:** Unlike the pre-2020 era (the old base rate), Walmart now has a massive, mature e-commerce and delivery/pickup infrastructure that serves the "24/7 access" need without the physical costs and risks.
*   **Heightened Focus on "Shrink":** Retail theft is a much more prominent and publicly discussed issue for Walmart now than it was before 2020, leading to store closures and a greater emphasis on in-store security and profitability.
*   **Post-Pandemic Operational Playbook:** The pandemic forced a natural experiment in reduced hours. Walmart discovered it could maintain or increase profitability without 24/7 operations, breaking the institutional inertia that previously supported the policy.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in just over one month. This is not a typical timeframe for a corporation of Walmart's size to execute a fundamental change in its nationwide operating model, especially during the busy holiday season.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior is warranted, based on the post-pandemic retail consensus and Walmart's explicit 2022 statement of "no plans." A starting point of ~2% seems reasonable, with an equivalent n of ~50 observations reflecting the stability of this new equilibrium.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time-to-resolution makes the required logistical implementation for a "Yes" nearly impossible.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Continued official silence on the topic in all recent earnings calls and reports, which instead focus on e-commerce, pricing, and efficiency.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Ongoing strategy of closing underperforming stores due to factors (like theft) that would be exacerbated by 24/7 operations.
    *   (↓ Small) Strong financial performance under the current model, removing any urgent need for a drastic change to boost revenue.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence is uniformly negative and strongly reinforces the low prior. The posterior probability should be pushed down significantly, very close to 0%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcement of a pilot program for 24/7 service in one or more markets.
    *   Statements from executives hinting at re-evaluating store hours.
    *   A major national competitor (e.g., Target) announces a return to extended hours.
    *   Widespread media reports citing internal sources about an imminent change.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The passage of Black Friday and early December without any announcement (the window for a holiday-season change is closing).
    *   Q4 earnings call preview or other investor communications that continue to omit any mention of store hours.
    *   Further announcements of store closures or investments in security technology for current hours.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The resolution requires a *majority* of stores to have *returned* to 24/7 service, not just an announcement. A pilot program in 100 stores would not trigger a "Yes." This is a very high bar.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** An unforeseen, dramatic economic shift or competitive action could theoretically force a rapid change, but this is highly improbable within the given timeframe.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Walmart could be planning a surprise announcement, but the lack of any leaks or preparatory signs (like mass hiring for overnight shifts) makes this extremely unlikely.
*   **Defining "Majority":** Walmart operates approximately 4,700 stores in the U.S. A "majority" means over 2,350 stores must change their operating model. The scale of this requirement is a critical constraint.

**Final Research Summary:** The financial, operational, and security incentives for Walmart all strongly favor maintaining its current, non-24/7 operating hours. The extremely short timeframe to the resolution deadline makes the nationwide logistical implementation required for a "Yes" outcome a near impossibility.

To forecast the probability of Walmart stores in the United States returning to 24-hour service before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for a major U.S. big-box retailer reverting to a 24/7 model post-pandemic is extremely low, likely less than 1%. This is based on the observed behavior of similar retailers like Target and Costco, which have not returned to pre-pandemic hours.
- **Rationale:** The base rate reflects the strategic consensus among large retailers to balance labor costs, security, and consumer behavior, which has shifted significantly since the pandemic.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Walmart, like other major retailers, has not returned to 24/7 operations post-pandemic. The strategic focus remains on cost-saving measures and adapting to new consumer behaviors.
- **Differences:** Walmart has a mature e-commerce infrastructure that reduces the need for physical 24/7 operations. Additionally, the heightened focus on security and profitability further discourages a return to 24/7 hours.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Short Timeframe (Large ↓):** The logistical challenge of implementing a nationwide change to 24/7 operations in just over a month is nearly impossible.
- **Financial Performance (Moderate ↓):** Strong financial results without 24/7 operations reduce the incentive for change.
- **Operational Strategy (Moderate ↓):** Continued focus on closing underperforming stores and addressing theft issues is inconsistent with a return to 24/7 operations.
- **Consumer Behavior Shift (Moderate ↓):** The shift towards e-commerce and curbside pickup reduces the demand for in-person overnight shopping.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** Start with a very low prior of ~2% based on the base rate.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Each piece of evidence strongly supports maintaining the current operating model, further decreasing the probability.
- **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 0.02 / 0.98 = 0.0204
  - Likelihood ratio for all evidence combined is significantly less than 1, reinforcing the low probability.
  - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.0204 × (much less than 1)
  - Posterior probability = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds) ≈ very close to 0%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise announcement or a black swan event, but these remain highly unlikely given the lack of preparatory signs.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where a competitor moves to 24/7 operations could pressure Walmart, but no such moves are currently observed.
- **Adjustments:** Given the overwhelming evidence against a return to 24/7 operations, the probability remains very low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability that Walmart stores in the United States will return to 24-hour service before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 0%

# Will Walmart stores in the United States return to 24-hour service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for Walmart returning to 24-hour service before January 1, 2026 (about 5 weeks from now).

The most appropriate reference class is major U.S. retailers that reduced hours during the pandemic but have since returned to 24-hour service. From the available information, virtually no major national retailers have returned to 24/7 operations after scaling back during the pandemic. This suggests an extremely low base rate.

Additionally, Walmart explicitly stated in August 2022 that they had "no plans" to return to 24/7 operations. Since then, there have been no public announcements or credible reports indicating a change in this position.

Given these factors, I'll set a very low prior probability of 2%. This reflects the rarity of such operational reversals among major retailers post-pandemic.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Walmart continues to operate under the reduced-hours model established during the pandemic
- Labor market challenges that initially drove the decision remain relevant
- The retail industry as a whole has largely maintained reduced hours

**Key differences:**
- The resolution deadline is extremely close (January 1, 2026, just over 5 weeks away)
- Walmart has demonstrated strong financial performance without 24/7 operations
- The company has been closing underperforming stores, indicating a focus on profitability over expanded service
- E-commerce has grown significantly, reducing the need for physical 24/7 access

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of a return to 24-hour service compared to the already low base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Extremely short timeframe to resolution**
- P(E|H): If Walmart were planning to return to 24/7 service, they would need months of preparation for hiring, training, and logistics. The probability of implementing such a major change in just 5 weeks is extremely low, perhaps 0.05.
- P(E|~H): If Walmart is not returning to 24/7 service, we would expect no announcements or preparations, which is exactly what we observe. Probability ≈ 0.99.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.99 = 0.05 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Recent financial performance and strategic focus**
- P(E|H): If Walmart were planning to return to 24/7 service, we would expect to see hints in earnings calls or strategic announcements. Instead, recent communications focus on e-commerce, pricing, and efficiency. Probability ≈ 0.2.
- P(E|~H): If Walmart is maintaining current hours, we would expect continued focus on their successful current strategy, which is what we observe. Probability ≈ 0.9.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Store closures and security concerns**
- P(E|H): If Walmart were planning to expand hours, closing stores due to theft concerns would be contradictory. Probability ≈ 0.3.
- P(E|~H): If Walmart is maintaining current hours, closing underperforming stores aligns with their focus on profitability and security. Probability ≈ 0.8.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.38 (moderate evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2:98 (0.02/(1-0.02) = 0.0204)

Update based on timeframe evidence:
Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 0.05 = 0.00102
Posterior probability = 0.00102/(1+0.00102) = 0.001 or 0.1%

Update based on financial/strategic evidence:
Posterior odds = 0.00102 × 0.22 = 0.000224
Posterior probability = 0.000224/(1+0.000224) = 0.00022 or 0.022%

Update based on store closure evidence:
Posterior odds = 0.000224 × 0.38 = 0.000085
Posterior probability = 0.000085/(1+0.000085) = 0.000085 or 0.0085%

This extremely low probability reflects the combined weight of evidence against Walmart returning to 24-hour service before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- I might be underestimating Walmart's operational capacity to implement rapid changes
- There could be confidential plans not yet leaked to the public
- Competitive pressures might force a sudden shift in strategy

However, even accounting for these possibilities:
- The logistical challenge of staffing thousands of stores for overnight shifts in just weeks remains insurmountable
- Any major operational change would likely have shown preliminary signs by now
- The resolution requires actual implementation, not just an announcement

The most plausible alternative forecast would be slightly higher (perhaps 1-2%) if Walmart had been secretly preparing for months. However, the absence of any hiring surges, training programs, or leaked internal communications makes this extremely unlikely.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming evidence against Walmart returning to 24-hour service in the next 5 weeks, including:
- The extremely short timeframe before resolution
- Strong financial performance under current hours
- Focus on profitability and security concerns
- Absence of any preparatory signals
- The massive logistical challenge of implementing such a change

I assess the probability as extremely low, but will round up slightly from my calculated 0.0085% to account for unknown factors.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the behavior of major U.S. big-box retailers in the post-pandemic era (2022-2025). The research report indicates that the overwhelming majority of these retailers, including Walmart, have curtailed hours and have not returned to pre-pandemic schedules. This establishes a strong industry-wide consensus against 24/7 operations. The base rate for any single major retailer reverting to a 24/7 model in this environment is extremely low, likely less than 1% per year.

A secondary, more generous base rate could be the historical frequency of Walmart making major, nationwide operational policy reversals. These are rare and typically occur over multi-year periods. The research report suggests a 5-10% chance over several years.

Given the specific context of the post-pandemic retail environment, the first base rate is more applicable. I will select a conservative prior probability of **2%**. This acknowledges the very low base rate for the reference class but gives a small amount of extra weight to the possibility because Walmart has a specific history of being a 24/7 operator, unlike many of its peers. This corresponds to prior odds of 2/98, or approximately 1-to-49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case (other post-pandemic retailers) in that Walmart faces the same powerful headwinds: high labor costs for overnight shifts, difficulty in staffing, and heightened concerns about security and theft ("shrink").

However, the current situation is critically different in one respect: the timeline. The question resolves on January 1, 2026. The current date is November 21, 2025. This leaves only about 40 days for the event to occur. This is a massive deviation from a general question about whether this will happen "in the next few years." A nationwide operational change of this magnitude would typically require many months of planning, hiring, and phased implementation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence points uniformly and strongly towards a "No" resolution.

*   **Evidence 1: Extremely Short Time Horizon (40 days remaining).**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The logistical challenge of hiring, training, and deploying staff to enable 24/7 service at over 2,350 stores within this timeframe is practically insurmountable, especially during the busy holiday retail season.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of being 40 days from the deadline with no announcement, no mass hiring events, and no leaks, *if* a majority of stores were about to become 24/7, is exceptionally low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of this same silence *if* stores are *not* changing their hours is close to 1.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Extremely small (<< 0.01). This evidence massively decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Consistent Corporate Strategy and Messaging.**
    *   Recent earnings calls (Nov 2025), annual reports (Feb 2024), and CEO statements (Mar 2024) all focus on e-commerce growth, price competition, and store profitability. There is a complete absence of any discussion about expanding store hours. In fact, the strategy of closing underperforming stores due to theft runs directly counter to the idea of taking on the increased security risks of overnight operations.
    *   P(E | H): It is highly unlikely that a company would be planning such a massive operational shift without it being a central part of its strategic narrative to investors.
    *   P(E | ~H): This evidence is perfectly consistent with the company continuing its current, successful operating model.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very small. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Underlying Causal Drivers.**
    *   The core reasons for ending 24/7 service—high labor costs, security risks, and the operational efficiency of overnight stocking—remain firmly in place. The rise of e-commerce has also provided an alternative for customers needing 24/7 access. There has been no fundamental shift in these drivers that would warrant a reversal.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Small. This evidence reinforces the low probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1-to-49 (a 2% probability), we update with the evidence.

The first piece of evidence—the 40-day timeline—is so strong that its likelihood ratio is likely less than 1/100.
*   **Posterior Odds** = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
*   **Posterior Odds** ≈ (1/49) × (1/100) = 1/4900

This single update pushes the probability to approximately 0.02%. The other pieces of negative evidence, while partially correlated, would push this value even lower. The final posterior probability is extremely close to zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Could I be wrong? The primary path to a "Yes" resolution would involve a secret, pre-planned, nationwide surprise rollout. This would require a level of operational secrecy that is implausible for a public company of Walmart's size, especially concerning a change affecting hundreds of thousands of employees. There have been no leaks, no unusual large-scale hiring for overnight shifts, and no pilot programs that would signal such a move. The resolution requires the change to have *happened* for a majority of stores, not just be announced, making a last-minute surprise even less feasible. An unforeseen "black swan" event that forces this change in the next 40 days is also a vanishingly small possibility. Therefore, confidence in a very low probability is high.

### Final Forecast
The combination of a low base rate, powerful and consistent negative evidence, and an almost logistically impossible timeline for implementation makes the probability of this event occurring extremely low. The incentives for Walmart are all aligned with maintaining its current, more profitable, and less risky operating hours.

Final: 1%
