### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Annual Turnover of Autocratic Leaders.** Studies of authoritarian regimes (e.g., by Geddes, Wright, and Frantz) find that the average annual probability of an autocratic leader losing power is around 7-10%. As this question involves six distinct leaders, the probability of *at least one* leaving office is a disjunction. Using a conservative 7% annual probability for an individual leader, the base rate for at least one of six leaving is `1 - (1 - 0.07)^6 ≈ 35%`. This is a strong starting point.
-   **Reference Class 2: Turnover in Established Single-Party/Personalist Regimes.** The listed regimes are not new or unstable; most are highly institutionalized or personalist dictatorships. Leaders in such regimes often have lower turnover rates than the average autocrat (who might be in a fragile military junta). This would suggest a lower individual probability (perhaps 3-5%), yielding a base rate of `1 - (1 - 0.04)^6 ≈ 22%`.
-   **Reference Class 3: Actuarial Risk for Leaders Over 80.** Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, will be 86 in 2025. The annual mortality rate for an 86-year-old male is significant, estimated to be around 12-15%. This specific, age-driven risk for one member of the group dramatically increases the probability of a "Yes" resolution, independent of political instability.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-09-22] Iran's state media releases photos of Ali Khamenei at a public event, appearing frail but seated throughout. (↓) — Matters because it counters immediate rumors of incapacitation but reinforces concerns about his advanced age and declining health.
-   [2025-08-15] Russia announces a further crackdown on online dissent, citing wartime security needs. (↓) — Matters because it signals Putin's regime is tightening control and successfully suppressing internal opposition, reducing the chance of a popular uprising.
-   [2025-07-20] Cuba experiences scattered protests in several cities due to prolonged power outages and food shortages. (↑) — Matters because it shows persistent internal pressure on the regime, though the protests were quickly contained, limiting their immediate impact.
-   [2025-06-04] The US Treasury Department renews sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector, citing Maduro's failure to adhere to democratic principles post-election. (↔) — Matters because while it increases external pressure, it's a continuation of existing policy and unlikely to be a catalyst for change on its own.
-   [2025-05-10] China's Politburo Standing Committee holds a meeting emphasizing "economic security and social stability," with Xi Jinping delivering a lengthy speech. (↓) — Matters because it indicates the leadership is focused on and actively managing internal stressors, reinforcing Xi's control over the state apparatus.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Leader's Health/Death (Large):** This is the most significant driver, especially for Iran's Ali Khamenei (86) and to a lesser extent Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, who have had unconfirmed health rumors. A natural death is a non-political event that would resolve the question.
-   **Elite Coup/Replacement (Moderate):** A seizure of power by military or political insiders. This is a constant, low-probability risk in autocracies, potentially triggered by a major policy failure (e.g., losing a war for Russia) or elite factionalism (e.g., in China or Iran's succession).
-   **Popular Uprising (Small):** Mass protests leading to regime collapse. While all six nations face internal discontent (economic, political), their security services are highly effective at suppression, making this a low-probability mechanism for change in the short 2025 timeframe.
-   **Economic Crisis (Small-to-Moderate):** Severe economic downturns can fuel popular unrest or elite dissatisfaction. This is a chronic condition in Cuba and Venezuela and a growing concern in China and Russia, but it rarely leads directly to leadership change without another catalyst.
-   **Succession Crisis (Moderate):** In Iran, Khamenei's death would trigger a succession process that could expose deep rifts within the regime, potentially leading to a period of instability where the "Supreme Leader" role is contested or vacant.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extreme Age of a Key Leader:** The base rate for autocrat turnover doesn't fully capture the acute actuarial risk of an 86-year-old leader (Khamenei). His health is the single most important variable in this question.
-   **Consolidated Personalist Rule:** Xi, Putin, and Kim have concentrated immense personal power, eliminating rivals and making them less vulnerable to party-based removal than a generic autocrat. This lowers the risk for them individually but makes their potential departure (especially via health) more destabilizing.
-   **Wartime Stress:** Russia is engaged in a major, protracted war. While this has so far been used by Putin to rally support and tighten control, a significant military collapse remains a potential "black swan" catalyst for a coup.
-   **High External Pressure:** All six regimes are under significant, coordinated US sanctions and diplomatic pressure. While this is a long-term stressor, it can also create a "rally around the flag" effect that strengthens the leader's domestic position.
-   **Disjunction of Six Independent Risks:** The question is not about the stability of one regime, but the chance that *any one* of six distinct systems fails. This structure means the overall probability is much higher than the probability for any single country.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior centered around 30-35% seems appropriate, derived from the base rate of one of six autocrats losing power in a given year. Equivalent n is moderate, as the reference class is well-studied.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑↑ Large) The specific, high actuarial risk of Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is not fully captured by the general base rate and strongly pushes the probability up.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The demonstrated resilience and power consolidation by Xi in China and Putin in Russia, even under stress, suggests their individual probabilities are lower than the reference class average.
    *   (↓ Small) Maduro in Venezuela has successfully navigated the post-election period, solidifying his control over the military and state institutions.
    *   (↑ Small) Chronic, unresolved economic crises in Cuba and Venezuela provide persistent fuel for potential instability, slightly raising the background risk.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence for stability in several key countries is outweighed by the acute, age-related risk in Iran. The posterior should be revised moderately upwards from the ~35% base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    *   Unscheduled, prolonged public absence of any leader, especially Khamenei or Kim.
    *   Reports of a leader receiving medical treatment abroad or from foreign doctors.
    *   Unusual military movements or lockdowns in a capital city.
    *   Sudden, high-level purges or arrests of senior security or political officials.
    *   Sustained, large-scale protests that are not immediately suppressed.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   All leaders appearing healthy and active at major public events (e.g., New Year's addresses).
    *   Successful and swift suppression of any nascent protests.
    *   Routine appointments and promotions within the regimes' security apparatuses.
    *   Official state media in Iran promoting the unity of the Assembly of Experts (the body that chooses the next leader).

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Information Opacity:** These are highly closed societies. Credible information on leader health or elite plotting is extremely scarce and often weaponized as disinformation. A leadership change could occur with no prior public warning.
-   **"Black Swan" Risk:** The forecast is vulnerable to sudden, unpredictable events like assassination, accident, or acute illness (e.g., stroke, heart attack), which are not captured by trend analysis.
-   **Definitional Edge Cases:** A leader could be incapacitated (e.g., in a coma) but not officially declared to have "ceased to be" in their role, potentially creating ambiguity at the resolution deadline.
-   **Focus on the Weakest Link:** The overall probability is dominated by the single most likely leader to depart (Khamenei). Over-focusing on the relative stability of Xi or Putin could lead to underestimating the total probability.
-   **Correlation vs. Independence:** While treated as independent risks, a major global crisis could theoretically correlate the fates of these regimes, though this is unlikely in the short 2025 timeframe.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for at least one of six autocratic leaders leaving office in a year is already substantial (~35%). This

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for an autocratic leader losing power in a given year is approximately 7-10%. Given that there are six leaders in question, the probability of at least one losing power is calculated as `1 - (1 - 0.07)^6 ≈ 35%`. This base rate is chosen because it reflects historical frequencies of leadership changes in autocratic regimes.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The regimes in question are all autocratic, aligning with the reference class used for the base rate.
   - Differences: The advanced age of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, introduces a higher actuarial risk not fully captured by the base rate. Additionally, the personalist nature of some regimes (e.g., China, Russia) may lower the probability of leadership change compared to the average autocracy.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Ali Khamenei's Health**: The likelihood of Khamenei losing power due to health issues is high given his age (86), with an estimated mortality rate of 12-15%. This significantly increases the probability of a leadership change.
   - **Consolidation of Power**: Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have shown strong consolidation of power, reducing the likelihood of a leadership change in their respective countries. This decreases the probability.
   - **Economic and Social Unrest**: Persistent economic issues in Cuba and Venezuela slightly increase the probability of instability, though these regimes have historically managed to suppress dissent effectively.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 35%, the evidence related to Khamenei's health strongly increases the probability. The consolidation of power by Xi and Putin slightly decreases it, but not enough to offset the increase from Khamenei's situation.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (for Khamenei's health)
   - Adjusting the prior upwards due to Khamenei's health, the posterior probability is estimated to be around 45%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence in the stability of regimes like China and Russia could lead to underestimating the overall probability. The possibility of unforeseen events (e.g., health crises, coups) should be considered.
   - An alternative forecast might emphasize the resilience of these regimes, suggesting a lower probability. However, the actuarial risk associated with Khamenei remains a strong counterpoint.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect the increased probability due to Khamenei's health risks and the overall disjunction of risks across six regimes.

Final: 45%

# Will there be a leadership change in any of US foreign adversaries in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to estimate the probability that at least one of six specific leaders will leave power in the remaining ~2.5 months of 2025 (from October 13 to December 31).

The most appropriate base rate comes from studies on autocratic leadership turnover. Research by Geddes, Wright, and Frantz suggests an annual turnover rate of 7-10% for autocratic leaders. Since we're looking at six leaders, and need only one to leave power, I'll calculate:

- Annual probability for at least one of six leaders to leave power: 1-(1-0.08)^6 ≈ 39%
- For the remaining ~2.5 months of 2025 (≈21% of a year): 1-(1-0.08*0.21)^6 ≈ 9.5%

However, I need to adjust this because:
1. These six leaders aren't average autocrats - most are highly entrenched
2. One leader (Khamenei) has significantly higher risk due to advanced age

My initial prior is approximately 12% for the remaining period of 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- All six are authoritarian leaders with concentrated power
- All face some level of internal pressure and external sanctions
- All have security apparatuses designed to maintain regime stability

**Key differences:**
- Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei is 86 years old, with significantly higher mortality risk than the average autocrat
- Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un have consolidated power more thoroughly than typical autocrats, potentially reducing their individual risk
- The time period is only ~2.5 months, not a full year
- Russia is engaged in a major war, which can either strengthen or weaken a leader's position

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Khamenei's advanced age and health**
- P(E|H): If a leadership change occurs, there's a high probability (~70%) we would observe Khamenei's current frail condition
- P(E|~H): If no leadership change occurs, there's still a moderate probability (~40%) we would observe his current condition
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This significantly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Recent appearances by all leaders**
- P(E|H): If a leadership change is imminent, we might see reduced public appearances (~60%)
- P(E|~H): If no leadership change is coming, we'd expect normal appearances (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67
- This moderately decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Lack of visible succession struggles**
- P(E|H): If a leadership change is coming, we might see signs of succession maneuvering (~70%)
- P(E|~H): If no leadership change is coming, such signs would be minimal (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.29
- This significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Short remaining timeframe**
- P(E|H): If a change occurs, it must happen in ~2.5 months (100%)
- P(E|~H): If no change occurs, the timeframe is irrelevant
- This constrains the overall probability substantially

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 12%:

First update (Khamenei's health):
- Prior odds: 12/88 = 0.136
- Posterior odds: 0.136 × 1.75 = 0.238
- Posterior probability: 0.238/(1+0.238) ≈ 19.2%

Second update (Recent appearances):
- Prior odds: 19.2/80.8 = 0.237
- Posterior odds: 0.237 × 0.67 = 0.159
- Posterior probability: 0.159/(1+0.159) ≈ 13.7%

Third update (Lack of succession struggles):
- Prior odds: 13.7/86.3 = 0.159
- Posterior odds: 0.159 × 0.29 = 0.046
- Posterior probability: 0.046/(1+0.046) ≈ 4.4%

Fourth update (Short timeframe consideration):
- This is already factored into our prior, but I'll make a small additional adjustment given the September appearance of Khamenei showing he's still functioning
- Adjusted probability: ≈ 4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk of sudden health events for elderly leaders
- The opacity of these regimes means leadership changes can occur with little warning
- I might be overweighting recent stability and underweighting long-term stressors

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Khamenei's health could deteriorate rapidly (10-15% probability)
- Putin could face a palace coup if the war situation deteriorates dramatically (2-3% probability)
- An unexpected crisis could emerge in Venezuela or Cuba (3-5% probability)

**Adjustments:**
- Given the possibility of sudden health events for Khamenei and the general uncertainty with closed regimes, I should adjust my probability upward slightly
- Final adjusted probability: 7%

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate for autocratic leadership turnover, the specific characteristics of these six leaders, the short remaining timeframe in 2025, and the available evidence about their current status, I forecast a 7% probability of a leadership change in any of the United States' foreign adversaries in the remaining months of 2025.

Final: 7%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks if at least one of six specified autocratic leaders will be replaced in 2025. This is a disjunction of six separate events. A suitable base rate can be derived from the annual turnover rate of autocratic leaders.

-   **Reference Class:** Studies on authoritarian regimes suggest an average annual leadership turnover rate of 7-10%.
-   **Calculation:** Using a conservative 7% annual probability for any single leader, the probability of *at least one* change among six leaders can be calculated as `1 - (1 - P_individual)^6`.
-   `1 - (1 - 0.07)^6 = 1 - (0.93)^6 ≈ 1 - 0.647 = 0.353`.
-   This suggests a starting base rate of approximately **35%** for the entire calendar year 2025, as of January 1, 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The specific group of six leaders has features that diverge from the general reference class.

-   **Similarities:** All are leaders of authoritarian states under significant internal and/or external pressure, which are typical drivers of change.
-   **Differences (Lowering Probability):** Several leaders, notably Xi Jinping (China) and Vladimir Putin (Russia), have achieved a high degree of personalist consolidation. They have systematically eliminated rivals and control the security apparatus, making them less vulnerable to coups or elite replacement than the "average" autocrat. This suggests their individual probabilities are lower than the 7% base rate.
-   **Differences (Increasing Probability):** One leader, Ali Khamenei of Iran, is 86 years old in 2025. His advanced age introduces a high actuarial risk of death or incapacitation from natural causes, which is a non-political driver of change. The annual mortality rate for an 86-year-old male is around 13-15%, a risk far higher than the political turnover risk for the other leaders.

The presence of one high-risk individual (Khamenei) in a group of otherwise highly consolidated (and thus lower-risk) leaders means the overall prior of ~35% is a reasonable starting point, as these factors pull in opposite directions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most significant piece of evidence is the passage of time. The forecast is being made on **October 13, 2025**.

-   **Evidence:** No leadership change has occurred in any of the six countries between January 1 and October 13, 2025.
-   **Time Elapsed:** Approximately 286 days have passed out of 365, meaning ~78% of the year is over.
-   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is much more likely if the event is *not* going to happen in 2025 (P(E|~H) = 1) than if it *is* going to happen (P(E|H) ≈ 0.22, assuming a uniform probability of the event occurring during the year). The likelihood ratio is therefore ~0.22, which strongly decreases the probability.

Other specific evidence from the research report:
-   **Khamenei's frailty (Sept 2025):** This confirms the high underlying risk due to his age but doesn't change the forecast much, as this risk was already the central reason for the high initial probability. He is still in power.
-   **Consolidation in Russia & China (May-Aug 2025):** Reports of crackdowns and emphasis on stability reinforce the assessment that these regimes are resilient and the individual risk for Putin and Xi is low. This slightly decreases the overall probability.
-   **Protests in Cuba (July 2025):** The protests were contained, indicating the regime maintains control despite pressure. This is weak, mixed evidence that slightly favors stability.

The overwhelming evidence is the lack of an event for the first ~9.5 months of the year.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We will update our 35% prior based on the passage of time.

-   **Prior Odds (as of Jan 1):** P(H) / P(~H) = 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.54
-   **Likelihood Ratio (from time passage):** P(E|H) / P(E|~H) ≈ 0.22 / 1 = 0.22
-   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.54 × 0.22 ≈ 0.119
-   **Posterior Probability:** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 0.119 / 1.119 ≈ **10.6%**

A bottom-up calculation for the remaining 79 days of the year provides a cross-check:
-   **Iran (Khamenei):** The primary risk. An annual mortality rate of ~13% translates to a `1 - (1 - 0.13)^(79/365) ≈ 3.0%` chance of death in the remaining period. Including other risks (e.g., incapacitation), we can estimate this at **~4%**.
-   **Other 5 Leaders:** The risk for each is much lower. Assigning a blended ~1-1.5% chance to each for the remainder of the year to account for black swan events (health, coup, accident).
-   **Combined Probability:** `1 - P(all survive)` = `1 - (0.96 * 0.985 * 0.99 * 0.99 * 0.985 * 0.99)` ≈ `1 - 0.90` = **10%**.

Both methods converge on a similar probability, suggesting the estimate is robust.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Main Risk:** My forecast could be too low. The Manifold market is at 17.4%, implying a higher perceived risk. This could be due to non-public information about a leader's health (especially Khamenei or Kim) or a belief that the Ukraine war makes Putin's position much more fragile than it appears. To reach ~17%, the risk from Khamenei for the rest of the year would need to be closer to 10% (implying a ~38% annual mortality/removal rate), and/or the risk for the other leaders would need to be significantly higher.
-   **Counterargument:** The 17% forecast seems to under-update on the fact that ~80% of the year has passed without incident. My estimate of 10% is grounded in the strong evidence of time passage and a specific, model-based assessment of the remaining risks, which are now heavily concentrated on a single individual's health.
-   **Alternative (Lower) Forecast:** It's possible that the stability of these regimes is even higher than estimated and that Khamenei's health is well-managed. In this scenario, the true probability could be closer to 5%.
-   **Conclusion:** My estimate of 10% sits between the higher market sentiment and a lower "stability-focused" view. It correctly identifies Khamenei's health as the dominant remaining factor.

### Final Forecast
The initial annual probability of a leadership change was substantial (~35%), driven primarily by the actuarial risk associated with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader. However, with nearly ten months of 2025 having passed without an event, the probability for the remaining period is significantly reduced. The updated forecast, based on both a time-decay model and a bottom-up risk assessment for each leader, converges around 10%. This reflects the high concentration of risk in Khamenei's health over the next ~2.5 months, with a smaller probability assigned to unforeseen events in the other five nations.

Final: 10%
