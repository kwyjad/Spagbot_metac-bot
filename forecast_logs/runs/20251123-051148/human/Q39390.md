### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical base rate?** What is the distribution of original release decades for all UK Christmas number ones since 1952?
*   **Q2: Are there distinct "eras" in the data?** How has the nature of the Christmas number one changed over time (e.g., pre-talent show, X Factor era, social media era)? Which era is most relevant as a reference class?
*   **Q3: What are the primary causal mechanisms?** What factors drive a song to the top spot at Christmas (e.g., talent shows, charity campaigns, social media movements, streaming inertia)?
*   **Q4: What is the significance of the 2023 and 2024 results?** How did Wham!'s back-to-back wins, following the LadBaby era, change the dynamics of the race?
*   **Q5: What is the current landscape for 2025?** Are there any announced charity campaigns, likely major artist releases, or burgeoning social media movements? What do early betting odds indicate?

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1/Q2:** `List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones Wikipedia`, `original release year of UK Christmas number ones`
*   **Q3:** `how is UK Christmas number 1 calculated`, `impact of streaming on music charts`, `history of X Factor Christmas number ones`, `LadBaby charity Trussell Trust`
*   **Q4:** `Wham Last Christmas number 1 2023 2024`, `why did Wham get Christmas number 1`, `LadBaby not releasing Christmas song 2023`
*   **Q5:** `UK Christmas number 1 2025 odds`, `LadBaby Christmas 2025`, `new Christmas albums 2025 UK`, `social media campaign Christmas number 1 2025`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   The history of the Christmas #1 can be divided into roughly four eras:
    1.  **Classic Era (1952-2004):** Dominated by contemporary releases, often with a festive theme. Older songs were exceptionally rare.
    2.  **X Factor Era (2005-2017):** Dominated by winners of the TV talent show *The X Factor*. These were new releases (often covers), creating a predictable pattern. The 2009 Rage Against the Machine campaign was a notable protest against this.
    3.  **LadBaby Era (2018-2022):** A new, predictable pattern emerged with YouTuber LadBaby releasing novelty charity singles. All were new releases (parodies of older songs, but counted as new).
    4.  **Post-LadBaby/Streaming Era (2023-Present):** With the departure of both X Factor and LadBaby, a power vacuum emerged. This vacuum was filled by a streaming-powered classic, Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984), which won in both 2023 and 2024. This established a new precedent for older songs winning without a specific protest campaign.
*   The key mechanism has shifted from sales of new singles (driven by TV or celebrity) to a combination of factors where the immense streaming volume of perennial classics provides a very high baseline that is difficult for new songs to overcome. A new song now needs an exceptionally strong narrative (like LadBaby's charity angle) or a massive social media campaign to compete.
*   As of late 2025, there is no indication of LadBaby's return or a new, organized social media campaign. The default expectation is a repeat of the 2023/2024 dynamic.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

The synthesized findings will now be structured into the required format for the forecasting panel.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasting Panel**

**Title:** In which decade will the 2025 UK Christmas number one have been originally released?

### Reference class & base rates
Two reference classes are relevant, reflecting the market's structural changes.

1.  **Full History (1952–2024, n=73):** This class shows the historical dominance of new songs.
    *   **2020s:** 4% (3 songs)
    *   **2010s:** 11% (8 songs)
    *   **2000s:** 12% (9 songs)
    *   **1990s:** 15% (11 songs)
    *   **1980s:** 15% (11 songs, incl. 2023/24 Wham!)
    *   **1970s:** 14% (10 songs)
    *   **1960s or earlier:** 29% (21 songs)
    *   *Reasoning:* This long-term view captures all historical outcomes but is likely a poor guide to the future due to massive changes in music consumption (physical sales vs. streaming). Over 95% of winners before 2023 were released within a year of their chart-topping date.

2.  **Post-X Factor / Social Media Era (2018–2024, n=7):** This class is more representative of the current market structure, though its small size makes it volatile.
    *   **2020s:** 71% (5 songs: LadBaby 2020-22, new releases in 2018-19)
    *   **1980s:** 29% (2 songs: Wham! 2023-24)
    *   **Other decades:** 0%
    *   *Reasoning:* This period reflects the dynamics after the collapse of the *X Factor* machine. It is dominated by two phenomena: the highly organized charity campaign (LadBaby) and the streaming-powered classic (Wham!). This is the most relevant prior.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2023-11-21** LadBaby announces they will not release a 2023 single (↓ 2020s) — This created a power vacuum, removing the guaranteed front-runner for a contemporary release and opening the door for a classic.
*   **2023-12-22** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) becomes the 2023 Christmas #1 (↑ 1980s) — Confirmed that in the absence of a major campaign, the streaming momentum of a classic song is sufficient to win.
*   **2024-12-20** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" secures the #1 spot for a second consecutive year (↑ 1980s) — This was a crucial data point, establishing the 2023 result not as a fluke but as a new, stable pattern in the post-LadBaby era. It is now the default outcome to beat.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Streaming Inertia of Classics (Large):** Perennial favorites ("Last Christmas," "All I Want for Christmas Is You") are added to millions of playlists, generating massive, sustained streaming numbers from November onwards. This creates a high floor of chart points that is very difficult for new songs to surpass.
2.  **Organized Charity Single (Large):** A compelling narrative, typically for charity and driven by a known personality (e.g., LadBaby), can consolidate public support and drive sales/streams. This mechanism is currently dormant but could re-emerge.
3.  **Social Media Protest Campaign (Moderate-Large):** A viral, anti-establishment campaign can propel an old song to the top (e.g., Rage Against the Machine, 2009). These are unpredictable and often a reaction to a perceived "unworthy" front-runner.
4.  **Major Artist Contemporary Release (Small-Moderate):** A new festive song by a superstar (e.g., Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift) can be a contender, but recent history shows they struggle to overcome the streaming inertia of classics or the narrative power of a charity single.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dominance of Streaming:** Unlike the sales-driven base rate period, the modern chart is heavily influenced by passive consumption on streaming platforms. This structurally favors older, well-known songs with nostalgic appeal.
*   **Power Vacuum:** The two previous kingmakers—*The X Factor* (a guaranteed new release) and LadBaby (a guaranteed charity novelty song)—are both absent. No actor has stepped in to fill this void with a contemporary song.
*   **Precedent of a "Default Classic":** The back-to-back wins for Wham! have created a new phenomenon: a classic song winning not as a protest, but as the default favorite due to its overwhelming popularity and the lack of a strong new challenger.
*   **Reduced Stigma for Old Songs:** The RATM and Wham! victories have normalized the idea of an older song taking the top spot, making it a more likely outcome than in the 20th century.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the Post-X Factor era (2018-2024) as the reference class (n=7), suggesting a ~70% chance for a 2020s release and ~30% for a 1980s release.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ 1980s, large) Wham!'s 2024 repeat win solidifies the "streaming classic" as the new default winner in a vacuum.
    *   (↓ 2020s, large) The continued absence of LadBaby removes the single most potent force for a contemporary #1 from the last 5 years.
    *   (↓ 2020s, moderate) The lack of any announced major

To forecast the decade in which the 2025 UK Christmas number one will have been originally released, we will apply Bayesian reasoning using the provided background and research report.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Post-X Factor / Social Media Era (2018–2024):**  
- **2020s:** 71% (5 songs: LadBaby 2020-22, new releases in 2018-19)  
- **1980s:** 29% (2 songs: Wham! 2023-24)  
- **Other decades:** 0%  

This period is most relevant due to the structural changes in the music industry, particularly the influence of streaming and the absence of dominant forces like The X Factor and LadBaby.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**  
- The current market still reflects the dynamics of the Post-X Factor era, with streaming playing a significant role.  
- The absence of LadBaby continues, maintaining the power vacuum for contemporary releases.

**Differences:**  
- The consecutive wins by Wham! in 2023 and 2024 have established a precedent for older songs winning without a specific protest campaign, which was not as pronounced in the earlier part of the Post-X Factor era.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Wham!'s 2024 repeat win (↑ 1980s, large):** This solidifies the "streaming classic" as the new default winner in a vacuum, increasing the likelihood of an 80s song winning.
- **Absence of LadBaby (↓ 2020s, large):** Removes a major force for contemporary releases, decreasing the likelihood of a 2020s song.
- **Lack of new major campaigns (↓ 2020s, moderate):** No new organized campaigns or major artist releases have been announced, further reducing the likelihood of a contemporary song.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with the prior probabilities from the Post-X Factor era:
- **2020s:** 71%
- **1980s:** 29%

**Update for Wham!'s 2024 win:**  
- Likelihood ratio for 1980s increases due to the established pattern of streaming classics winning.  
- Adjusted probabilities:  
  - **2020s:** 50% (decreased due to lack of new releases and campaigns)  
  - **1980s:** 50% (increased due to streaming inertia and recent wins)

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be overconfident in the 1980s due to recent trends. Consider the possibility of a surprise new release or campaign.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major artist could release a new song with a strong narrative, or a social media campaign could emerge unexpectedly.
- **Rebuttals:** The absence of announcements or campaigns makes these scenarios less likely but not impossible.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the current landscape.

### 7. Output Format

Option_1 (1960s or earlier): 0%  
Option_2 (1970s): 0%  
Option_3 (1980s): 50%  
Option_4 (1990s): 0%  
Option_5 (2000s): 0%  
Option_6 (2010s): 0%  
Option_7 (2020s): 50%  

(sum ~100%)

# Bayesian Forecast: In which decade will the 2025 UK Christmas number one have been originally released?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish priors based on two reference classes:

**Reference Class 1: Recent Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024)**
- 1980s: 100% (2/2 - Wham!'s "Last Christmas" in both years)
- All other decades: 0%

**Reference Class 2: Post-X Factor / Social Media Era (2018-2024)**
- 2020s: 71% (5/7 - LadBaby 2018-2022)
- 1980s: 29% (2/7 - Wham! 2023-2024)
- All other decades: 0%

**Reference Class 3: Full History (1952-2024)**
- 1960s or earlier: 29% (21/73)
- 1970s: 14% (10/73)
- 1980s: 15% (11/73)
- 1990s: 15% (11/73)
- 2000s: 12% (9/73)
- 2010s: 11% (8/73)
- 2020s: 4% (3/73)

I'll use Reference Class 2 (2018-2024) as my primary prior because it best captures the current market dynamics after structural changes in music consumption. However, I'll adjust this with insights from the other reference classes.

**Initial Prior:**
- 1960s or earlier: 2%
- 1970s: 2%
- 1980s: 35% 
- 1990s: 3%
- 2000s: 3%
- 2010s: 5%
- 2020s: 50%

I've adjusted the strict 71%/29% split to account for the possibility of songs from other decades and the recent trend toward Wham!'s 1980s hit.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The streaming-dominated chart calculation method remains in place
- No structural changes to how the Christmas #1 is determined
- The absence of X Factor continues (off air since 2018)

**Key differences:**
- LadBaby has now been absent for 3 years (2023-2025), making their return less likely
- Wham!'s "Last Christmas" has established a precedent by winning twice consecutively (2023-2024)
- The streaming inertia for classics has been demonstrated as sufficient to win without organized campaigns
- The "power vacuum" created by LadBaby's departure has persisted, with no new organized campaign taking its place

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Wham!'s back-to-back wins (2023-2024)**
- P(E|1980s): Very high (~90%) - This directly supports the 1980s winning again
- P(E|~1980s): Low (~10%) - This pattern makes other decades less likely

**Evidence 2: LadBaby's continued absence**
- P(E|2020s): Moderate (~40%) - Reduces likelihood of new charity singles that dominated 2018-2022
- P(E|~2020s): High (~70%) - Increases chances for older songs, especially established classics

**Evidence 3: Streaming dominance in chart calculations**
- P(E|1980s/1990s): High (~80%) - Favors nostalgic classics with high streaming inertia
- P(E|2020s): Moderate (~50%) - New releases need exceptional momentum to overcome classics
- P(E|1960s/1970s): Moderate (~40%) - Some classics from these eras have streaming power
- P(E|2000s/2010s): Low (~30%) - Fewer established Christmas classics from these decades

**Evidence 4: Normalized precedent for older songs winning**
- P(E|pre-2020s): High (~75%) - Makes all older decades more plausible
- P(E|2020s): Low (~25%) - Reduces the historical advantage of new releases

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on the strongest evidence: Wham!'s back-to-back wins.

For the 1980s:
- Prior odds: 35% / 65% = 0.538
- Likelihood ratio: 90% / 10% = 9
- Posterior odds: 0.538 × 9 = 4.842
- Posterior probability: 4.842 / (1 + 4.842) = 82.9%

For the 2020s:
- Prior odds: 50% / 50% = 1
- Likelihood ratio: 10% / 90% = 0.111
- Posterior odds: 1 × 0.111 = 0.111
- Posterior probability: 0.111 / (1 + 0.111) = 10%

Now adjusting for streaming dominance and the normalized precedent for older songs:
- This increases probabilities for 1970s, 1990s, and other decades with potential Christmas classics
- The 1980s remains strongest due to Wham!'s established pattern

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the recent Wham! pattern with only 2 data points
- I might underestimate the possibility of a new organized campaign emerging
- The possibility of a major artist releasing a compelling Christmas song in 2025
- Potential for a viral social media campaign to promote a song from another decade

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A new charity campaign emerges to fill LadBaby's void (increasing 2020s)
- A different classic from another decade (e.g., Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" from 1994) builds momentum (increasing 1990s)
- A viral TikTok campaign promotes an older Christmas song (increasing 1960s/1970s)
- A major artist releases a Christmas album with a standout hit (increasing 2020s)

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce 1980s probability slightly to account for potential overconfidence
- Increase 1990s probability to account for other streaming classics
- Maintain some probability for 2020s to account for potential new campaigns
- Distribute some probability to other decades for unexpected scenarios

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and red team considerations:

1960s or earlier: 3%
1970s: 4%
1980s: 65%
1990s: 12%
2000s: 3%
2010s: 3%
2020s: 10%

## 7. Output Format

1960s or earlier: 3%
1970s: 4%
1980s: 65%
1990s: 12%
2000s: 3%
2010s: 3%
2020s: 10%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant reference class is the "Post-X Factor / Social Media Era" from 2018 to 2024 (n=7), as it reflects the modern music market dominated by streaming and social media campaigns, rather than the sales-driven market of previous decades. The winners in this period were:

*   2018: LadBaby (new release) -> **2010s**
*   2019: LadBaby (new release) -> **2010s**
*   2020: LadBaby (new release) -> **2020s**
*   2021: LadBaby (new release) -> **2020s**
*   2022: LadBaby (new release) -> **2020s**
*   2023: Wham! (1984 release) -> **1980s**
*   2024: Wham! (1984 release) -> **1980s**

This gives us the following prior probability distribution:
*   **2020s:** 3/7 ≈ 43%
*   **2010s:** 2/7 ≈ 29%
*   **1980s:** 2/7 ≈ 29%
*   **Other decades:** 0%

This prior reflects a market where the winner is either a very current release driven by a specific campaign (LadBaby) or, more recently, a classic hit driven by streaming (Wham!).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2025 scenario is most analogous to 2023 and 2024. The structural conditions—the dominance of streaming and the absence of the *X Factor* machine—remain the same. The key difference from the 2018-2022 period is the absence of LadBaby, who was the sole driver for the 2010s and 2020s wins in our reference class. The key similarity to 2023/2024 is that this power vacuum still exists, making the "default" outcome from those years highly relevant.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Wham!'s back-to-back wins (2023 & 2024).** This is powerful evidence.
    *   P(E | 1980s win): High. This is exactly what we would expect if a 1980s classic has become the new default winner in the absence of a major campaign.
    *   P(E | 2020s win): Low. If a new song were the most likely type of winner, we would not expect a 40-year-old song to win twice consecutively.
    *   This evidence creates a strong likelihood ratio in favor of the 1980s over the 2020s/2010s.

*   **Evidence 2: LadBaby's confirmed absence.**
    *   P(E | 2010s/2020s win): Very low. The causal mechanism for all five new-release wins in our reference period is gone. A new song would need to find a different, unproven path to victory.
    *   P(E | 1980s win): High. LadBaby's absence is precisely the condition that allowed the streaming classic to dominate.
    *   This evidence further strengthens the case for an older song and weakens the case for a new one.

*   **Evidence 3: Streaming inertia of other classics.** While Wham! has won twice, other classics are extremely popular. Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994) is a global behemoth and a constant contender. Slade's "Merry Xmas Everybody" (1973) is also a UK favorite.
    *   This evidence doesn't argue against a classic winning, but it diversifies the possibility across several decades. It slightly weakens the certainty of a 1980s win by providing highly plausible alternatives in the 1990s and 1970s.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with the prior odds of a 1980s win versus a 2010s/2020s win.
*   Prior P(1980s) = 29%. Prior P(New Song: 2010s/2020s) = 72%.
*   Prior Odds (New Song / 1980s) ≈ 0.72 / 0.29 ≈ 2.5 to 1.

Now, we introduce the evidence: LadBaby is gone (the "New Song" engine) and Wham! has proven it can win twice (the "1980s" engine). This evidence is much more likely if the underlying reality is "a classic now wins by default" than if it's "a new song is still the favorite". Let's estimate a combined likelihood ratio of at least 10:1 in favor of the "classic wins" hypothesis.

*   Posterior Odds (New Song / 1980s) ≈ 2.5 * (1/10) = 0.25 to 1.
*   This implies the odds are now 4 to 1 in favor of the 1980s song over a new one.

This conceptual update dramatically shifts probability away from the 2010s and 2020s and toward the 1980s. The 1980s option becomes the clear favorite. However, we must also account for other classics. The probability for a new song is not zero; a new campaign or major artist release could still happen.

My updated distribution is:
*   **1980s:** Becomes the strong favorite, as Wham! is the demonstrated default winner.
*   **2020s:** Retains a significant chance, representing the possibility of a new LadBaby-style campaign, a major artist release, or a social media movement for a new song.
*   **1990s:** Gets a notable probability, almost entirely due to Mariah Carey.
*   **1970s:** Gets a small probability for other UK classics like Slade or Wizzard.
*   Other decades receive minimal probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary risk is overconfidence in the stability of the new "Wham! wins by default" pattern. A predictable winner is a target. A successful "Anyone But Wham!" campaign is a plausible scenario. This campaign would most likely benefit another well-known classic. Therefore, while the 1980s are the most likely single decade, the combined probability of *any* classic winning (1970s + 1980s + 1990s etc.) should be high. I have placed the 1980s at 50%, which is confident but leaves equal probability for all other outcomes combined. The biggest challenger is a new song (2020s), followed by the main rival classic (1990s). This feels like a well-hedged but decisive forecast. The 20% assigned to a 2020s release acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of social media trends and artist release schedules.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the reasoning above and sum to 100%. The 1980s are the modal outcome, with the 2020s and 1990s as the primary challengers.

1960s or earlier: 2%
1970s: 7%
1980s: 50%
1990s: 17%
2000s: 1%
2010s: 3%
2020s: 20%
