### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical precedent for states of emergency in Ecuador?**
    *   What are the common triggers (e.g., security, social protest, natural disaster)?
    *   What is the typical duration, scope (number of provinces), and legal basis?
    *   How often are they renewed? What is the role of the Constitutional Court?
*   **Q2: What is the legal framework governing states of emergency in Ecuador?**
    *   What are the maximum initial duration and renewal periods?
    *   What are the constitutional requirements and limitations for their declaration and extension?
*   **Q3: What are the primary drivers of the current (fictional October 2025) crisis?**
    *   Analyze the dynamics between the government's fiscal policy (subsidy cuts), indigenous mobilization (led by groups like CONAIE), and organized crime (the alleged role of Tren de Aragua).
*   **Q4: What is President Noboa's established strategy and political calculus?**
    *   How did he handle the January 2024 crisis? What does his "internal armed conflict" declaration signify for his approach to this new crisis?
    *   Is he more likely to negotiate or escalate? What are the political incentives for each path?
*   **Q5: What is the timeline and logic for the current state of emergency's expiration and potential renewal?**
    *   The 60-day declaration from early October expires in early December. The resolution date is December 25. The core question is therefore about the probability of renewal or a new declaration.

**2. Proposed Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `Ecuador "estado de excepción" historia`, `CONAIE protestas Ecuador historial`, `frecuencia estados de excepción Ecuador`, `duración promedio estado de excepción Ecuador`.
*   **Q2:** `Constitución de Ecuador estado de excepción artículo 164`, `Corte Constitucional Ecuador control estado de excepción`, `ley de seguridad pública y del estado Ecuador`.
*   **Q3:** `Ecuador protestas subsidios combustibles 2019 2022`, `Tren de Aragua en Ecuador`, `relación CONAIE y crimen organizado Ecuador`.
*   **Q4:** `Daniel Noboa política de seguridad`, `resultados plan fénix Ecuador`, `Noboa "conflicto armado interno" análisis`, `aprobación Daniel Noboa`.
*   **Q5:** (This is analytical, based on findings from Q2 and the prompt's timeline).

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

Ecuador frequently uses states of emergency to manage crises. The Constitution (Art. 164) allows them for up to 60 days, with one possible 30-day renewal, subject to review by the Constitutional Court, which has previously limited or struck down such decrees. The current crisis is a volatile hybrid: it combines the dynamics of past major indigenous-led anti-austerity protests (like in 2019 and 2022) with the security crisis of 2024. President Noboa's established playbook, demonstrated in January 2024, is to frame crises in security terms ("internal armed conflict," "terrorists") and use the military. This escalatory framing makes a quick, negotiated settlement less likely. The current 60-day state of emergency expires around December 4-6, 2025. Given the resolution date of December 25, the central forecast hinges on whether the government will seek and receive approval for a 30-day extension. The severity of the events described (kidnappings, alleged assassination attempt) suggests the underlying conflict will not be resolved by early December, making a renewal highly probable.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

***

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency in Ecuador (2010-2024):** Ecuador has declared dozens of states of emergency in this period, often localized. Triggers include prison riots, spikes in gang violence, natural disasters, and social protests. Most are limited in scope and duration. A baseline might be that on any given day, there is a ~10-15% chance of *at least one* province being under a state of emergency. The number of provinces involved varies widely from 1 to 24.
2.  **Major Indigenous-led National Protests (2019, 2022):** These are less frequent but more impactful events, typically triggered by economic policies like fuel subsidy cuts. They often lead to widespread states of emergency. The 2019 protests under President Moreno and the 2022 protests under President Lasso both resulted in states of emergency across multiple provinces, including the capital, for several weeks. This class suggests a high number of provinces (6+) is plausible during such conflicts.
3.  **Noboa-era Security Crises (2024-Present):** This class is defined by the "internal armed conflict" doctrine. The January 2024 event saw a nationwide (24-province) state of emergency. This class suggests a tendency towards maximalist, country-wide declarations in response to perceived security threats.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-06** Declaration expanded to 16 provinces. — ↑ — Shows the crisis is widening geographically and the government is responding with broader security measures, not targeted de-escalation.
*   **2025-10-05** Five arrested for "attempted assassination" on Noboa. — ↑ — Dramatically raises the stakes, personalizes the conflict for the president, and provides strong justification for extending security measures.
*   **2025-10-04** Noboa declares 60-day state of emergency in 10 provinces. — ↑ — The foundational event. The 60-day clock starts, setting up a critical decision point on renewal in early December.
*   **2025-10-03** 12 soldiers injured, 17 kidnapped during protests. — ↑ — Indicates a high level of violence and organization from protesters, making a swift resolution unlikely and a forceful state response more probable.
*   **2025-09-16** State of emergency declared in Carchi and Imbabura. — ↑ — Establishes a pre-existing security concern in northern provinces, which was then subsumed into the larger crisis.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Noboa's Security Doctrine:** Noboa's political brand is built on a "mano dura" (iron fist) approach. Framing the protests as "narco-terrorism" allows him to use the military and avoid political concessions. This is a large driver towards maintaining the state of emergency.
2.  **Fiscal Imperative vs. Social Pressure:** The government is likely under fiscal pressure (e.g., from the IMF) to cut subsidies. Indigenous groups (like CONAIE) have a proven history of paralyzing the country to reverse such measures. This core conflict is difficult to resolve quickly. Large driver.
3.  **Constitutional Court Oversight:** The Constitutional Court must approve the state of emergency and any extension. It has a track record of acting as a check on executive power, sometimes limiting the scope or duration of decrees. This is a moderate driver towards a lower number of provinces or non-renewal.
4.  **Expiration & Renewal Timeline:** The 60-day decree from Oct 4-6 expires around Dec 4-6. The resolution date (Dec 25) falls squarely within the 30-day renewal period allowed by the constitution. This timing makes a renewal the path of least resistance if the crisis is ongoing. Moderate driver.
5.  **Criminal Gang Opportunism:** Whether gangs are instigating the protests (as Noboa claims) or simply exploiting the chaos, their presence adds a layer of violence and complexity that makes a negotiated settlement with protest leaders harder to achieve. Moderate driver.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Conflation of Protest and "Terrorism":** Unlike the 2019/2022 protests, which were framed as social conflicts, Noboa is explicitly and immediately framing this as a security threat linked to international cartels. This justifies a much harsher, more militarized response.
*   **"Internal Armed Conflict" Framework:** Noboa has a legal framework from January 2024 that designates gangs as terrorist groups and gives the military broad powers. Applying this to social protesters, even rhetorically, is a significant and dangerous escalation beyond past presidents' actions.
*   **Extreme Initial Violence:** The kidnapping of 17 soldiers and an alleged assassination attempt on the president are far more severe than the initial events of previous protest waves. This hardens positions on both sides from the outset.
*   **Short Time to Renewal Decision:** The crisis began in October, with the renewal decision due in early December. This compressed timeline leaves little room for the lengthy negotiations that eventually resolved past crises.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on a low number (e.g., a mode of 0), reflecting that states of emergency are temporary and the current one is set to expire *before* the resolution date. Give this prior a low "equivalent n" due to the inherent volatility of Ecuadorian politics.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (large):** Noboa's established hardline security doctrine and his immediate framing of protesters as terrorists strongly suggest he will not back down and will seek renewal.
    *   **↑ (large):** The extreme initial violence (kidnappings, assassination attempt) makes a peaceful resolution by early December highly improbable.
    *   **↑ (moderate):** The conflation of social and security issues complicates negotiations, making the status quo (maintaining the state of emergency) the default option.
    *   **↓ (moderate):** The Constitutional Court is a significant source of uncertainty and could refuse to grant a renewal or could limit its scope to fewer provinces.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points toward the crisis continuing past the early December expiration date. The posterior should shift dramatically upward, with a high probability mass on a number close to the current 16 provinces, while retaining a small probability of 0 if the Court intervenes.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting a high number of provinces):**
    *   Government formally requests a 30-day extension from the Constitutional Court in late November/early December.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the structured probabilistic reasoning approach outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Historically, Ecuador has frequently declared states of emergency, often in response to social unrest or security threats. The number of provinces affected can range from a few to all 24 provinces. A reasonable base rate might be a distribution centered around 5-10 provinces, reflecting typical past events.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** A mean of 8 provinces with a variance that allows for a wide range (e.g., 1 to 24) to account for the variability in past declarations.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves significant social unrest and security threats, similar to past events that led to widespread states of emergency.
- **Differences:** The current crisis is marked by extreme violence and a strong security framing by the government, which could lead to a broader and more prolonged state of emergency than usual.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Noboa's Security Doctrine:** Increases the likelihood of a high number of provinces being under a state of emergency due to his hardline stance.
- **Extreme Initial Violence:** Suggests a continuation or escalation of the state of emergency, increasing the likelihood of a high number.
- **Constitutional Court Oversight:** Could decrease the likelihood if the court limits the scope or duration of the emergency.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Start with a prior centered around 8 provinces.
- **Likelihood Adjustments:** 
  - Noboa's doctrine and the violence increase the likelihood of a higher number of provinces.
  - The Constitutional Court's potential intervention slightly decreases this likelihood.
- **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution shifts towards a higher number of provinces, with a significant probability mass around the current 16 provinces.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of the Constitutional Court limiting the emergency or a sudden de-escalation.
- **Tail Risks:** The possibility of a nationwide emergency (24 provinces) if the situation worsens.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where negotiations succeed, and the emergency is limited to fewer provinces.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **P10:** 8
- **P20:** 10
- **P40:** 14
- **P60:** 16
- **P80:** 18
- **P90:** 20

These percentiles reflect a high likelihood of a significant number of provinces remaining under a state of emergency, with some probability of either a reduction or an expansion depending on future developments.

# Forecasting the Number of Ecuadorian Provinces Under State of Emergency on December 25, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use historical patterns of states of emergency in Ecuador, particularly focusing on those declared in response to social unrest and security concerns.

**Historical base rate:**
- Ecuador has 24 provinces total
- States of emergency are typically declared for 60 days (the constitutional maximum)
- Extensions are possible for 30 additional days with Constitutional Court approval
- Based on the research report, Ecuador has a pattern of using states of emergency frequently, with varying scope (1-24 provinces)
- Major indigenous-led protests (like 2019, 2022) typically result in 6+ provinces under emergency
- Under President Noboa specifically, there's a precedent for nationwide (24-province) declarations for security threats (January 2024)

Given these patterns, I'll use a prior distribution with:
- Median (P50): 4 provinces
- Significant probability mass at 0 (no emergency)
- Some probability mass at higher values (10+ provinces)
- Small probability of nationwide emergency (24 provinces)

This reflects that states of emergency are temporary by design, but Ecuador uses them frequently.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The current situation involves indigenous-led protests against economic policy (fuel subsidies), similar to 2019/2022 events
- The government is framing the protests in security terms, consistent with Noboa's approach in January 2024
- Constitutional limitations on duration remain the same (60 days + possible 30-day extension)

**Key differences:**
- The current emergency is unusually broad (16 provinces) from the outset
- The violence level is exceptionally high (kidnapped soldiers, alleged assassination attempt)
- Noboa is explicitly linking protesters to organized crime (Tren de Aragua cartel)
- The timing is critical: the 60-day declaration from early October expires in early December, with our resolution date (Dec 25) falling within the potential 30-day extension period

These differences suggest a higher probability of continuation than the base rate would indicate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher number of provinces:**
1. **Current scope (16 provinces)**: The emergency already covers 16/24 provinces, showing the government perceives a widespread threat. (Strong upward push)
2. **Extreme violence**: Kidnapping of soldiers and alleged assassination attempt against Noboa represent extraordinary escalation. (Strong upward push, ~3x likelihood of continuation)
3. **Security framing**: By attributing protests to cartels and threatening terrorism charges, Noboa has limited his ability to negotiate a face-saving resolution. (Moderate upward push, ~2x)
4. **Timing**: The resolution date falls within the potential 30-day extension period, making continuation the path of least resistance. (Moderate upward push, ~1.5x)

**Evidence for lower number of provinces:**
1. **Constitutional Court oversight**: The Court has previously limited executive power and could reject or narrow an extension request. (Moderate downward push, ~0.7x)
2. **Economic pressure**: Prolonged emergencies disrupt the economy, creating incentives to resolve the crisis. (Weak downward push, ~0.9x)
3. **Potential negotiated settlement**: Indigenous groups have historically secured concessions through protests. (Weak downward push, ~0.9x)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 4 provinces, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on current scope (16 provinces):**
- This dramatically shifts my distribution upward
- The fact that 16 provinces are already under emergency makes it much more likely that a significant number will remain so
- New median estimate: ~12 provinces

**Update on violence level and security framing:**
- The extraordinary violence and Noboa's cartel-terrorism framing make de-escalation difficult
- This further shifts my distribution upward and reduces probability mass at 0
- New median estimate: ~14 provinces

**Update on Constitutional Court constraint:**
- This moderates my estimate somewhat, acknowledging the Court could limit the scope
- New median estimate: ~13 provinces

**Update on timing:**
- The December 25 resolution date falls within the potential 30-day extension period
- This increases probability that at least some provinces will remain under emergency
- Final median estimate: ~12-13 provinces

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Overestimating continuity**: I may be giving too much weight to the current situation continuing. States of emergency are designed to be temporary, and the Constitutional Court might strictly enforce this.

2. **Underestimating negotiation potential**: Despite the rhetoric, the government might reach a settlement with indigenous leaders before December to avoid economic damage during the holiday season.

3. **Ignoring potential escalation**: I haven't fully considered that the situation could worsen, potentially leading to a nationwide emergency by December 25.

4. **Overlooking political calendar**: December 25 is Christmas, which might create pressure to normalize the situation or, conversely, might make it easier to maintain emergency measures with less scrutiny.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would be a much lower forecast (0-3 provinces), based on the argument that the Constitutional Court will reject an extension request, forcing the government to either end the emergency or declare a new one with narrower scope. This is especially plausible if the violence subsides by late November.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The extreme nature of the violence (kidnappings, assassination attempt) and Noboa's consistent security-focused approach make a complete normalization by December 25 unlikely. Even if the Court rejects a blanket extension, the government would likely declare a new emergency for the most affected provinces.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to reflect both the strong evidence for continuation and the uncertainty around the exact number of provinces:

P10: 0
P20: 5
P40: 10
P60: 14
P80: 18
P90: 22

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the number of Ecuadorian provinces (out of 24) under a state of emergency on a specific future date. A suitable base rate comes from observing the state of Ecuador on any random day.

*   **Reference Class:** The number of provinces under a state of emergency (SoE) in Ecuador on a typical day.
*   **Reasoning:** States of emergency are, by definition, exceptional and temporary. The default state for any province is *not* to be under an SoE. Therefore, on any randomly chosen day in recent history, the most probable number of provinces under an SoE is zero. However, Ecuador is politically volatile, and has experienced numerous crises (gang violence, protests, natural disasters) leading to localized or even nationwide declarations.
*   **Distribution:** This suggests a prior distribution that is heavily skewed towards zero. The mode and median would be 0. However, the distribution would have a long tail, meaning there's a non-trivial chance of a high number of provinces being under an SoE. For example, we could model this as a zero-inflated distribution, with P(X=0) being very high (e.g., >80%), and a small probability of a larger number of provinces.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is fundamentally different from the base case of a "random day."

*   **Similarities:** The legal mechanism being used—a state of emergency—is a standard tool with constitutional limits on its duration (60 days + 30-day renewal). The current SoE is set to expire *before* the resolution date of December 25, 2025.
*   **Differences:** We are not on a random day; we are in the midst of a severe, ongoing, and escalating national crisis. The background describes extreme violence (kidnapping of 17 soldiers) and a direct, severe threat against the head of state (alleged assassination attempt). Furthermore, President Noboa has a recent history (January 2024) of responding to crises with maximalist, nationwide security declarations under an "internal armed conflict" framework. The base rate assumption that the SoE will simply expire is therefore highly questionable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the forecast, moving away from the prior of 0.

*   **Evidence Pushing Up (towards a high number):**
    *   **Severity of the Crisis:** The kidnapping of soldiers and the alleged assassination attempt are extreme events. They make a quick, negotiated resolution by early December highly unlikely. This evidence strongly suggests the underlying conditions justifying an SoE will persist. (Large upward update).
    *   **President Noboa's Doctrine:** The report highlights Noboa's "mano dura" (iron fist) approach and his framing of social protest as "narco-terrorism." This is his established political brand and playbook. He is politically incentivized to maintain a hardline security posture rather than offer concessions. This makes a renewal of the SoE his most likely course of action. (Large upward update).
    *   **Timeline:** The current 60-day SoE expires around December 4-6. The resolution date of December 25 falls perfectly within the 30-day renewal period allowed by the constitution. This timing makes renewal a logistically simple and legally available option for the government. (Moderate upward update).
    *   **Current Scope:** The SoE is already broad, covering 16 provinces. This indicates the government perceives the crisis as a national threat, justifying a continued, widespread response.

*   **Evidence Pushing Down (towards a low number):**
    *   **Constitutional Court Oversight:** The research report explicitly notes that the Constitutional Court must approve any renewal and has a history of limiting or striking down such decrees. This is the most significant factor that could lead to an outcome of 0, even if the crisis is ongoing. The Court could rule the renewal unjustified, its scope too broad, or its basis (treating protesters as terrorists) unconstitutional. (Large downward update / source of major uncertainty).
    *   **Possibility of a Political Settlement:** Despite the harsh rhetoric, past major protests in Ecuador (e.g., 2019, 2022) have ended through negotiation. It is possible, though less likely given the framing, that a deal is reached before early December, leading to the SoE being lifted. (Small downward update).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution with P(X=0) ≈ 80-90% and a long tail.
*   **Update Step:** The powerful evidence of crisis severity and Noboa's hardline stance drastically reduces the probability that the situation will be resolved and returned to the baseline by December. The initial P(X=0) from the prior is no longer credible.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution becomes bimodal.
    1.  There is a significant probability mass at a high number (around the current 16, or even 24 if it escalates), reflecting the scenario where Noboa's desire for renewal succeeds.
    2.  There is also a significant probability mass at **0**, reflecting the two primary "off-ramps": the Constitutional Court blocking the renewal, or an unexpected political settlement.
*   **Shift:** The mean and median of the distribution shift dramatically upward from the prior. The mode is now likely bimodal at 0 and ~16. The variance is very high, reflecting the deep uncertainty between these two divergent outcomes. The probability of a low, non-zero number (e.g., 1-5 provinces) is relatively small; the outcome is more likely to be "all or nothing" (or at least a significant number vs. zero).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered on 0. This would be plausible if one believes the Constitutional Court is very likely to block any renewal that conflates social protest with terrorism, seeing it as a dangerous executive overreach. This is a real possibility and justifies the large probability mass I've placed at 0.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Am I underestimating the chance of escalation? Noboa's precedent from January 2024 was a *nationwide* (24 province) SoE. The events described here are arguably as severe. Therefore, the upper tail of my distribution must seriously consider 24 as a possible outcome, not just a continuation of 16.
*   **Blind Spots:** Could there be a middle ground? The Court might not reject the renewal outright but could limit its scope to only the most violent provinces (e.g., Pichincha, Cotopaxi, Guayas). This would result in a "partial renewal" outcome, perhaps 5-10 provinces. My bimodal model should be adjusted to a multi-modal one, with smaller peaks for partial renewal.
*   **Adjustment:** I will ensure my final percentiles reflect these three distinct scenarios: 1) No SoE (0 provinces), 2) Partial SoE (e.g., 8 provinces), and 3) Full/Expanded SoE (16-24 provinces). This leads to a very wide distribution.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution reflects a roughly 40% chance of the SoE ending (either through a deal or a court block), and a 60% chance of it continuing in some form. The upper percentiles account for the significant possibility of a continuation of the current state or a full escalation.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 8
P80: 16
P90: 24
