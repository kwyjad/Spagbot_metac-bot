### Reference class & base rates
-   **Direct U.S. bilateral bailouts of major emerging markets:** This is a rare event. The most prominent modern example is the 1995 U.S. Treasury-led $20 billion loan to Mexico during the "Tequila Crisis," using the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). Since then, the U.S. has strongly preferred to work through the IMF. Over the last 30 years, there has been perhaps one such major, direct intervention. This suggests a very low base rate, perhaps **2-5%** for any given emerging market in crisis in a given year.
-   **Activation of U.S. Federal Reserve swap lines with non-G10 countries:** The Fed has established swap lines to provide U.S. dollar liquidity, primarily with major advanced economies. During the 2008 and 2020 crises, these were extended to a handful of key emerging markets (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, South Korea). Argentina has not historically been part of this group. The base rate for a country like Argentina receiving and *drawing upon* such a line is low, but higher than a direct Treasury bailout. A ballpark estimate might be **10-15%** for a country in Argentina's situation over a multi-year crisis period.
-   **Limitations:** These base rates are based on a different geopolitical and economic context. The current (hypothetical) U.S. administration's strong ideological alignment with Argentina's president is a significant anomaly that may render historical precedents less applicable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-05-14] Milei's government successfully strengthens the peso ahead of midterms. ↓ — Demonstrates a period of successful currency management, reducing the immediate need for external support.
-   [2025-09-19] Argentina's central bank (BCRA) intervenes to defend the peso. ↑ — Signals that the currency's stability is fragile and requires using finite reserves, increasing the potential need for a backstop.
-   [2025-09-24] U.S. announces plans for a $20 billion swap line with Argentina. ↑↑ — A massive signal of U.S. intent to provide support. It creates the primary mechanism by which this question could resolve "Yes."
-   [2025-09-23] Trump downplays the plan as a "bailout" but vows to "help." ↔ — Ambiguous signal. While it lowers the odds of a direct loan/bond purchase, it reinforces the political will behind the swap line, framing it as proactive support rather than a rescue.
-   [2025-10-XX] The $20 billion U.S. currency swap is formally authorized. ↑↑ — The plan moves from intention to a concrete, available facility. This is the most critical step toward a potential "Yes" resolution.
-   [2025-11-21] A parallel $20 billion private financing deal falters. ↑ — Increases Argentina's dependence on the U.S. government's support package, making a drawdown on the official swap line more likely if liquidity is needed.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Argentine Currency Stability:** A sharp, sudden depreciation of the peso is the most likely trigger for the BCRA to draw on the swap line to fund intervention. The recent lifting of currency controls creates a high-risk environment for such an event. (Large)
-   **U.S. Political Will:** The ideological alignment between the (hypothetical) Trump administration and President Milei is the primary driver for the existence of the support package. A desire to see Milei's free-market reforms succeed provides a strong motive for the U.S. to prevent a collapse. (Large)
-   **BCRA Reserve Levels:** Argentina's net foreign currency reserves are the ultimate backstop. If market pressure depletes them to a critical level, the government will be forced to choose between a default, reimposing capital controls, or drawing on the U.S. swap line. (Moderate)
-   **IMF Program Compliance:** Argentina is reliant on IMF disbursements. Any delay or disagreement with the IMF over policy could create a short-term funding gap that the U.S. swap line would be needed to fill. (Moderate)
-   **Market Confidence & Private Capital Flows:** The failure of the private financing deal shows that market confidence is fragile. Any further negative shock (e.g., political instability, poor economic data) could accelerate capital flight and necessitate intervention. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Exceptional Political Alignment:** The personal and ideological affinity between the U.S. and Argentine presidents is highly unusual. U.S. support is framed as backing a fellow reformer, not rescuing a mismanaged economy, which dramatically changes the political calculus compared to past crises.
-   **Proactive vs. Reactive Support:** The swap line was authorized *before* a full-blown crisis erupted. This is not a last-minute rescue (like Mexico '95) but a pre-emptive backstop intended to build confidence. This makes its use more plausible as a stabilization tool rather than a bailout of last resort.
-   **Mechanism is Already in Place:** The central question is not "Will the U.S. decide to help?" but "Will an already-authorized facility be used?" The political and bureaucratic hurdles to create the bailout mechanism have already been cleared.
-   **Failure of Private Sector Alternatives:** The explicit withdrawal of private banks from a parallel deal is a key feature. It removes a potential alternative source of funds and funnels Argentina's potential needs directly toward the U.S. Treasury/Fed facility.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10-15%) based on the reference class of rare U.S. direct interventions, with a low "equivalent n" due to the infrequency of such events.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑↑ Large) The formal authorization of a $20B swap line is the single most powerful piece of evidence, creating a direct and viable path to a "Yes" resolution.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The faltering of the parallel private-sector financing deal significantly increases the importance and likelihood of the U.S. facility being used.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The strong, explicit political and ideological backing from the U.S. administration for Milei's project provides a powerful motive for intervention.
    -   (↑ Small) Evidence of ongoing currency fragility (e.g., BCRA intervention in September) confirms the underlying risk that could trigger a drawdown.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should move significantly upward from the low base rate. The primary uncertainty has shifted from U.S. willingness-to-act to Argentina's need-to-act within a very short time frame.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Argentine peso depreciates sharply (e.g., >5% in a week) against the dollar.
    -   BCRA announces a significant drop in net international reserves.
    -   Argentine finance minister or central bank governor travels to Washington for unscheduled meetings.
    -   Negative reports emerge about Argentina's upcoming debt service payments or IMF review.
    -   Major social unrest or political setbacks for Milei's reform agenda that spook markets.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Peso remains stable or strengthens following the lifting of currency controls.
    -   BCRA successfully builds reserves through market purchases.
    -   Argentine officials publicly state the swap line is a "precautionary" tool they have no immediate plans to use.
    -   A smaller, alternative private financing deal is successfully negotiated and announced.
    -   Positive surprises in inflation or economic activity data boost market confidence.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Precision is Key:** The resolution hinges on the BCRA *drawing* from the swap line, not just its existence. The line could exist unused through 2025, resolving the question as "No."
-   **Information Asymmetry:** The true state of the BCRA's liquid reserves and the exact trigger conditions for a drawdown are not public knowledge. The decision could be made based on information we do not have.
-   **Political Stigma:** The Milei government may view drawing on the line as a sign of failure and will resist doing so unless absolutely necessary, potentially tolerating more market volatility than expected.
-   **Short Time Horizon:** With just over one month until the end of 2025, the outcome is highly sensitive to short-term market volatility and specific events. A period of calm could easily push the resolution into 2026.
-   **U.S. Rhetoric vs. Policy:** Trump's public statements can be volatile. While policy seems set, a contradictory public statement could create uncertainty and affect market dynamics, though the authorized facility would likely remain available.

---
**Final Research Summary:** The U.S. has already completed the most difficult step by authorizing a $20 billion swap line, driven by unique political alignment with Argentina's government. The resolution now depends entirely on whether Argentina's fragile economic situation deteriorates enough in the next five weeks to force them to draw on this pre-positioned support.

To forecast the probability of the United States bailing out Argentina before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for a direct U.S. bailout of an emerging market like Argentina is very low, around 2-5%, based on historical precedents such as the 1995 U.S. intervention in Mexico. However, the base rate for the activation of a U.S. Federal Reserve swap line with a non-G10 country like Argentina is higher, estimated at 10-15% over a multi-year crisis period.
- **Chosen Prior:** Given the context of a swap line being authorized, we start with a prior probability of 15%, reflecting the higher likelihood of swap line activation compared to a direct bailout.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Argentina is experiencing significant economic challenges, similar to other emerging markets that have received U.S. support in the past.
- **Differences:** The political alignment between the U.S. and Argentina's leadership is unusually strong, and the swap line has already been authorized, which is not typical in historical cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Swap Line Authorization (↑↑ Large):** The formal authorization of a $20 billion swap line is a strong indicator that the U.S. is prepared to support Argentina, increasing the likelihood of a "Yes" resolution.
- **Faltering Private Financing (↑ Moderate):** The failure of a parallel private financing deal increases the likelihood that Argentina will need to draw on the U.S. swap line.
- **Political Support (↑ Moderate):** The U.S. administration's ideological support for Milei's reforms suggests a willingness to intervene if necessary.
- **Currency Fragility (↑ Small):** Ongoing currency instability increases the risk of Argentina needing to draw on the swap line.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 15% probability translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The combined evidence suggests a strong likelihood ratio, significantly greater than 1, due to the authorization of the swap line and the lack of alternative financing.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.176 × 3 (estimated) = 0.528.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.528 / (1 + 0.528) ≈ 34.5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should consider the possibility that Argentina manages without drawing on the swap line, especially if the peso stabilizes or reserves are bolstered.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** If Argentina secures alternative financing or the peso stabilizes, the need for the swap line diminishes.
- **Adjustment:** Given the short time frame and potential for stabilization, a slight downward adjustment is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Adjusted Probability:** Considering the evidence and potential for stabilization, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a more cautious outlook.

Final: 30%

# Will the United States bailout Argentina before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the U.S. providing a bailout to Argentina before 2026.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Direct U.S. bilateral bailouts of major emerging markets
- Activation of U.S. Federal Reserve swap lines with non-G10 countries

Looking at historical precedents, direct U.S. bailouts of emerging markets are rare. The most notable example is the 1995 $20 billion loan to Mexico during the "Tequila Crisis." Since then, the U.S. has generally preferred to work through the IMF rather than provide direct bilateral support.

For swap lines, the Federal Reserve has occasionally extended them to key emerging markets during major crises (2008, 2020), but Argentina has not historically been included in this group.

Given these considerations, I'll set a base rate of **12%** - representing the low historical frequency of such events but acknowledging that swap lines are somewhat more common than direct bailouts.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Argentina is experiencing economic instability with high inflation and currency pressure
- The country has a history of financial crises and IMF interventions
- There are concerns about reserve adequacy and currency stability

**Key differences:**
- Exceptional political alignment: The U.S. administration has shown unusual ideological affinity with President Milei's free-market reforms
- A $20 billion swap line has already been announced and formally authorized
- This is proactive support rather than a reactive emergency rescue
- The mechanism for a "bailout" is already in place, removing bureaucratic hurdles
- A parallel private financing deal has faltered, increasing reliance on official support
- The timeframe is extremely short (about 5 weeks until the end of 2025)

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Formal authorization of $20 billion swap line**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If a bailout occurs, it would almost certainly use this mechanism
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - The line could be authorized but never drawn upon
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Failure of parallel $20 billion private financing deal**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A bailout becomes more necessary when private alternatives fail
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Private deals can fail without necessitating official support
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Recent BCRA intervention to defend the peso**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Currency pressure often precedes the need for external support
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Many countries defend their currencies without U.S. bailouts
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Trump's statement downplaying "bailout" but promising "help"**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Ambiguous messaging that neither confirms nor denies
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could indicate reluctance for full intervention
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.0
- This is neutral evidence

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 12% (odds of 0.136:1), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence - the formal authorization of the $20 billion swap line:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 0.136 × 2.4 = 0.326

Converting back to probability:
Posterior probability = 0.326 / (1 + 0.326) = 0.246 or about 25%

Updating further with the failure of the private financing deal:
Posterior odds = 0.326 × 1.6 = 0.522
Posterior probability = 0.522 / (1 + 0.522) = 0.343 or about 34%

Final update with the BCRA intervention evidence:
Posterior odds = 0.522 × 1.3 = 0.679
Posterior probability = 0.679 / (1 + 0.679) = 0.404 or about 40%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of the swap line authorization. Many such facilities exist but are never drawn upon.
- The short timeframe (5 weeks) significantly reduces the probability - economic crises often develop slowly.
- Milei's government has strong ideological reasons to avoid using the swap line if possible, as it could be seen as contradicting their self-reliance narrative.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Argentina might successfully stabilize its currency through December without external support.
- The U.S. might provide other forms of support that don't meet the resolution criteria.
- Political considerations might lead both sides to delay any drawdown until after January 1, 2026.

**Tail risks:**
- A sudden, severe market shock could force immediate action.
- Political instability in Argentina could accelerate capital flight and currency pressure.

After considering these factors, I should adjust my probability downward somewhat, particularly given the short timeframe remaining in 2025.

## 6. Final Forecast

The evidence suggests that while a U.S. bailout of Argentina is more likely than historical precedents would indicate, the short timeframe (only 5 weeks remaining in 2025) and Milei's reluctance to use external support unless absolutely necessary are significant limiting factors.

The swap line is already authorized, which removes a major hurdle, but Argentina would need to experience sufficient economic pressure in the next few weeks to necessitate drawing on it before year-end.

Considering all factors, I adjust my final probability to 35%.

Final: 35%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is a direct, non-IMF-mediated financial bailout of a major emerging market by the United States. This is a historically rare event. The primary reference case is the 1995 U.S. Treasury-led loan to Mexico. Another relevant class is the activation of U.S. Federal Reserve swap lines for select emerging markets (like Brazil and Mexico in 2008/2020), which is also uncommon, and Argentina has not historically been included.

-   **Reference Class:** Direct U.S. financial rescue packages (loans, bond purchases, or swap line drawdowns) for non-G10 countries.
-   **Frequency:** Over the last 30 years, there has been perhaps one major direct bailout (Mexico '95) and a handful of swap line activations for a select group of countries. For a country with Argentina's history, the probability of such an event in any given year of crisis is very low.
-   **Chosen Base Rate:** I will select a prior probability of **10%**. This is higher than a simple annual frequency might suggest, but it accounts for the fact that we are already observing a period of significant economic distress in Argentina, which is the prerequisite for any bailout discussion. In prior odds, this is 1:9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

-   **Similarities:** Argentina is experiencing a classic emerging market crisis involving currency instability, high inflation, and reliance on external financing, which is the general context for past interventions.
-   **Differences:**
    1.  **Exceptional Political Alignment:** The primary difference is the strong ideological and personal alignment between the hypothetical U.S. (Trump) and Argentine (Milei) administrations. U.S. support is framed as backing a free-market reform project, not rescuing a mismanaged economy. This drastically lowers the political barrier to U.S. action compared to historical cases.
    2.  **Proactive Mechanism:** The key support mechanism, a $20 billion swap line, has been announced and formally authorized *before* a full-blown collapse. This is not a last-minute emergency response but a pre-emptive backstop. This makes its use as a stabilization tool more plausible.
    3.  **The Political Hurdle is Cleared:** The most difficult part of any bailout is securing the political will and legal authority. The formal authorization of the swap line in October 2025 means this hurdle has already been passed. The question has shifted from "Will the U.S. agree to help?" to "Will Argentina need to use the help that is already available?"

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the 10% prior based on the specific evidence provided.

-   **Evidence 1: U.S. announces and formally authorizes a $20 billion swap line (Sept-Oct 2025).**
    -   P(E | H): Very high. If a bailout (via swap line drawdown) is to occur, the line must first be authorized. This is a necessary precondition.
    -   P(E | ~H): Low. It is highly unusual for the U.S. to go through the political and bureaucratic process of authorizing a $20 billion facility for a specific country if there isn't a significant chance it will be needed. While it could be purely precautionary, it's a very strong and costly signal.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very high (>>1). This evidence massively increases the probability from the base rate.

-   **Evidence 2: A parallel $20 billion private financing deal falters (Nov 21, 2025).**
    -   P(E | H): High. A bailout becomes necessary when other options, particularly from the private sector, are exhausted. The failure of this deal makes the U.S. swap line the primary (and perhaps only) source of large-scale dollar liquidity.
    -   P(E | ~H): Moderate. Even if Argentina muddles through without a bailout, its financial situation is precarious, making the failure of a large private deal plausible.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately high (>1). This evidence increases the probability by removing a key alternative and signaling deep market skepticism.

-   **Evidence 3: Argentina's central bank is already intervening to defend the peso (Sept 2025).**
    -   P(E | H): High. The very reason for the swap line is to backstop the central bank's reserves during currency defense operations. This evidence confirms the underlying problem is active.
    -   P(E | ~H): Moderate. The central bank could successfully stabilize the currency with its existing reserves, making the swap line unnecessary.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately high (>1). This confirms the risk is present and active, increasing the odds of the swap line being needed.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's walk through the update from the prior.

-   **Prior Odds:** 1:9 (10% probability).
-   **Update with Evidence 1 (Swap line authorized):** This is the most powerful evidence. It fundamentally changes the situation from a low-probability hypothetical to a high-probability contingency. The likelihood ratio is very strong; let's estimate it at 9. This implies it's 9 times more likely we'd see a swap line authorized if it's going to be used than if it isn't.
    -   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1:9) × 9 = 9:9 = 1:1.
    -   **Updated Probability:** 50%.
-   **Update with Evidence 2 & 3 (Private deal fails, BCRA intervening):** These pieces of evidence confirm the immediate need and lack of alternatives. They suggest the crisis is not just possible but actively unfolding. This pushes the probability from a coin-flip to being more likely than not. Let's apply a combined likelihood ratio of 1.75 for this new information.
    -   Posterior Odds = (1:1) × 1.75 = 1.75:1.
    -   **Final Probability:** 1.75 / (1 + 1.75) = 1.75 / 2.75 ≈ 63.6%.

The resulting probability is around 64%. The main uncertainty has shifted from U.S. willingness to Argentina's need *within the specific 5-week timeframe*.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

-   **Argument for a Lower Probability (The "No" Case):** The strongest argument against a "Yes" resolution is the short timeframe and the power of the swap line as a deterrent. The existence of a $20 billion backstop might be enough to scare off speculators and stabilize the peso without a single dollar being drawn. The Milei government would also have a strong incentive to avoid the political stigma of using the line, and might "muddle through" past the December 31 deadline. Market activity is often lower in late December, which could provide a brief period of calm.
-   **Argument for a Higher Probability (The "Yes" Case):** The failure of the private deal on November 21 is a fresh and powerful signal that market confidence is gone. Argentina's options have narrowed dramatically. With currency controls recently lifted, the situation is inherently volatile. A crisis can develop and force a drawdown in a matter of days, and we have five weeks for such an event to occur. The bar for resolution is low—any drawdown, even a small one, counts.
-   **Adjustment:** The red team analysis confirms the key tension is between the acute, immediate risk (pushed up by the failed private deal) and the short timeline. The ~64% estimate seems to capture this tension well, acknowledging that while a drawdown is now the most likely path, it is not a certainty that it will be triggered in this specific window. I will round down slightly to account for the "muddling through" scenario.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such a bailout is very low. However, the evidence overwhelmingly points to a unique situation where the primary obstacles have been removed. The U.S. has demonstrated clear political will and has formally authorized the specific mechanism (a swap line). Recent market events, particularly the failure of a major private financing deal, indicate that Argentina's need for this backstop is acute and immediate. The main remaining uncertainty is whether a trigger event will occur in the very short window before 2026. Given the high volatility and lack of alternatives, this appears more likely than not.

Final: 62%
