### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical base rate of MP departures (resignations, floor-crossings, becoming independent) in the Canadian House of Commons?** How does this rate change in minority government situations, particularly in the first year after an election?
*   **Q2: What are the primary causal mechanisms that drive MP departures?** This includes both "push" factors (e.g., party dissent, scandal) and "pull" factors (e.g., government inducements like cabinet or senate appointments, personal career changes).
*   **Q3: What is unique about the current political context as described in the background?** How do the specific actors (PM Carney, Opposition Leader Poilievre) and the razor-thin parliamentary math alter the standard dynamics?
*   **Q4: How does the very short time horizon (Nov 17, 2025 – Dec 31, 2025) impact the likelihood?** Does the upcoming holiday season increase or decrease the probability of a political move?
*   **Q5: What are the observable indicators that would signal an impending departure?** This involves identifying leading signals from media reports, party statements, and MP behavior.

**2. Search Queries (Simulated):**

*   **For Q1 (Base Rates):**
    *   `"list of Canadian federal politicians who have crossed the floor"`
    *   `"Canadian MP resignations by year"`
    *   `"floor crossing Canadian minority government history"`
    *   `"by-elections caused by MP resignation Canada"`
*   **For Q2 (Mechanisms):**
    *   `"reasons for MP floor crossing Canada"`
    *   `"patronage appointments former Canadian MPs"`
    *   `"caucus dissent Conservative Party of Canada Poilievre"` (using scenario context)
    *   `"political pressure tactics Canadian party whips"`
*   **For Q3 (Current Context):**
    *   `"Mark Carney government formation 2025"` (scenario)
    *   `"Liberal minority government strategy Canada"`
    *   `"Pierre Poilievre leadership challenges"` (scenario)
    *   `"impact of tight minority on government stability Canada"`
*   **For Q4 (Timeline):**
    *   `"Canadian House of Commons sitting calendar 2025"`
    *   `"political announcements during Christmas holidays Canada"`
*   **For Q5 (Indicators):**
    *   `"rumours MP crossing floor Canada"`
    *   `"MP meeting with Prime Minister's Office"`
    *   `"unusually quiet MP social media"`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Base Rate:** Historically, floor-crossings are rare events, often occurring once or twice per parliament. Resignations for personal or health reasons are more common, averaging a few per year. The rate is elevated during periods of high political stress, such as in a new, unstable minority government. The period immediately following an election and during a contentious budget process is a high-risk window.
*   **Mechanisms:** The primary drivers are a combination of strong government "pull" (inducements) and opposition "push" (dissent). The current scenario has both in spades. The Liberals have a massive incentive to offer plum positions to secure a majority. The background explicitly mentions dissent against the Conservative leader.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the arithmetic: the government is only two seats from a majority. This creates an unprecedentedly high-leverage situation where the value of a single opposition MP to the government is immense. The recent cascade (d'Entremont, Jeneroux) creates momentum and psychological permission for others to follow.
*   **Timeline:** The short timeline concentrates the pressure. The budget vote is a natural deadline. While the holidays might slow things down, a deal could be struck and announced just before the House rises to maximize impact and avoid scrutiny during a recess.
*   **Indicators:** The most reliable indicators will be media reports citing anonymous sources about unhappy MPs or secret negotiations. Public statements of "full confidence" in the leader from an MP can sometimes be a counter-indicator.

**4. Drafting the Brief:**

With the synthesized findings, I will now draft the research brief following the required format.

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Broad Class: All MP Departures.** In a typical 4-year parliament with 338-343 MPs, there are roughly 5-10 resignations and 1-2 floor crossings. This yields a rough base rate of ~2 departures per year. For a 6-week period (~1/8th of a year), this suggests a ~25% chance of *any* departure. However, this class is too broad as it averages over stable majorities and quiet periods.
*   **Narrow Class: Departures in Unstable Minority Governments.** The period following the 2004 and 2008 elections, which resulted in unstable minorities, saw heightened activity. The most famous example is Belinda Stronach's 2005 floor crossing, which saved Paul Martin's Liberal minority government during a budget vote. This suggests that in high-stakes minority situations, the probability of a strategic departure is significantly higher than the broad base rate. A ballpark rate in the first year of such a government might be 2-3 times the normal rate, suggesting a **prior in the 40-50% range** for a departure over a several-month period, which needs to be adjusted for our specific 6-week window.
*   **Limitations:** Historical instances are few, and each is highly context-dependent. The current parliamentary math (2 seats from a majority) is rarer still, making direct comparisons difficult.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-04] Budget tabled — ↑ — Creates a high-stakes confidence vote, forcing MPs to take a side and providing a deadline for any potential move.
*   [2025-11-05] MP d'Entremont crosses floor to Liberals — ↑↑ — Establishes a precedent, signals deep Conservative dissent, and moves the government one seat closer to a majority, increasing the value of the next defector.
*   [2025-11-06] MP Jeneroux resigns amid pressure — ↑↑ — Reinforces the narrative of Conservative turmoil and demonstrates that the party may be using hardball tactics that could backfire and push wavering MPs out.
*   [2025-11-10] Media reports Jeneroux was in talks with PMO — ↑ — Confirms the Liberal government is actively courting opposition MPs, making further attempts highly probable.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Government Inducement (Pull):** The Liberal government is two seats from a majority. The incentive to offer a wavering MP a cabinet post, a future Senate seat, a diplomatic appointment, or significant local investment is enormous. (Large impact)
*   **Opposition Disunity (Push):** D'Entremont's defection was explicitly linked to disagreement with Poilievre's leadership. Where there is one public dissenter, there are often others in private. This internal friction is a powerful "push" factor. (Large impact)
*   **Political Momentum/Cascade Effect:** The two recent departures make a third more thinkable and less politically shocking. It creates a "window of opportunity" for other unhappy MPs to act while the topic is in the news. (Moderate impact)
*   **Budget Vote Pressure:** The upcoming confidence vote on the budget acts as a forcing function. An MP who is considering leaving must decide before this critical vote, concentrating action into a short timeframe. (Moderate impact)
*   **Conservative Party Counter-Pressure (Countervailing):** The "consequences" hinted at in the Jeneroux case show the Conservative party will be working hard to enforce discipline, which could prevent further departures. However, it could also alienate MPs and backfire. (Moderate impact, uncertain direction)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Proximity to Majority:** The government needing only two seats is a rare and powerful dynamic. This dramatically increases the value of each potential defector and the intensity of government efforts.
*   **Public and Recent Precedent:** Unlike a hypothetical departure, a floor-crossing and a high-profile resignation have just happened. This "proof of concept" lowers the psychological barrier for others.
*   **Explicit Ideological/Leadership Rift:** The stated reasons for d'Entremont's departure (disagreement with Poilievre) provide a clear, non-personal justification that other ideologically-similar Conservative MPs could adopt.
*   **New Government Momentum:** The Carney-led government is in its first year, likely still in a "honeymoon" phase and highly motivated to consolidate power by achieving a majority, rather than managing a stable, years-old minority.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the narrow reference class (unstable minorities), suggesting a ~30% chance of a departure in this specific 6-week window. This reflects that it's more likely than average, but still not a coin flip. (Equivalent n ≈ 10, reflecting limited historical data).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Government is 2 seats from majority (↑ Large): The incentive structure is extreme.
    *   Recent cascade of two departures (↑ Large): Demonstrates the possibility and current volatility.
    *   Explicit leadership dissent in opposition (↑ Moderate): Provides a clear motive and narrative for others.
    *   High-stakes budget vote pending (↑ Moderate): Creates a deadline and forces a decision.
    *   Reports of active government courting (↑ Small): Confirms the "pull" mechanism is in operation.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly in the affirmative direction. The prior of ~30% should be revised significantly upwards, likely well past 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Media reports (even from anonymous sources) of other Conservative MPs being "unhappy" or "considering their options."
    *   Unusual praise for the Liberal budget or PM Carney from an opposition MP.
    *   A Conservative MP suddenly cancelling public events or becoming unreachable by media.
    *   The Prime Minister's schedule showing private meetings with opposition MPs.
    *   Speculation in political columns about who might be "next."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A strong, unified, and public statement of caucus solidarity from the Conservative Party, signed by all remaining MPs.
    *   The Liberal government securing budget support from another party (e.g., NDP or Bloc Québécois), reducing the urgency to get to a majority.
    *   The House of Commons rising for the holiday break early without any further incident.
    *   Key potential defectors accepting new, senior roles within the Conservative caucus.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Unpredictability of Individuals:** The final decision rests with one or two individuals, whose personal calculations, risk tolerance, and private circumstances are unknowable.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most important negotiations are happening behind closed doors. The public only sees the results, not the near-misses or failed attempts.
*   **Holiday Lull:** The resolution period covers the run-up to Christmas when political activity traditionally slows. A deal may be harder to finalize, or an MP may simply decide to wait until the new year.
*   **Resolution Window:** The question resolves on Dec 31, 2025. An MP could have a deal in place but delay the announcement until January 2026 for strategic reasons, which would result in a "No" resolution.
*   **Definition of "Resign":** This includes resigning from caucus to sit as an independent, not just resigning

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for MP departures (resignations, floor-crossings, becoming independent) in the Canadian House of Commons during a minority government is higher than average. Historically, in unstable minority governments, the rate of such events is elevated. Given the current political context, a base rate of around 30% for a 6-week period seems reasonable, reflecting the increased likelihood compared to a stable majority government.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically sees higher rates of MP departures due to political instability and strategic maneuvering.
   - Differences: The current government is only two seats away from a majority, creating a unique incentive structure for both the government and opposition MPs. Recent defections and resignations have already occurred, indicating heightened volatility.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Government is 2 seats from a majority: This creates a strong incentive for the government to induce defections, increasing the likelihood of further departures.
   - Recent defections (d'Entremont, Jeneroux): These events demonstrate current volatility and provide a precedent, increasing the likelihood of additional departures.
   - Leadership dissent in the Conservative Party: This provides a motive for potential defectors, increasing the likelihood.
   - High-stakes budget vote: Acts as a forcing function, increasing the likelihood of departures before the vote.
   - Reports of government courting opposition MPs: Confirms active efforts to induce defections, increasing the likelihood.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior probability: 30%
   - Evidence overwhelmingly supports an increase in probability. The likelihood ratio for each piece of evidence is greater than 1, indicating that the evidence is more likely if the event occurs.
   - Posterior probability: Given the strong evidence, the probability should be revised upwards significantly, likely exceeding 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could be overly influenced by recent events, assuming a continuation of the trend without considering potential stabilizing factors.
   - Alternative scenario: The Conservative Party could successfully enforce discipline, preventing further defections. The Liberal government might secure budget support from another party, reducing the urgency for defections.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of stabilizing factors and the holiday lull, which might delay or prevent further departures.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential stabilizing factors, the final forecast reflects a high probability of another MP defecting or resigning before 2026, but with some uncertainty due to potential countervailing forces.

Final: 65%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for MP departures (defections, resignations, or becoming independent) in a short timeframe (about 5 weeks from Nov 23 to Dec 31, 2025).

**Reference Class Selection:** The most appropriate reference class is MP departures during unstable minority governments, particularly in the early period after an election when tensions are high and the parliamentary math is tight.

**Historical Base Rate:** In typical 4-year parliaments with 338-343 MPs, there are roughly 5-10 resignations and 1-2 floor crossings, yielding approximately 2 departures per year. For a 5-week period, this would translate to roughly a 20% chance. However, the current situation is far from typical.

**Adjusted Base Rate:** In unstable minority governments where the balance of power is precarious (like 2004-2006 and 2008-2011), the rate of strategic departures increases significantly. Given the extremely tight parliamentary math (just 2 seats from a majority) and the recent precedents, I'll set a prior of **35%** for this 5-week window.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Case:**
- This is a minority government situation where individual MPs have outsized influence
- There is ideological tension within the opposition party (Conservatives)
- A budget vote creates a natural pressure point for potential defectors

**Key Differences:**
- **Extreme Proximity to Majority:** The Liberals need only 2 more seats to secure a majority, making each potential defector extraordinarily valuable
- **Recent Precedent:** Two MPs have already left the Conservative caucus in quick succession (one defection, one resignation)
- **Explicit Leadership Dissent:** D'Entremont specifically cited disagreement with Poilievre's leadership
- **Active Government Recruitment:** Reports indicate the Liberal government is actively courting opposition MPs
- **Compressed Timeline:** The holiday season may affect political calculations

These differences significantly increase the likelihood above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Two MPs have already left the Conservative caucus in November 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If more defections/resignations are coming, we would expect to see initial departures creating a cascade effect
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if no more MPs leave, we could still see the initial departures we've observed
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: D'Entremont explicitly cited disagreement with Poilievre's leadership**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If more MPs are planning to leave, we'd expect to see ideological justifications being established
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This could be an isolated case of disagreement
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Reports that Jeneroux was in talks with the PMO**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Active recruitment by the government would be expected if more departures are imminent
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - The government might try but fail to recruit more MPs
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: The upcoming holiday season (Dec 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Political activity often slows during holidays, but strategic announcements can be timed for minimal scrutiny
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - The holiday period makes major political moves less likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7
- This evidence slightly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with my prior of 35% (odds of 0.35/0.65 = 0.538)

**Update on Evidence 1 (Two recent departures):**
- Prior odds: 0.538
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.538 × 3.0 = 1.614
- Posterior probability: 1.614/(1+1.614) = 0.617 or 61.7%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Leadership disagreement):**
- Prior odds: 1.614
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 1.614 × 2.0 = 3.228
- Posterior probability: 3.228/(1+3.228) = 0.763 or 76.3%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Government recruitment):**
- Prior odds: 3.228
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 3.228 × 1.8 = 5.810
- Posterior probability: 5.810/(1+5.810) = 0.853 or 85.3%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Holiday season):**
- Prior odds: 5.810
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7
- Posterior odds: 5.810 × 0.7 = 4.067
- Posterior probability: 4.067/(1+4.067) = 0.803 or 80.3%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 80%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Overconfidence:**
- I may be overestimating the significance of the recent departures. Two MPs leaving doesn't necessarily mean a third will follow.
- The Conservative Party is likely implementing strong countermeasures to prevent further departures.
- The holiday season may genuinely slow political activity more than I've accounted for.

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- The Liberal government might secure budget support from another party (NDP or Bloc), reducing the urgency to poach Conservative MPs.
- Potential defectors might delay their announcements until January 2026, which would result in a "No" for this question.
- The two departures might have been the only MPs seriously considering leaving.

**Adjustment for Uncertainty:**
Given these considerations, I should moderate my confidence somewhat. The evidence is still strongly in favor of another departure, but perhaps not as overwhelmingly as my calculation suggests. I'll adjust my forecast downward to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and accounting for potential overconfidence, I forecast a 75% probability that another Canadian MP will defect or resign before 2026.

Final: 75%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Identify Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the frequency of MP departures (resignations, floor-crossings, or becoming an independent) during periods of unstable minority government in Canada.
*   **Reasoning:** A broad base rate of all departures across all parliaments is too general. Stable majority governments have different dynamics. Unstable minority governments, especially in their first year and around critical confidence votes like a budget, experience heightened political pressure and incentives for such events. Historical data shows that events like Belinda Stronach's 2005 floor-crossing are rare but more likely under these specific conditions.
*   **Calculation:** A typical parliament might see 1.5-3 departures per year. In a high-stress minority year, this rate could be 2-3 times higher, let's say ~5 departures per year. The question covers a period of approximately 6 weeks (Nov 17 - Dec 31), which is about 11.5% (6/52) of a year. Using a Poisson distribution for event frequency, the probability of at least one event in this window is `1 - exp(-rate * time)`. With a rate of 5 events/year, the calculation is `1 - exp(-5 * 0.115)` = `1 - exp(-0.575)` ≈ 44%.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will set the initial prior probability at **40%**. This reflects that such an event is significantly more likely than in a normal political climate, but still not a certainty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation fits the reference class of an unstable minority government facing a critical confidence vote (the budget). This mirrors past high-stakes situations.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Extreme Proximity to Majority:** The key difference is the parliamentary math. The Liberal government is only two seats away from a majority. This dramatically increases the "pull" incentive for the government to entice opposition MPs, making the value of a single defector extraordinarily high.
    *   **Recent Cascade:** The base rate assumes a random event within the year. This situation is not random; it occurs in the immediate aftermath of two other departures (one floor-crossing, one resignation under pressure). This suggests a period of acute instability and momentum, a "hot spot" where the probability is temporarily much higher than the annual average.
    *   **Explicit Leadership Dissent:** The first defection was explicitly tied to disagreement with the Conservative leader. This provides a ready-made narrative and political cover for other ideologically-similar MPs to follow suit, representing a powerful "push" factor.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Government is 2 seats from a majority.**
    *   This evidence makes a departure much more likely. The government has a powerful motive to actively engineer one.
    *   P(E1 | H: another MP departs) is much higher than P(E1 | ~H: no MP departs).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is strongly > 1 (increases probability).**
*   **Evidence 2: A floor-crossing and a resignation just occurred in the preceding two weeks.**
    *   This "cascade" is strong evidence of underlying caucus turmoil. It's much more likely to see a cluster of departures if there is a systemic issue than if the first two were isolated incidents.
    *   P(E2 | H) is much higher than P(E2 | ~H).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is strongly > 1 (increases probability).**
*   **Evidence 3: Media reports confirm the government is actively courting MPs and the opposition is applying pressure to stop them.**
    *   This confirms that the theoretical "pull" and "counter-pressure" mechanisms are actively in play. It describes a high-stakes environment where a departure is being negotiated or contested.
    *   P(E3 | H) is significantly higher than P(E3 | ~H).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is > 1 (increases probability).**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 40%, so Prior Odds = 0.40 / (1 - 0.40) = 0.67.
*   **Update Step:** The combined evidence (extreme incentives, recent cascade, confirmed maneuvering) makes the hypothesis of another departure significantly more plausible. The fact that two have already happened suggests the conditions are ripe. A conservative estimate for the combined Likelihood Ratio of this highly specific and volatile situation is around 3.0.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.67 × 3.0 = 2.01.
*   **Posterior Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 2.01 / 3.01 ≈ 67%.
*   **Summary:** The initial 40% base rate is substantially increased by the overwhelming evidence that the current political environment is exceptionally volatile and the incentives for a departure are at a peak. The situation has moved from "plausible" to "probable."

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative View:** The two recent departures may have been the only "low-hanging fruit." The Conservative Party, now on high alert, will have implemented intense loyalty enforcement measures, making a third departure much harder. The threat of "consequences" may now be a very effective deterrent.
*   **Counterargument:** These hardball tactics could backfire, alienating a wavering MP even further and becoming the final push factor.
*   **Timing Risk:** The resolution window closes on Dec 31. Political activity slows significantly in late December. A potential defector might decide to wait until the new year to make a move, causing this forecast to resolve as "No" even if a departure is imminent.
*   **Complexity:** Getting one MP to cross is a coup. Getting the two needed for a majority is a full campaign. The difficulty increases with each attempt. However, the question only asks for one more.
*   **Adjustment:** The red team arguments are valid and introduce significant uncertainty. The holiday lull and the possibility that the Conservative party has successfully quelled the rebellion are the strongest points. I will slightly reduce my posterior probability from 67% to account for these risks.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for an MP departure in a volatile minority government is already significant (~40% for this time window). However, the current situation is far from typical. The extreme incentive for the government (needing only two seats for a majority) combined with the proven instability in the opposition caucus (evidenced by two recent departures) creates a perfect storm. The evidence strongly suggests that the probability is much higher than the base rate. While there are countervailing factors, such as party discipline and the upcoming holiday season, the political momentum and the sheer size of the prize for the government make another departure more likely than not.

Final: 64%
