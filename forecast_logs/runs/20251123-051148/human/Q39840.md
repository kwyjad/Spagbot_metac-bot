### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical base rate for the *highest daily* global surface air temperature anomaly in November-December?** This requires examining past years, especially recent ones, using the specified Copernicus dataset. I need to differentiate between El Niño, La Niña, and neutral years to create relevant reference classes.
*   **Q2: What is the current state and forecasted strength/duration of the ongoing La Niña event?** This is the primary driver mentioned in the background and sources. I need to synthesize the provided sources to understand its expected impact.
*   **Q3: What other major climate drivers are currently active and how do they influence global temperatures?** This includes the long-term warming trend, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) outside the equatorial Pacific, and potential lingering effects from events like the Hunga Tonga eruption.
*   **Q4: How has the daily temperature anomaly evolved over the past six months?** The provided chart and background text are the primary sources. This recent trend is a key piece of evidence for how the system is currently behaving.
*   **Q5: How does the current situation (late 2025) differ from the reference class years?** This involves comparing the background state (e.g., overall ocean heat content) and unique factors of 2025 against past La Niña or record-warm years.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Base Rates:** Recent Nov/Dec daily peaks are highly dependent on ENSO. The 2023 El Niño peak was exceptionally high, likely near +1.9°C. The 2020-2022 La Niña period saw lower peaks, likely in the +1.2°C to +1.4°C range. The underlying warming trend means each subsequent year's base rate is higher.
*   **La Niña:** The sources are unanimous. A La Niña is active as of Oct/Nov 2025. It is expected to persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter but is generally forecast to be a weak-to-moderate event. Its cooling effect is the most significant recent change to the climate system.
*   **Other Drivers:** The long-term warming trend provides a powerful, persistent upward pressure. Global oceans, particularly the North Atlantic, remain exceptionally warm, counteracting some of La Niña's cooling effect. The stratospheric water vapor from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption is still likely exerting a small warming influence.
*   **Recent Trend:** The provided chart is critical. It shows 2025's anomaly has plateaued and slightly decreased in recent months, falling below 2023 and 2024 levels. This is strong evidence that the cooling influence of the emerging La Niña is already taking effect, arresting the upward trend seen earlier in the year.
*   **Differences:** The key difference from past La Niña events is the exceptionally warm starting point. The planet is emerging from a period of record-breaking heat in 2023-2024, and overall ocean heat content is at a record high. This means the La Niña is acting on a system with much more thermal inertia than in the past.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

With the synthesized findings, I will now populate the required sections of the brief, ensuring the language is concise and decision-useful for a statistician.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Recent Strong El Niño Years (e.g., 2023):** This class represents an upper bound. The peak daily anomaly in Nov/Dec 2023 was exceptionally high, likely in the **+1.8°C to +2.0°C** range relative to the 1850-1900 baseline used by Copernicus for headline figures (or ~+1.7 to +1.9°C vs the 1991-2020 baseline). This class is relevant for understanding the potential ceiling but is unlikely to be repeated under La Niña conditions.
*   **Recent La Niña Years (e.g., 2020-2022):** This class provides a more analogous comparison. During the multi-year La Niña, peak Nov/Dec daily anomalies were significantly lower, likely in the **+1.2°C to +1.4°C** range (vs 1850-1900). Limitation: The underlying long-term warming trend means the baseline for 2025 is ~0.06°C warmer than for 2022.
*   **All Recent Years (2020-2024):** This blended class gives a broader sense of modern variability. The range of Nov/Dec daily peaks spans from roughly **+1.2°C to +2.0°C**. The midpoint of this range (~+1.6°C) could serve as a weak starting point before considering specific 2025 conditions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **ENSO State (La Niña):** The primary driver for this forecast. La Niña promotes cooling by altering atmospheric circulation and bringing cooler, deep ocean water to the surface in the Pacific. **Effect:** Large, downward pressure on the anomaly.
*   **Long-Term Warming Trend:** Greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, providing a persistent warming pressure of roughly +0.2°C per decade. **Effect:** Large, upward pressure on the anomaly.
*   **Global Ocean Heat Content:** Oceans outside the equatorial Pacific, particularly the North Atlantic, remain at record or near-record warmth. This acts as a massive heat reservoir, buffering the global average from La Niña's cooling. **Effect:** Moderate, upward pressure.
*   **Hunga Tonga Water Vapor:** The 2022 eruption injected a large amount of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. Its warming effect is thought to be peaking in the 2024-2025 timeframe. **Effect:** Small to moderate, upward pressure.
*   **Weather Variability:** The question resolves on a *daily peak*. A specific synoptic-scale weather pattern (e.g., a "heat dome" over a large landmass like Siberia) could cause a short-term spike unrelated to the broader climate state. **Effect:** Random, could be moderate in either direction for a single day.

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

For the base rate, I will use the historical highest daily global surface air temperature anomalies during November-December from recent years, particularly focusing on La Niña years. The range for recent La Niña years (e.g., 2020-2022) is approximately +1.2°C to +1.4°C. Given the ongoing warming trend, I will adjust this slightly upward to account for the increased baseline temperature, setting the base rate mean at +1.35°C with a variance reflecting the historical spread.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

The current situation is similar to past La Niña years in that La Niña conditions are expected to persist, exerting a cooling influence. However, the differences include a higher starting point due to the record warmth of 2023-2024 and the ongoing long-term warming trend. These differences suggest a potential upward shift in the anomaly compared to past La Niña years.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

- **La Niña Conditions:** Strong downward pressure on the anomaly, making lower values more likely.
- **Long-Term Warming Trend:** Provides upward pressure, making higher values more likely.
- **Global Ocean Heat Content:** Adds upward pressure, counteracting some of La Niña's cooling.
- **Recent Temperature Trends:** The plateau and slight decrease in anomalies suggest La Niña's influence is already being felt, reinforcing the likelihood of lower anomalies.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**

Starting with a prior centered at +1.35°C, the evidence of La Niña conditions suggests a downward adjustment. However, the long-term warming trend and high ocean heat content provide significant upward pressure. Balancing these factors, I adjust the mean slightly upward to +1.4°C, with a variance that allows for a range of outcomes reflecting the competing influences.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

Considering tail risks, such as unexpected synoptic weather patterns that could cause short-term spikes, I ensure the distribution allows for these possibilities. An alternative forecast might emphasize the cooling effect of La Niña more strongly, but given the high ocean heat content and warming trend, I find the upward adjustment justified. I ensure the percentiles reflect a realistic range without overconfidence.

**6. Final Percentiles**

P10: 1.25  
P20: 1.30  
P40: 1.35  
P60: 1.45  
P80: 1.55  
P90: 1.65

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use recent La Niña years (2020-2022) as my primary reference class, since we know a La Niña is currently active and expected to persist through the forecast period. According to the research report, during recent La Niña years, peak Nov/Dec daily anomalies were in the range of +1.2°C to +1.4°C (relative to the 1850-1900 baseline).

However, I need to account for the underlying warming trend of approximately +0.2°C per decade, which means the baseline for 2025 is about 0.06°C warmer than for 2022 (the most recent La Niña year in our reference class).

Therefore, my prior distribution for the highest daily temperature anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025 has:
- Median (P50): +1.36°C (midpoint of La Niña range, adjusted for warming trend)
- Spread: Approximately ±0.2°C for the central 80% interval

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through the forecast period
- The general climate system dynamics remain similar to recent years
- The seasonal cycle and measurement methodology are consistent

**Key differences:**
1. The 2025 La Niña emerged from an exceptionally warm period (2023-2024), with record ocean heat content
2. The current La Niña is described as weak-to-moderate, whereas some previous events were stronger
3. The North Atlantic and other ocean basins remain exceptionally warm, potentially buffering La Niña's cooling effect
4. The long-term warming trend continues to push temperatures upward
5. Lingering effects from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption may provide additional warming pressure

These differences suggest that while La Niña will exert downward pressure on temperatures, the starting point and background conditions are warmer than in previous La Niña events.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing distribution higher:**
1. **Record ocean heat content**: The planet is emerging from record-breaking heat in 2023-2024, with exceptionally high thermal inertia. This makes a likelihood ratio of ~2:1 favoring higher values.
2. **Warming trend**: The +0.2°C per decade trend continues, already incorporated in the base rate adjustment. Likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 for higher values.
3. **Hunga Tonga water vapor**: The 2022 eruption's stratospheric water vapor is still exerting a small warming influence. Likelihood ratio ~1.1:1 for higher values.

**Evidence pushing distribution lower:**
1. **Active La Niña conditions**: NOAA confirmed La Niña conditions on October 9, 2025, with expectations to persist through winter. This is the dominant cooling mechanism. Likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower values.
2. **Recent temperature plateau**: The chart shows 2025's anomaly has already plateaued and slightly decreased in recent months, falling below 2023 and 2024 levels. This suggests La Niña's cooling effect is already taking hold. Likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring lower values.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at +1.36°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

First update - La Niña's cooling effect (3:1 likelihood ratio favoring lower values):
- This shifts my distribution downward by approximately 0.1°C
- New median: +1.26°C

Second update - Record ocean heat content (2:1 likelihood ratio favoring higher values):
- This shifts the distribution upward by approximately 0.07°C
- New median: +1.33°C

Third update - Recent temperature plateau (2:1 likelihood ratio favoring lower values):
- This shifts the distribution downward by approximately 0.07°C
- New median: +1.26°C

The combined effect of these updates is to:
1. Shift the central tendency slightly downward from my prior (from +1.36°C to +1.26°C)
2. Maintain a similar spread due to competing factors
3. Create a slightly right-skewed distribution due to the potential for short-term heat spikes

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be underestimating the cooling effect of La Niña if it strengthens more than expected
2. I may be overestimating the buffering effect of warm oceans outside the equatorial Pacific
3. The question asks for the highest daily anomaly, which could be affected by short-term weather patterns that are inherently unpredictable

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Stronger cooling scenario**: If La Niña strengthens significantly, we could see anomalies closer to +1.0°C
2. **Weather spike scenario**: A specific synoptic-scale weather pattern could cause a short-term spike to +1.5°C or higher, regardless of the broader La Niña conditions
3. **Minimal impact scenario**: If La Niña's teleconnections are weaker than expected, the anomaly might remain closer to +1.4°C

Given these considerations, I should widen my uncertainty bands slightly, particularly on the upper end to account for potential weather-driven spikes.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025:

P10: 1.05
P20: 1.12
P40: 1.22
P60: 1.30
P80: 1.42
P90: 1.52

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the *highest daily* global surface air temperature anomaly in November-December 2025. The most appropriate reference class is recent years (2020-2024), as the strong underlying warming trend makes older data less relevant. This class can be subdivided by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) state, which is the primary driver of inter-annual variability. The anomalies are relative to the 1991-2020 baseline, as shown in the provided chart.

*   **La Niña Years (2020-2022):** During this multi-year La Niña, global temperatures were suppressed. The peak daily anomalies in Nov-Dec were in the range of **+0.5°C to +0.6°C**.
*   **El Niño/Transition Years (2023-2024):** Driven by a strong El Niño, 2023 saw Nov-Dec daily peaks around **+1.1°C to +1.2°C**. 2024, while transitioning away from El Niño, remained exceptionally warm.

Given that 2025 is a confirmed La Niña year, the 2020-2022 period is the more relevant starting point. However, we must account for the background warming trend of ~0.02°C per year. Adjusting the 2022 peak (~0.6°C) for three years of warming (+0.06°C) gives a starting point.

Therefore, my prior distribution is centered around **0.66°C**, with a plausible range from 0.5°C to 0.9°C, reflecting the uncertainty and the influence of the warmer El Niño years on the overall recent distribution.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation in late 2025 is similar to the 2020-2022 reference class in that La Niña is the dominant ENSO state, which exerts a cooling pressure.

However, there are critical differences that push the forecast upwards from this base case:
1.  **Record Ocean Heat Content:** 2025 is emerging from the record-breaking global heat of 2023-2024. Overall ocean heat content is at an all-time high. This creates immense thermal inertia, meaning the global system has much more heat to shed, which will buffer the cooling effects of La Niña.
2.  **La Niña Strength:** The current La Niña is forecast to be weak-to-moderate and potentially short-lived. This contrasts with the stronger, multi-year "triple-dip" La Niña of 2020-2022. A weaker event will have a smaller cooling impact.
3.  **Hunga Tonga Eruption:** Lingering stratospheric water vapor from the 2022 eruption continues to exert a small but non-trivial warming effect (~0.05°C), a factor not as present during the 2020-2022 period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the key differences identified above.

*   **Evidence 1: Confirmed La Niña & Recent Trend.** The NOAA announcement and the provided chart confirm La Niña's cooling effect is already active. The 2025 temperature anomaly (dark red line) has stagnated and is tracking below 2023 and 2024 levels. This strongly disfavors outcomes in the El Niño range (>1.1°C) and anchors the forecast in La Niña territory. This evidence confirms the relevance of the La Niña base rate but doesn't significantly shift it, as the base rate already assumed La Niña.
*   **Evidence 2: High Ocean Heat Content + Weak La Niña.** This is the most significant evidence. A weak La Niña acting on a record-warm planet is unlikely to produce the same level of cooling as the stronger 2020-2022 event did on a cooler planet. This makes outcomes significantly higher than the adjusted base rate of 0.66°C much more likely. I estimate this combination provides a strong upward pressure, shifting the median by +0.15°C to +0.20°C.
*   **Evidence 3: Hunga Tonga Water Vapor.** This provides a smaller, persistent warming influence. It makes outcomes at the lower end of the prior distribution less likely and nudges the entire distribution slightly higher. I estimate this as a small upward shift of ~+0.05°C.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior Median:** ~0.66°C (based on 2022 La Niña + warming trend).
*   **Update 1 (Strong):** The combination of record ocean heat and a weak La Niña strongly suggests 2025 will be much warmer than the 2020-2022 La Niña years.
    *   *Conceptual Update:* Posterior Median ≈ 0.66°C + 0.19°C = 0.85°C.
*   **Update 2 (Weak):** The lingering effect of the Hunga Tonga eruption adds a small amount of additional warming.
    *   *Conceptual Update:* Posterior Median ≈ 0.85°C + 0.05°C = 0.90°C.

My final posterior distribution is centered around a median of **0.90°C**. The distribution is no longer centered on the historical La Niña base rate but has shifted significantly upward due to the unique background conditions of 2025. The variance remains substantial due to inherent daily weather variability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong.
*   **Higher Scenario (Peak > 1.0°C):** The La Niña's atmospheric coupling could be weaker than expected, and the immense heat stored in the oceans (especially the Atlantic) could completely overwhelm its cooling influence. A random, large-scale weather event (e.g., a "heat dome" over Asia) could also cause a short-term spike. This makes a peak above 1.0°C plausible.
*   **Lower Scenario (Peak < 0.8°C):** The La Niña could unexpectedly and rapidly strengthen in November or December. Its cooling teleconnections could prove more potent or faster-acting than models currently predict. This could drive the peak temperature down towards the levels seen in the chart's most recent data points (~0.8°C) or even lower.

My central estimate of 0.90°C seems robust, as it balances these competing forces. The final percentile range should reflect these tail risks, creating a distribution that is cooler than the 2023-2024 peaks but significantly warmer than the 2020-2022 peaks. I will create a symmetric distribution around my median of 0.90°C to represent the uncertainty in both directions.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0.74
P20: 0.80
P40: 0.86
P60: 0.94
P80: 1.00
