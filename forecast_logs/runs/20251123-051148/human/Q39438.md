### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Cases with Unanimous Lower Court Outcomes:** When the Supreme Court reviews a case where multiple lower courts have reached the same outcome (here, that the tariffs are unlawful), the Court affirms more often than it reverses. While precise rates vary, a ballpark estimate is that the Supreme Court affirms in **60-70%** of such cases. This suggests a base rate favoring the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome. This is limited because the lower courts here used different reasoning, which might be the very reason the Supreme Court took the case—to clarify the correct legal standard.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine Cases in the Roberts Court:** This case squarely implicates the "major questions doctrine," where the Court is skeptical that Congress delegates vast economic or political authority to the executive branch via general statutory language. In recent major cases invoking this doctrine (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, the OSHA vaccine mandate case), the executive branch has lost. The base rate for the government winning a major questions case before the current Court is low, perhaps **20-30%**. This strongly favors the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome.
3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court has shown significant deference to the President in matters of foreign policy and national security. In cases touching on these areas, the President's actions are upheld at a higher rate than in purely domestic matters. A base rate might be **55-65%** in favor of the President. This class points toward "Tariffs lawful," providing a strong countervailing consideration to the other reference classes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms ruling against tariffs (7-4) — ↑ Unlawful — A specialized and respected appellate court found the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority, strengthening the legal case against them.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants expedited review of both cases — ↓ No 2025 ruling — The Court's urgency signals it intends to resolve the matter quickly, making a decision by year-end more likely than not.
*   **2025-11-05** Supreme Court hears oral arguments — Neutral — This is a procedural milestone. The content of the arguments is unknown, but the hearing itself moves the timeline forward, keeping a 2025 ruling on the table.
*   **2025-11-14** Trump administration removes some "reciprocal tariffs" on agricultural goods — ↑ Unlawful/Mixed — This could be a tactical retreat, signaling the administration's belief that its legal position on the broadest tariffs is weak and an attempt to moot part of the case.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Statutory Interpretation of IEEPA:** The core of the case is whether IEEPA's text, which allows the President to "regulate... any... importation," includes the power to set tariffs (a tax). A narrow, textualist reading likely finds it does not, as the power to tax is constitutionally granted to Congress. (Large driver toward `Unlawful`).
2.  **Major Questions & Non-Delegation Doctrines:** The current conservative majority is highly skeptical of broad delegations of legislative power. The Court may rule that if Congress meant to delegate its core tariff authority, it would have done so explicitly. This is a powerful judicial philosophy driving recent decisions. (Large driver toward `Unlawful` or `Mixed`).
3.  **Deference to Executive on National Emergency:** The government's main argument rests on the President's authority to act decisively in a declared national emergency. Some justices are highly deferential to executive power in this domain, viewing it as essential for national security. (Moderate driver toward `Lawful`).
4.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court is not reviewing one monolithic policy. The "trafficking tariffs" are tied to a more traditional national security threat (cartels), while the "reciprocal tariffs" are based on a purely economic rationale (trade deficits). This provides a clear path for the Court to split the difference. (Large driver toward `Mixed`).
5.  **Judicial Pragmatism and Economic Stability:** The justices are aware of the massive economic disruption caused by the tariffs and the uncertainty from the legal challenges. This may push them toward a clear, decisive ruling to restore stability, likely by striking down the broadest and most disruptive tariffs. (Moderate driver toward `Unlawful` or `Mixed`).
6.  **Tight Resolution Deadline:** With oral arguments in early November, issuing a major, potentially fractured, opinion by December 31 is a very fast turnaround. The complexity and contentiousness of the case could easily push the decision into January 2026. (Moderate driver toward `No 2025 ruling`).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions, this is a novel and exceptionally broad application of the statute to implement general economic policy (tariffs), making historical precedent less relevant.
*   **A Court Skeptical of Executive Power:** The current 6-3 conservative Court is arguably more skeptical of administrative and executive overreach than any Court in decades, directly countering the historical deference base rate in foreign affairs.
*   **Clear Off-Ramp for a "Mixed" Ruling:** The case presents two distinct and severable categories of tariffs. This structure makes a nuanced, mixed ruling more plausible than in a typical case challenging a single government action.
*   **Consolidated Cases with Different Lower Court Reasoning:** The Court is not just affirming or reversing a single legal theory. It must sort out conflicting rationales from the lower courts (*V.O.S.*: tariffs don't "deal with" the threat; *Learning Resources*: IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all), increasing the complexity and potential for a fractured or narrow opinion.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior favoring `Unlawful` given the unanimous lower court outcomes, but with significant uncertainty. E.g., `Unlawful` 45%, `Mixed` 25%, `Lawful` 15%, `No 2025 ruling` 10%, `Other` 5%. (Equivalent n≈4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑↑ `Mixed`: The clear distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs provides a compelling path for a split decision that both reins in and preserves executive power.
    *   ↑ `Unlawful`: The prominence of the Major Questions Doctrine with the current Court majority is a powerful force against the government's broad interpretation of IEEPA.
    *   ↓ `Lawful`: The government's case relies on a theory of executive deference that this Court has shown a willingness to reject in other high-profile cases.
    *   ↓ `No 2025 ruling`: The Court's decision to expedite the case signals a strong intent to rule before the end of the term, and likely sooner, though the Dec 31 deadline remains tight.
    *   ↑ `Unlawful`/`Mixed`: The administration's partial rollback of tariffs can be read as a sign of weakness in their legal arguments for the reciprocal tariffs.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the government will lose, at least in part. The posterior should shift probability away from `Lawful`. The most significant update is an increase in the probability of a `Mixed ruling`, which may become as likely as, or even more likely than, a complete `Unlawful` ruling.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Unlawful/Mixed):**
    *   Leaks from the Court (via SCOTUSblog, etc.) suggesting a majority opinion authored by a conservative justice like Roberts, Gorsuch, or Kavanaugh, focusing on statutory limits.
    *   Further actions by the Trump administration to narrow or roll back the tariffs, suggesting an attempt to preempt a negative ruling.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars arguing against the tariffs on separation-of-powers grounds.
    *   Unusual delays in the Court's opinion release schedule, potentially indicating a fractured court and difficulty forming a majority.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Lawful):**
    *   Leaks suggesting a majority opinion authored by a strong proponent of executive power like Alito.
    *   Public statements by the administration defending the tariffs' legality and necessity in strong terms, suggesting confidence.
    *   A surprisingly quick release of a unified majority opinion.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Timing:** The Dec 31, 2025 deadline is the biggest pitfall. A decision released in the first or second week of January 2026 is highly plausible, which would resolve this question as `No 2025 ruling` even if the tariffs are ultimately struck down.
*   **Definition of "Mixed Ruling":** The threshold is low: if *any* challenged measure is held lawful and *any* is held unlawful, it resolves as `Mixed`. The Court could uphold a minor trafficking tariff while striking down 99% of the tariff regime, and it would still be a `Mixed` outcome.

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential powers in foreign affairs and national security, with a base rate of 55-65% in favor of the President. However, this is countered by the current Court's skepticism of executive overreach, especially in economic matters.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The base rate for the Supreme Court affirming lower court rulings where multiple courts have found the same outcome is 60-70%. Additionally, the major questions doctrine cases in the Roberts Court have often resulted in rulings against the executive, suggesting a base rate of 20-30% for the government winning such cases.

- **Mixed ruling**: Given the distinct categories of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal), there is a plausible path for a mixed ruling. Historical data on mixed rulings in complex cases is less clear, but the structure of this case suggests a moderate prior probability.

- **Other ruling**: This is less likely given the Court's decision to expedite the case, but procedural dismissals or other non-merits outcomes are possible.

- **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling more likely, but the complexity of the case could push the decision into early 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves significant questions of executive power and statutory interpretation, similar to past cases where the Court has ruled against broad executive interpretations.

- **Differences**: The case involves a novel use of IEEPA for tariffs, which is unprecedented, and the Court's current composition is more conservative and skeptical of executive overreach than in past cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Federal Circuit ruling against tariffs**: Strengthens the case for "Tariffs unlawful" as it aligns with the lower court consensus.

- **Supreme Court's expedited review**: Decreases the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling" as it indicates the Court's intent to resolve the matter quickly.

- **Trump administration's partial rollback of tariffs**: Suggests a weakening legal position, increasing the likelihood of "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling".

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior for Tariffs unlawful**: 45%
- **Likelihood of evidence (Federal Circuit ruling)**: High, as it aligns with the lower court consensus.
- **Posterior for Tariffs unlawful**: Increases due to strong alignment with major questions doctrine and lower court rulings.

- **Prior for Mixed ruling**: 25%
- **Likelihood of evidence (distinct tariff categories)**: High, as it provides a clear path for a mixed ruling.
- **Posterior for Mixed ruling**: Increases due to the distinct categories and potential for a nuanced decision.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of overconfidence in the "Unlawful" outcome due to the Court's conservative leanings and skepticism of executive power.
- Acknowledge the potential for a "Mixed ruling" given the distinct tariff categories and the Court's need to balance executive power with statutory limits.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 40%  
Mixed ruling: 35%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 10%  

This distribution reflects the evidence and reasoning, with a higher likelihood of an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling given the Court's current composition and the distinct categories of tariffs involved.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs unlawful (45%)**:
- When lower courts unanimously rule against the government (as both the Court of International Trade and DC District Court did here), the Supreme Court affirms roughly 60-70% of the time.
- The current Court has been skeptical of broad executive power claims under the "major questions doctrine" (e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, NFIB v. OSHA), ruling against the executive in approximately 70-80% of such cases.

**Mixed ruling (25%)**:
- The Court often finds middle ground in complex cases with multiple issues.
- The case presents two distinct types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) with different justifications, creating a natural path for a split decision.

**Tariffs lawful (15%)**:
- Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in foreign affairs and national security (55-65% favor rate).
- The IEEPA specifically grants the President emergency powers in international economic matters.

**No 2025 ruling (10%)**:
- While the Court expedited the case, the timeline is tight: oral arguments in November with just weeks to issue a complex ruling before year-end.

**Other ruling (5%)**:
- Procedural dismissals, remands without merits rulings, or fractured opinions with no majority are relatively rare but possible.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Like other major questions doctrine cases, this involves a claim of broad executive authority based on general statutory language.
- The case follows the typical pattern of lower court unanimity against the government's position.
- The Court has expedited review, suggesting it sees the issue as urgent and important.

**Key differences**:
- The unprecedented breadth of these tariffs under IEEPA makes this case unique - the statute has never been used for such sweeping tariff authority.
- The current 6-3 conservative Court is particularly skeptical of executive overreach, more so than historical courts.
- The case presents two distinct categories of tariffs with different justifications, creating a clearer path for a mixed ruling than typical cases.
- The consolidated cases present different legal theories (tariffs don't "deal with" the threat vs. IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all), increasing complexity.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful"**:
- Both lower courts ruled against the tariffs, though on different grounds.
- The Federal Circuit affirmed 7-4 that the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority.
- The Major Questions Doctrine suggests Congress would have spoken clearly if it meant to delegate its core tariff authority.
- Trump administration recently removed some "reciprocal tariffs" on agricultural goods, potentially signaling weakness in their legal position.

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling"**:
- The case presents two distinct tariff categories with different justifications:
  - "Trafficking tariffs" (Mexico/Canada/China) have a stronger national security nexus
  - "Reciprocal tariffs" (general trade deficits) have a weaker emergency justification
- This structure provides a natural path for the Court to uphold some tariffs while striking down others.

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful"**:
- IEEPA's text allows the President to "regulate... any... importation" during declared emergencies.
- Courts traditionally defer to the executive in foreign affairs and national security.
- The Court's conservative majority generally favors strong executive power in security matters.

**Evidence favoring "No 2025 ruling"**:
- With oral arguments in early November, the Court has less than two months to issue a complex ruling.
- The consolidated cases present different legal theories, potentially complicating opinion writing.
- Major cases often take months to resolve, especially with multiple opinions.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our priors:
- Tariffs unlawful: 45%
- Mixed ruling: 25%
- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- No 2025 ruling: 10%
- Other ruling: 5%

Let's update based on key evidence:

**Update on the Federal Circuit's 7-4 decision against the tariffs**:
- This evidence is ~3x more likely if tariffs are unlawful than if they're lawful
- Prior odds for "Unlawful" vs "Lawful": 45%/15% = 3:1
- Posterior odds: 3:1 × 3 = 9:1
- New probabilities (before normalization):
  - Tariffs unlawful: ~54%
  - Mixed ruling: ~28% (slight increase as this ruling distinguished between tariff types)
  - Tariffs lawful: ~6% (decreased)
  - No 2025 ruling: ~10% (unchanged)
  - Other ruling: ~5% (unchanged)

**Update on Trump's partial rollback of reciprocal tariffs**:
- This evidence is ~2x more likely under "Mixed ruling" or "Tariffs unlawful" than under "Tariffs lawful"
- It suggests the administration sees weakness in at least part of its case
- Further updating our probabilities:
  - Tariffs unlawful: ~56%
  - Mixed ruling: ~32% (increased)
  - Tariffs lawful: ~3% (decreased)
  - No 2025 ruling: ~8% (slight decrease)
  - Other ruling: ~4% (slight decrease)

**Update on expedited review schedule**:
- The Court's decision to fast-track the case makes a 2025 ruling more likely
- This evidence is ~2x less likely if "No 2025 ruling" were to occur
- Further updating:
  - Tariffs unlawful: ~57%
  - Mixed ruling: ~33%
  - Tariffs lawful: ~3%
  - No 2025 ruling: ~4% (decreased)
  - Other ruling: ~3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to executive power in national security matters.
- The Court could surprise by finding creative ways to uphold the tariffs while still limiting executive power.
- I might be overestimating the likelihood of a 2025 ruling - complex cases often take longer than expected.
- The Court could issue a narrow procedural ruling that avoids the merits entirely.

**Alternative scenarios**:
- The Court could find that IEEPA does authorize tariffs generally, but that these specific implementations exceed statutory bounds.
- The Court might dismiss part of the case as moot following Trump's partial tariff rollback.
- The Court could split 4-4 if a justice recuses, affirming the lower court without creating precedent.

**Adjustments**:
- Increase "Mixed ruling" probability given the natural dividing line between tariff types.
- Slightly increase "No 2025 ruling" given the complexity and tight timeline.
- Slightly increase "Other ruling" to account for procedural outcomes.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and adjustments:
- Tariffs unlawful: ~52%
- Mixed ruling: ~35%
- Tariffs lawful: ~3%
- No 2025 ruling: ~6%
- Other ruling: ~4%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs unlawful: 52%  
Mixed ruling: 35%  
No 2025 ruling: 6%  
Other ruling: 4%  
Tariffs lawful: 3%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes:

1.  **Major Questions Doctrine Cases:** This case, involving a broad claim of executive authority over the economy based on a general statute (IEEPA), fits squarely within the Major Questions Doctrine. The current Supreme Court has been highly skeptical of such claims, frequently ruling against the executive branch. The base rate for the government winning a major questions case is low, perhaps 20-30%. This suggests a high prior probability (70-80%) for an outcome where the tariffs are found at least partially unlawful.
2.  **Executive Power in Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in matters of national security and foreign affairs. The tariffs are justified under a declared national emergency involving foreign drug cartels and trade imbalances. This reference class suggests a higher probability of the President's actions being upheld, perhaps 55-65% in favor of the government ("Tariffs lawful").
3.  **Affirmance of Unanimous Lower Courts:** Two lower courts found the tariffs unlawful, and one of those decisions was affirmed by a court of appeals. When lower courts are in agreement, the Supreme Court tends to affirm more often than reverse (perhaps 60-70% of the time). This points toward "Tariffs unlawful."

**Synthesized Prior:** These base rates are in tension. I will weigh the Major Questions Doctrine most heavily, as it reflects the current Court's specific jurisprudence, which has often overridden historical deference. This leads to a prior that strongly disfavors a complete win for the government. I will set the initial distribution as: P(Unlawful) = 40%, P(Mixed) = 30%, P(Lawful) = 20%, P(No 2025 ruling) = 8%, P(Other) = 2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case has unique features that distinguish it from the general base rates:

*   **Similarity:** The case is a classic Major Questions scenario, making that base rate highly relevant.
*   **Difference 1 (Structure):** The challenge involves two distinct sets of tariffs—"trafficking tariffs" linked to national security and "reciprocal tariffs" linked to economic policy. This structure is unusual and provides a clear path for a "Mixed ruling," where the Court could treat them differently. This makes a mixed outcome more plausible than in a typical case.
*   **Difference 2 (Statutory Context):** The IEEPA statute explicitly grants the President power during a "national emergency," a stronger textual hook for executive authority than in other recent Major Questions cases (like those involving OSHA or the EPA). This slightly strengthens the government's position compared to a standard administrative law case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probabilities:

*   **Evidence:** The existence of two distinct and severable categories of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal).
    *   **Assessment:** This evidence makes a "Mixed ruling" much more likely. P(Evidence | Mixed) is very high, while P(Evidence | Unlawful or Lawful) is lower. A court seeking a compromise or narrow holding has a clear way to split the difference. This strongly pushes probability toward the "Mixed ruling" option.

*   **Evidence:** The Trump administration's partial removal of "reciprocal tariffs" on agricultural goods after oral arguments.
    *   **Assessment:** This action suggests a lack of confidence in the legal standing of the reciprocal tariffs. It is much more likely to occur if the administration anticipates losing on that issue (P(E | Unlawful or Mixed) >> P(E | Lawful)). This evidence significantly lowers the probability of "Tariffs lawful" and increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court granted expedited review with oral arguments in early November.
    *   **Assessment:** This signals the Court's intent to resolve the issue quickly, which decreases the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling." However, the Dec 31 deadline is still very tight for a complex and contentious case (less than two months from argument), meaning a slip into January 2026 remains a significant possibility. The net effect is a slight decrease in the probability of "No 2025 ruling" from a non-expedited baseline, but it remains a key uncertainty.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Initial Prior:** P(Lawful) = 20%, P(Unlawful) = 40%, P(Mixed) = 30%.
*   **Update 1 (Case Structure):** The clear path to splitting the decision is strong evidence for a mixed outcome. I will shift significant probability mass to "Mixed ruling," primarily from "Tariffs unlawful," as a clean sweep becomes less likely than a nuanced decision. The distribution might now look like: P(Mixed) = 45%, P(Unlawful) = 25%, P(Lawful) = 20%.
*   **Update 2 (Admin's Tariff Rollback & Major Questions Doctrine):** The administration's actions and the strong headwinds from the Major Questions Doctrine are powerful evidence against the legality of the tariffs. This significantly reduces the probability of "Tariffs lawful." I will cut the probability of "Lawful" roughly in half, distributing that probability primarily to the outcomes where the government loses.
*   **Update 3 (Timing):** While expedited, the schedule is tight. I will maintain a notable probability for "No 2025 ruling" to account for the risk of delays in drafting opinions for a complex case. I will set this at 15%.

After these updates, the probabilities are re-distributed to reflect that a partial or full loss for the government is the most likely scenario, with the "Mixed ruling" being the single most probable outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Primary Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating the Court's deference to the executive on national security? The "trafficking tariffs" have a plausible national security nexus. A majority could coalesce around the idea that IEEPA grants broad powers in a declared emergency, and the Court should not second-guess the President's chosen remedy. This could lead to a "Tariffs lawful" outcome. To account for this, I have kept the probability for "Lawful" in the double digits (13%) rather than near zero.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible alternative to a "Mixed ruling" is a broad "Tariffs unlawful" decision. The Court could issue a clean, bright-line rule that the power to set tariffs (a tax) is a core Congressional power that was not clearly delegated in IEEPA. This would be a major separation-of-powers statement. I have this as the second-most-likely merits outcome at 25%.
*   **Timing Risk:** The biggest risk to any merits-based forecast is the calendar. A decision released in the first week of January 2026 is entirely plausible and would resolve this question as "No 2025 ruling." My 15% allocation acknowledges this significant uncertainty.

### 6. Final Normalization

After considering the evidence and challenging my own assumptions, I arrive at the following normalized probability distribution:

*   **Mixed ruling:** The structure of the case and the Roberts Court's tendency toward narrow or compromising decisions make this the most likely outcome. The Court can curb the broadest assertion of power (reciprocal tariffs) while showing deference on the more traditional security-related tariffs (trafficking).
*   **Tariffs unlawful:** A clean sweep against the tariffs is the next most likely outcome, likely based on a strong non-delegation or separation-of-powers argument.
*   **No 2025 ruling:** The tight timeline makes a slip into January 2026 a very real possibility.
*   **Tariffs lawful:** A full victory for the government is unlikely given the Major Questions Doctrine and lower court rulings, but possible due to executive deference in national security.
*   **Other ruling:** A procedural punt is highly unlikely given the case's importance and expedited status.

The final probabilities sum to 100%.
