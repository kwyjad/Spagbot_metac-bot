### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Unilateral US military strikes in sovereign nations without government consent (post-Cold War):** This class includes actions like the 1998 cruise missile strikes in Sudan, the 2017 and 2018 strikes in Syria, and numerous drone/special forces operations in countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The base rate for a *new* country being added to this list in any given year is very low, likely **<3%**. Nigeria is a regional power and a nominal partner, making it a much harder target than a failed state or pariah regime.
2.  **US military interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa:** Major combat interventions are exceedingly rare (e.g., Somalia 1993). More common are advise-and-assist missions, training, and limited counter-terrorism strikes (e.g., drone strikes in Somalia, support operations in Niger). A unilateral, non-consensual attack on a major partner like Nigeria is historically unprecedented. The base rate for such an event is **<1%**.
3.  **Instances of a US President making a public military threat and following through:** Presidents often use threats as coercive diplomacy. The follow-through rate is highly context-dependent. President Trump, during his first term, made numerous threats (e.g., North Korea's "fire and fury") that did not result in direct attacks. However, he also demonstrated a willingness to use limited, punitive force (e.g., Syria). The base rate is difficult to calculate but suggests that public threats are a weak predictor of major military action, though they slightly increase the probability of limited strikes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-20** Trump threatens military action in Nigeria, citing violence against Christians. (↑) — Establishes a public, presidential-level rationale and commitment trap for potential intervention.
*   **2025-11-01** Trump posts on Truth Social, threatening to go in "guns-a-blazing" and halt aid. (↑↑) — Escalates the rhetoric from general concern to a specific, direct threat of military force, putting his personal credibility on the line with his political base.
*   **2025-11-01** Trump reportedly orders the DoD to "prepare for possible action" in Nigeria. (↑) — Moves the issue from rhetoric to operational planning, engaging the military bureaucracy. While such orders can be exploratory, it is a necessary first step for any action.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Personalism & Commitment:** President Trump's foreign policy is highly personalized and less constrained by institutional processes. Having made a public threat, he may feel compelled to act to maintain an image of strength, especially if a "trigger" event occurs. (Size: Large)
2.  **Domestic Political Motivation:** The framing of the conflict as the "killing of Christians" resonates strongly with key evangelical constituencies in the US. This provides a powerful domestic political incentive for the President to be seen as taking decisive action. (Size: Large)
3.  **Institutional Drag & Opposition:** The Department of Defense, State Department, and intelligence agencies are likely to strongly oppose a unilateral strike on Nigeria, a major regional partner, oil producer, and counter-terrorism ally. They would view it as highly destabilizing and counterproductive to long-term US interests. (Size: Large)
4.  **Trigger Event (e.g., High-Profile Massacre):** A widely publicized, large-scale attack on a Christian community in Nigeria could create a "CNN effect," generating immense public and political pressure that could override institutional opposition and force the President's hand. (Size: Moderate to Large)
5.  **Nigerian Government Actions:** Proactive and successful Nigerian military operations against extremist groups, coupled with diplomatic outreach to the US, could de-escalate the situation and remove the pretext for intervention. Conversely, perceived inaction or complicity would strengthen the case for US action. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Low-Cost Military Options:** The availability of low-footprint, "plausible deniability" options like drone strikes or special forces raids makes the threshold for action much lower than a large-scale invasion. The resolution criteria are broad enough to include these limited actions. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Target is a Partner, Not a Pariah:** Unlike Syria, Sudan, or Yemen, Nigeria is a major regional power, a democracy (albeit flawed), and a key security partner for AFRICOM. A unilateral strike would rupture this relationship in a way previous interventions have not.
*   **Explicitly Religious Rationale:** While religious freedom is a US foreign policy goal, it is highly unusual for the "protection of Christians" to be the primary, publicly stated casus belli for a potential military intervention.
*   **Idiosyncratic Presidential Actor:** President Trump's decision-making style is less reliant on the traditional national security consensus, making historical precedent a less reliable guide. His public statements create personal political stakes that are distinct from abstract national interests.
*   **Public Commitment Trap:** The President has made a very specific and public threat. Inaction in the face of a future atrocity could be politically costly for him, creating a dynamic not present in the base case of general counter-terrorism operations.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior, informed by the base rate of unilateral US strikes on partner nations (<5%), reflecting strong structural constraints. An "equivalent n" of ~20 observations seems reasonable.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) President Trump's specific, public, and repeated threats create a strong personal and political commitment to action.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The framing around protecting Christians provides a powerful domestic political rationale that can sustain controversial action.
    *   (↓ Large) Strong, expected institutional opposition from DoD/State, who view Nigeria as a vital, if difficult, partner.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Nigeria's status as a major regional power, not a failed state, raises the diplomatic and strategic costs of intervention immensely.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The availability of limited strike options (drones, SOF) lowers the bar for what constitutes "action," making a resolution more plausible than a full invasion.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence pushes strongly in both directions. The President's personal commitment dramatically increases the probability from the near-zero base rate. However, the institutional and strategic barriers are immense. The posterior should move significantly upward from the prior, but likely remain well below 50%, reflecting a highly contested policy decision where institutional friction is the most probable victor, absent a major trigger event.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A high-casualty, widely-publicized attack on a Christian community in Nigeria.
    *   Appointment of foreign policy hawks known for favoring intervention to key NSC or DoD positions.
    *   US issues travel advisories for Nigeria and begins drawing down non-essential embassy staff.
    *   Deployment of US ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) assets or special operations forces to countries neighboring Nigeria (e.g., Niger, Chad).
    *   Nigerian government rejects US diplomatic overtures or publicly condemns US rhetoric.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Successful, well-publicized Nigerian military offensives against Boko Haram/ISWAP or bandit groups.
    *   High-level diplomatic engagement between US and Nigerian officials resulting in joint statements.
    *   Prominent members of Congress (especially Republicans) publicly express opposition to military action.
    *   President Trump's attention shifts to a different domestic or international crisis.
    *   The Nigerian government announces new initiatives to protect vulnerable communities.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** "Military attack" is broad. A single drone strike against an ISWAP leader, potentially with tacit Nigerian intelligence support, could resolve this "Yes" but is a world away from the "guns-a-blazing" rhetoric.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Intent:** The President's threats may be a coercive tool to pressure the Nigerian government into action, rather than a statement of genuine intent to intervene.
*   **Black Swans:** An attack on US personnel or assets in Nigeria could dramatically alter the calculus, potentially bypassing all institutional constraints and making an attack a near-certainty.
*   **Information Gaps:** The internal deliberations within the White House, NSC, and Pentagon are opaque. We are forecasting the outcome of a policy battle we cannot directly observe.
*   **Nigerian Agency:** The Nigerian government's response is a key variable. A skillful diplomatic and security response could effectively neutralize the threat of intervention.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a US attack on a major partner like Nigeria is extremely low due to powerful institutional and strategic constraints. However, President Trump's personalistic style and public commitment to "protecting Christians" creates a volatile situation where a trigger event could plausibly lead to a limited military strike, making this a low-probability but high-impact scenario.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for unilateral US military strikes in sovereign nations without government consent, especially a major partner like Nigeria, is very low. Historical data suggests a base rate of less than 1% for such an event in Sub-Saharan Africa. Given Nigeria's status as a regional power and a key US partner, the base rate is likely closer to 1% than 3%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a US President making public threats, which historically have sometimes led to military action, albeit rarely.
   - Differences: Nigeria is a significant partner, unlike previous targets of unilateral US strikes. The explicit religious rationale and Trump's personalistic decision-making style are also unusual factors.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Presidential Threats and Orders**: Trump's public threats and orders to prepare for action increase the likelihood of an attack (↑). However, such rhetoric has not always led to action in the past.
   - **Institutional Opposition**: Strong opposition from the DoD and State Department decreases the likelihood (↓).
   - **Domestic Political Motivation**: The framing of the conflict as protecting Christians increases the likelihood (↑).
   - **Nigerian Government Actions**: If Nigeria takes effective action against extremists, it could decrease the likelihood (↓).
   - **Low-Cost Military Options**: The availability of limited strike options increases the likelihood (↑).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 1% (base rate for such an event), the evidence from Trump's threats and the domestic political motivation increases the probability. However, the strong institutional opposition and Nigeria's status as a partner significantly counterbalance this.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the mixed evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted upward but remains well below 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The forecast must account for the possibility of a sudden trigger event or a shift in Trump's focus.
   - Alternative Scenarios: A high-profile attack on Christians in Nigeria could dramatically increase the probability.
   - Adjustments: Consider the potential for a limited strike rather than a full-scale attack.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential scenarios, the probability of the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is estimated to be around 10%.

Final: 10%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 (approximately 13 months from now).

The most relevant reference classes are:
- US unilateral military strikes in sovereign nations without consent (post-Cold War)
- US military interventions specifically in Sub-Saharan Africa
- Instances where a US President makes a public military threat and follows through

Based on historical data, the US rarely conducts military attacks against partner nations like Nigeria. Nigeria is a regional power, a nominal US partner, and a democracy (albeit flawed). The base rate for a new country being added to the list of nations where the US conducts unilateral military operations is very low, likely <3% per year.

For Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, major US combat interventions are exceedingly rare (Somalia 1993 being the notable example). More common are advise-and-assist missions, training, and limited counter-terrorism operations.

**Prior probability**: I'll set the base rate at 4% for a 13-month period. This reflects the very low historical frequency of US military attacks against partner nations, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, while acknowledging that some limited precedent exists.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Nigeria faces genuine security challenges from terrorist groups (Boko Haram, ISWAP)
- The US has strategic interests in regional stability and counterterrorism
- The US has previously conducted limited military operations in Africa (Somalia, Libya)

**Key differences**:
- Nigeria is a major regional power and US partner, unlike typical targets of unilateral US strikes
- The stated rationale is explicitly religious ("protecting Christians"), which is highly unusual
- President Trump has made specific, public threats creating a commitment trap
- The timeline is compressed (13 months remaining)
- Trump's decision-making style is less constrained by traditional institutional processes

These differences significantly alter the probability. The explicit threats and commitment trap increase the likelihood, while Nigeria's status as a partner nation decreases it.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's public threats and Truth Social post**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US were planning to attack, such threats would be likely
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Trump has made threats without follow-through before
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump ordering DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Military planning is a necessary precursor to action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Contingency planning happens frequently without action
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Nigeria's status as a regional partner**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - The US rarely attacks partners
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Most US partners are not attacked
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Framing around protecting Christians**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - This provides political cover for action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Religious protection is often cited without military action
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 4% (0.04), I'll update based on the key pieces of evidence:

**Update on Trump's public threats**:
- Prior odds: 0.04 / 0.96 = 0.042
- Posterior odds: 0.042 × 3.0 = 0.126
- Posterior probability: 0.126 / (1 + 0.126) = 0.112 or 11.2%

**Update on DoD preparation order**:
- Prior odds: 0.112 / 0.888 = 0.126
- Posterior odds: 0.126 × 2.4 = 0.302
- Posterior probability: 0.302 / (1 + 0.302) = 0.232 or 23.2%

**Update on Nigeria's partner status**:
- Prior odds: 0.232 / 0.768 = 0.302
- Posterior odds: 0.302 × 0.25 = 0.076
- Posterior probability: 0.076 / (1 + 0.076) = 0.070 or 7.0%

**Update on Christian protection framing**:
- Prior odds: 0.070 / 0.930 = 0.075
- Posterior odds: 0.075 × 1.5 = 0.113
- Posterior probability: 0.113 / (1 + 0.113) = 0.101 or 10.1%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 10%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating Trump's willingness to act unilaterally against institutional advice
- I might be overweighting historical precedent when Trump has shown willingness to break norms
- I could be underestimating the impact of a potential trigger event (e.g., a high-profile massacre of Christians)
- The definition of "military attack" includes limited options like drone strikes, which have a lower threshold

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A limited drone strike against a high-value terrorist target, possibly with tacit Nigerian approval, would still count as a "Yes"
- A major terrorist attack against Christians could create overwhelming political pressure to act
- Trump might view a limited military action as politically advantageous with minimal downside

**Adjustments**:
Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast upward slightly. The resolution criteria are broad enough to include limited strikes, and Trump has demonstrated willingness to order such actions in the past (Syria). The presence of a clear trigger mechanism (violence against Christians) and Trump's public commitment create a plausible pathway to a "Yes" resolution.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that the United States will conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 at 15%.

This reflects:
- The very low historical base rate
- The significant upward pressure from Trump's explicit threats and orders
- The strong downward pressure from Nigeria's status as a partner nation
- The possibility of a trigger event leading to limited military action
- The broad definition of "military attack" that includes limited strikes

Final: 15%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a unilateral US military attack on a sovereign nation that is also a major regional power and a security partner.

*   **Reference Class:** Unilateral US military strikes in sovereign nations without government consent since the end of the Cold War. This class includes actions in countries like Sudan, Syria, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.
*   **Reasoning:** These cases typically involve either pariah states, failed states, or states with limited sovereignty over their territory where the US is pursuing designated terrorist groups. Nigeria does not fit this profile well; it is a flawed but functioning democracy, a major oil producer, and a key security partner for the US in Africa. A non-consensual US strike on Nigeria would be historically unprecedented and carry immense diplomatic and strategic costs.
*   **Prior Probability:** The base rate for a *new* country, especially a partner nation of Nigeria's stature, being subjected to a unilateral US attack in any given year is extremely low. I will set the prior probability at **2%**. This is low but non-zero, acknowledging the US's capability and occasional willingness to act unilaterally. In odds form, this is 2:98, or approximately 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** Nigeria, like other countries where the US has conducted strikes, hosts US-designated terrorist groups (Boko Haram, ISWAP) and struggles to control its entire territory. This provides a potential pretext for counter-terrorism operations.
*   **Differences:** The crucial difference is Nigeria's status. Unlike Syria (a pariah state) or Somalia (a failed state), Nigeria is a major regional power and a partner. An attack would rupture a key strategic relationship. The other major difference is the specific US President. President Trump's foreign policy is known to be highly personalized and less constrained by institutional norms, making historical precedent a less reliable guide. Finally, the explicitly religious rationale ("protecting Christians") is unusual and creates a powerful domestic political dynamic that is not present in the typical counter-terrorism base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that the US conducts a military attack in Nigeria before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: President Trump's public threats and reported order to the DoD to "prepare for possible action."**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if an attack is being seriously considered (P(E|H) is high) than if it is not. While threats can be cheap talk, the combination of specific rhetoric ("guns-a-blazing") and an order to the Pentagon represents a significant escalation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly **increases** the probability from the base rate.

*   **Evidence 2: The framing of the issue as "the killing of Christians."**
    *   This rationale resonates strongly with a key domestic political constituency for the President. It provides a powerful justification that could override traditional foreign policy concerns. This framing makes a controversial military action more politically feasible.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence **increases** the probability by providing a strong causal mechanism.

*   **Evidence 3: Expected institutional opposition from the Department of Defense, State Department, and intelligence community.**
    *   The US national security establishment would almost certainly view a unilateral strike on Nigeria as a catastrophic strategic error. This opposition is a massive barrier. It is highly likely to exist if no attack occurs (P(E|~H) is high) and would have to be overcome for an attack to occur (P(E|H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly less than 1. This is the strongest piece of evidence **decreasing** the probability.

*   **Evidence 4: The broad definition of "military attack" and the availability of low-cost options (e.g., drone strikes).**
    *   The resolution criteria can be met by a single drone strike, not necessarily a large-scale intervention. This dramatically lowers the threshold for action. It provides a way for the President to follow through on his threat and claim a victory without incurring high costs or risks.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence **increases** the probability by making a "Yes" resolution much easier to achieve.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will start with the prior odds of 1:49 (2%) and update based on the evidence.

1.  **Prior:** 2% (Odds ~ 1:49)
2.  **Trump's Threats/DoD Order:** This is strong evidence. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 5, reflecting that these actions are five times more likely if an attack is planned than if not.
    *   Posterior Odds = 1:49 * 5 = 5:49 ≈ 1:9.8. (Probability ≈ 9%)
3.  **Institutional Opposition:** This is the primary countervailing force. However, President Trump has a history of overriding this opposition. I'll use a likelihood ratio of 1/4, meaning this level of opposition is four times more likely if no attack occurs.
    *   Posterior Odds = 1:9.8 * (1/4) = 1:39.2. (Probability ≈ 2.5%)
4.  **Domestic Politics & Low-Cost Options:** The "protecting Christians" angle and the low bar for resolution (a single drone strike) combine to make action much more palatable. Together, these factors provide a powerful incentive and a low-cost path to fulfill the threat. I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio of 6 for these factors.
    *   Posterior Odds = 1:39.2 * 6 = 6:39.2 ≈ 1:6.5.
    *   **Posterior Probability** = 1 / (1 + 6.5) = 1 / 7.5 ≈ **13.3%**.

An alternative model considers the probability of a "trigger event" (e.g., a high-profile massacre of Christians).
*   P(Trigger Event) ≈ 35%
*   P(Attack | Trigger Event) ≈ 40% (Immense pressure to act on threats)
*   P(Attack | No Trigger Event) ≈ 5% (Institutional drag likely wins)
*   Total P(Attack) = (0.35 * 0.40) + (0.65 * 0.05) = 0.14 + 0.0325 = **17.25%**.

This second model, which explicitly accounts for the most likely causal pathway to an attack, yields a slightly higher probability. I find this reasoning more compelling. The situation is a standoff between very strong structural constraints and a uniquely powerful, personalized political driver, which is most likely to be resolved in favor of action by an external shock.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~17% could be too high if Trump's rhetoric is purely performative for his base, or if the institutional roadblocks within the US government are simply insurmountable for an action this strategically damaging. The Nigerian government could also act decisively to remove the pretext for any intervention.

Conversely, the forecast could be too low. I might be underestimating President Trump's commitment to this issue and his willingness to disregard expert advice in a second term. The low bar for resolution—a single drone strike against an ISWAP leader—could make this an easy "win" for him to deliver to his base. An unexpected attack on US interests in Nigeria could also make a retaliatory strike a near-certainty.

Balancing these considerations, a probability in the high teens seems appropriate. It correctly frames the event as unlikely due to strong structural reasons, but plausible due to the specific political actors and dynamics involved.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for a US attack on a major partner like Nigeria is extremely low. However, the specific and repeated threats from President Trump, motivated by a powerful domestic political issue (protecting Christians), significantly increase the probability. The primary barrier is the immense institutional and strategic opposition within the US government. This creates a volatile situation where a trigger event, such as a high-profile massacre, could overcome this opposition and lead to a limited military action (like a drone strike) to fulfill the President's public commitment. The probability remains below 20%, reflecting that the institutional barriers are more likely than not to hold, but the risk is substantial and much higher than the base rate would suggest.

Final: 18%
