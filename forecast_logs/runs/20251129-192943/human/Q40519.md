### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Ligue 1 seasons post-Qatari acquisition (2012-2025):** This is the most relevant reference class. In the 13 seasons from 2012-13 to 2024-25, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) won the league 11 times. They were the "autumn champion" (leader at the winter break/midpoint) in 10 of those 13 seasons.
    *   **Base Rate (PSG): ~75-80%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This period reflects the current reality of PSG's immense financial dominance over the rest of the league.
    *   **Limitations:** This class may understate the impact of unique, recent factors like the hypothetical 2025 Champions League (UCL) win and the current season's unusual competitiveness.

2.  **Seasons in "Big 5" European leagues with a single, financially dominant team (e.g., Bayern Munich in Bundesliga, Juventus in Serie A during their 9-year streak):** These teams often secure the top spot early and hold it. In the 2010s, Bayern and Juventus were midpoint leaders in over 80% of their title-winning seasons.
    *   **Base Rate (Dominant Team): ~80-85%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the general dynamic of a super-club in a less competitive domestic league, reinforcing the high probability for PSG.
    *   **Limitations:** League-specific factors and the strength of the "next best" teams (e.g., Dortmund in Germany vs. Marseille/Lens in France) can vary significantly.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-29** Current league status reported: PSG leads, but two teams are within 2 points after 13 matches. PSG has already dropped 9 points. ↓ — Strongest evidence that this season's dynamic is different from the base rate. PSG's dominance is being seriously challenged early on.
*   **2025-11-26** PSG's season scope confirmed: Competing in 6 competitions, including the new FIFA Intercontinental Cup. ↓ — Unprecedented fixture congestion increases the risk of fatigue, injuries, and dropped points in the league due to squad rotation and prioritization.
*   **2025-07-30** PSG reinforces squad: Signs GK Lucas Chevalier and DF Ilya Zabarnyi, while maintaining a stable core midfield. ↑ — Proactive squad improvement suggests the club is not complacent and is building depth to handle the demanding schedule, mitigating some fixture congestion risk.
*   **2025-06-17** Background context: PSG won the 2024-25 Champions League, and is now reportedly more focused on back-to-back European titles. ↓ — This is the core narrative driver. A shift in priorities away from domestic dominance could lead to less focus and intensity in league matches.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Financial Disparity:** PSG's budget, backed by Qatar Sports Investments, vastly exceeds that of all other Ligue 1 clubs. This allows them to acquire and retain world-class talent. **(Large impact)**
2.  **Squad Depth:** Superior finances enable a deeper bench. This is crucial for navigating injuries and the extreme fixture congestion from six concurrent competitions. A deep squad allows for rotation without a catastrophic drop in quality. **(Large impact)**
3.  **Club Priorities & "UCL Hangover":** Having achieved the long-sought goal of a Champions League title, the club's primary motivation may shift to repeating that success. This can subconsciously (or consciously) reduce the perceived importance of a regular-season league match in December. **(Moderate impact)**
4.  **Competitor Strength & Form:** The challenge to PSG is not just about their own performance but also the ability of rivals (Marseille, Lens, etc.) to maintain consistent, high-level form. The current tight race suggests at least two rivals are having exceptionally strong seasons. **(Moderate impact)**
5.  **Managerial Strategy:** How the manager chooses to rotate the squad, prioritize competitions, and adapt tactics to the grueling schedule will be a key determinant of league performance. Over-reliance on stars could lead to burnout; excessive rotation could lead to dropped points. **(Moderate impact)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Fixture Load:** The base rate period did not include participation in six top-tier competitions simultaneously, including the new Intercontinental Cup. This season's schedule is significantly more demanding.
*   **Post-UCL Victory Psychology:** Unlike any other season in the reference class, PSG enters this one as the reigning European champion. This creates a unique psychological context where domestic dominance may feel like a "solved problem" and less of a priority.
*   **Confirmed Early-Season Competitiveness:** The background explicitly states this is the most disputed start to a season since 2010-11, with PSG dropping points at a much higher rate than usual. The base rate is built on seasons where PSG often had a significant lead by this stage.
*   **Challenger Viability:** In many prior seasons, PSG's challengers have faded by the winter break. The fact that two teams remain within a single win of the lead after 13 matches is a notable departure from the norm.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior favoring PSG, based on the post-QSI reference class. An initial probability of ~80% for PSG seems appropriate, with an equivalent n of ~10-12 seasons, reflecting the strength of the historical data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The current league table after 13 games shows a highly competitive race, directly contradicting the "PSG runs away with it" pattern.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The narrative of a post-UCL focus shift, while a soft factor, provides a strong causal explanation for the observed underperformance.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The extreme fixture congestion from participating in six competitions is a concrete, structural reason to expect more dropped points.
    *   (↑ Small) Evidence of continued squad investment (Chevalier, Zabarnyi) pushes back slightly, showing the club is not entirely neglecting the team's foundation.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, concrete evidence of a tight race, combined with plausible causal mechanisms (focus shift, fixture load), should significantly pull the posterior down. The prior is strong, but the evidence is compelling. The update should be a substantial reduction, perhaps moving from 80% towards the 55-65% range for PSG.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring PSG):**
    *   PSG wins its next 2-3 league matches convincingly, especially against strong opponents.
    *   Key rivals (Marseille, Lens, etc.) drop points in their own matches, widening the gap.
    *   Managerial statements explicitly prioritizing a strong finish before the winter break.
    *   Key players like Dembélé or Ramos hit a strong run of goal-scoring form.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring another team):**
    *   PSG draws or loses another league match, particularly against a mid-table team.
    *   Major injuries to 1-2 key players in PSG's midfield or attack.
    *   Public comments or team selection that clearly prioritizes an upcoming Champions League or Intercontinental Cup match over a league fixture.
    *   Rivals continue their winning form, keeping the pressure on or overtaking PSG.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Narrative Fallacy:** The "UCL focus shift" is a compelling story but may be overstated. Top clubs are typically adept at competing on multiple fronts, and the culture of winning can be self-reinforcing.
*   **Small Sample Size:** 13 matches is a significant portion of the first half of the season, but a short run of good form for PSG and/or bad form for rivals could quickly revert the situation to the mean.
*   **Data Gaps:** We lack specific information on the current form, budget, and injury status of the primary challengers (Marseille, Lens, etc.), making it hard to assess their staying power.
*   **Resolution Definition:** The resolution is on a specific date (Jan 5, 2025). The Ligue 1 schedule usually has a winter break, so the number of matches played by that date should be relatively even, but any postponements could complicate the "midpoint" definition.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate strongly favors PSG, but this season presents a significant departure from the norm. A combination of a potential post-Champions League priority shift, unprecedented fixture congestion, and observed early-season struggles has created the most vulnerable domestic position for PSG in over a decade, warranting a significant downward update to their probability of leading at the midpoint.

To forecast which club will be the leader of Ligue 1 at the midpoint of the 2025-2026 season, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Paris Saint-Germain (PSG):** Historically, PSG has been the dominant team in Ligue 1, winning 11 of the last 13 seasons since the Qatari acquisition. They have been the "autumn champion" in 10 of those 13 seasons. Therefore, the base rate for PSG is approximately 75-80%.
  
- **Marseille:** As a historically strong club in France, Marseille has been a consistent competitor. However, they have not matched PSG's dominance in recent years. A reasonable base rate for Marseille could be around 10-15%.

- **Lens:** Lens has been competitive but lacks the historical dominance of PSG or the consistent top-tier performance of Marseille. A base rate for Lens might be around 5-10%.

- **Another team:** Given the financial and competitive disparity in Ligue 1, other teams have a lower probability of leading at the midpoint. A base rate for another team could be around 5-10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** PSG's financial dominance and historical performance align with the base rate scenario.
  
- **Differences:** This season is notably more competitive, with PSG dropping points early and facing fixture congestion. PSG's focus may have shifted post-Champions League victory, which is not typical of the base rate scenario.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Current League Status:** PSG leads but with two teams within two points. This suggests a more competitive season, reducing the likelihood of PSG leading at the midpoint compared to the base rate.
  
- **Fixture Congestion:** PSG's participation in six competitions increases the likelihood of fatigue and dropped points, further reducing their probability of leading.
  
- **Squad Reinforcement:** PSG's squad improvements slightly increase their likelihood of maintaining the lead despite challenges.
  
- **Focus Shift:** The narrative of focusing on European titles suggests a reduced emphasis on domestic dominance, decreasing the likelihood of PSG leading.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **PSG:** Starting with a prior of 80%, the evidence of a competitive league and fixture congestion suggests a downward adjustment. The likelihood ratio for PSG leading is lower than the base rate due to these factors. Adjusting for these, a posterior probability of around 60% seems reasonable.

- **Marseille and Lens:** Both teams are within striking distance of PSG. Given the competitive nature of the season, their probabilities should be adjusted upwards. Marseille could be adjusted to around 20%, and Lens to around 10%.

- **Another team:** The likelihood of another team leading remains low but should be slightly adjusted upwards due to the competitive season. A posterior probability of around 10% is reasonable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** The historical dominance of PSG might lead to overconfidence in their probability. The competitive nature of the current season should be given significant weight.
  
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a major injury or a strategic shift by PSG that could further impact their performance.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure the probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Paris Saint-Germain: 60%  
Marseille: 20%  
Lens: 10%  
Another team: 10%  

These probabilities reflect the current competitive landscape and the unique challenges PSG faces this season.

# Forecasting the Ligue 1 Leader at Midpoint of 2025-2026 Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Paris Saint-Germain (PSG):**
- Base rate: 77%
- Reasoning: PSG has won 11 of the last 13 Ligue 1 seasons since Qatari acquisition. More specifically, they've been the midpoint leader ("autumn champion") in approximately 10 of those 13 seasons, giving us a base rate of about 77%.

**Marseille:**
- Base rate: 8%
- Reasoning: Marseille is historically the second most successful club in Ligue 1 and has occasionally challenged PSG. They've been midpoint leaders perhaps once in the last decade.

**Lens:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Reasoning: Lens has shown competitive form in recent seasons despite financial constraints. They've rarely been midpoint leaders in the modern era.

**Another team:**
- Base rate: 10%
- Reasoning: This captures all other teams (Monaco, Lyon, Lille, etc.) that have occasionally led at the midpoint or won the league in the PSG era.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- PSG still maintains financial dominance over other Ligue 1 clubs
- They continue to attract top talent and have made reinforcements (Chevalier, Zabarnyi)
- The structural advantages that have led to their dominance remain largely intact

**Key differences:**
- PSG won the Champions League last season, creating a potential shift in priorities
- They're competing in six competitions, including the new FIFA Intercontinental Cup
- The current season is unusually competitive, with two teams within 2 points of PSG after 13 matches
- PSG has already dropped 9 points (1 loss, 3 draws) compared to only 10 points dropped in the entire previous season

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Current league standings (13 matchdays in)**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint): Moderate (~50%) - Even when PSG ultimately leads at midpoint, they don't always have a commanding lead this early
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint): High (~80%) - If another team will overtake PSG, we'd expect to see early signs of competitiveness

**Evidence 2: PSG's Champions League focus**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint): Moderate (~60%) - PSG has historically balanced multiple competitions
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint): Very high (~90%) - A shift in priorities away from domestic dominance strongly supports the possibility of another team leading

**Evidence 3: Unprecedented fixture congestion**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint): Moderate (~55%) - PSG's squad depth helps mitigate this issue
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint): High (~85%) - The extreme schedule increases injury risk and necessitates rotation

**Evidence 4: PSG's early season form (already lost once and drawn three times)**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint): Low (~30%) - This is unusual for a PSG team that will dominate by midpoint
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint): High (~80%) - Early dropped points strongly indicate vulnerability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with PSG's prior of 77%, let's update based on the most significant evidence: their current form.

Prior odds for PSG: 77/23 ≈ 3.35
Likelihood ratio: 30/80 = 0.375
Posterior odds: 3.35 × 0.375 ≈ 1.26
Posterior probability: 1.26/(1+1.26) ≈ 0.557 or about 56%

Further updating based on the Champions League focus:
Prior odds (from previous update): 56/44 ≈ 1.27
Likelihood ratio: 60/90 = 0.667
Posterior odds: 1.27 × 0.667 ≈ 0.85
Posterior probability: 0.85/(1+0.85) ≈ 0.46 or about 46%

For the other teams, we need to distribute the remaining 54% probability mass:
- Marseille would receive the largest share due to their historical strength
- Lens gets a moderate boost from their competitive showing despite financial constraints
- "Another team" category also increases due to the unusual competitiveness

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting recent performance (13 matchdays) versus long-term structural advantages
- The "Champions League focus" narrative might be overstated; elite clubs regularly compete on multiple fronts
- PSG's squad depth might be sufficient to handle the fixture congestion better than anticipated

**Alternative scenario:**
- PSG could regain focus on the league if they face early elimination in a cup competition
- The current challengers might not sustain their form over the next 6-8 weeks
- PSG's superior resources could become more decisive as the season progresses and injuries/fatigue affect smaller squads

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase PSG's probability slightly to account for their structural advantages
- The distribution among challengers should reflect both current form and historical capacity to maintain performance

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting the probabilities based on the red team considerations:

**Paris Saint-Germain:** 52% (increased from 46% to account for structural advantages)
**Marseille:** 20% (given their historical strength and financial backing)
**Lens:** 12% (competitive despite constraints, but less likely to sustain challenge)
**Another team:** 16% (capturing Monaco, Lyon, and other potential surprises)

## 7. Final Forecast

Paris Saint-Germain: 52%  
Marseille: 20%  
Lens: 12%  
Another team: 16%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### Reasoning

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is the period of Paris Saint-Germain's (PSG) dominance since their acquisition by Qatar Sports Investments. This covers the 13 seasons from 2012-13 to 2024-25.
*   **Base Rate Calculation:** In these 13 seasons, PSG won the Ligue 1 title 11 times. They were the leader at the midpoint (the "autumn champion") in 10 of those 13 seasons (failing to be midpoint leader in 2016-17, 2020-21, and one other season where they came from behind). This establishes a strong prior probability.
    *   **P(PSG leads at midpoint): ~77%** (10/13)
    *   **P(Another team leads at midpoint): ~23%** (3/13)
*   **Prior Distribution:** I will distribute the 23% for other teams based on their historical status as challengers. Marseille is a historical giant, and Lens has been a strong performer recently.
    *   **PSG:** 77%
    *   **Marseille:** 8%
    *   **Lens:** 6%
    *   **Another team:** 9% (covering Monaco, Lille, Lyon, etc.)

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental financial disparity between PSG and the rest of Ligue 1 remains. PSG possesses a deeper and more talented squad than any other team, which is a significant advantage over a full season.
*   **Differences:** This season presents several crucial deviations from the base case:
    1.  **Post-Champions League Psychology:** The background states PSG won the 2024-25 Champions League. This is a unique event within the reference period. The narrative that the club is now prioritizing back-to-back European titles over domestic dominance is a plausible causal mechanism for reduced league performance.
    2.  **Unprecedented Fixture Congestion:** Competing in six competitions, including a new Intercontinental Cup, creates a far more demanding schedule than in any previous season. This will force heavy squad rotation and increase the risk of fatigue, injuries, and dropped points.
    3.  **Observed Performance:** The most compelling difference is the current league table. After 13 matches (over a third of the season), PSG is leading but has two teams within two points. Their rate of dropping points (1 loss, 3 draws) is significantly higher than their historical average, providing concrete evidence that this season is different.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

Let's evaluate the key piece of new evidence: "After 13 matchdays, PSG leads, but two teams are within two points." (E)

*   **P(E | PSG leads at midpoint):** This is possible. A dominant team can have a slow start and still be leading at the midpoint before pulling away later. However, it's less common than them having already established a comfortable lead.
*   **P(E | Another team leads at midpoint):** This is very likely. For another team to overtake PSG by the midpoint, the race would almost certainly have to be very close at the 13-game mark. A tight race is a strong precondition for a non-PSG leader.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood ratio P(E | ~PSG leads) / P(E | PSG leads) is significantly greater than 1. The observed tight race is much more indicative of a scenario where PSG's leadership is in genuine jeopardy than one where their leadership is secure. I estimate this evidence makes a non-PSG leader at least 3-4 times more likely.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**

I will now update my prior probabilities based on this strong evidence.

*   **Prior Odds (PSG vs. Not PSG):** P(PSG) / P(~PSG) = 77% / 23% ≈ 3.35 to 1.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) for the evidence:** I'll use a conservative likelihood ratio of 3 for P(E|~H)/P(E|H). This means the tight race is 3 times more likely if PSG *doesn't* end up as the midpoint leader.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × (1/LR) = 3.35 / 3 ≈ 1.12 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability for PSG:** P(PSG | E) = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 1.12 / 2.12 ≈ 52.8%.

This represents a significant downward update from the 77% prior, reflecting the compelling evidence that this season is not business as usual. PSG remains the favorite, but their position is fragile. The remaining ~47% probability must be distributed among the challengers. Since two teams are very close, their chances increase substantially.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

*   **Potential Blind Spot:** Am I over-weighting the narrative of a "focus shift"? Top-tier clubs are built to compete on all fronts, and a culture of winning often prevents complacency. PSG's squad depth is specifically designed to handle fixture congestion.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** PSG, annoyed by the close race, could easily put together a 5-6 game winning streak before the winter break, while their rivals, who lack similar depth, falter. This could quickly re-establish a comfortable lead, making the current situation a minor blip.
*   **Counter-Argument:** While possible, the evidence from the first 13 games is not just a narrative; it's a fact. PSG has demonstrated uncharacteristic vulnerability. The challengers have proven they can keep pace so far.
*   **Adjustment:** Acknowledging the "reversion to the mean" possibility, I will keep PSG's probability slightly above 50%. They are still the incumbent leader with the best squad. My updated probability of ~52% seems robust. The distribution among challengers assumes Marseille and Lens are the two teams in question, which is a reasonable inference given they are named options.

**6. Final Normalization**

I will normalize the probabilities based on the updated assessment. PSG is the most likely single outcome, but the field of challengers now has a collective probability that is nearly as high. I will distribute the remaining probability to the challengers, giving the most to Marseille and Lens as the implied front-runners.

*   **Paris Saint-Germain:** The updated probability is ~52%. They are still the leader and have the strongest squad.
*   **Marseille:** As a major club and likely one of the two close challengers, their probability increases significantly.
*   **Lens:** Similarly, as the other likely challenger, their probability also rises sharply.
*   **Another team:** This category's probability is reduced, as the evidence points to two specific challengers pulling away from the rest of the pack.

My final distribution reflects PSG as a fragile favorite.

---
**Final Forecast**

*Assumption: The resolution date of "January 5, 2025" is a typo and should be January 5, 2026, corresponding to the midpoint of the 2025-2026 season.*

Paris Saint-Germain: 52%

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**  
   - PSG: 77% (based on 10/13 seasons as midpoint leader post-Qatari acquisition, per research report; aligns with 75-80% range). This reference class captures PSG's historical dominance in the modern era.  
   - Marseille: 7% (historical challenger; won Ligue 1 in 2009-10 and occasionally led early in competitive seasons, but rare post-2012; estimated from ~1-2/13 seasons where a team like Marseille led at midpoint).  
   - Lens: 4% (recent riser, competitive in 2020s but not a historical powerhouse; lower than Marseille due to fewer instances of leading at midpoint).  
   - Another team: 12% (covers all other teams; derived from remaining ~2-3/13 seasons where neither PSG nor the specified teams led, distributed across possibles like Monaco or Lyon).  
   - Reasoning: These are derived from the post-2012 reference class, adjusted for specific options. Sum to 100%. Big 5 leagues dominant team base (~80%) reinforces PSG's high prior, with others split based on historical viability.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**  
   - Similarities: PSG maintains financial dominance, squad depth, and talent edge (e.g., recent signings like Chevalier and Zabarnyi), mirroring post-2012 seasons where they often overcame early hiccups.  
   - Differences: Unprecedented fixture congestion (6 competitions), post-UCL priority shift to Europe, and the most competitive start since 2010-11 (PSG dropped 9 points in 13 games vs. typical dominance). These matter because they increase likelihood of rotation, fatigue, and dropped points, deviating from base cases where PSG built early leads without such burdens.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**  
   - Tight race after 13 games (two teams within 2 points): P(E | PSG leader) ≈ 30% (unusual for PSG, but possible if they rally); P(E | ~PSG) ≈ 80% (expected if priorities shift and rivals stay strong). More likely under non-PSG options.  
   - UCL focus shift and fixture congestion: P(E | PSG leader) ≈ 40% (mitigated by depth, but strains resources); P(E | ~PSG) ≈ 70% (explains dropped points, favoring rivals like Marseille/Lens who are close). Boosts non-PSG.  
   - Squad reinforcements: P(E | PSG leader) ≈ 80% (builds resilience); P(E | ~PSG) ≈ 50% (helps but doesn't counter priorities/fatigue fully). Slightly favors PSG.  
   - Overall: Evidence leans against PSG (tight race and causal drivers like congestion are stronger under ~PSG), but reinforcements provide a counterbalance.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**  
   - Explicit update for PSG (key evidence: tight race). Prior P(PSG) = 0.77, odds = 0.77/0.23 ≈ 3.35:1. LR = P(E | PSG)/P(E | ~PSG) ≈ 0.3/0.8 = 0.375. Posterior odds = 3.35 × 0.375 ≈ 1.26:1. Posterior P(PSG) = 1.26/(1+1.26) ≈ 56%.  
   - Qualitative for other evidence: UCL shift/fixture congestion further reduces PSG by ~5-10% (moderate downward shift via LR ~0.6); reinforcements add back ~3-5% (small upward). Net for PSG: ~58%.  
   - For Marseille/Lens: Evidence of being the close challengers boosts them (LR ~3-4x for each, as current position makes leading more likely); updates priors to ~17% each.  
   - For Another: Evidence lowers it (teams not close are less likely to surge; LR ~0.5), updating to ~8%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**  
   - Overconfidence/blind spots: May overupdate on "narrative" of UCL shift (could be overstated; PSG often multitasks well). Small sample (13 games) risks ignoring regression to mean, where PSG pulls away.  
   - Tail risks/alternatives: Tail risk of PSG injuries/further drops (boosts non-PSG to 50%+); or rivals falter (PSG to 80%). Best alternative forecast: 75% PSG (minimal update, per calibration advice for small nudges; plausible if evidence is noisy/early-season anomaly). Rebuttal: Evidence is consistent and causal (congestion, observed competitiveness), warranting larger shift; report supports 55-65% range. Adjusted PSG down slightly from 62% to 58% to temper update, increased Another to 8% for surge risk.

6. **Final Normalization**  
   - Probabilities sum to 100%. Uncertainty distributed to non-PSG options proportionally to current closeness (Marseille/Lens favored over Another).

Paris Saint-Germain: 58%  
Marseille: 17%  
Lens: 17%  
Another team: 8%
