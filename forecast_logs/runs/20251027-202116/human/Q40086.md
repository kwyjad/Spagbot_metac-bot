### Reference class & base rates
- **Recent La Niña Years (2020-2022):** During the "triple-dip" La Niña, the highest daily anomalies for Nov/Dec were lower than recent peaks but still elevated by the long-term warming trend. The peak daily anomaly in these months was in the **0.85°C to 1.05°C** range. This class is relevant due to the matching ENSO phase but may understate the current baseline warmth.
- **Recent El Niño/Post-El Niño Years (2023-2024):** The record-breaking El Niño of 2023 and its aftermath in 2024 set a new ceiling. The highest daily anomaly for Nov/Dec 2023 was approximately **1.35°C**. This class represents the current "hot state" of the climate system but is a poor match for the current ENSO phase. It serves as a plausible upper bound.
- **All Years in the Last Decade (2015-2024):** This class captures the modern, warmer climate regime. The average peak daily anomaly in Nov/Dec across these years is roughly **1.10°C**. This provides a broad baseline but mixes different ENSO phases, potentially obscuring the specific impact of the current La Niña.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-02-13** La Niña conditions noted as weak, with a 66% chance of transition to neutral in Mar-May. ↑ — A short-lived prior La Niña means less accumulated ocean cooling, keeping the baseline temperature higher.
- **2025-09-XX** Global surface air temperature for the month was the third warmest on record. ↓ — While still very warm, this represents a cooling trend relative to the record-setting pace of 2023 and early 2024, consistent with a developing La Niña.
- **2025-10-08** Copernicus confirms September 2025 was the third warmest, despite near-La Niña conditions. ↑ — This demonstrates the powerful underlying warming trend, which is keeping temperatures exceptionally high even with a cooling influence from the Pacific.
- **2025-10-09** NOAA officially announces La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through winter. ↓ — The primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period is now officially active.
- **2025-10-10** Washington Post reports a 71% chance La Niña continues into December. ↓ — High confidence in the persistence of the primary cooling driver through the resolution period.
- **2025-10-27** CPC/IRI reports La Niña is favored to persist, but with a 55% chance of transition to neutral in Jan-Mar 2026. ↑ — The forecast for a potential transition soon after the resolution period suggests the event may not strengthen significantly, limiting its peak cooling effect.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** La Niña involves cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which reduces heat transfer to the atmosphere, exerting a global cooling effect. This is the primary downward driver. **Size: Large.**
- **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The accumulation of greenhouse gases creates a persistent, powerful warming trend that raises the baseline temperature for any given year. All natural variability now occurs on top of a much hotter base state. **Size: Large.**
- **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The world's oceans have absorbed over 90% of excess heat. OHC is at a record high, acting as a massive heat reservoir that continuously releases energy into the atmosphere, counteracting short-term cooling influences. **Size: Moderate to Large.**
- **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Eruption (Jan 2022):** This eruption injected a significant amount of water vapor (a potent greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. This is believed to have a lingering, small net warming effect. **Size: Small.**
- **Short-term Weather Variability:** The question resolves on the *highest daily* temperature, not a monthly average. A specific large-scale weather pattern (e.g., a Rossby wave configuration) could produce a short-lived global spike, introducing significant volatility. **Size: Small to Moderate.**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Unprecedented Baseline Warmth:** The global system is emerging from the record-shattering heat of 2023-2024. The thermal inertia is immense, and the "starting point" for this La Niña's cooling influence is far higher than any previous event.
- **Record Ocean Heat Content:** Unlike past La Niña periods, this one is occurring with OHC at unprecedented levels. This may dampen La Niña's atmospheric cooling effect more than historical analogues would suggest.
- **Weak La Niña Event:** Forecasts consistently describe this as a weak and potentially short-lived La Niña. A strong event would have a much more significant cooling impact; a weak one will struggle to overcome the background warming signal.
- **Post-Hunga Tonga Stratosphere:** The atmospheric composition is still subtly altered by the 2022 eruption's water vapor injection, a unique warming factor not present in the 2020-2022 La Niña reference class.
- **Stagnating but not Plummeting Anomalies:** As shown in the chart, 2025's temperatures have leveled off below the 2023/2024 peaks but remain well above all prior years. This suggests La Niña is capping further temperature rises rather than inducing a sharp drop.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with the upper end of the recent La Niña years (2020-2022) reference class, adjusted slightly for two years of background warming. This suggests a prior centered around **1.05°C** with moderate confidence (equivalent n≈10).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - (↓) La Niña is officially active and persistent through the period. **Magnitude: Moderate.**
    - (↑) The event is forecast to be weak, limiting its cooling power. **Magnitude: Moderate.**
    - (↑) Record-high Ocean Heat Content provides a powerful, persistent warming pressure. **Magnitude: Moderate.**
    - (↑) Lingering stratospheric water vapor adds a small, anomalous warming influence. **Magnitude: Small.**
    - (↓) The observed 2025 temperature trajectory has already flattened, showing a cooling trend relative to the 2023/24 peak. **Magnitude: Small.**
- **Net effect:** The downward pressure from an active La Niña is largely offset by its weakness and the immense background heat in the climate system (especially the oceans). The posterior should move slightly upwards from the La Niña-based prior, but remain well below the 2023 El Niño peak.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - Weekly Niño 3.4 index values trending towards zero (weakening La Niña).
    - Copernicus monthly temperature reports for October showing a smaller-than-expected drop.
    - Persistent positive anomalies in the North Atlantic SSTs.
    - Development of strong, globally-warming MJO phases.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Weekly Niño 3.4 index values becoming more negative (e.g., below -1.0°C), indicating a strengthening La Niña.
    - Unusually rapid growth in Arctic or Antarctic sea ice extent for the season.
    - A major tropical volcanic eruption that injects cooling sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere.
    - Copernicus October data showing a sharp drop in the global anomaly, closer to the 2022 track.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The resolution is on a single day's peak, which is subject to short-term weather "noise" and can be significantly higher than the monthly average. A single anomalous weather event could determine the outcome.
- **Model Uncertainty:** While models agree on a weak La Niña, its precise evolution and teleconnections in this record-warm environment are uncertain.
- **Data Revisions:** The Copernicus dataset (ERA5) is subject to periodic reprocessing and revision, which could slightly alter the final resolving value.
- **Novel Climate State:** The combination of a weak La Niña, record OHC, and post-Hunga Tonga effects creates a climate state without a perfect historical analogue, making forecasts more challenging.
- **Resolution Source Specificity:** The resolution depends solely on the Copernicus dataset. Other global temperature datasets (e.g., from NOAA or NASA) might show slightly different values.

**Final Research Summary:**
The developing weak La Niña is applying a brake to global temperatures, pulling them off the record highs of 2023-2024. However, this cooling influence is fighting against a powerful underlying warming trend and unprecedented ocean heat, making it highly probable that the Nov/Dec 2025 peak anomaly will be significantly warmer than prior La Niña years.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the base rate, I will use the recent La Niña years (2020-2022) as a reference class, given the current La Niña conditions. During these years, the highest daily anomalies for November and December were in the range of 0.85°C to 1.05°C. This range is relevant due to the matching ENSO phase, although it may understate the current baseline warmth due to ongoing global warming.
   - Mean/Median: 0.95°C, Variance: Moderate (reflecting natural variability and ENSO phase).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation shares the La Niña phase with the reference years, suggesting a similar cooling influence.
   - Differences: The baseline global temperature is higher now due to ongoing warming trends and record ocean heat content, which may dampen the cooling effect of La Niña.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - La Niña conditions are expected to persist, suggesting a cooling influence (↓).
   - The event is weak, limiting its cooling power (↑).
   - Record-high ocean heat content provides persistent warming pressure (↑).
   - Lingering stratospheric water vapor adds a small warming influence (↑).
   - The observed 2025 temperature trajectory has flattened, showing a cooling trend relative to the 2023/24 peak (↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered around 1.05°C.
   - Evidence suggests a net upward adjustment due to the weak La Niña and strong warming influences.
   - Posterior mean shifts slightly upwards, with a broader variance to account for potential short-term weather variability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks: A strong weather pattern could cause a spike in temperatures, while a sudden strengthening of La Niña could lead to lower anomalies.
   - Alternative forecast: A stronger La Niña could push anomalies closer to 0.85°C, but current evidence suggests this is less likely.
   - Adjustments: Ensure percentiles reflect the possibility of both higher and lower outcomes due to short-term variability.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the likelihood of a higher anomaly than the base rate due to the weak La Niña and strong warming influences.

P10: 0.95  
P20: 1.00  
P40: 1.05  
P60: 1.10  
P80: 1.15  
P90: 1.20

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly for Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of reference classes:

- **Recent La Niña years (2020-2022)**: During these years, the highest daily anomalies for Nov/Dec were in the 0.85°C to 1.05°C range.
- **Recent years (2015-2024)**: The average peak daily anomaly in Nov/Dec across these years is approximately 1.10°C.
- **Background warming trend**: There's an underlying warming trend of roughly 0.2°C per decade.

Given that we're entering a La Niña period but starting from a much warmer baseline than previous La Niñas, I'll center my prior at **1.05°C** with a moderate spread (σ ≈ 0.15°C). This represents the upper end of recent La Niña years, adjusted slightly for the continued background warming.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're entering a La Niña phase, which typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures
- The seasonal pattern (Nov-Dec) matches our reference class
- The measurement methodology (Copernicus) is consistent

**Key differences:**
- The current La Niña is developing after record-breaking warmth in 2023-2024, creating an unusually high thermal baseline
- Ocean heat content is at unprecedented levels, which may dampen La Niña's cooling effect
- This La Niña is forecast to be weak, unlike some stronger events in the reference class
- The lingering effects of the Hunga Tonga eruption (water vapor in stratosphere) provide a small warming influence not present in earlier La Niñas
- The temperature trajectory for 2025 has already shown signs of stagnation (third warmest rather than first/second)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing temperatures lower:**
- NOAA has officially announced La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through winter (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood for lower values)
- Temperature anomalies have already stagnated in 2025, falling to third warmest from second warmest earlier in the year (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for lower values)
- There's a 71% chance La Niña continues into December according to reports (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for lower values)

**Evidence pushing temperatures higher:**
- The La Niña is forecast to be weak, limiting its cooling power (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood for higher values)
- Record-high ocean heat content provides persistent warming pressure (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood for higher values)
- September 2025 was still the third warmest on record despite near-La Niña conditions (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for higher values)
- Lingering stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga adds a small warming influence (weak evidence, ~1.1x likelihood for higher values)
- There's a 55% chance of transition to ENSO-neutral by Jan-Mar 2026, suggesting this La Niña may not strengthen significantly (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for higher values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 1.05°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - La Niña presence:**
- The confirmed La Niña shifts the distribution downward
- Prior mean: 1.05°C
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x for lower values
- Posterior mean shifts to approximately 0.95°C

**Second update - Weak La Niña + high ocean heat content:**
- These factors partially offset the cooling from La Niña
- Previous posterior mean: 0.95°C
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x for higher values
- New posterior mean shifts back to approximately 1.05°C

**Third update - Temperature stagnation in 2025:**
- The observed cooling trend relative to early 2025 suggests some La Niña impact is already visible
- Previous posterior mean: 1.05°C
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5x for lower values
- New posterior mean shifts to approximately 1.00°C

The posterior distribution is now centered around 1.00°C, with a slightly narrower spread than my prior (σ ≈ 0.13°C) due to the accumulated evidence. The distribution is also slightly right-skewed, reflecting the possibility of short-term weather events causing temperature spikes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the cooling power of La Niña due to recency bias from the extreme warmth of 2023-2024
- The question asks for the highest daily anomaly, which could be significantly affected by short-term weather patterns that are inherently unpredictable
- I might be overestimating the dampening effect of ocean heat content on La Niña's cooling influence

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Stronger La Niña scenario**: If the La Niña strengthens more than expected, we could see anomalies closer to 0.85°C (like in 2020-2022)
- **Weather spike scenario**: A specific large-scale weather pattern could produce a short-lived global spike, pushing the anomaly up to 1.20°C despite the La Niña background
- **Rapid transition scenario**: If La Niña weakens earlier than expected in December, we could see a quick rebound in temperatures

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my distribution to account for daily variability and the inherent uncertainty in forecasting specific weather patterns
- I should shift my lower percentiles down slightly to account for the possibility of a stronger-than-expected La Niña
- I should extend my upper tail to account for the possibility of short-term weather spikes

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 0.82
P20: 0.88
P40: 0.96
P60: 1.04
P80: 1.12
P90: 1.18

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class for this forecast is the set of recent La Niña years, specifically the "triple-dip" event from 2020 to 2022. This class matches the primary driver for the forecast period—an active La Niña. During the November-December periods of these years, the highest daily global surface air temperature anomalies were in the range of **0.85°C to 1.05°C**.

However, this base rate must be adjusted for the strong background warming trend of approximately 0.2°C per decade. From the midpoint of that La Niña period (late 2021) to the forecast period (late 2025) is about four years, implying an upward adjustment of roughly 0.08°C.

Therefore, my prior distribution is centered on the upper end of the historical range plus the trend adjustment: 1.05°C + 0.08°C = **1.13°C**. The spread of this prior reflects the historical range, suggesting a plausible range from approximately 1.03°C to 1.23°C.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: The primary similarity to the 2020-2022 reference class is the presence of a La Niña event, which exerts a global cooling influence by reducing heat transfer from the Pacific Ocean to the atmosphere.
*   **Differences**: The current situation is significantly different in several key ways:
    1.  **Unprecedented Baseline Warmth**: The planet is emerging from the record-shattering heat of 2023-2024. As the provided chart shows, 2025 temperatures, while no longer record-breaking, are running substantially warmer than the 2020-2022 period. This thermal inertia is a major factor.
    2.  **Record Ocean Heat Content (OHC)**: The oceans are warmer than ever before, acting as a massive heat reservoir that counteracts the atmospheric cooling effect of La Niña.
    3.  **Weak La Niña**: Forecasts indicate the current La Niña is weak and may be short-lived. A weak event will have a much smaller cooling impact than a moderate or strong one.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on my prior distribution centered at 1.13°C.

*   **(↓) La Niña is officially active**: This is the primary cooling mechanism and is the reason for selecting the La Niña base rate. Its effect is already incorporated into the prior, but its confirmed persistence through the forecast period reinforces the idea that we will not see a return to the 2023 El Niño peaks.
*   **(↑↑) Unprecedented Baseline Warmth & Record OHC**: The fact that September 2025 was the third warmest on record *despite* developing La Niña conditions is strong evidence. It suggests the underlying warming trend and high OHC are largely overwhelming the cooling signal. This evidence makes outcomes significantly higher than the prior of 1.13°C much more likely.
*   **(↑) Weak La Niña Forecast**: The forecast for a weak and potentially short-lived event further strengthens the case for a muted cooling effect. This pushes the distribution upwards, as the primary downward pressure is weaker than in a "typical" La Niña year.
*   **(~) Daily Peak Volatility**: The question asks for the *highest daily* anomaly, not a monthly average. This introduces positive skew, as short-term weather patterns are more likely to cause an anomalous spike than a dip. This doesn't shift the median much but widens the upper tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior**: A distribution centered at **1.13°C**, based on trend-adjusted recent La Niña years.
*   **Likelihood**: The evidence (extremely high baseline warmth, record OHC, weak La Niña) strongly suggests that the cooling effect will be much less pronounced than in the 2020-2022 period. The observed 2025 temperature track in the chart, running ~0.2-0.3°C above the 2021/2022 tracks, is a powerful update.
*   **Update Step**: I will update my prior median of 1.13°C upwards. The evidence that the background warming is dominating the weak La Niña is compelling. A simple model would be to take the peak of the last La Niña (1.05°C) and add the observed anomaly difference from the chart (~0.2°C), but that might be too aggressive as La Niña's cooling effect may strengthen into winter. A more conservative upward shift of +0.06°C seems warranted.
*   **Posterior**: This shifts my median from 1.13°C to approximately **1.19°C**. The distribution is now centered significantly higher than past La Niña peaks but remains well below the 2023 El Niño peak (~1.35°C). The variance should also increase slightly to account for the unprecedented nature of the current climate state.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast could be wrong if I am either under- or over-estimating the impact of La Niña in this novel, hot climate state.

*   **Alternative Forecast (Lower)**: I might be underestimating the cooling power of La Niña. The atmospheric response can lag the oceanic changes, and we could see a sharper drop in temperatures in November and December. In this scenario, the peak might be closer to **1.10°C**. This is plausible but seems less likely given the immense heat already in the system.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Higher)**: I might be underestimating the power of the background warming and record OHC. The weak La Niña could be almost entirely negated, and a favorable weather pattern could push the daily peak into the territory of the 2023/2024 records, potentially reaching **1.30°C or higher**.

My central estimate of ~1.19°C tries to balance these risks. I will ensure my final percentiles reflect these possibilities, with a P10 near the "stronger cooling" scenario and a P90 reflecting the "warming dominates" scenario. The positive skew from the "daily peak" nature of the question also supports a wider upper tail.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 1.10
P20: 1.13
P40: 1.17
P60: 1.22
P80: 1.27
P90: 1.31
