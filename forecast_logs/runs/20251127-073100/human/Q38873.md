### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Appeals of CAS awards to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT):** This is the most direct reference class. The SFT is the only body that can overturn a CAS award. The background information, citing a 2011 CAS bulletin, provides a historical success rate of 0.3% of all CAS awards and ~1% of appeals filed. A 2024 source confirms this trend, noting most challenges in 2024 were not upheld.
    *   **Base Rate:** **0.5% - 2%**. This range accounts for the historical data and allows for slight variations over time. The data is robust over decades, suggesting a stable process.
2.  **Appeals from the CAS Ad Hoc Division:** This case originated in the CAS Ad Hoc Division, which operates under expedited rules during the Olympics. These rushed proceedings could theoretically lead to more procedural errors, potentially increasing the chance of a successful appeal. Conversely, the SFT may grant even greater deference to this specialized, on-the-ground body. Data on SFT success rates specifically for Ad Hoc division appeals is not readily available.
    *   **Base Rate:** **Uncertain, but likely similar to the main class (0.5% - 2%)**. The fundamental legal constraints of the SFT appeal process remain the same.
3.  **High-profile sports disputes involving major national federations (e.g., USA Gymnastics):** Powerful, well-funded federations can mount more sophisticated legal challenges. However, the SFT is a national supreme court and is expected to be insulated from the political or financial weight of the appellants. This class is less useful for predicting legal outcomes but relevant for understanding the appellant's capacity to pursue the case fully.
    *   **Base Rate:** Not quantifiable as a success rate, but suggests the appeal will be pursued with maximum legal resources.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-08-11:** USA Gymnastics (USAG) announces its appeal of the CAS ruling to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, citing video evidence that proves the inquiry was filed on time. **(↑)** — This confirms the appeal is proceeding and is based on specific evidence, not just a general complaint.
*   **2024-08-16:** An article on Olympic arbitrations highlights the swift, 24-hour nature of CAS Ad Hoc decisions. **(↑, small)** — The expedited process could make procedural errors, the basis of an SFT appeal, slightly more likely than in a standard CAS proceeding.
*   **2024-09-25:** A LawInSport summary of CAS Ad Hoc decisions at Paris 2024 is published, providing context on the types of cases heard. **(Neutral)** — Confirms the Chiles case was one of several field-of-play disputes handled by the division.
*   **2024-12-20:** A Sportlegis compilation confirms the Chiles case is "still pending before the Swiss Federal Tribunal." **(Neutral)** — Indicates the case has not been summarily dismissed and is proceeding, but gives no information on its timeline or merits.
*   **2024-12-20:** A separate Sportlegis article notes that most SFT challenges against CAS awards in 2024 were not upheld. **(↓)** — Reinforces the extremely low base rate of success for this type of appeal, showing the historical trend continues.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Narrow Grounds for SFT Appeal (Large, ↓):** This is the most significant driver. The SFT does not re-examine the facts or merits of a case. It can only overturn a CAS award on extremely limited procedural grounds, such as lack of jurisdiction, violation of the right to be heard, or incompatibility with public policy. This creates a massive barrier to success.
2.  **Nature of USAG's Argument (Moderate, ↑):** USAG's appeal is based on a procedural error (the CAS panel's finding on the timing of the inquiry), supported by specific evidence (video). This correctly targets the narrow grounds for an SFT appeal, making it a more plausible challenge than one arguing about the gymnastics scoring itself.
3.  **SFT's Deference to CAS Factual Findings (Large, ↓):** The SFT is highly deferential to the CAS's role as the finder of fact. For USAG to succeed, they must convince the SFT not just that the CAS panel was wrong about the timing, but that its error was so egregious it constituted a violation of fundamental procedural rights (e.g., ignoring crucial evidence presented to it).
4.  **Clarity of the "Video Evidence" (Moderate, ?):** The strength of the appeal hinges on this evidence. If the video is unambiguous and proves the inquiry was timely, it strengthens the argument for a procedural violation. If it is open to interpretation, the SFT will almost certainly defer to the original CAS panel's assessment. We cannot currently assess this evidence.
5.  **Timeline vs. Resolution Deadline (Moderate, ↓):** SFT proceedings can take many months. The case must be decided and reported before January 1, 2026. While plausible, there is a non-trivial risk the legal process extends beyond the resolution date, which would result in a "No" resolution.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Focus on Procedure, Not Merits:** Unlike many failed appeals that attempt to re-argue the substance of a case, this appeal is correctly framed around a procedural issue, which is the SFT's domain. This makes it a stronger candidate for success than a "generic" appeal.
*   **Existence of "Smoking Gun" Evidence:** USAG's public claim of having definitive video evidence is a key feature. Many procedural appeals may lack such a clear, objective piece of evidence to anchor their claims.
*   **Ad Hoc Division Origin:** The original CAS decision was made under intense time pressure during the Olympics. This environment is more prone to error than the standard, multi-month CAS process, potentially providing a more fertile ground for a procedural challenge.
*   **High-Profile "Field of Play" Decision:** This involves an Olympic medal, a quintessential "field of play" issue. The SFT is historically extremely reluctant to intervene in such matters, which are seen as the purview of sports bodies. Overturning this would be a significant and rare intervention.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the historical base rate of successful SFT appeals against CAS awards, around **1%**, with a high equivalent n (e.g., n=200) due to the stability and volume of historical data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The appeal is correctly framed on procedural grounds, the only viable path to success.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The claim of specific, objective video evidence provides a stronger basis for a procedural challenge than is typical.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The SFT's institutional deference to CAS's factual findings and its extremely high bar for what constitutes a "procedural violation" remains the single largest obstacle.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The origin in the time-pressured Ad Hoc division slightly increases the possibility of a reviewable error having occurred.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests this case is stronger than the average SFT appeal. The posterior should be revised **upwards significantly** from the very low base rate, but should remain low in absolute terms. A move from ~1% to the **5-10% range** seems justifiable.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The SFT announces it will hold a full hearing on the case (i.e., it passes preliminary review).
    *   Credible leaks or reports describing the video evidence as definitive and unambiguous.
    *   Statements from independent Swiss sports law experts suggesting the USAG appeal has strong legal merit under Swiss law.
    *   Any preliminary procedural ruling by the SFT in favor of USAG.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   An announcement from the SFT dismissing the appeal.
    *   USAG withdrawing the appeal.
    *   Official court schedules showing a hearing date set for after the resolution deadline (Jan 1, 2026).
    *   Statements from CAS or the Romanian Olympic Committee expressing high confidence after reviewing USAG's legal filings.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The single most important factor—the content and clarity of the video evidence and the detailed legal arguments—is not public. The forecast is highly sensitive to this unknown.
*   **Black Box of Deliberation:** The SFT's internal deliberations are opaque. The outcome will be announced without significant leading indicators beyond formal procedural steps.

To forecast the probability of the decision to reallocate the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics being overturned before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate for this event is the historical success rate of appeals against CAS awards to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT). The data indicates a success rate of approximately 0.3% for all CAS awards and about 1% for appeals filed. Given the stability of this data over decades, we will use a base rate of 1% as our prior probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The appeal is being made to the SFT, which is the only body that can overturn CAS awards.
- The historical success rate of such appeals is extremely low, consistent with the base rate.

**Differences:**
- The appeal is based on a procedural issue, which is the correct domain for SFT appeals, potentially making it stronger than average.
- The existence of specific video evidence claimed by USAG could provide a clearer basis for the appeal than typical cases.
- The original decision was made under the expedited CAS Ad Hoc Division, which might be more prone to procedural errors.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Procedural Focus (↑):** The appeal is correctly focused on procedural grounds, which is the only viable path for success. This increases the probability slightly.
- **Video Evidence (↑):** The claim of definitive video evidence strengthens the procedural argument. However, without public access to this evidence, the impact is uncertain but positive.
- **SFT Deference (↓):** The SFT's deference to CAS's factual findings and high bar for procedural violations significantly decreases the probability.
- **Ad Hoc Division Origin (↑, small):** The expedited nature of the original decision slightly increases the chance of a procedural error.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 1% (0.01 in probability terms), we consider the evidence:

- **Procedural Focus and Video Evidence:** These factors suggest a stronger case than average, warranting an upward adjustment. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 2 for these factors combined.
- **SFT Deference:** This remains a significant barrier, suggesting a likelihood ratio of 0.5.

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.01 / (1 - 0.01) × 2 × 0.5 = 0.01

Posterior probability = 0.01 / (1 + 0.01) ≈ 0.01 or 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence:** The forecast might underestimate the potential impact of the video evidence if it is indeed clear and compelling.
- **Tail Risks:** The possibility of a procedural error due to the expedited process could be higher than typical cases.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** If the video evidence is unambiguous and the SFT finds a procedural violation, the probability could be higher.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, the procedural focus of the appeal, the potential impact of the video evidence, and the SFT's deference to CAS, the probability of the decision being overturned remains low but slightly higher than the base rate. A reasonable final forecast is:

Final: 5%

# Probability Analysis: Will the Jordan Chiles Bronze Medal Decision Be Overturned?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the historical success rate of appeals against Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decisions to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT) as my base rate.

According to the 2011 CAS Bulletin provided in the background:
- Only 5 appeals against CAS arbitral awards had succeeded since 1984
- The success rate in 2009-2010 was approximately 1% of appeals
- Overall success rate from 1984-2010 was 0.3% of all CAS arbitral awards

More recent information from December 2020 confirms this trend has continued, with most SFT challenges against CAS awards in 2024 not being upheld.

**Initial Prior: 1%**

This represents the approximate success rate of appeals against CAS decisions to the SFT. I'm using the slightly higher figure (1% vs 0.3%) because we know an appeal has been filed, which puts us in the denominator of appeals rather than all CAS decisions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a standard appeal of a CAS decision to the SFT, which follows the same legal framework as all cases in our reference class
- The SFT can only overturn CAS decisions on very limited procedural grounds, not on the merits
- The case involves a "field of play" decision, which courts are historically extremely reluctant to overturn

**Key differences:**
- This case originated from the CAS Ad Hoc Division during the Olympics, which operates under expedited procedures and time pressure, potentially increasing the chance of procedural errors
- USA Gymnastics claims to have specific video evidence proving their inquiry was filed on time, which directly addresses a procedural issue (timing) rather than attempting to re-argue the merits
- This is a high-profile Olympic medal case with significant resources behind the appeal (USA Gymnastics)
- The case involves a clear binary factual dispute (was the inquiry filed on time?) rather than a subjective judgment call

These differences suggest this case may have a somewhat higher chance of success than the average appeal, but the fundamental constraints of the SFT appeal process remain.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: USA Gymnastics claims to have video evidence proving the inquiry was filed on time**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the decision will be overturned, we would expect exactly this kind of clear evidence of a procedural error
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if the appeal ultimately fails, USA Gymnastics might still have what they believe is compelling evidence, but it could be insufficient for legal reasons or subject to interpretation
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: The case originated in the time-pressured CAS Ad Hoc Division during the Olympics**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Successful appeals are more likely to come from rushed proceedings where procedural errors are more common
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.95) - Most Olympic disputes go through this division regardless of outcome
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.84 (slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: The case involves a "field of play" decision about an Olympic medal**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Courts are extremely reluctant to intervene in field of play decisions
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Most failed appeals involve similar deference to sporting authorities
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: The appeal is correctly framed on procedural grounds (timing of inquiry) rather than merit**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Successful appeals almost always focus on procedural issues
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many unsuccessful appeals also target procedure but fail to meet the high threshold
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.38 (increases probability)

**Evidence 5: The case is still pending before the SFT as of December 2024**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - Cases that will be overturned typically go through full review
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Many unsuccessful appeals also proceed through full review
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.29 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (video evidence):**
- Prior odds: 1:99 (0.01)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3:99 ≈ 0.03
- Posterior probability: 0.03/(1+0.03) ≈ 2.9%

**Update on Evidence 3 (field of play decision):**
- Prior odds: 0.03:0.97
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.0075:0.97 ≈ 0.0077
- Posterior probability: 0.0077/(1+0.0077) ≈ 0.77%

**Update on Evidence 4 (procedural framing):**
- Prior odds: 0.0077:0.9923
- Likelihood ratio: 2.38
- Posterior odds: 0.018:0.9923 ≈ 0.018
- Posterior probability: 0.018/(1+0.018) ≈ 1.8%

After these key updates, my posterior probability is approximately 1.8%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the quality of USA Gymnastics' evidence. If their video evidence is truly unambiguous, it could present a stronger case than typical appeals.
- The SFT might view the timing of an inquiry as a more fundamental procedural issue than typical "field of play" matters, making intervention more likely.
- The political and diplomatic aspects of an Olympic medal dispute between nations could influence the proceedings in ways not captured by historical statistics.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might place the probability at 5-10%, arguing that:
- The specific nature of the evidence (video timestamp) makes this case unusually strong
- The procedural error (if proven) is clear-cut rather than subjective
- The expedited nature of the Ad Hoc Division makes procedural errors more likely

**Rebuttal:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome the fundamental constraints:
- The SFT is extremely deferential to CAS factual findings
- The bar for what constitutes a procedural violation warranting intervention is extremely high
- The historical success rate is persistently low across decades and various case types

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I will adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility that this case has stronger evidence than typical appeals, but remain close to the historical base rate given the consistent pattern of SFT deference to CAS.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the historical base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that the decision to reallocate the bronze medal from Jordan Chiles to Ana Bǎrbosu will be overturned before 2026 at 3%.

This reflects:
- The extremely low historical success rate of appeals against CAS decisions
- The slightly higher chance due to the specific procedural nature of the appeal and claimed video evidence
- The countervailing factor of extreme judicial deference in "field of play" decisions
- The time constraint (resolution by January 1, 2026)

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the overturning of a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decision by the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT). This is the only available avenue for appeal. The most relevant reference class is the historical success rate of such appeals.

- The provided background information, citing a 2011 CAS bulletin, gives a historical success rate of approximately 1% for appeals filed between 2009-2010, and an overall success rate of 0.3% for all CAS awards issued between 1984 and 2010.
- More recent data from 2024, mentioned in the research report, confirms this trend, noting that most SFT challenges against CAS awards were not upheld.

Given that an appeal has been filed, the 1% success rate of *filed appeals* is the more appropriate starting point than the success rate against all decisions. This base rate is robust, reflecting a stable legal process over decades.

**Prior Probability P(H): 1%** (or 1:99 odds).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has features that make it both stronger and weaker than the average appeal of a CAS award.

- **Similarities:** The appeal follows the standard legal path from CAS to the SFT, involving a high-profile sporting outcome.
- **Differences (Strengths):**
    1.  **Grounds for Appeal:** The appeal is correctly focused on a narrow procedural issue (the timeliness of the inquiry), which is the only basis on which the SFT can act. It does not attempt to re-argue the merits of the gymnastics scoring.
    2.  **Specific Evidence:** USA Gymnastics claims to have "definitive video evidence." A strong, objective piece of evidence is more compelling than arguments based on interpretation alone.
    3.  **Origin:** The decision came from the CAS Ad Hoc Division, which operates under intense 24-hour time pressure during the Olympics, potentially increasing the likelihood of procedural errors compared to standard CAS proceedings.
- **Differences (Weaknesses):**
    1.  **"Field of Play" Doctrine:** The SFT is extremely reluctant to intervene in decisions that alter results on the field of play. Overturning this decision would mean reallocating an Olympic medal, a very high bar for intervention.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the decision is overturned.

- **Evidence 1: The appeal is based on procedural grounds and specific video evidence.**
    - P(E | H): A successful appeal to the SFT is almost certain to be based on strong evidence of a procedural flaw. This probability is high.
    - P(E | ~H): Many unsuccessful appeals are also framed procedurally, but they may lack the "smoking gun" evidence claimed here. Still, appellants often claim their evidence is strong.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence makes the appeal significantly stronger than the average case, increasing the probability.

- **Evidence 2: The decision concerns a "field of play" result.**
    - P(E | H): It is very rare for a successful SFT appeal to overturn a field-of-play result. The court shows immense deference to sporting bodies in these matters. This probability is very low.
    - P(E | ~H): A large fraction of unsuccessful appeals likely involve attempts to change field-of-play results. This probability is high.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Much less than 1. This is the single largest obstacle and strongly decreases the probability.

- **Evidence 3: The case must be resolved before Jan 1, 2026.**
    - SFT proceedings can be lengthy. While the timeline is plausible, there is a non-zero chance the case is not fully resolved by the deadline, which would result in a "No" resolution. This acts as a small downward adjustment on the final probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We start with a prior of 1% (1:99 odds).

1.  **Initial Prior:** 1% (Odds: 1:99)
2.  **Update for Positive Factors:** The combination of a correct procedural framing, the claim of definitive video evidence, and the error-prone context of the Ad Hoc division makes this case substantially stronger than the average appeal. Let's estimate these factors collectively increase the odds of success by a factor of 8 (a significant update).
    -   *Intermediate Odds* = 1:99 × 8 = 8:99 ≈ 1:12.4
    -   *Intermediate Probability* ≈ 1 / (1 + 12.4) ≈ 7.5%
3.  **Update for Negative Factors:** The SFT's extreme deference on "field of play" matters is a massive counterweight. The SFT's position is not to re-weigh the evidence (the video) but to determine if the CAS process was fundamentally flawed (e.g., a violation of the right to be heard). This is a very high bar. Let's estimate this factor reduces the odds of success by a factor of 2/3 (a likelihood ratio of 1/1.5 is too weak, 1/4 is too strong, let's use 1/2). Let's say it halves the odds.
    -   *Posterior Odds* = 1:12.4 × (1/2) = 1:24.8
    -   *Posterior Probability* = 1 / (1 + 24.8) ≈ 1 / 25.8 ≈ 3.9%

This calculation suggests the probability is significantly higher than the 1% base rate but remains very low in absolute terms.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too low if the "video evidence" is a true smoking gun that demonstrates a clear and undeniable procedural violation that the CAS panel ignored, which would constitute a violation of the right to be heard. In this scenario, the SFT might feel compelled to act despite its usual deference.

Conversely, my forecast could be too high because I am being influenced by USA Gymnastics' public statements. The CAS panel already viewed this evidence and was not persuaded. The SFT is highly likely to defer to the CAS's role as the finder of fact, stating that it will not substitute its own interpretation of the video for that of the expert panel. This is the most probable outcome and suggests the final probability should remain very close to the base rate.

Balancing these, the ~4% figure seems like a reasonable synthesis. It acknowledges that this is a well-founded appeal with better-than-average prospects, but it correctly reflects that success remains an exceptional and unlikely event.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a successful appeal of a CAS decision is extremely low, at around 1%. The specific features of this case—a focused procedural argument backed by purported video evidence—make it a stronger candidate for success than the average appeal. However, this is counteracted by the Swiss Federal Tribunal's profound reluctance to interfere with "field of play" decisions like the awarding of medals. The net effect is an upward adjustment from the very low base rate, but the probability remains low in absolute terms. The final probability reflects a roughly four-fold increase over the base rate, accounting for the case's specific strengths while respecting the immense institutional hurdles.

Final: 4%
