### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent periods with similar yield levels (2023-2025):** The most relevant reference class is the behavior of the 10-year yield when it has been in a similar regime, i.e., above 3.5% but not in a state of extreme panic. In the 2023-2025 period (based on general market knowledge and the provided sources), the yield has shown significant volatility. A base rate derived from this period suggests that a biweekly change is typically within +/- 25 basis points (bps). The mean reversion tendency is weak in the short term; momentum often dominates.
-   **Post-Financial Crisis tightening/pausing cycles (e.g., 2018):** In periods where the Federal Reserve has paused or concluded a tightening cycle, the 10-year yield tends to stabilize or drift lower as the market anticipates future easing. The median biweekly change in such periods is slightly negative, around -5 bps, with a standard deviation of approximately 15-20 bps. This class suggests a slight downward bias from the starting point.
-   **All biweekly periods (post-2000):** A broad reference class of all biweekly periods since 2000 would yield a lower average rate (approx. 2.8%) and smaller volatility. However, this is not a useful base rate as it includes a long period of secularly declining rates and quantitative easing, a regime that is fundamentally different from the current one. It is included here for completeness but should be heavily discounted.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-09-25** Weekly average yield was 4.16%. — (Baseline) — Establishes a recent peak from which the current rate has fallen, indicating recent downward momentum.
-   **2025-09-30** Deloitte publishes its Q3 forecast. — (↓) — Projects yields to "ease consistently" from Q3 2025, reinforcing a narrative of a near-term peak and subsequent decline.
-   **2025-10-24** Deloitte's forecast (near 4.5%) and CBO's (4.1%) are reported. — (↑/Neutral) — These year-end targets are higher than the current rate, suggesting some analysis expects a rebound from the 4.00% level.
-   **2025-10-24** Yield reported at 4.02%. — (↓) — Confirms the decline from the late September high of 4.16%, showing the "easing" narrative is playing out in markets.
-   **2025-10-27** Yield reported at 4.00%. — (↓) — The most recent data point, reinforcing the downward trend and acting as a strong anchor for the short-term forecast.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Inflation Expectations:** Market expectations for future inflation (e.g., breakeven rates). Higher expected inflation erodes the real return of bonds, pushing yields up. The tension between "stubborn inflation" (ING) and slowing growth is the central driver. (Size: Large)
-   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** The market's perception of the Fed's future path for the federal funds rate. A more hawkish stance (higher for longer) pushes yields up; a dovish pivot (rate cuts) pushes them down. The market appears to be pricing in a less hawkish Fed given the recent yield decline. (Size: Large)
-   **Economic Growth Outlook:** Stronger growth data (e.g., jobs, GDP, PMIs) suggests a more robust economy, which can support higher rates and inflation, pushing yields up. Weaker data or "recession fears" (Bankrate) do the opposite. (Size: Moderate)
-   **Treasury Supply and Demand:** The amount of debt issued by the Treasury versus demand from domestic and foreign investors. Higher-than-expected supply or waning demand can push yields up to attract buyers. (Size: Moderate)
-   **Global Safe-Haven Demand:** Geopolitical or global financial instability can increase demand for U.S. Treasuries as a safe asset, pushing yields down. (Size: Small to Large, event-dependent)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Post-Tightening Apex:** Unlike a random period, Q4 2025 is widely seen as the period at or just after the peak of a historic Fed tightening cycle. This creates a strong asymmetric bias, where the bar for yields to rise further is high, while the path to lower yields (in anticipation of future cuts) is more plausible.
-   **Elevated Debt Levels:** The U.S. fiscal situation involves a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than in most historical reference periods. This could increase term premium and keep yields structurally higher than past cycles would suggest, even if the Fed cuts rates.
-   **Conflicting Economic Signals:** The current environment is characterized by an unusual mix of "stubborn inflation" concerns alongside "recession fears." This creates more uncertainty than a typical cycle where inflation and growth move more in tandem.
-   **Compressed Timeline:** The forecast horizon is extremely short (less than a month). This means that near-term momentum and technical factors will play a much larger role than long-term fundamentals, which are more relevant for the reference classes. The current 4.00% level is a very powerful anchor.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the provided Q4 forecasts (CBO, Deloitte, Bankrate), would be a distribution centered around **4.15%**, reflecting the consensus that yields would remain elevated. Give this an equivalent n of ~10, as it's based on multiple expert forecasts but lacks hard data from the immediate period.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The observed decline from 4.16% in late September to 4.00% on October 27th is the most powerful evidence. It strongly contradicts the "rebound to 4.5%" narrative and supports the "easing" thesis.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Deloitte's specific forecast of "consistent easing" from Q3 provides a qualitative narrative that matches the recent price action.
    -   (↑ Small) The ING forecast for 5.5% and Deloitte's for 4.5% should be heavily discounted. ING's is from January 2025 and seems outdated by recent events. Deloitte's 4.5% seems to be a general "rest of 2025" view that is being overridden by the most recent data.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior should be pulled down significantly from the 4.15% prior. The strength of the recent data (the 4.00% print) should dominate. The final posterior should be centered very close to the current **4.00%** level, with a slight upward skew to account for the possibility of a minor rebound or volatility.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   October CPI/PPI reports (released early Nov) coming in significantly above expectations.
    -   October Jobs Report (released early Nov) showing unexpectedly strong payroll growth and wage inflation.
    -   Hawkish commentary from FOMC members or in meeting minutes.
    -   Unexpectedly large Treasury auction sizes or poor auction demand (low bid-to-cover ratios).
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   CPI/PPI reports showing a continued disinflationary trend.
    -   A weak Jobs Report, particularly with a rising unemployment rate.
    -   Dovish Fedspeak explicitly acknowledging rising growth risks.
    -   Signs of stress in financial markets (e.g., widening credit spreads) increasing safe-haven demand.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Data Revisions:** Key economic data like GDP and employment figures are subject to revision, which could alter the market's perception of the economic trajectory after the fact.
-   **Term Premium Volatility:** The term premium (the extra yield investors demand for holding a long-term bond) is unobservable and notoriously volatile. A sudden shift in term premium could move the yield for reasons unrelated to inflation or Fed policy.
-   **Geopolitical Shocks:** Unforeseen geopolitical events could trigger a flight to safety, causing a sharp, unpredictable drop in yields.
-   **Over-reliance on Momentum:** While the recent downward trend is strong, yields can reverse quickly. A forecast anchored too heavily on the 4.00% level could be caught off guard by a single piece of surprising data.
-   **Resolution Window:** The resolution is the last day of the period (Nov 21). A single day's market move, potentially driven by low liquidity around the Thanksgiving holiday week, could determine the outcome.

### Final Research Summary
The 10-year yield will likely end the period near its current level of 4.00%. Strong recent downward momentum and a narrative of economic easing have overwhelmed earlier, higher forecasts, creating an anchor that will be difficult to dislodge without a significant inflationary surprise in the next few weeks.

To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of Nov 10 - Nov 21, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from recent periods with similar yield levels (2023-2025), where the yield has been above 3.5% with significant volatility. The mean reversion tendency is weak, and momentum often dominates. A typical biweekly change is within +/- 25 basis points (bps). The mean of this base rate is around 4.15%, with a standard deviation of approximately 20 bps.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in terms of volatility and the level of yields. However, it differs due to the post-tightening apex, where the Federal Reserve is seen as having peaked in its rate hikes, creating a downward bias. Additionally, elevated debt levels and conflicting economic signals add complexity.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent evidence shows a decline from 4.16% to 4.00%, suggesting a strong downward momentum. Deloitte's forecast of "consistent easing" supports this trend. However, some forecasts (e.g., ING's 5.5%) suggest a potential rebound, although these are less consistent with recent data.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 4.15%, the strong recent evidence of a decline to 4.00% shifts the posterior mean downward. The likelihood of further declines is reinforced by the narrative of easing and recent data points, resulting in a posterior centered near 4.00%, with a slight upward skew to account for potential volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes unexpected inflationary data or geopolitical events that could cause a sharp move in yields. The possibility of over-relying on recent momentum is acknowledged, but the strong evidence of a downward trend is compelling. An alternative forecast might emphasize a rebound, but recent data and forecasts suggest this is less likely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the period are as follows:

P10: 3.85  
P20: 3.90  
P40: 3.95  
P60: 4.00  
P80: 4.05  
P90: 4.10

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 10-21, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use the most recent 10-year Treasury yield data, which shows the yield at 4.00% as of October 27, 2025. This is the most relevant starting point for a short-term forecast.

For the distribution around this value, I'll consider:
- Historical biweekly volatility in similar market environments (post-tightening cycles): typically ±20-25 basis points
- The mean/median of this base rate is 4.00%, with a standard deviation of approximately 0.20-0.25 percentage points

This base rate is appropriate because it represents the most current market pricing, which incorporates all available information about economic conditions, inflation expectations, and Fed policy.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We remain in a post-tightening cycle environment where the Fed has likely reached its terminal rate
- The economic backdrop continues to show mixed signals with concerns about both inflation persistence and growth slowdown
- Market participants are weighing similar factors as they have been in recent months

**Differences from base case:**
- The forecast period (Nov 10-21) is approximately two weeks away from the current data point, allowing time for new economic data to influence yields
- The period falls during a potentially volatile time (pre-Thanksgiving in the US), which could affect market liquidity
- Recent momentum has been downward (from 4.16% in late September to 4.00% currently), suggesting a possible continuation of this trend

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting lower yields:**
- Recent momentum shows yields declining from 4.16% in September to 4.00% by October 27 (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood for lower vs. higher)
- Deloitte's Q3 forecast explicitly projects yields to "ease consistently" from Q3 2025 (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for lower)
- The forecast period is in Q4, which historically often sees "year-end" positioning that can favor bonds (weak evidence, ~1.2x likelihood for lower)

**Evidence supporting higher yields:**
- Some forecasts (Deloitte at 4.5%, CBO at 4.1%) suggest yields could remain above current levels (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for higher)
- Treasury supply concerns remain as US debt levels are elevated (weak evidence, ~1.2x likelihood for higher)
- Inflation has proven "stubborn" according to some sources, which could keep yields elevated (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for higher)

**Neutral factors:**
- The extremely short forecast horizon (biweekly period) limits how far yields typically move without major catalysts
- The period falls during a potentially lower-liquidity week (pre-Thanksgiving), which could amplify moves in either direction

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.00% with a standard deviation of ~0.225%, I'll update based on the evidence:

The combined evidence suggests a slight downward bias:
- The recent momentum (4.16% → 4.00%) is the strongest signal
- Deloitte's "consistent easing" forecast aligns with this trend
- The higher forecasts (4.5%, 4.1%) appear to be longer-term or potentially outdated given recent movement

Applying Bayesian updating conceptually:
- Prior: Mean = 4.00%, SD = 0.225%
- Likelihood: Slightly favors lower yields (~1.3x overall)
- Posterior: Mean ≈ 3.95%, SD ≈ 0.22%

This represents a small downward shift in the central tendency while maintaining similar dispersion, reflecting the modest but consistent evidence for continued yield decline.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent momentum and underestimating mean reversion
- The forecast period could see unexpected economic data releases that dramatically shift the narrative
- Geopolitical events could trigger safe-haven flows in either direction
- Treasury auctions during this period could reveal unexpected shifts in demand

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 4.10%, arguing that:
- The recent decline to 4.00% was too rapid and some rebound is likely
- The CBO and Deloitte forecasts suggest yields should remain above 4.00%
- Markets may have gotten ahead of themselves in pricing in future Fed easing

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The momentum of the decline has been consistent rather than sharp, suggesting a genuine trend
- The most recent data point (4.00%) carries more weight than earlier forecasts
- The short time horizon limits how much yields can rebound without significant catalysts

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these considerations and the inherent uncertainty in short-term rate movements, particularly around potentially lower-liquidity periods.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.65%
P20: 3.75%
P40: 3.90%
P60: 4.00%
P80: 4.15%
P90: 4.25%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target is the 10-year Treasury yield on November 21, 2025, with the forecast being made on October 27, 2025. The time horizon is very short (less than one month).

I will construct a prior based on the consensus of expert forecasts for Q4 2025, as mentioned in the research report. These include the CBO's forecast of 4.1% and Deloitte's of "near 4.5%". A simple average of these and other similar views suggests a prior distribution centered around **4.15%**.

Given the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting, I'll assign this prior a relatively large standard deviation of 30 basis points (0.30%). This "Fundamental Prior" represents a reasonable expectation for the quarter *before* incorporating the most recent, high-frequency market data.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities**: The current environment resembles past post-tightening cycle periods, where markets begin to anticipate future Fed easing, putting downward pressure on long-term yields. The tension between slowing growth and persistent inflation is also typical of a cycle peak.
*   **Differences**: The key difference is the extremely short forecast horizon. For a date just three and a half weeks away, the current market price is not just a data point; it's a powerful anchor that has already priced in most available information. The current yield of 4.00% is significantly below the 4.15% prior, suggesting the market's immediate view is more dovish than the broader quarterly forecasts. Additionally, the high US debt-to-GDP ratio could exert structural upward pressure on yields compared to historical cycles.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key evidence and its impact on the prior distribution.

*   **Evidence 1: Recent Downward Momentum (High Impact, Downward Pressure)**
    *   The yield has fallen from 4.16% on Sep 25 to 4.00% on Oct 27. This is a strong, direct signal from the market that contradicts the higher "Fundamental Prior".
    *   *Likelihood Adjustment*: This observation is far more likely if the true distribution for late November is centered near 4.00% than if it's centered at 4.15%. This evidence strongly pulls the forecast down.

*   **Evidence 2: Supporting Narrative (Moderate Impact, Downward Pressure)**
    *   Deloitte's forecast for "consistent easing" from Q3 2025 provides a narrative that aligns perfectly with the observed price action.
    *   *Likelihood Adjustment*: This reinforces the downward update from the price momentum.

*   **Evidence 3: Upcoming Event Risk (High Impact, Increases Variance)**
    *   Key data releases (Jobs Report, CPI, PPI) are scheduled before the resolution date. A significant surprise in any of these could cause a sharp move of 10-20 bps.
    *   *Likelihood Adjustment*: This doesn't shift the center of the forecast but significantly widens the distribution. The probability of outcomes far from the median increases.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Conceptual Update**: Posterior ∝ Prior(centered at 4.15%) × Likelihood(strong signal at 4.00%).
*   **Process**: The strong, recent evidence of the market pricing the yield at 4.00% must overwhelmingly update the weaker, more general prior of 4.15%. The posterior distribution's center must shift very close to the current price. A weighted average approach, giving ~80-90% weight to the current market price and ~10-20% to the fundamental prior, suggests a posterior mean around 4.03%.
    *   `Posterior Mean ≈ 0.85 * (4.00%) + 0.15 * (4.15%) = 3.40% + 0.62% = 4.02%`
*   **Posterior Shape**: The median of the posterior distribution will be anchored near 4.02-4.03%. The distribution will be wide to reflect the significant event risk from upcoming data releases.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Primary Risk**: I am heavily anchored to the current 4.00% level. What if this recent drop is a head-fake or an overreaction? A single hot inflation report could cause a violent snap-back rally in yields toward the 4.20-4.30% range, making my forecast look naive.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Inflation Re-acceleration)**: The October Jobs and CPI reports come in much hotter than expected. The market narrative shifts from "easing" back to "higher for longer," and the yield quickly moves to 4.30%.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Hard Landing)**: A weak jobs report or a financial stability scare triggers a flight-to-safety bid for Treasuries, pushing the yield down toward 3.75%.
*   **Adjustment**: My initial symmetric distribution around 4.03% might understate the risk of a snap-back. The "bar for yields to rise is high" might apply to a sustained trend, but not to a short-term, data-driven spike. I will therefore introduce a slight positive skew to my final distribution, making the upside tail (P80, P90) slightly fatter than the downside tail to account for this snap-back risk. The median will remain at 4.03%.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is centered at 4.03%, reflecting a strong anchor to the current 4.00% level with a slight pull toward higher fundamental estimates. The distribution is wide to account for major data releases before the resolution date and has a slight positive skew to reflect the risk of a sharp upward move on an inflation surprise.
