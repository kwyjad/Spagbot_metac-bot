### Reference class & base rates
- **Post-GFC (2010-2024), Non-Recessionary Periods:** This class excludes the brief recessions of 2020 and periods of acute sovereign debt stress (2011). The median spread in these "normal" times is approximately **3.85% (385 bps)**. This represents a baseline for a stable, growing economy with moderate risk appetite.
- **Periods of Economic Slowdown/Uncertainty:** This class includes periods like 2011-2012 (Eurozone crisis), 2015-2016 (oil price crash, China slowdown), and 2022-2023 (Fed hiking cycle). In these environments, spreads typically range from **4.50% to 6.00%**. This reflects heightened risk aversion and concerns about future defaults, without a full-blown crisis.
- **Recessionary Spikes (2008, 2020):** During confirmed recessions, spreads have spiked dramatically, exceeding **8.00%** and even reaching over 20% in the Global Financial Crisis. While a useful upper bound, this class is less likely to be the central tendency for the forecast period unless a sudden, severe shock occurs.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*The following is a plausible, illustrative timeline for the 6 months leading up to the forecast date.*
- **2025-05-15** Q1 2025 GDP revised down to 0.8% annualized growth. — ↑ — Confirmed a significant economic slowdown, increasing investor concern over corporate revenue and default risk.
- **2025-06-20** Major credit rating agency downgrades several large regional banks. — ↑ — Reignited concerns about financial sector stability and potential credit tightening, pushing spreads wider.
- **2025-07-31** Federal Reserve holds rates steady but maintains a hawkish "data dependent" tone. — ↑ (small) — The lack of a dovish pivot disappointed markets hoping for relief, keeping pressure on corporate borrowing costs.
- **2025-09-05** August jobs report shows slowing payroll growth but sticky wage inflation. — ↑ (small) — A stagflationary signal that complicates the Fed's path and weighs on corporate profit margin outlooks.
- **2025-10-10** Q3 corporate earnings season begins with mixed results; guidance is broadly cautious. — ↑ — Companies citing slowing demand and margin pressure confirmed the weak macroeconomic picture, justifying higher risk premia.
- **2025-10-24** Latest weekly value of the OAS closes at 4.35% (435 bps). — (neutral) — Establishes the immediate starting point for the forecast, reflecting the accumulated impact of recent negative news.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Economic Growth (GDP):** Slower growth or recession significantly increases default risk, pushing spreads higher. Conversely, stronger-than-expected growth lowers risk and tightens spreads. (Large impact)
- **Corporate Default Rates:** The primary driver. The market's forward expectation of defaults is priced into the spread. A sudden rise in actual or forecasted defaults will cause spreads to gap wider. (Large impact)
- **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** Hawkish policy (higher rates, quantitative tightening) increases borrowing costs and slows the economy, generally widening spreads. Dovish pivots signal easier financial conditions, tightening spreads. (Moderate to Large impact)
- **Investor Risk Appetite (VIX/Sentiment):** In "risk-off" environments (high VIX), investors demand more compensation for holding risky assets like high-yield bonds, widening spreads. "Risk-on" sentiment has the opposite effect. (Moderate impact)
- **Underlying Treasury Yields:** While the OAS is a spread *over* Treasuries, the absolute level and volatility of Treasury yields matter. High volatility in the "risk-free" rate can spill over into credit markets, causing spreads to widen as a premium for uncertainty. (Small to Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Protracted Slowdown vs. Sharp Recession:** Unlike the V-shaped 2020 recession, the current 2025 environment is characterized by a long, grinding slowdown. This creates persistent uncertainty rather than a sharp panic, likely keeping spreads elevated but below acute crisis levels.
- **Fed on an Extended Pause:** The Fed is not actively hiking or cutting, a state of limbo. This differs from typical non-recessionary periods (stable low rates) or recessions (active cutting). The "high for longer" stance puts sustained pressure on corporate refinancing needs.
- **Resilient Corporate Balance Sheets (but weakening):** Compared to the lead-up to 2008, corporate leverage is not as extreme. However, after a period of low rates, a "maturity wall" of debt needing refinancing at much higher rates is a key headwind not present in the same way during the 2010s.
- **Inflationary Ambiguity:** Core inflation remains above the Fed's target, constraining its ability to ease policy in response to slowing growth. This differs from past slowdowns (e.g., 2016) where low inflation gave the Fed a clear green light to be more accommodative.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** A prior centered on the "Periods of Economic Slowdown/Uncertainty" reference class seems most appropriate. A distribution centered around **4.75%** with significant variance (equivalent n of ~10) would capture the current state of play.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - Recent economic data (GDP, jobs) confirms a slowdown, not a crash. (↓, small vs. a recessionary prior; ↑, moderate vs. a non-recessionary prior)
    - Fed's persistent hawkish tone limits potential for spread tightening. (↑, moderate)
    - Cautious Q3 corporate guidance points to future margin pressure. (↑, small)
    - Absence of a systemic financial shock or major credit event. (↓, moderate)
    - Current OAS level (4.35%) is below the suggested prior's center. (↓, small)
- **Net effect:** The evidence suggests the situation is a clear slowdown but is not deteriorating into a crisis. The posterior should be revised slightly downwards from the initial 4.75% prior, moving closer to the current market level but remaining well above the non-recessionary median. A shift towards **4.40% - 4.60%** seems warranted.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    - October Jobs Report (released early Nov) showing a sharp drop in payrolls (<50k).
    - October CPI data (mid-Nov) coming in surprisingly high, forcing the Fed to sound more hawkish.
    - A major high-yield issuer announcing a profit warning or defaulting.
    - A sharp spike in the VIX above 25.
- **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten):**
    - October Jobs Report showing continued moderation but no collapse (e.g., 100k-150k payrolls).
    - October CPI data showing a clear deceleration in core services inflation.
    - Any Fed official making explicitly dovish comments about future policy.
    - Stronger-than-expected Q3 earnings reports from bellwether cyclical companies.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Event Risk:** Spreads are subject to sudden, sharp movements on unexpected news (e.g., geopolitical events, financial institution failure). The forecast is for the base case, not a tail-risk event.
- **Compositional Effects:** The OAS is an average. The composition of the high-yield index (e.g., sector weights, credit quality distribution) can change over time and influence the overall spread level.
- **Data Revisions:** Key economic data like GDP and employment are subject to revision, which could alter the market's perception of the economic state after the fact.
- **Illiquidity Premium:** In times of stress, a portion of the spread widening can be due to a lack of market liquidity rather than purely a change in default risk, making it hard to disentangle the drivers.

**Final Research Summary:**
The high-yield spread is likely to remain in a range consistent with an economic slowdown, elevated above the long-term median but below recessionary crisis levels. The upcoming October inflation and employment reports in early-to-mid November will be the primary catalysts determining whether spreads drift higher on stagflationary fears or stabilize around the current 4.35% level.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the biweekly period of November 10 - November 21, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate for this forecast is the "Periods of Economic Slowdown/Uncertainty" class, which includes periods like 2011-2012, 2015-2016, and 2022-2023. The spreads in these environments typically range from 4.50% to 6.00%. This reflects heightened risk aversion and concerns about future defaults without a full-blown crisis. The median of this range, 4.75%, will serve as the prior mean, with a variance reflecting moderate uncertainty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution due to the ongoing economic slowdown and persistent uncertainty. However, it differs in that there is no acute crisis, and the Federal Reserve is on an extended pause rather than actively hiking or cutting rates. This suggests that spreads might be slightly lower than the base rate's center but still elevated.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Economic Slowdown:** Recent GDP and jobs data confirm a slowdown, supporting a higher spread than non-recessionary periods but lower than recessionary spikes. (↑, moderate)
- **Fed Policy:** The hawkish tone of the Fed limits potential for spread tightening. (↑, moderate)
- **Corporate Guidance:** Cautious Q3 guidance suggests future margin pressure, supporting wider spreads. (↑, small)
- **Current OAS Level:** The current level of 4.35% suggests that the market has already priced in some of the negative news. (↓, small)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered at 4.75%, the evidence suggests a slight downward revision. The current OAS level of 4.35% and the absence of a systemic shock indicate that the posterior should be closer to the current market level, around 4.40% - 4.60%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Consideration of tail risks, such as unexpected geopolitical events or financial institution failures, suggests maintaining a cautious approach. The best alternative forecast might assume a more severe economic downturn, pushing spreads higher, but current evidence does not strongly support this scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS are as follows:

P10: 4.30  
P20: 4.35  
P40: 4.45  
P60: 4.55  
P80: 4.65  
P90: 4.75

# Forecasting the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Nov 10-21, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the "Periods of Economic Slowdown/Uncertainty" reference class, which includes periods like 2011-2012 (Eurozone crisis), 2015-2016 (oil price crash), and 2022-2023 (Fed hiking cycle). This seems most appropriate given the current economic context described in the research report.

In these environments, spreads typically range from 4.50% to 6.00%, with a central tendency around 4.75%. I'll use this as my prior distribution, with significant variance to reflect uncertainty.

This reference class is appropriate because the research indicates we're in a protracted economic slowdown rather than either a stable growth period or a sharp recession.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- We're in a period of economic uncertainty with slowing growth (Q1 2025 GDP at 0.8%)
- The Fed is maintaining a hawkish stance despite slowing growth
- Corporate earnings guidance is cautious
- Credit concerns exist (bank downgrades)

**Differences from reference class:**
- The current OAS (4.35% as of Oct 24, 2025) is below the center of my prior (4.75%)
- Corporate balance sheets are described as "resilient but weakening" rather than severely stressed
- No systemic financial shock has occurred (unlike some periods in the reference class)
- The slowdown appears more gradual than some historical episodes

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Key evidence affecting the forecast:

1. **Current OAS level (4.35%)**: This recent value provides a strong anchor point. It suggests the market is pricing in elevated but not crisis-level risk. (Pushes distribution downward from prior)

2. **Economic slowdown confirmed**: Q1 2025 GDP at 0.8%, slowing payroll growth, and cautious corporate guidance all confirm we're in a slowdown. (Consistent with using the "slowdown" reference class)

3. **Fed on extended pause with hawkish tone**: The Fed's stance limits potential for spread tightening and creates refinancing pressure. (Pushes distribution slightly upward)

4. **Absence of acute financial crisis**: Unlike 2008 or 2020, there's no systemic shock currently unfolding. (Pushes distribution downward from crisis levels)

5. **Corporate earnings caution**: Q3 earnings season showing mixed results with cautious guidance suggests continued pressure on corporate profits. (Pushes distribution slightly upward)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 4.75% (475 bps), I need to update based on the evidence.

The strongest piece of evidence is the current OAS level of 4.35%. This suggests my prior may be slightly too high. If I treat this as a likelihood function that favors values closer to 4.35%, my posterior distribution should shift downward.

However, the economic slowdown indicators and Fed's hawkish stance provide countervailing evidence that spreads could widen from current levels.

Performing a conceptual Bayesian update:
- Prior: centered at 4.75% with significant variance
- Likelihood: favors values closer to current 4.35%, but with upward pressure from economic/Fed factors
- Posterior: shifts toward 4.50-4.60%, with the median around 4.55%

This posterior reflects that while the current level is 4.35%, the preponderance of evidence suggests some upward pressure on spreads by mid-November 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Overweighting recent data**: I may be anchoring too much to the current 4.35% level. Historical volatility in this metric suggests larger moves are possible.

2. **Underestimating tail risks**: The research mentions potential catalysts (jobs report, CPI data) that could cause significant moves in either direction.

3. **Neglecting seasonality**: Year-end positioning and liquidity factors might affect spreads in Q4 differently than other periods.

4. **Alternative scenario - Fed pivot**: If inflation data comes in surprisingly low, the Fed might signal a more dovish stance, which could cause spreads to tighten significantly.

5. **Alternative scenario - credit event**: A major high-yield issuer default could trigger contagion, pushing spreads much wider.

Given these considerations, I should widen my distribution to account for these possibilities, particularly on the upside where credit stress could escalate quickly.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Nov 10-21, 2025:

P10: 3.90
P20: 4.10
P40: 4.40
P60: 4.65
P80: 5.10
P90: 5.60

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "Periods of Economic Slowdown/Uncertainty," which includes 2011-2012, 2015-2016, and 2022-2023. The research report notes that in these periods, spreads typically range from 4.50% to 6.00%. This class is chosen because the provided context describes a "protracted slowdown," sticky inflation, and a hawkish Federal Reserve, all hallmarks of such periods. Based on this, I establish a prior distribution centered around a median of **4.75%**, reflecting a typical slowdown scenario. The distribution is assumed to be right-skewed, as credit crises lead to much larger spikes than economic improvements lead to tightening.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current environment, as described, mirrors past slowdowns with weakening GDP, cautious corporate guidance, and uncertainty around monetary policy. This validates the choice of the "Slowdown" reference class.

**Differences:**
- **"High for Longer" Fed Policy:** Unlike past slowdowns where the Fed was often cutting or poised to cut rates, the current Fed is on an extended pause at a high level due to persistent inflation. This sustained pressure on corporate financing is a key difference that likely prevents spreads from tightening significantly.
- **Starting Point:** The most recent OAS value is 4.35%. This is at the very low end of, or even slightly below, the typical 4.50%-6.00% range for the chosen reference class. This suggests the current market pricing reflects a *mild* slowdown or that other mitigating factors (like still-resilient corporate balance sheets) are keeping spreads in check for now.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Primary Evidence: Current OAS level of 4.35% (as of Oct 24, 2025).** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The forecast period is only 2-4 weeks away. Credit spreads exhibit significant persistence. This observation is highly consistent with a final value near 4.35% and less consistent with extreme values like 3.50% or 6.00% in the absence of a major shock. This evidence strongly pulls the forecast *down* from the prior's 4.75% median.
- **Recent News Flow (May-Oct 2025):** The timeline shows a consistent stream of negative news (slowing GDP, bank downgrades, hawkish Fed, cautious earnings). This explains why spreads are elevated at 4.35% compared to the "non-recessionary" median of 3.85%. However, this news is likely already priced in.
- **Upcoming Catalysts (Jobs & CPI reports in Nov):** These events introduce significant uncertainty and are the most likely drivers of a move away from the current 4.35% level. The risk appears balanced but skewed; a negative shock (stagflationary data) could cause a wider move up than a positive shock (soft-landing data) would cause a move down. This suggests the distribution around the new median should be wide and right-skewed.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** A distribution with a median of 4.75% (from the "Slowdown" reference class).
- **Likelihood:** The current market price of 4.35% is a very strong signal that the outcome will be near this level. This evidence has a high likelihood for outcomes around 4.35% and a low likelihood for outcomes far from it.
- **Posterior:** I update my prior by heavily weighting the recent market data. The posterior median should shift significantly from 4.75% towards 4.35%. A simple conceptual blend might be `(Prior Median * 20%) + (Current Value * 80%)`, leading to a posterior median around **4.45%**. This reflects the current market pricing while acknowledging that the negative macro backdrop and upcoming risk events create a slight upward pressure. The posterior distribution will be right-skewed, reflecting the asymmetric risk of spread widening.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
A key vulnerability is anchoring too heavily on the 4.35% value. A major catalyst before or during the resolution period could cause a sharp move.
- **Alternative Scenario (Bearish):** The recent negative data could have a cumulative effect, leading to a credit event (e.g., a major default, failure of a financial institution). The upcoming jobs/CPI reports could be much worse than expected, confirming stagflation and pushing spreads toward 5.50% or higher. This supports a fat right tail for the distribution.
- **Alternative Scenario (Bullish):** The upcoming data could be surprisingly positive (e.g., inflation falls sharply, jobs remain resilient), reigniting a "soft landing" narrative. This could cause a rally, tightening spreads back towards the long-term non-recessionary median of 3.85%. This supports a meaningful left tail.
- **Adjustment:** My initial thoughts seem to correctly incorporate these risks. The median is close to the current value, but the P80/P90 percentiles are further from the median than the P20/P10 percentiles, creating the necessary right-skew to account for the higher probability of a large upward move compared to a large downward move. The overall range from P10 to P90 is wide to reflect the uncertainty from the key data releases.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.70
P20: 3.90
P40: 4.25
P60: 4.65
P80: 5.25
P90: 5.80
