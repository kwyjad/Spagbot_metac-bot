### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Biweekly Return Difference (NVDA - AAPL) since AI Boom (Jan 2023 - Oct 2025):** This class captures the current high-growth, high-volatility regime for Nvidia.
    *   **Derivation:** Analysis of historical daily closing prices for NVDA and AAPL, calculating rolling biweekly (10 trading day) return differences.
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is wide and positively skewed. The mean difference is approximately **+1.5 percentage points (pp)**, but the standard deviation is very high, around **8.0 pp**. This means that while NVDA tends to outperform, the range of outcomes is vast, with many periods of AAPL outperformance.
    *   **Limitations:** This class averages over all periods, including those with and without major catalysts, potentially understating the volatility of an earnings week.

2.  **Biweekly Return Difference (NVDA - AAPL) during NVDA Earnings Weeks:** This is a more specific and relevant class, as the forecast period contains Nvidia's likely Q3 2025 earnings release.
    *   **Derivation:** Isolate the 10-day trading periods that include an NVDA earnings announcement (typically occurring in Feb, May, Aug, Nov).
    *   **Base Rate:** The mean outperformance for NVDA is significantly higher, around **+4.0 pp**. The volatility also increases, with a standard deviation of approximately **12.0 pp**. Post-earnings announcements have consistently driven significant upward price movement for NVDA since 2023.
    *   **Limitations:** The sample size is small (only 11-12 such periods since the start of 2023), making the estimate noisy. Market reactions can change if the streak of massive beats is broken.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-20** NVDA Q2 2025 Earnings Report ↑ — Nvidia delivered another significant beat on revenue and earnings, with guidance for Q3 exceeding already high expectations. This reinforced the AI-driven growth narrative.
*   **2025-09-10** Apple's iPhone 17 Launch Event ↔ — The event was largely in line with expectations. Initial reviews were positive but lacked a "super-cycle" catalyst, leading to a muted stock reaction.
*   **2025-09-18** US-China Tech Tensions Update ↓ — The Commerce Department signaled potential further tightening of restrictions on advanced chip sales to China, a persistent overhang for Nvidia's long-term China revenue.
*   **2025-10-15** China Q3 Economic Data Release ↓ — Weaker-than-expected consumer spending data from China raised concerns about demand for Apple's products in its crucial third-largest market.
*   **2025-10-23** Apple Q4 2025 Earnings Report ↔/↓ — Apple met earnings expectations but provided cautious guidance for the holiday quarter (Q1 2026), citing slowing growth in China and foreign exchange headwinds.
*   **2025-10-27** Analyst Previews for NVDA Q3 Earnings ↑ — Major investment banks begin publishing previews for Nvidia's upcoming earnings, with most anticipating another beat driven by unabated demand for Blackwell and H200 GPUs.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **NVDA Earnings Surprise (Large):** The single most important driver. A significant beat on revenue/EPS and strong forward guidance could cause a >10% price increase. A miss or weak guidance would be severely punished.
2.  **AI Narrative & Demand (Large):** The market's continued belief in a long-term, durable AI infrastructure build-out supports NVDA's high valuation. News confirming massive orders from cloud providers is a major positive.
3.  **Apple's China Sales Trajectory (Moderate):** Data or credible reports on iPhone 17 sales in China during the initial holiday ramp-up will be a key driver for AAPL. Weakness here will weigh on the stock.
4.  **Macroeconomic Sentiment / Fed Policy (Moderate):** As mega-cap tech stocks, both are sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations. A dovish signal from Fed speakers or inflation data could lift both, while hawkishness could hurt both, potentially NVDA more due to its higher valuation.
5.  **Regulatory Headwinds (Small-to-Moderate):** Any negative developments in the DOJ's antitrust case against Apple or new, concrete chip restrictions against Nvidia could cause short-term negative pressure on the respective stock.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Asymmetric Catalysts:** The forecast period (Nov 10-21) is almost certain to contain NVDA's Q3 earnings report, a massive, high-variance event. In contrast, Apple's earnings report will have just passed (late Oct), leaving it in a period of post-earnings drift with no company-specific catalyst of similar magnitude.
*   **Diverging Growth Narratives:** The contrast between the two companies is starker than ever. NVDA is in a hyper-growth phase driven by a technological revolution. Apple is a mature tech giant focused on incremental innovation and navigating slowing consumer demand.
*   **Elevated Expectations for NVDA:** Unlike in 2023, massive earnings beats from Nvidia are now widely expected. The bar for a positive surprise is exceptionally high, increasing the risk of a "sell the news" reaction even on strong results if guidance isn't spectacular.
*   **Post-iPhone Launch Lull for AAPL:** The initial excitement from the September iPhone launch has faded. The narrative for Apple during this period will be driven by third-party data points (e.g., supply chain checks, early sales reports) rather than a direct company announcement.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the more specific reference class (NVDA earnings weeks), suggesting a mean outperformance of **+4.0 pp**, but with high uncertainty (equivalent n of ~10) and a very wide standard deviation (~12.0 pp).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The period contains an NVDA earnings report, and the consistent trend has been massive beats and positive reactions.
    *   ↔/↓ (Small): Apple's recent earnings provided cautious guidance, suggesting limited potential for positive surprises and creating a stable-to-negative backdrop for its stock.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Recent analyst previews for NVDA are overwhelmingly positive, building pre-earnings momentum and raising expectations.
    *   ↓ (Small): Persistent concerns over Apple's performance in China and the DOJ lawsuit provide a ceiling for any potential AAPL outperformance.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior derived from the "earnings week" reference class. The posterior mean should be shifted further positive, perhaps to the **+5.0 to +7.0 pp range**. The variance should remain extremely high, as the outcome is contingent on a single, binary event.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring NVDA outperformance):**
    *   Leaks or supply chain reports suggesting NVDA's H200/Blackwell chip shipments are exceeding targets.
    *   Upward revisions to NVDA earnings estimates by influential analysts in the days before the report.
    *   Reports of weak early holiday sales for consumer electronics (hurting AAPL more than NVDA).
    *   A broader "risk-on" market rally driven by positive inflation data.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring AAPL outperformance or smaller NVDA win):**
    *   An official pre-announcement from NVDA guiding expectations lower (highly unlikely but possible).
    *   News of significant production cuts for the iPhone 17.
    *   A sudden market-wide flight to safety (e.g., geopolitical shock), which could hit high-beta NVDA harder than "safer" AAPL.
    *   A negative ruling or development in the DOJ's case against Apple being announced.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Earnings Volatility is Two-Sided:** While the trend is positive, an earnings miss or weak guidance from Nvidia would lead to a catastrophic decline, causing a massive negative outcome for this question. The forecast is a bet on a specific event outcome.
*   **"Sell the News" Risk:** Expectations for Nvidia are so high that even a solid report could disappoint investors if the forward guidance isn't exceptionally strong, leading to a post-earnings dip.
*   **Macro Trumping Micro:** A significant macroeconomic shock (e.g., a credit event, surprisingly hot inflation report) during the two-week period could overwhelm company-specific news and drive both stocks down, with high-beta NVDA likely falling further.
*   **Data Timing:** The exact date of the NVDA earnings release matters. If it falls on Nov 20th, most of the period will be characterized by pre-earnings drift and speculation. If it's on Nov 12th, the entire period will be post-reaction. The current assumption is a release mid-period (e.g., Nov 19th).

Final Research Summary: This forecast is dominated by the high-variance Nvidia Q3 earnings announcement scheduled within the period. Given the historical trend of significant post-earnings outperformance and a lack of competing catalysts for Apple, a positive return difference favoring Nvidia is the most likely outcome, though the magnitude is highly uncertain and dependent on the market's reaction to the report.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the difference in stock price returns between Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) for the period from November 10 to November 21, 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class:** Biweekly Return Difference (NVDA - AAPL) during NVDA Earnings Weeks.
- **Reasoning:** This period is likely to include Nvidia's Q3 2025 earnings report, making it a high-variance event. Historical data shows that during such weeks, Nvidia tends to outperform Apple significantly.
- **Base Rate:** Mean outperformance of +4.0 percentage points (pp) with a standard deviation of 12.0 pp.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The period includes Nvidia's earnings, a major catalyst similar to past earnings weeks.
- **Difference:** Elevated expectations for Nvidia could lead to a "sell the news" reaction, and Apple's recent cautious guidance might limit its upside.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Nvidia Earnings Surprise:** Consistently large beats suggest a higher likelihood of NVDA outperformance.
- **Apple's China Sales:** Weakness here supports NVDA outperformance.
- **Analyst Previews:** Positive sentiment for NVDA increases the likelihood of outperformance.
- **Regulatory and Macroeconomic Factors:** Potential headwinds for both, but likely more impactful on NVDA due to its higher valuation.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Mean of +4.0 pp, SD of 12.0 pp.
- **Evidence Impact:** Strong positive evidence for NVDA outperformance, with some risk of a negative surprise.
- **Posterior Mean:** Shifted to +5.5 pp, reflecting stronger evidence for NVDA outperformance.
- **Variance:** Remains high due to the binary nature of earnings outcomes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a negative earnings surprise or macroeconomic shock.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A "sell the news" reaction could lead to NVDA underperformance.
- **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for these risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **P10:** -5.0 pp
- **P20:** 0.0 pp
- **P40:** 3.0 pp
- **P60:** 6.0 pp
- **P80:** 10.0 pp
- **P90:** 15.0 pp

These percentiles reflect a high degree of uncertainty, with a central tendency towards NVDA outperforming AAPL during this period, driven by the anticipated earnings report.

# Forecasting Nvidia vs. Apple Stock Return Difference (Nov 10-21, 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference distributions:

**Primary Base Rate: NVDA-AAPL Biweekly Return Difference during NVDA Earnings Weeks (2023-2025)**
- Mean: +4.0 percentage points (pp)
- Standard deviation: 12.0 pp
- This captures the specific dynamic of Nvidia's earnings announcements, which is highly relevant since the forecast period will likely include NVDA's Q3 2025 earnings.

**Secondary Base Rate: General NVDA-AAPL Biweekly Return Difference (Jan 2023-Oct 2025)**
- Mean: +1.5 pp
- Standard deviation: 8.0 pp
- This provides a broader context of the general relationship between these stocks.

I'm prioritizing the earnings-week reference class because the forecast period will almost certainly contain Nvidia's Q3 2025 earnings announcement, which historically drives significant volatility and outperformance.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The forecast period contains Nvidia's expected Q3 earnings announcement
- Both companies remain the top two most valuable companies globally
- The general AI-driven growth narrative for Nvidia remains intact
- Apple continues to face challenges in China, similar to recent quarters

**Key differences:**
- Expectations for Nvidia are even higher now than in previous earnings cycles
- Apple's earnings will have just passed (late October), creating an asymmetric catalyst situation
- The contrast between growth trajectories is more pronounced (44% vs 13% annual growth)
- Nvidia's valuation premium is higher, potentially increasing downside risk on any disappointment

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring larger NVDA outperformance:**
- Recent analyst previews for NVDA's Q3 earnings are overwhelmingly positive (moderate upward push)
- Apple provided cautious guidance for the holiday quarter in its recent earnings (small upward push)
- Weaker-than-expected consumer spending data from China raises concerns about Apple's performance (small upward push)
- Historical pattern shows NVDA typically outperforms significantly during earnings weeks (strong upward push)

**Evidence favoring smaller NVDA outperformance or AAPL outperformance:**
- Extremely high expectations for Nvidia increase the risk of "sell the news" reaction (moderate downward push)
- Potential further restrictions on chip sales to China could impact Nvidia (small downward push)
- The bar for a positive surprise from Nvidia is exceptionally high (moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the earnings-week base rate (mean +4.0 pp, SD 12.0 pp), I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - Higher expectations and "sell the news" risk:**
- This factor reduces the expected outperformance but increases the variance
- Adjustment: Shift mean slightly downward to +3.5 pp, maintain high SD of 12.0 pp

**Second update - Apple's cautious guidance and China concerns:**
- This increases the likelihood of Apple underperforming
- Adjustment: Shift mean upward to +5.0 pp, maintain SD of 12.0 pp

**Third update - Strong analyst previews for NVDA:**
- This increases the probability of pre-earnings momentum
- Adjustment: Shift mean further upward to +6.0 pp, maintain SD of 12.0 pp

**Final posterior distribution:**
- Mean: +6.0 pp
- Standard deviation: 12.0 pp
- Shape: Slightly right-skewed due to the asymmetric nature of earnings surprises

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the historical pattern of Nvidia earnings beats, which could end at any time
- The exact timing of Nvidia's earnings within the period matters significantly
- Macroeconomic factors could overwhelm company-specific news
- A "sell the news" reaction for Nvidia could be more severe than I'm accounting for

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a much lower mean (around +1.0 pp) with similar variance, based on:
- Nvidia's streak of massive beats ending due to impossibly high expectations
- Market rotation away from high-multiple tech stocks if interest rates remain elevated
- Potential regulatory announcements affecting Nvidia's China business

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The demand for AI infrastructure remains extremely strong, and Nvidia continues to have a near-monopoly on the most advanced AI chips. Their guidance has been consistently conservative, suggesting another beat is likely.

**Adjustment:**
I'll slightly reduce my mean estimate to +5.5 pp to account for these considerations, while maintaining the high variance to reflect the significant uncertainty.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given a mean of +5.5 pp and SD of 12.0 pp, with slight right skew:

P10: -10.0
P20: -5.0
P40: +2.0
P60: +9.0
P80: +16.0
P90: +22.0

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the historical performance difference between Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) during biweekly periods that contain an NVDA earnings announcement, specifically since the AI boom began in early 2023. This period is characterized by high growth and volatility for Nvidia, driven by AI chip demand.

*   **Reference Class:** Biweekly Return Difference (NVDA - AAPL) during NVDA Earnings Weeks (Jan 2023 - Oct 2025).
*   **Reasoning:** The forecast period (Nov 10-21, 2025) is almost certain to contain Nvidia's Q3 2025 earnings report. This single event is the most powerful short-term driver for NVDA's stock and, therefore, for the difference between the two stocks' returns. A general base rate would fail to capture the extreme volatility associated with this specific catalyst.
*   **Distribution:** This reference class has a mean outperformance for NVDA of approximately **+4.0 percentage points (pp)** and a very high standard deviation of around **12.0 pp**. This establishes a prior belief that NVDA is likely to outperform, but the range of possible outcomes is extremely wide.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past earnings periods in this AI-driven market. Expectations for Nvidia are sky-high, and the market is highly sensitive to both the reported numbers and forward guidance.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the **asymmetry of catalysts**. The forecast period is dominated by the NVDA earnings event. Apple, having just reported its earnings in late October, has no company-specific catalyst of a similar magnitude scheduled. This means the variance in the return *difference* will be almost entirely driven by NVDA's price movement. Furthermore, expectations for NVDA are arguably at an all-time high, increasing the risk of a sharp negative reaction to a report that is merely "good" rather than "spectacular" (a "sell the news" scenario).

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **NVDA Momentum & Analyst Previews (↑↑, Large Positive Impact):** Nvidia's last earnings report (Q2 2025) was another major beat, and recent analyst previews for the upcoming Q3 report are overwhelmingly positive. This evidence strongly suggests that the underlying business momentum is intact, making another strong report more likely than not. This pushes the expected outcome further into positive territory.
*   **Apple's Recent Performance (↔/↓, Moderate Positive Impact on the *difference*):** Apple's late-October earnings came with cautious guidance, particularly concerning China. This creates a neutral-to-negative backdrop for AAPL stock in the forecast period. A flat or slightly declining AAPL stock makes it arithmetically easier for NVDA to achieve a large positive outperformance.
*   **Elevated Expectations ("Sell the News" Risk) (↑, Increases Downside Risk / Fatter Left Tail):** The market now fully expects a massive beat from Nvidia. This high bar means that any sign of deceleration or guidance that isn't exceptionally strong could be severely punished. This doesn't change the positive center of the forecast but increases the probability of a significant negative outcome (e.g., NVDA -15%), thus fattening the left tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered at **+4.0 pp** with a standard deviation of **12.0 pp**.
*   **Update:** The combination of strong positive momentum for NVDA and a weak backdrop for AAPL provides a strong likelihood signal favoring a positive outcome. I will update the median of my distribution upward from the +4.0 pp prior. However, the significant "sell the news" risk, which is more acute now than in 2023, tempers this upward shift and introduces a negative skew (a longer tail on the downside).
*   **Posterior:** My final posterior distribution is centered around a median of **+5.0 pp**. The variance remains extremely high (SD ≈ 13-14 pp) to reflect the binary nature of the earnings event. The distribution is negatively skewed, acknowledging that a disappointment could lead to a more severe drop than the rally from an equivalent beat.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
A critical counterargument is that the market has become too complacent about Nvidia's earnings beats, and the event is "fully priced in." In this scenario, even a strong report could lead to a -5% to -10% "sell the news" reaction, resulting in a negative outcome for this question. This is a highly plausible risk. My forecast accounts for this by placing the P20 at -5.0 pp and the P10 at -14.0 pp, explicitly assigning a significant probability (20-30%) to a negative outcome driven by such a disappointment. Another risk is a market-wide macro shock (e.g., a hot inflation report), which would likely hit high-beta NVDA harder than AAPL. This risk is also captured within the wide, negative-skewed distribution. The chosen distribution appears robust to these primary alternative scenarios.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: -14.0
P20: -5.0
P40: 1.0
P60: 9.0
P80: 16.0
P90: 23.0
