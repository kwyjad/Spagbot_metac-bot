### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major German Coalition Government Bills:** Bills formally proposed by the cabinet of a governing coalition have a very high passage rate, likely **85-95%**. Governments do not typically introduce flagship legislation they expect to fail, as it signals weakness and instability. This class represents the baseline expectation of government efficacy.
2.  **Controversial Fiscal/Social Reforms with Internal Party Dissent:** This is a more specific and relevant class. Major reforms touching on long-term fiscal commitments (like pensions) often face internal opposition. The success rate here is lower, perhaps in the **60-75%** range. The dissent from the CDU's own Youth Wing (Junge Union) places this bill squarely in this category.
3.  **Legislation Passed Under Extreme Time Pressure (e.g., year-end):** Bills rushed through the legislative process in the final weeks of the year face procedural hurdles and increased risk of failure due to unforeseen delays or political maneuvering. The base rate for successful passage on the original timeline might be **70-80%**, as the urgency also focuses political will.

*Reasoning:* The most appropriate reference class is #2, given the explicit and organized internal rebellion. A starting prior should be anchored in this range, reflecting that while passage is more likely than not, failure is a significant possibility.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-28] Coalition announces a compromise to quell the CDU youth wing rebellion. ↑ — This is the most significant event, directly addressing the primary obstacle to passage by promising a future reform commission, providing political cover for rebels to support the bill.
*   [2025-11-28] Chancellor Merz publicly states he "expects approval" and stands firm on the bill. ↑ — Signals that the Chancellor is staking his political capital on the bill's success, increasing pressure on his party members to fall in line.
*   [2025-11-25] The Junge Union (JU) publicly calls for comprehensive negotiations, highlighting the rebellion's seriousness. ↓ — This established the initial high risk of failure due to the government's slim 12-seat majority being smaller than the JU's 18-member bloc.
*   [2025-11-18] The United Services Union (ver.di) urges finalization of the reform in 2025 to prevent a pension level drop in 2026. ↑ — This adds external pressure from a key stakeholder (trade unions) and reinforces the government's tight deadline, potentially forcing a resolution.
*   [2025-08-06] The Federal Cabinet formally approves the pension reform package, including Aktivrente. ↑ — This marked the official start of the legislative process, demonstrating the coalition's unified intent at the leadership level.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Coalition Discipline & Survival (Large ↑):** The CDU/CSU and SPD coalition's stability rests on passing key agenda items. A failure on a central social policy bill would be a major crisis. Leadership will exert immense pressure to ensure passage.
2.  **Junge Union (JU) Rebellion (Large ↓):** The JU's opposition is ideological, based on long-term fiscal sustainability. With 18 members, they have the numbers to defeat the bill if they vote as a bloc and no opposition members cross the aisle.
3.  **The "Compromise" Face-Saving Mechanism (Large ↑):** The agreement to form a commission for future reforms is a classic political tool to defuse internal dissent without changing the immediate bill. It allows rebels to claim a victory and vote for the package.
4.  **Legislative Calendar & Timeline (Moderate ↓):** The deadline of Jan 1, 2026 (for implementation) leaves less than one month. The Christmas parliamentary recess further compresses the timeline. Any procedural delay in the Bundestag or Bundesrat could push enactment past the resolution date.
5.  **SPD Commitment (Moderate ↑):** Pension security is a core issue for the Social Democrats. They are a crucial part of the coalition and will resist any attempts to weaken the package, making it less likely the bill is withdrawn or fundamentally altered.
6.  **Aktivrente's Low Salience (Small ↑):** The primary controversy surrounds the 48% pension level guarantee, not the Aktivrente. The Aktivrente is a relatively minor, supply-side reform that is less ideologically contentious. It is unlikely to be the reason the bill fails.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Slim Majority:** The government's 12-seat majority is unusually small for a German Grand Coalition, making it highly vulnerable to small, organized factions like the JU.
*   **Intra-Party Generational Conflict:** The dissent is not typical horse-trading but a fundamental, generational conflict over fiscal priorities within the leading government party, making it harder to resolve with simple concessions.
*   **Specific Clause vs. Whole Package:** The question is about a specific, relatively uncontroversial clause (Aktivrente) within a highly controversial legislative package. Its fate is tied to the larger bill, which is an unusual forecasting dynamic.
*   **Nature of the Compromise:** The compromise is a "promise" of future action (a commission), not a substantive change to the current bill. Its effectiveness depends entirely on whether the rebels trust the leadership to follow through.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on a major bill with internal dissent, a prior of P=0.70 (with an equivalent n of ~10 to represent moderate confidence) seems reasonable.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The late-November compromise deal directly targets the main failure mechanism (the JU rebellion) and is the strongest piece of evidence for eventual passage.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The public commitment of the Chancellor and the backing of the SPD partner show high-level political will to push the bill through.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The extremely tight timeline before the Jan 3, 2026 deadline remains a significant, non-political risk factor. A procedural snag could cause failure.
    *   (↔) The lack of controversy around the Aktivrente clause itself means it's unlikely to be stripped out. Its probability is therefore tightly coupled with the overall package's success.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the compromise, strongly mitigates the primary risk identified in the base rate. The posterior should move significantly upwards from the prior, though the timeline risk prevents it from approaching certainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements of support for the compromise from the JU's leadership.
    *   The bill being successfully scheduled for its second and third readings in the Bundestag before the Christmas recess.
    *   The SPD defending the compromise against criticism from its left wing.
    *   No significant objections being raised by the Bundesrat (the Federal Council).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A significant number of JU members publicly stating the compromise is insufficient.
    *   Procedural delays or the bill being pushed off the December parliamentary agenda.
    *   Attempts by the opposition to split the bill to vote on the Aktivrente separately.
    *   The Bundesrat signaling it will send the bill to a mediation committee, which would delay enactment.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Specificity:** The question resolves "No" if the main pension package passes but the Aktivrente clause is removed in a last-minute deal. While unlikely, this remains a possibility.
*   **Timeline is Absolute:** The deadline is Jan 3, 2026. A successful passage on Jan 4, 2026, resolves as "No". The legislative process can be unpredictable, and a short delay for any reason is a critical failure risk.
*   **Fictional Premise:** The analysis is based on the provided background and sources, which describe a hypothetical 2025 political situation. It assumes the actors and pressures behave as described.
*   **Bundesrat's Role:** The power of the Bundesrat is a potential uncertainty. If the law requires its formal consent (as fiscal matters often do), opposition-led states could block or delay it, a factor not fully detailed in the provided sources.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this event is the passage rate for controversial fiscal/social reforms with internal party dissent, which is estimated to be in the 60-75% range. This is because the Aktivrente is part of a broader pension reform package that faces internal opposition, particularly from the CDU's Youth Wing. Therefore, I will use a prior probability of 70% for the event occurring.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation aligns with the base case of controversial reforms with internal dissent, as the bill faces opposition from within the governing coalition.
   - Differences: The recent compromise to address the CDU Youth Wing's concerns and the Chancellor's public commitment to the bill are significant developments that could increase the likelihood of passage compared to a typical case of internal dissent.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Compromise with CDU Youth Wing: This increases the likelihood of passage as it directly addresses the main obstacle. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Chancellor's Public Commitment: This also increases the likelihood as it indicates strong political will. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Tight Legislative Timeline: This decreases the likelihood due to potential procedural delays. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - SPD's Support: Increases likelihood as it ensures coalition backing. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Low Controversy of Aktivrente: Neutral, as it is unlikely to be the reason for failure. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.70 / (1 - 0.70) = 2.33
   - Considering the evidence, particularly the compromise and political commitment, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1. Let's assume a combined likelihood ratio of 1.5 for simplification.
   - Posterior odds = 2.33 × 1.5 = 3.495
   - Posterior probability = 3.495 / (1 + 3.495) ≈ 0.777 or 77.7%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The tight timeline remains a significant risk, and procedural delays could still derail the bill.
   - Alternative Scenario: If the compromise fails to satisfy the CDU Youth Wing, the bill could still fail. However, the political cost of failure is high, which should motivate resolution.
   - Adjustments: Given the timeline risk, a slight downward adjustment might be prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is adjusted slightly downward to account for the timeline risk.

Final: 75%

# Will Germany enact the Aktivrente before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of a specific government bill passing within a given timeframe.

The most relevant reference class is "Controversial fiscal/social reforms with internal party dissent in Germany." Based on the background information, this bill:
- Has been approved by the Federal Cabinet
- Faces opposition from the CDU's Youth Wing
- Has a tight timeline (needs to pass before January 1, 2026)
- Is part of a larger pension reform package

Looking at similar cases of major German legislation with internal party opposition, a reasonable base rate would be around 70%. This reflects that:
- Government-proposed bills generally have a high passage rate (>80%)
- Internal party dissent significantly reduces this probability
- The slim 12-seat majority makes the coalition vulnerable to the 18-member Youth Wing

**Prior probability: 70%** (or odds of 7:3)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a government-sponsored bill with cabinet approval
- It follows the standard German legislative process (Cabinet → Bundestag → Bundesrat)
- It has a defined implementation date (January 1, 2026)

**Key differences:**
- The government coalition has an unusually slim majority (12 seats)
- The Youth Wing opposition (18 members) is numerically sufficient to block the bill
- A compromise has been announced to address the rebellion
- The timeline is extremely tight (less than a month remaining)
- The Aktivrente is part of a larger, more controversial pension package

These differences suggest both positive and negative adjustments to the base rate, with the compromise being a significant positive factor but the timeline being a significant negative factor.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: The compromise to quell the CDU youth wing rebellion**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the bill will pass, we would expect to see compromise efforts
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if the bill will fail, compromise attempts would be made
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This evidence significantly increases the probability of passage

**Evidence 2: Chancellor Merz's public statement expecting approval**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If the bill will pass, the Chancellor would express confidence
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if uncertain, the Chancellor would likely project confidence
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Extremely tight timeline before January 2026**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Successful bills can still face tight timelines
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Failed bills often run out of time
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.625
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: The Aktivrente being a less controversial part of the package**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If passing, less controversial elements are unlikely to be removed
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If failing, it would likely be due to the more controversial elements
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.0
- This substantially increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 7:3 (70% probability):

**Update on the compromise:**
- Prior odds: 7:3 = 2.33
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 2.33 × 2.25 = 5.24
- Posterior probability: 5.24/(1+5.24) = 84%

**Update on the tight timeline:**
- Prior odds: 5.24
- Likelihood ratio: 0.625
- Posterior odds: 5.24 × 0.625 = 3.28
- Posterior probability: 3.28/(1+3.28) = 77%

After considering all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 77%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the effectiveness of the compromise. Political promises of future commissions don't always satisfy rebels.
- The Bundesrat's role is unclear. If formal consent is required, opposition-led states could block or delay the bill.
- Procedural delays are common in legislative processes, especially for complex bills.
- The Christmas parliamentary recess further compresses the timeline.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The bill passes but with the Aktivrente provision removed as a concession (resolves as No)
- The bill passes the Bundestag but gets delayed in the Bundesrat until after January 3, 2026 (resolves as No)
- The Youth Wing accepts the compromise but demands procedural delays for "proper consideration" (resolves as No)

Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability downward to account for these procedural and timeline risks.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the evidence, and the red team analysis, I believe the probability of Germany enacting the Aktivrente before 2026 is 72%.

The compromise significantly increases the chances of passage, but the extremely tight timeline and procedural uncertainties create substantial risk of delay beyond January 3, 2026.

Final: 72%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the enactment of a specific legislative provision, the "Aktivrente," which is part of a larger, more controversial government bill. The most appropriate reference class is not just any government bill, but specifically "controversial fiscal or social reforms facing organized internal party dissent."

-   **Reference Class:** Major German government bills with significant internal opposition.
-   **Reasoning:** While most government-sponsored bills in Germany pass (a base rate of perhaps 85-95%), this bill faces a rebellion from the CDU's own youth wing (Junge Union) that is large enough to defeat the bill given the coalition's slim 12-seat majority. This internal dissent is the primary source of risk, making it the defining characteristic for our reference class. Historically, such bills have a lower but still better-than-even chance of passage.
-   **Prior Probability:** I will set the prior probability at **P(H) = 70%**. This reflects the general tendency for governing coalitions to ultimately enforce discipline and pass their key legislation, while acknowledging the substantial risk of failure (30%) posed by the internal rebellion. This corresponds to prior odds of 70:30, or 2.33 to 1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
-   **Similarities:** The situation aligns well with the base case of a controversial bill facing internal dissent. The leadership is applying pressure, and the dissent is organized around a core ideological issue (long-term fiscal sustainability).
-   **Differences:**
    -   **Slimmer Majority:** The coalition's 12-seat majority is unusually small, making it more vulnerable than a typical grand coalition. The rebel faction (18 members) is larger than the majority, which increases the risk compared to the base case.
    -   **Strict Deadline:** The "before 2026" resolution criteria is absolute. Failure is not just the bill being voted down, but also any procedural delay (e.g., in the Bundesrat) that pushes enactment into January 2026. This adds a significant failure mode not always present in the general reference class.
    -   **Specific Clause:** The question is about the *Aktivrente* clause, not the whole package. This clause is reportedly not the main point of contention. This means its fate is almost entirely tied to the overall package. There is a very small risk it could be stripped out in a last-minute compromise, but the primary risk is the failure of the entire bill.

These differences, particularly the slim majority and the tight deadline, suggest this specific case may be slightly more difficult than the average for our reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key developments, focusing on how they alter the probability from the 70% prior.

-   **Evidence 1: The JU Rebellion (Negative, already incorporated in prior):** The existence of an 18-member rebellion against a 12-seat majority is the core reason for choosing a lower prior of 70% instead of a higher one (~90%).

-   **Evidence 2: The Compromise Deal (Strongly Positive):** On Nov 28, a compromise was announced to create a future reform commission.
    -   P(E | H): This is highly likely. If a controversial bill is to pass, a face-saving compromise that gives rebels political cover is a very common mechanism.
    -   P(E | ~H): This is less likely. If the bill were doomed, it's plausible leadership wouldn't find a workable compromise or that the one they offered would be rejected as insufficient.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly greater than 1. This is the strongest piece of evidence and substantially *increases* the probability of passage. It directly addresses the primary failure risk.

-   **Evidence 3: Chancellor Merz's Public Stance (Moderately Positive):** The Chancellor has publicly stated he "expects approval," staking his political capital on the bill.
    -   This increases the pressure on rebels to fall in line and signals that the leadership will use all its tools to ensure passage. This evidence moderately *increases* the probability.

-   **Evidence 4: The Tight Legislative Timeline (Moderately Negative):** The bill must pass both the Bundestag and Bundesrat before the end of the year, which includes a Christmas recess.
    -   This is a persistent risk factor. Even with political agreement, procedural tactics or legitimate delays in the Bundesrat could cause the deadline to be missed. This evidence *decreases* the probability of success, acting as a cap on how high the forecast can go.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will start with the prior and update based on the evidence.

-   **Prior Odds:** 2.33 to 1 (70%).
-   **Update for the Compromise:** The compromise deal is the most crucial new fact. It provides a plausible path to victory by giving the rebels a reason to back down. This is a strong update. I estimate this evidence makes success at least twice as likely. Let's use a likelihood ratio of 2.
    -   **Posterior Odds:** 2.33 × 2.0 = 4.66 to 1.
    -   **New Probability:** 4.66 / (1 + 4.66) ≈ 82%.

This 82% represents the probability of securing the necessary political votes. However, it does not account for the procedural and timeline risks. I estimate there is a significant chance (perhaps 15%) of failure due to procedural delays alone, especially with the potential for the Bundesrat to send the bill to a mediation committee.

-   **Final Adjustment for Timeline Risk:** P(Success) = P(Political Success) × P(Procedural Success | Political Success)
    -   P(Success) = 0.82 × (1 - 0.15) = 0.82 × 0.85 ≈ 0.697.

This calculation seems to have discounted the compromise too heavily, bringing me back below my prior. A better approach is to model the scenarios.

Let's model two key uncertainties:
1.  Will the compromise deal hold and placate the rebels? (Political Risk)
2.  If it holds, will the bill pass the legislative process in time? (Procedural Risk)

-   I estimate an 85% chance the deal holds. It was likely announced after back-channel assurances.
-   If the deal holds, I estimate an 85% chance of clearing procedural hurdles in time. The Bundesrat is a real risk.
-   If the deal *fails* (15% chance), the government must scramble, and the chance of passage before 2026 is low, perhaps 20%.

-   **Calculation:** (0.85 × 0.85) + (0.15 × 0.20) = 0.7225 + 0.03 = 0.7525.

This calculation feels more robust. It results in a posterior probability of **75%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 75% could be wrong if I am overestimating the strength of the compromise. The JU's opposition is described as ideological, and a "promise of a future commission" is a classic political trick that they might see through and reject. If the rebellion holds firm, the bill is very likely to fail, and my probability is too high. Conversely, I might be overestimating the procedural risk. For a high-priority government bill, the legislative process can be expedited, and the Bundesrat may not choose to pick a fight and delay the bill. In that case, the probability should be closer to 85-90%. The 75% forecast sits between these two possibilities, acknowledging the compromise as a major positive development but retaining a 1-in-4 chance of failure due to the combination of the deal's potential fragility and the tight, unforgiving timeline.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a controversial bill like this is around 70%. The announcement of a compromise deal specifically designed to quell the internal rebellion is a strong piece of positive evidence. However, the risk that this face-saving measure is not enough for the ideologically-driven rebels, combined with the very tight "before 2026" deadline and potential for procedural delays in the Bundesrat, keeps the probability from going higher. My final assessment balances these factors.

Final: 75%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event is drawn from the reference class of "Controversial Fiscal/Social Reforms with Internal Party Dissent" in Germany, as outlined in the research report. This class includes major reforms involving long-term fiscal commitments like pensions, where internal opposition (e.g., from party factions) is common and reduces the success rate compared to standard government bills. Historical data and analogies (e.g., past pension or welfare reforms under coalitions facing dissent, such as the Hartz reforms or recent debt brake debates) suggest a passage rate of 60-75%. I choose a midpoint prior of 70% (or odds of 7:3, equivalent to 2.33:1) because it reflects the balance of government motivation to pass flagship legislation against the real risk of failure due to organized internal rebellion, as seen in similar cases where bills like the 2014 pension reforms faced but overcame youth and fiscal conservative pushback. This prior is anchored with moderate confidence (equivalent n ~10, implying it's not overly precise but grounded in a handful of comparable events).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that it involves a major coalition-backed social reform (pension package) with ideological dissent from within the governing party (CDU's Youth Wing, or Junge Union, opposing on fiscal sustainability grounds), much like past German reforms where intra-party conflicts arose over long-term costs (e.g., the 2001 Riester pension reform or 2018 adjustments, which passed despite grumbling). The coalition's slim majority (12 seats) and the bill's fiscal implications align with cases where success hinged on party discipline.

However, it differs in key ways: The dissent here is unusually organized and generational (youth vs. older leadership), with the JU's 18 members potentially outnumbering the majority margin, making it more precarious than typical horse-trading. Additionally, the extremely tight timeline (must pass by end-2025 for Jan 1, 2026 effect, with Christmas recess looming) adds procedural risk not always present in base cases. The recent compromise (promising a future reform commission) is a positive difference, as it provides a face-saving exit for rebels, similar to but more targeted than concessions in past reforms. These differences matter: The slim majority and timeline increase downside risk (lowering probability), while the compromise mitigates the core dissent (raising it), suggesting an upward adjustment from the base rate but with lingering uncertainty.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I'll evaluate key pieces of evidence from the background and research report, focusing on likelihood ratios (LR = P(E | H) / P(E | ~H), where H is "Aktivrente enacted before 2026").

- **Compromise to quell JU rebellion (2025-11-28)**: This is highly likely if H (P(E | H) ≈ 0.9, as compromises are common in successful passages to unify parties) but less likely if ~H (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.3, as failed bills often lack such resolutions and descend into gridlock). LR ≈ 3 (strong evidence increasing probability).
- **Chancellor Merz's public expectation of approval (2025-11-28)**: Likely if H (P(E | H) ≈ 0.8, leaders stake capital on wins) but somewhat likely even if ~H (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.4, as bluster can precede failures). LR ≈ 2 (moderate increase).
- **Tight timeline and procedural risks (e.g., Christmas recess, Bundesrat approval)**: Somewhat likely if H (P(E | H) ≈ 0.6, urgency can focus efforts) but more likely if ~H (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.8, delays often doom rushed bills). LR ≈ 0.75 (moderate decrease).
- **Low controversy around Aktivrente specifically**: Likely if H (P(E | H) ≈ 0.95, uncontroversial clauses survive in packages) but still possible if ~H (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.7, as clauses can be stripped in deals). LR ≈ 1.36 (small increase).
- **External pressure from unions (e.g., ver.di urging finalization)**: Likely if H (P(E | H) ≈ 0.7, stakeholders push for success) but neutral if ~H (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0.5). LR ≈ 1.4 (small increase).

Overall, the evidence leans positive, with the compromise as the strongest updater, though timeline risks pull against it.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior probability P(H) = 0.70 (prior odds = 0.7 / 0.3 = 2.33:1).

For an explicit update, I'll combine the major pieces into a net likelihood ratio, focusing on the compromise (LR=3) as the primary evidence, moderated by timeline risk (LR=0.75), and smaller positives (net LR≈1.5 from others). Conceptual net LR ≈ 3 * 0.75 * 1.5 ≈ 3.375.

Posterior odds = prior odds * net LR = 2.33 * 3.375 ≈ 7.87:1.  
Posterior probability = 7.87 / (1 + 7.87) ≈ 0.887 (88.7%).

This update reflects a significant upward shift due to the compromise addressing the JU rebellion (the main failure mode), but tempered by timeline uncertainty and the possibility of the Aktivrente clause being removed (though low). The posterior remains uncertain (not near 100%) due to procedural tail risks and the compromise's reliance on trust, with confidence equivalent to a wider distribution (e.g., 80-95% range).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the compromise's effectiveness—it's a "promise" of a future commission, not a binding change, and if JU members distrust leadership (as in some past rebellions like the 2010 CDU nuclear policy fights), it could fail to sway them, potentially dropping the probability to 60-70%. Blind spots include underestimating Bundesrat opposition (if states block it, as in some fiscal bills), or unforeseen events like a coalition crisis unrelated to pensions. Tail risks: A procedural delay past Jan 3 (e.g., mediation committee) could resolve as No even if it eventually passes (10-15% chance), or Aktivrente stripped in a last-ditch deal (5% chance). An alternative forecast of 75% might be plausible if weighting timeline risks higher, as rushed year-end bills have failed before (e.g., some 2020 COVID measures delayed). Rebuttal: The Chancellor's stake and coalition survival incentives make failure less likely than in non-flagship cases. Adjusting for this, I widen my implicit uncertainty, nudging the point estimate down slightly to 85% to avoid overconfidence.

Final: 85%
