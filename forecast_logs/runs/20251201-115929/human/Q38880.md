### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New International Environmental/Technology Treaties:** This class includes agreements like the Minamata Convention on Mercury, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, or the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Typically, the process from initial high-level political calls to a treaty being open for signature takes 2-5 years. Once open, achieving 35 signatories can be fast *if the groundwork is laid*. The Ottawa Treaty (landmines) got 122 signatures on its first day, but that followed years of intense campaigning (the "Ottawa Process"). **The base rate for a treaty going from a "call for an agreement" to having >34 binding commitments within a year is very low (<5%). The base rate for this happening in one month is near 0%.**
2.  **Pre-emptive Technology Bans:** This class includes treaties that ban a technology before it is widely developed or deployed, such as the aforementioned Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. These often garner support from a large number of non-possessor states but are opposed or ignored by states developing the technology. They can achieve the requisite number of signatories from a "coalition of the willing." However, the timeline from proposal to entry into force is still measured in years, not weeks.
3.  **UN General Assembly (UNGA) or Environment Assembly (UNEA) Resolutions:** These are not treaties but represent political commitments. A resolution can be drafted and passed much more quickly than a treaty. However, the question specifies a "treaty obligation," which is a much higher and legally binding bar than a resolution. The base rate for a resolution on a contentious topic getting >34 co-sponsors is high, but this is not the right class for a "treaty obligation."

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-17] AMCEN reaffirms its call for a non-use agreement, building on its 2023 position. A source claims this represents nearly 60 countries. **↑** — This confirms a large, cohesive bloc of nations (the African Union has 55 members) is the primary engine for a potential pact.
*   [2025-09-24] A *Frontiers in* article highlights growing scientific and political support, framing the AMCEN decision as part of a global resistance. **↑** — Reinforces the political momentum and narrative-building from the Global South and allied academics.
*   [2025-03-05] CIEL report emphasizes that a restrictive governance framework (e.g., CBD moratorium) already exists and momentum for a non-use treaty is growing. **↑** — Shows sustained advocacy and the leveraging of existing, albeit weaker, international norms.
*   [2024-09-26] Reports note that momentum is building beyond Africa, with support from Latin America, Pacific, and European nations (via Parliament resolution). **↑** — Suggests the coalition is broadening beyond a single continent, which is necessary to reach the 35-country threshold.
*   [2024-02-29] At UNEA-6, nations failed to agree on a path forward for Solar Radiation Modification (SRM), with a Swiss proposal for a research group being withdrawn amid opposition from the African Group and others who favored a non-use pact. **↓** — This is a critical counter-signal. It demonstrates that while the pro-ban coalition is strong enough to block weaker proposals, it has not yet achieved the global consensus needed to pass its own binding treaty in a universal forum like the UN. It highlights a clear diplomatic stalemate between major blocs.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Global South Cohesion (Large ↑):** The unified position of the African Group (via AMCEN), supported by other Global South nations, is the primary driver. They fear disproportionate negative impacts and governance dominated by the Global North. This provides a ready-made bloc of 50+ potential signatories.
2.  **Pace of International Law (Large ↓):** The process of drafting, negotiating, vetting, and signing a legally binding treaty is exceptionally slow. With only one month remaining until the deadline, the procedural and diplomatic hurdles are immense, making this the most powerful driver against a "Yes" resolution.
3.  **"Keep Options Open" Strategy by Major Powers (Moderate ↓):** Countries with significant scientific establishments (e.g., US, potentially China, Switzerland) are hesitant to support a stringent ban that includes research and patents. Their opposition or non-participation can stall progress in global forums like UNEA and discourage allies from signing on.
4.  **Advocacy from NGOs and Academia (Moderate ↑):** The "Non-Use Agreement" initiative, backed by hundreds of academics and civil society organizations like CIEL, provides draft language, moral suasion, and political pressure, which helps cohere the pro-ban coalition.
5.  **Lack of a Focusing Event (Moderate ↓):** There has been no "rogue" solar geoengineering experiment or climate-related cataclysm explicitly blamed on the lack of mitigation. Without a crisis to force the issue, the default is diplomatic inertia.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Time Compression:** The most significant difference is the one-month horizon. The base rate for treaty formation operates on a multi-year timescale. This question requires a process to conclude in weeks, which is virtually unprecedented for a new, binding international agreement.
*   **Pre-emptive Nature:** Unlike treaties on mercury or landmines that addressed existing, tangible problems, this pact aims to ban a technology that is still largely theoretical. This creates a different dynamic, pitting precautionary principles against arguments for research freedom.
*   **A Pre-Formed, Cohesive Bloc:** The existence of the African Group as a unified and vocal proponent is unusual. Often, treaty negotiations involve building a coalition from scratch. Here, a large coalition already exists, which could theoretically accelerate the process if a pathway opened up.
*   **High Bar for Stringency:** The resolution criteria are exceptionally strict, including bans on research funding and patents. Many environmental treaties contain carve-outs or focus only on deployment. This high stringency makes it harder to achieve broad consensus compared to a less restrictive agreement.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the reference class of international treaty formation. The procedural impossibility of drafting, negotiating, and getting 35 binding commitments in one month is the overwhelming factor. (Equivalent n > 50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Strong, unified political momentum from a large bloc of ~55-60 nations in the Global South (AMCEN and allies). This provides a potential pool of signatories.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The demonstrated stalemate at UNEA-6 in early 2024 shows that this bloc, while powerful, cannot (yet) overcome opposition from key states to establish a global regime.
    *   **↓ (Very Large):** The one-month timeline to resolution. This is the decisive piece of evidence. Standard diplomatic processes make fulfilling the criteria before Jan 1, 2026, a near impossibility.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The stringency of the pact (banning research funds/patents) raises the bar for agreement, likely peeling off some potential, less-fervent supporters.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence massively reinforces the extremely low prior. The political momentum is real but is rendered moot by the procedural and temporal constraints. The posterior should remain extremely low (<1%).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of an emergency UN General Assembly session to vote on a pre-drafted anti-SG treaty.
    *   A major diplomatic conference on this topic is announced for December 2025.
    *   A "coalition of the willing" led by the African Union announces it will open a new treaty for signature immediately.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The passage of time with no news (the status quo leads to "No").
    *   Statements from major powers (US, China, EU) emphasizing the need for more research before considering governance.
    *   Year-end diplomatic schedules are released with no mention of such a treaty or signing ceremony.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** "Committed as a matter of treaty obligation" is key. If this could be interpreted as a simple signature by a minister without requiring parliamentary ratification, the bar is lower, but still exceptionally high for 35 countries in one month.
*   **"Bolt from the Blue" Scenario:** While procedurally implausible, a shock event could trigger an extraordinary diplomatic response. For example, a sudden, credible announcement of an imminent large-scale SG experiment by a state or non-state actor.
*   **Misinterpreting Declarations:** The AMCEN "call for a non-use agreement" is a powerful political statement of intent, but it is not the agreement itself. Confusing the call for the commitment is a potential error.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Secret diplomatic negotiations could be occurring, but a process involving 35+ countries is almost impossible to keep entirely secret. The lack of public information is likely evidence of inaction.

**Final Research Summary:**
There is significant and growing political will for a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact, primarily from a large, unified bloc of Global South nations. However, this momentum is completely negated by the near-insurmountable procedural and timeline constraints of creating and securing 35 binding treaty commitments in the single month remaining before resolution.

To forecast the probability of more than 34 countries committing to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate:** The base rate for a new international treaty achieving more than 34 binding commitments within a short timeframe (like one month) is extremely low. Historical data on similar treaties, such as the Minamata Convention or the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, suggests that the process from proposal to widespread commitment typically takes years. The base rate for achieving this within a month is near 0%.

**Initial Prior:** Given the procedural and temporal constraints, the initial prior probability is set at less than 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
- The process of forming international treaties is inherently slow and complex, requiring extensive negotiation and consensus-building.
- The stringent requirements of the proposed anti-solar-geoengineering pact make it comparable to other high-bar treaties.

**Differences:**
- The existence of a cohesive bloc of Global South nations advocating for the pact is unusual and could theoretically accelerate the process.
- The pre-emptive nature of the treaty, aiming to ban a technology not yet widely deployed, adds a unique dynamic.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Key Evidence:**
- **AMCEN Support (↑):** The African Union's support represents a significant bloc of potential signatories, increasing the likelihood of reaching the threshold.
- **UNEA-6 Stalemate (↓):** The failure to agree on a path forward at UNEA-6 indicates significant opposition and a lack of consensus, decreasing the likelihood.
- **One-Month Timeline (↓↓↓):** The extremely short timeframe is a major barrier, making it highly unlikely that the procedural steps can be completed in time.
- **Stringency of Pact (↓):** The high bar for agreement, including bans on research and patents, likely reduces the number of potential signatories.

**Likelihood Ratios:**
- The evidence of political momentum (AMCEN support) slightly increases the probability, but the overwhelming procedural and temporal constraints significantly decrease it.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

**Bayesian Update:**
- **Prior Odds:** Very low (<1%).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence, particularly the one-month timeline and UNEA-6 stalemate, strongly supports a decrease in probability.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability remains extremely low, likely below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

**Critical Evaluation:**
- **Overconfidence Risk:** The forecast could underestimate the potential for a rapid diplomatic breakthrough, though this remains unlikely.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden geopolitical event or crisis could theoretically catalyze rapid agreement, but this is speculative.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of any significant diplomatic movement or announcements in the final month strongly supports the low probability forecast.

### 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming procedural and temporal constraints, combined with the lack of significant diplomatic progress, the probability of more than 34 countries committing to the stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 0%

# Will more than 34 countries commit to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider the base rate of countries rapidly forming and committing to stringent international environmental treaties, particularly those that preemptively ban emerging technologies.

The most appropriate base rate is extremely low, approximately **0.5%**, because:

- International treaties typically take years to negotiate, draft, and secure commitments
- The question requires 35+ countries to commit to a highly stringent pact (banning research funding, patents, etc.)
- The resolution date is December 31, 2025, giving only one month from today
- Preemptive technology bans with this level of stringency are rare in international law

This base rate reflects the historical pace of international treaty formation, where even fast-tracked agreements with strong political will (like the Ottawa Treaty on landmines) took years, not weeks, to reach 35 signatories.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Requires formal treaty obligations (not just declarations or resolutions)
- Involves a contentious technology with mixed scientific opinions
- Requires coordination across multiple countries with different interests

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline constraint (major negative)**: Only one month remains until the deadline, whereas typical treaty processes take years
- **Existing coalition (positive)**: The African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) has already called for a non-use agreement, representing a potential bloc of ~55 countries
- **Stringency level (negative)**: The criteria are exceptionally strict, including bans on research funding and patents, making consensus harder to achieve
- **Pre-emptive nature (negative)**: Unlike treaties addressing existing problems, this aims to ban a largely theoretical technology

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: AMCEN's call for a non-use agreement (2023, reaffirmed 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.9 (If a treaty were to happen, we'd very likely see this regional bloc support)
- P(E|~H): ~0.3 (This political call could exist without resulting in a binding treaty)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (Moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Failure to agree on a path forward at UNEA-6 (February 2024)**
- P(E|H): ~0.2 (If a treaty were imminent, we'd expect progress at UNEA)
- P(E|~H): ~0.8 (Diplomatic stalemate is consistent with no treaty by deadline)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (Significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Broadening support beyond Africa (September 2024)**
- P(E|H): ~0.8 (Treaty would require diverse geographic support)
- P(E|~H): ~0.4 (Political statements of support can exist without treaty)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (Moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 4: One-month timeline to deadline**
- P(E|H): ~0.01 (Treaty formation in one month is procedurally almost impossible)
- P(E|~H): ~0.99 (The status quo leads to no treaty by deadline)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.01 (Drastically decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.005/(1-0.005) = 0.005/0.995 ≈ 0.005

Updating with evidence:
- Prior odds × LR(AMCEN support) × LR(UNEA failure) × LR(Broadening support) × LR(Timeline constraint)
- 0.005 × 3.0 × 0.25 × 2.0 × 0.01 = 0.000075

Converting back to probability:
- Posterior odds = 0.000075
- Posterior probability = 0.000075/(1+0.000075) ≈ 0.000075 ≈ 0.0075%

This extremely low posterior reflects the overwhelming impact of the timeline constraint, which renders the political momentum almost irrelevant given procedural realities.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a "bolt from the blue" scenario where a crisis triggers emergency diplomatic action
- There could be secret negotiations already far advanced that aren't public
- I might be overestimating the procedural constraints if countries decide to bypass normal treaty processes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A coalition of willing countries might sign a political declaration that they claim constitutes a "treaty obligation" but doesn't follow normal ratification processes
- A pre-drafted treaty might already exist and be ready for immediate signature
- A major climate disaster in December could trigger unprecedented rapid action

After considering these alternatives, I still find them extremely unlikely given:
- The stringency requirements in the resolution criteria
- The need for 35+ countries to commit simultaneously
- The lack of any public signals of imminent treaty signing

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming procedural and timeline constraints, despite some political momentum, I assess the probability as extremely low. The one-month timeline is simply too short for the normal treaty process, and there are no indications of an imminent signing ceremony or emergency diplomatic conference.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the frequency with which new, binding international treaties are conceived, drafted, negotiated, and signed by over 34 nations within a one-month period. The history of international law provides a clear reference class. Major environmental and technology treaties, such as the Minamata Convention on Mercury or the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, consistently take multiple years to move from political negotiation to being open for signature. The process involves extensive drafting, legal review within dozens of capitals, and building consensus. A one-month timeline for this entire process is unprecedented in modern diplomacy. Therefore, the base rate for such an event occurring in any given month is virtually zero. I will set a conservative prior probability of **0.1%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The proposed event is a standard international treaty process, requiring consensus-building, legal drafting, and sovereign commitments, which are inherently slow and complex, just like the base case.

**Differences:**
*   **Extreme Time Compression (Negative):** The most significant difference is the one-month resolution window (December 2025). This is a radical departure from the multi-year norm and is the single most important factor making a "Yes" outcome less likely than the base case.
*   **Pre-formed Coalition (Positive):** Unlike many treaties that require building a coalition from scratch, there is a large, pre-existing, and vocal bloc of ~55 nations (the African Group, via AMCEN) and their allies who are already calling for such a pact. This provides a ready-made pool of potential signatories, which could theoretically accelerate the final stages if a treaty text were ready. This makes the situation more favorable than a typical base case *if* the procedural hurdles could be overcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that >34 countries commit to the pact before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: One month remaining until the deadline.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of observing this short timeline *if* a successful treaty were being formed is extremely low. A successful process would almost certainly involve a well-publicized signing conference planned months in advance. The lack of any such announcement by December 1st is strong evidence against H.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of observing this short timeline if no treaty is formed is very high; it is the default state of affairs.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This evidence massively decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: A cohesive bloc of ~55-60 nations is calling for a non-use agreement.**
    *   P(E2 | H): Very high. The existence of this bloc is a necessary precondition for a "Yes" outcome.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): Also quite high. This political bloc has existed for some time and can continue to advocate for a treaty for years without one being successfully concluded, as demonstrated by the current situation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors H (> 1). This evidence provides a plausible path and pool of signatories, increasing the probability relative to the base rate.

*   **Evidence 3: Diplomatic stalemate at UNEA-6 in February 2024.**
    *   P(E3 | H): Low. If a treaty were on a path to success, we would expect to see progress and consensus-building in major international forums, not deadlock.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): High. A stalemate is a direct cause for a treaty process failing to advance.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H (< 1). This shows that the pro-ban bloc, while large, currently lacks the power to overcome opposition in global forums.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I begin with a prior of 0.1% (odds of 1:999), reflecting the near-impossibility of the timeline. The positive evidence of the pro-ban coalition (Evidence 2) is significant; it provides the "who" but not the "how" or "when". This might increase the odds tenfold, bringing the probability to around 1% (odds of 1:99).

However, this is immediately counteracted by the evidence of the UNEA-6 stalemate and, most critically, the timeline itself. The fact that it is December 1st and there is no public information about a finalized text or a signing ceremony is overwhelming evidence. The diplomatic and legal machinery of 35+ countries cannot be spun up and completed in 31 days, a period which also includes major holidays for many of the relevant governments. This final piece of evidence has a massive negative likelihood ratio, driving the probability back down to a value very close to the original prior. The political will is negated by procedural reality.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome would be a "bolt from the blue" scenario. For example, the African Union could have secretly prepared a treaty text and plans to open it for signature at a surprise summit in late December, using its institutional power to secure commitments from its members rapidly. Alternatively, a sudden, shocking event (like a credible announcement of an imminent rogue geoengineering test) could force an emergency diplomatic response.

However, a secret process involving dozens of sovereign states is exceptionally difficult to keep secret and procedurally complex. An emergency response would still run into the wall of domestic legal requirements for treaty commitment. The phrasing "committed as a matter of treaty obligation" sets a high legal bar that is difficult to meet with a simple political declaration. While these tail-risk scenarios prevent a 0% forecast, they are highly improbable. The overwhelming likelihood is that diplomatic inertia and procedural requirements will ensure the deadline passes without the criteria being met.

### Final Forecast
The procedural and temporal barriers to creating and securing 35 binding treaty commitments in a single month are immense and, based on historical precedent, effectively insurmountable. While there is significant political momentum from a large bloc of nations, this has not been sufficient to overcome diplomatic stalemate in key international forums. The complete lack of public information regarding a finalized treaty text or a signing conference with one month to go is the most decisive piece of evidence. The probability of this event occurring is therefore extremely low.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
For the base rate, I'll draw from the reference class of new international environmental or technology treaties, as outlined in the research report (e.g., Minamata Convention, Kigali Amendment, Ottawa Treaty). These typically take 2-5 years from initial calls to opening for signature, with achieving 35+ binding commitments often requiring additional time for negotiation and ratification. The base rate for a treaty reaching >34 binding commitments within a year of initial high-level calls is very low (<5%), and within one month, it's near 0%, as no modern precedent exists for such rapid formation without years of prior groundwork. Pre-emptive bans (e.g., Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons) also follow multi-year timelines, often gaining signatures from non-possessor states but still not in weeks.

I choose this base rate because solar geoengineering pacts fit this class: they're contentious, involve global coordination, and require legally binding commitments, not just resolutions. Historical data from sources like the UN Treaty Collection supports this, showing median times of 3+ years for environmental treaties to hit 35 signatories. Thus, my initial prior probability P(H) is 0.5% (or odds of 1:199), reflecting the extreme rarity of ultra-fast treaty adoption, adjusted slightly upward from near-zero to account for any "coalition of the willing" scenarios in the reference class.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to base cases like the Ottawa Treaty or nuclear prohibition treaties in that there's a pre-formed coalition (e.g., African Group via AMCEN, with ~55-60 Global South nations) pushing for a pre-emptive ban on a controversial technology, driven by advocacy from NGOs and academics. This mirrors how landmine bans built on intense campaigning and a "coalition of the willing" to quickly amass signatures once open.

However, it's different in critical ways that lower the probability: (1) Extreme time compression—only ~1 month remains until the deadline (Dec 31, 2025), versus multi-year processes in base cases; this matters because drafting, legal vetting, diplomatic negotiation, and securing binding commitments (beyond mere signatures) can't realistically happen in weeks without unprecedented urgency. (2) Higher stringency—the required pact bans research funding, patents, and experiments, which is stricter than many treaties (e.g., landmine bans allowed some research carve-outs), potentially deterring moderate supporters. (3) No focusing crisis event (e.g., no rogue geoengineering test), unlike landmine campaigns spurred by visible harms. These differences suggest the situation is harder than the base case, warranting a downward adjustment from the prior.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Key pieces of evidence from the research report and background:

- **Strong Global South cohesion (e.g., AMCEN reaffirmation on 2025-10-17, claiming ~60 countries' support):** P(E | H) is high (~90%), as a large pre-formed bloc is necessary for rapid sign-ups in a yes scenario. P(E | ~H) is moderate (~40%), as such calls happen without leading to treaties (e.g., ongoing climate resolutions). Likelihood ratio: ~2.25 (increases probability moderately, as it provides a pool of potential signatories but doesn't guarantee binding action).

- **Recent advocacy and broadening support (e.g., 2025-09-24 Frontiers article, 2024-09-26 reports of Latin American/Pacific/European backing):** P(E | H) ~80% (momentum is key for fast adoption). P(E | ~H) ~50% (advocacy often builds without resolution). Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (increases probability slightly, showing coalition growth but not yet at treaty stage).

- **UNEA-6 stalemate (2024-02-29), where a research proposal was blocked but no pact advanced):** P(E | H) low (~20%, as consensus failures would be unlikely if a pact were imminent). P(E | ~H) high (~80%, stalemates are common in diplomacy). Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (decreases probability significantly, highlighting opposition from major powers and lack of global buy-in).

- **Extreme timeline constraint (only ~1 month left as of 2025-12-01, with no announced treaty draft or signing event):** P(E | H) very low (~5%, as yes would require near-instantaneous action). P(E | ~H) very high (~99%, inertia is default). Likelihood ratio: ~0.05 (decreases probability massively, as procedural hurdles make short-term success implausible).

- **Lack of crisis trigger (no rogue experiments or cataclysms reported):** P(E | H) moderate (~40%, crises could accelerate but aren't required). P(E | ~H) high (~90%, absence is normal). Likelihood ratio: ~0.44 (decreases probability moderately, reducing urgency).

Overall, the evidence mix has some upward drivers (momentum) but is dominated by strong downward ones (stalemate, timeline).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds: 1:199 (P(H) = 0.5%).

First explicit update: Combine upward evidence (Global South cohesion and advocacy; net LR ~3.6 from multiplying 2.25 and 1.6). Posterior odds = 1:199 × 3.6 ≈ 1:55.3. Posterior P = 1.8% (small increase due to momentum providing a feasible path).

Second update: Incorporate downward evidence (UNEA stalemate, timeline, no crisis; net LR ~0.0055 from multiplying 0.25, 0.05, and 0.44, approximating conservatively). Posterior odds = 1:55.3 × 0.0055 ≈ 1:10,000. Posterior P ≈ 0.01%.

The resulting posterior is extremely low (~0.01%), reflecting high uncertainty resolved toward no due to overwhelming procedural barriers, but with slight residual uncertainty for tail risks like a sudden diplomatic breakthrough.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the low end by underweighting "bolt from the blue" scenarios (e.g., a shock event like a announced geoengineering test triggering an emergency UN session), which could compress timelines—historical outliers like rapid UN resolutions post-crises show this is possible, though rare (<1% base rate). Blind spots include potential secret negotiations or looser interpretations of "treaty obligation" (e.g., if signatures without ratification count), which could make yes more feasible.

Best alternative forecast: 5% (arguing the pre-formed bloc of 55+ African nations could unilaterally open a treaty for signature in December, hitting 35 easily if momentum holds). Rebuttal: This ignores the stringent criteria (e.g., banning patents/research), which even willing coalitions struggle with quickly, and no indicators (e.g., announcements) suggest it's happening. Still, to account for tails, I'll nudge up slightly to widen the distribution, making my final ~0.1% (covering 99th percentile surprises without overreacting).

Final: 0%
