### Reference class & base rates
*   **Post-Financial Crisis (2009-2021):** This period was characterized by low inflation, accommodative monetary policy (ZIRP, QE), and secular stagnation concerns. The average 10-year yield was approximately **2.4%**. This class is relevant for understanding yield behavior in a low-growth, low-inflation regime but is likely a poor guide for the current environment.
*   **Modern High-Inflation Era (2022-Present):** This period reflects the post-pandemic economy with significant inflation, a rapid Fed hiking cycle, and quantitative tightening. The average yield has been approximately **3.9%**, with a range from roughly 2.5% to 5.0%. This is the most relevant reference class, capturing the current macroeconomic regime.
*   **All Q4 Periods (2000-2024):** Looking at the fourth quarter specifically can capture seasonal patterns related to holiday spending, corporate bond issuance, and portfolio rebalancing. The average yield in Q4 over this period is around **3.1%**. However, this average is heavily skewed by the low-rate environment of the 2010s and the high-rate environment of the early 2000s, limiting its direct predictive power.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-15** October CPI data slightly above consensus — ↑ — Core inflation proves sticky, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's "higher for longer" stance and pushing back market expectations for 2026 rate cuts.
*   **2025-10-08** September FOMC meeting minutes released — ↑ — Minutes revealed a hawkish tilt, with several members concerned about premature easing. This reduced the probability of near-term dovish pivots, supporting higher yields.
*   **2025-10-03** September jobs report shows slowing wage growth — ↓ — While job gains were solid, moderating wage pressures suggest a cooling labor market, a key condition for the Fed to eventually consider rate cuts.
*   **2025-09-26** Q2 2025 Final GDP revised slightly lower — ↓ — Weaker final growth numbers for the second quarter reinforced the narrative of a slowing economy, putting downward pressure on long-term growth and inflation expectations.
*   **2025-09-17** Fed holds rates steady at September FOMC meeting — ↔ / ↑ — The hold was expected, but the accompanying statement and dot plot signaled a higher terminal rate for longer than markets had priced in, causing a hawkish reaction.
*   **2025-08-22** Geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea escalate — ↓ — A minor naval incident increased risk-off sentiment, leading to a temporary flight-to-safety bid for U.S. Treasuries, briefly pushing yields down.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Inflation Expectations (Large):** The primary driver. Higher expected inflation erodes the real return of bonds, forcing investors to demand a higher nominal yield. Breakeven inflation rates are a key metric here.
*   **Federal Reserve Policy Path (Large):** Market expectations for the future path of the Fed Funds Rate directly influence the entire yield curve. Hawkish signals (higher for longer) push yields up; dovish signals (impending cuts) pull them down.
*   **Economic Growth Outlook (Moderate):** Stronger growth expectations often correlate with higher inflation and a more hawkish Fed, pushing yields up. Conversely, recession fears lead to expectations of rate cuts and a flight to safety, pushing yields down.
*   **Treasury Supply and Demand (Moderate):** The size of U.S. government deficits determines the supply of new bonds. Reduced demand from foreign buyers or the Fed (via Quantitative Tightening) can force yields higher to attract new buyers. This is often called the "term premium."
*   **Global Safe-Haven Demand (Small to Large):** During periods of global economic or geopolitical stress, investors flock to U.S. Treasuries as a safe asset, increasing demand and pushing yields down. The effect size depends on the severity of the crisis.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Elevated Debt & Deficit Levels:** Compared to most of the post-2008 period, the U.S. is running historically large peacetime deficits, creating a significant and ongoing supply of new Treasury bonds that the market must absorb.
*   **Quantitative Tightening (QT) vs. QE:** Unlike the 2009-2021 reference class, the Federal Reserve is actively reducing its balance sheet, removing a large, price-insensitive buyer from the market and putting upward pressure on the term premium.
*   **Sticky Inflation Above Target:** While inflation has fallen from its 2022 peak, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. This prevents the Fed from easing policy pre-emptively in response to slowing growth, a major departure from the 2010s playbook.
*   **Resilient Labor Market:** The labor market has remained surprisingly strong despite aggressive monetary tightening, complicating the inflation picture and giving the Fed more leeway to maintain a restrictive policy stance.
*   **Geopolitical Fragmentation:** The current environment features multiple active conflicts and heightened tensions between major powers, creating a higher baseline for "risk-off" events that could trigger sudden flights to safety.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around the recent trading range of **4.10% - 4.30%** seems appropriate, reflecting the market's current equilibrium. Equivalent n should be moderate, acknowledging the recent stability but also the potential for new data to shift the outlook.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Sticky core inflation data (↑, moderate): Suggests the "last mile" of disinflation is difficult, keeping the Fed on hold.
    *   Hawkish Fed communications (↑, moderate): The Fed is actively managing expectations to prevent a premature easing of financial conditions.
    *   Slowing growth and wage data (↓, moderate): Provides a countervailing force, suggesting the Fed's tightening is working and future cuts are inevitable, albeit delayed.
    *   Ongoing QT and high Treasury issuance (↑, small-to-moderate): A persistent structural headwind providing a floor for yields.
    *   Elevated geopolitical risk (↓, small): A background factor that could cause short-term downward spikes on any negative headlines.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting, creating a strong tug-of-war. The hawkish Fed and sticky inflation likely outweigh the slowing growth narrative in the short term. The posterior should shift slightly **upward** from the midpoint of the prior range, with a slight increase in variance to reflect the balanced but powerful opposing forces.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   October CPI report (to be released mid-November) showing core inflation re-accelerating.
    *   October jobs report (early November) showing unexpectedly strong wage growth.
    *   Hawkish speeches from key FOMC members (e.g., Powell, Williams, Waller).
    *   A breakdown in ceasefire negotiations or new geopolitical conflicts.
    *   Poorly received Treasury auctions, indicating weak demand.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A significant miss to the downside in the October jobs or CPI reports.
    *   A sharp drop in consumer sentiment or retail sales data for October.
    *   Unexpected signs of stress in the banking or financial sector.
    *   Dovish commentary from the Fed, hinting that the peak rate is definitively in.
    *   De-escalation of a major geopolitical conflict.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Revisions:** Initial economic data releases (e.g., jobs, GDP) are often subject to significant future revisions that can alter the macroeconomic narrative.
*   **Term Premium Uncertainty:** The term premium is not directly observable and is difficult to model. A sudden, unexplained rise in the term premium could push yields higher even without a change in the economic outlook.
*   **Non-Linearity:** The relationship between economic data and yields is not always linear. A small miss in a key data point could trigger an outsized market reaction if it crosses a psychological threshold.
*   **"Black Swan" Events:** The forecast is vulnerable to unforeseen geopolitical events, natural disasters, or financial crises that would trigger a massive flight to safety, causing yields to plummet.
*   **Resolution Timing:** The resolution is the value on the final day of the period. A single day's market-moving event (e.g., a data release on Nov 21st itself) could determine the outcome, irrespective of the trend over the preceding days.

**Final Research Summary:** The 10-year yield is caught between the upward pressure of sticky inflation and a hawkish Fed, and the downward pull of a gradually slowing economy. In the immediate term, the Fed's resolve to keep rates high appears to be the dominant factor, suggesting yields will remain firm or drift slightly higher.

To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of November 10 - November 21, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate for the current environment is the "Modern High-Inflation Era (2022-Present)" with an average yield of approximately 3.9%, ranging from 2.5% to 5.0%. This period captures the post-pandemic economic conditions, characterized by significant inflation and a rapid Fed hiking cycle. The mean of this base rate is 3.9%, with a variance reflecting the range of 2.5% to 5.0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution due to ongoing inflationary pressures and a hawkish Federal Reserve stance. However, it differs in the sense that there is a slowing economic growth narrative and geopolitical tensions, which could exert downward pressure on yields. These differences suggest a slightly higher yield than the base rate average but within the upper range.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Sticky Core Inflation (↑, moderate):** Supports higher yields as it suggests persistent inflation.
- **Hawkish Fed Communications (↑, moderate):** Reinforces expectations of higher yields due to a "higher for longer" rate stance.
- **Slowing Growth and Wage Data (↓, moderate):** Suggests potential for future rate cuts, exerting downward pressure on yields.
- **Ongoing QT and High Treasury Issuance (↑, small-to-moderate):** Adds upward pressure due to increased supply.
- **Elevated Geopolitical Risk (↓, small):** Could lead to temporary downward spikes in yields.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered around 4.10% - 4.30%, the evidence suggests a slight upward shift due to the dominant hawkish Fed and inflationary pressures. The posterior distribution will have a mean slightly above the midpoint of the prior range, with increased variance to account for conflicting evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Considering potential overconfidence, the forecast should account for tail risks such as unexpected geopolitical events or significant economic data surprises. An alternative forecast might emphasize the slowing growth narrative more heavily, suggesting a lower yield. However, given the current evidence, the hawkish Fed stance is likely the stronger force.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the UST 10Y Yield are:

P10: 4.05  
P20: 4.15  
P40: 4.25  
P60: 4.35  
P80: 4.45  
P90: 4.55

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 10-21, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the Modern High-Inflation Era (2022-Present) as my primary reference class, where the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged approximately 3.9%, with a range from 2.5% to 5.0%. This is the most relevant reference class because:

- It captures the current macroeconomic regime of elevated inflation and restrictive monetary policy
- It reflects the Federal Reserve's "higher for longer" stance
- It incorporates the effects of quantitative tightening and elevated government deficits

More specifically, I'll narrow my prior to the recent trading range mentioned in the research report of 4.10% - 4.30%, with a midpoint of 4.20%. This represents the market's current equilibrium and recent stability in yields.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Persistent above-target inflation remains a concern
- The Fed continues to maintain a restrictive policy stance
- Quantitative tightening is ongoing
- Government deficits remain elevated, creating Treasury supply pressure
- The labor market remains relatively resilient

**Differences from base case:**
- Recent data shows some signs of economic slowing (Q2 GDP revision, slowing wage growth)
- Geopolitical tensions have increased (South China Sea incident)
- We're looking at a specific two-week period in Q4 2025, which may have seasonal factors
- The forecast period is over a year from now, increasing uncertainty

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing yields higher:**
- October CPI data slightly above consensus (recent): This suggests inflation remains sticky, supporting the Fed's "higher for longer" stance. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.3x in favor of higher yields.
- September FOMC minutes revealed hawkish tilt: Several members expressed concern about premature easing, reducing probability of near-term dovish pivots. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.4x for higher yields.
- September FOMC meeting signaled higher terminal rate for longer: The dot plot and statement were more hawkish than markets expected. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.2x for higher yields.
- Ongoing QT and high Treasury issuance: Creates persistent structural upward pressure. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.1x for higher yields.

**Evidence pushing yields lower:**
- September jobs report shows slowing wage growth: Suggests cooling labor market, a precondition for Fed cuts. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.2x for lower yields.
- Q2 2025 Final GDP revised slightly lower: Reinforces slowing economy narrative. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.1x for lower yields.
- Escalating geopolitical tensions: Could trigger flight-to-safety flows into Treasuries. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.1x for lower yields.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.20% with a moderate spread (roughly 3.7% to 4.7% for the 80% confidence interval):

**First update - Sticky inflation and hawkish Fed:**
- Combined likelihood ratio of approximately 1.3 × 1.4 × 1.2 = 2.18x in favor of higher yields
- This shifts my posterior mean upward from 4.20% to approximately 4.35%
- The confidence in this shift is moderate, so I'll maintain a similar spread

**Second update - Slowing economic data:**
- Combined likelihood ratio of approximately 1.2 × 1.1 = 1.32x in favor of lower yields
- This partially counteracts the first update, pulling the posterior mean down to approximately 4.28%
- The conflicting evidence increases uncertainty slightly, widening the spread

**Third update - Structural factors and geopolitics:**
- QT and Treasury issuance (1.1x for higher) vs. geopolitical tensions (1.1x for lower)
- These roughly cancel out, leaving the mean at 4.28%
- The time horizon (over a year away) adds additional uncertainty, further widening the spread

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent data points that will be distant history by Nov 2025
- The forecast period is over a year away, making current trends less reliable
- I haven't fully accounted for potential seasonal effects in Q4 (year-end positioning, etc.)
- The research report doesn't mention potential fiscal policy changes after the 2024 election

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Recession scenario:** If economic data deteriorates significantly by late 2025, the Fed could be in the midst of an easing cycle, pushing yields down to 3.0-3.5%
- **Inflation resurgence scenario:** If inflation proves more persistent than expected, yields could rise to 5.0-5.5%
- **Geopolitical crisis scenario:** A major international conflict could trigger a flight to safety, temporarily pushing yields down to 3.0-3.5%

**Adjustments needed:**
- Widen the distribution to account for the long time horizon
- Ensure the tails adequately capture both recession and inflation resurgence scenarios
- Slightly lower the median given the mixed signals and potential for economic slowing by late 2025

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.60
P20: 3.85
P40: 4.15
P60: 4.35
P80: 4.65
P90: 4.90

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the "Modern High-Inflation Era (2022-Present)," as it reflects the current macroeconomic regime of elevated inflation and restrictive monetary policy. This period has seen an average 10-year yield of approximately 3.9%, with a wide range from 2.5% to 5.0%. However, to anchor the forecast more closely to current market conditions, I will use the "recent trading range of 4.10% - 4.30%" mentioned in the research report as the central tendency for my prior. This suggests a prior distribution centered around 4.2%, but with a high variance consistent with the volatility observed since 2022. A normal distribution with a mean of 4.2% and a standard deviation of approximately 0.6% seems appropriate, capturing both the recent central point and the broader range of possibilities in this regime.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast period of November 2025 is a direct continuation of the conditions described in the research report (which is dated October 2025). The primary drivers—inflation, Fed policy, and economic growth—remain the same. The key difference is that the forecast period occurs just after several crucial data releases mentioned as "indicators to watch" (e.g., the October jobs report and October CPI). This means the situation is highly dynamic, and the market could be in the process of repricing based on this new information, making the situation potentially more volatile than the immediate past. The underlying structural pressures of high deficits (upward pressure on yields) and the cumulative effect of monetary tightening (downward pressure) will be more pronounced.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the report, which is dated just before the forecast period.

*   **Upward Pressure (Hawkish Evidence):**
    *   **Sticky Core CPI (Oct 15):** This is a strong piece of evidence suggesting inflation is persistent. It supports the Fed's "higher for longer" stance and makes near-term rate cuts less likely. This pushes the entire distribution higher.
    *   **Hawkish FOMC Minutes (Oct 8) & Dot Plot (Sep 17):** These communications explicitly guide the market towards a higher policy rate for a longer duration. This is a powerful signal that directly increases the expected yield.
    *   **Structural Factors (QT & Deficits):** These are persistent, moderate upward pressures on the term premium, acting as a floor under yields.

*   **Downward Pressure (Dovish Evidence):**
    *   **Slowing Wage Growth (Oct 3) & Lower GDP Revision (Sep 26):** This is significant counter-evidence showing that the economy is cooling. It suggests that the Fed's tightening is working and that rate cuts are the eventual outcome, even if delayed. This pulls the distribution lower.
    *   **Geopolitical Risk (Background):** The potential for "flight-to-safety" events creates a latent downward pressure, primarily affecting the left tail of the distribution (i.e., increasing the probability of a sharp drop).

The net effect is a tug-of-war. However, the most recent evidence (sticky CPI) and the Fed's explicit forward guidance are more immediate drivers than the slower-moving economic cooling. Therefore, the evidence provides a net upward update to the prior.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at 4.2% with high variance.
*   **Likelihood:** The combined evidence is more consistent with slightly higher yields than the prior's center. The sticky inflation and hawkish Fed signals outweigh the slowing growth data in the short term.
*   **Posterior:** I will update my prior by shifting the median upward from 4.2% to approximately 4.35%. This reflects the dominance of the "higher for longer" narrative based on the latest information. The variance of the distribution should remain wide, or even increase slightly, because the strong opposing forces (hawkish Fed vs. slowing economy) create significant uncertainty and the potential for a sharp move if one narrative decisively wins out following the upcoming key data releases.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My central forecast is anchored to the "higher for longer" narrative prevailing in October 2025. I need to challenge this.

*   **Alternative Scenario (Sharp Slowdown):** What if the slowing growth and wage data are the true leading indicators, and the sticky inflation is a lagging effect? The October jobs report (early Nov) or a key sentiment index could come in shockingly weak, causing the market to aggressively price in 2026 rate cuts. In this scenario, the 10-year yield could quickly fall below 4.0%. This possibility means my lower percentiles (P10, P20) must be meaningfully low.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Inflation Resurgence):** Conversely, what if the October CPI report (mid-Nov) shows a re-acceleration in core inflation? This would shatter the disinflation narrative and could even lead to market pricing of another Fed hike. This would likely push the 10-year yield towards the top of its multi-year range, near 4.8% or 5.0%. This informs the upper percentiles (P80, P90).

Considering these risks, my median of 4.35% seems reasonable, but the distribution must be wide to account for the high-impact potential of the imminent data releases. The symmetric risks of a dovish pivot versus an inflation scare justify a relatively symmetric distribution. I will maintain a wide 90-basis-point spread between my P10 and P90 estimates.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.90
P20: 4.05
P40: 4.25
P60: 4.45
P80: 4.65
P90: 4.80
