### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Spanish Legislatures (1979-Present):** Since the 1979 election, Spain has had 15 legislatures. Of these, only 5 have completed or are on track to complete a full four-year term. This yields a base rate of early elections of approximately **67% (10/15)**. This is a strong, relevant reference class for the general instability of Spanish politics.
2.  **Minority Governments in Spain:** Pedro Sánchez leads a minority coalition government. Historically, Spanish minority governments are significantly more prone to collapse or calling early elections than majority governments. Of the 10 legislatures that ended early, at least 7 were minority governments. This suggests the base rate for this specific situation is likely **higher than 70%**.
3.  **Pedro Sánchez's Prime Ministerships:** Sánchez himself has a track record of calling snap elections. He called one in 2019 after failing to pass a budget and another in 2023 as a political gamble after poor regional election results. In his two previous terms, neither completed a full four-year mandate. This personal history suggests a very high propensity to use early elections as a political tool.

*Limitations:* While historical base rates are high, each political situation is unique. The specific composition of the current parliamentary support and the nature of the political pressures are critical context not captured by the raw numbers.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-07-08] EU Rule of Law report published. ↓ — While noting tensions, it confirmed progress on renewing the judiciary council, slightly reducing a source of institutional friction for the government.
*   [2025-09-10] Government presents draft 2026 budget framework. ↑ — This officially starts the clock on the most critical and contentious legislative process, forcing difficult negotiations with unstable partners like Junts and ERC.
*   [2025-10-16] High Court elevates a query to the EU Court of Justice regarding the amnesty law. ↑ — This move signals significant judicial resistance and delays the full implementation of the law, angering Catalan partners and increasing their incentive to pressure Sánchez.
*   [2025-10-28] Junts per Catalunya's leader states budget support is "not guaranteed" and conditional on "tangible progress" for Catalan independence. ↑↑ — This is a direct, public threat to the government's stability, making the budget a high-stakes test of the coalition's viability.
*   [2025-11-07] A judge re-opens a preliminary investigation into Sánchez's wife, Begoña Gómez, based on new claims from an opposition-linked group. ↑ — This renews the "lawfare" narrative, puts Sánchez on the defensive, and consumes political capital needed for negotiation and governance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Budget Approval Failure (Large):** The government's survival is contingent on passing the 2026 budget. Failure to secure support from Catalan separatist parties (Junts, ERC) would leave Sánchez without a functioning government, making a snap election almost inevitable.
2.  **Withdrawal of Catalan Support (Large):** The government depends on the votes of Junts and ERC. If they withdraw their support—either over the budget, the slow implementation of the amnesty law, or a new political demand—the government loses its parliamentary majority and cannot govern.
3.  **Sánchez's Strategic Calculus (Large):** Sánchez is a known political risk-taker. If polls show a favorable window, or if he believes an election can reset the political narrative and break a stalemate, he has a demonstrated history of calling them proactively, rather than waiting for his government to collapse.
4.  **Escalation of Corruption Probes (Moderate):** While ongoing probes are a source of chronic weakness, a significant formal development (e.g., an official indictment of a family member) could create an acute political crisis, forcing Sánchez's hand to either resign or call an election to seek a new mandate.
5.  **Coalition Tensions with Sumar (Small):** Disagreements between Sánchez's PSOE and his left-wing coalition partner Sumar could weaken the government, but are unlikely to be the primary trigger for collapse compared to the external support from Catalan parties.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Parliamentary Arithmetic:** Unlike past minority governments, this one relies on the explicit, and highly transactional, support of the full spectrum of nationalist and separatist parties, including Junts, led by Carles Puigdemont. This arrangement is inherently more volatile than previous coalitions.
*   **The Amnesty Law as a Lynchpin:** The entire government was formed on the basis of a controversial amnesty for Catalan separatists. This single issue both holds the coalition together and serves as its greatest point of vulnerability, subject to judicial and political attacks that constantly threaten the pact.
*   **Personalized "Lawfare":** The judicial pressure is uniquely focused on Sánchez's immediate family (wife, brother). This makes the attacks more personal and politically damaging than typical party-level corruption scandals, potentially affecting Sánchez's decision-making more directly.
*   **Extreme Political Polarization:** The level of animosity between the government and the opposition (PP, Vox) is exceptionally high, leaving no room for cross-party deals on major issues (like the budget), making the government entirely dependent on its fragile support base.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **65-75%** is justified by the high base rate of early elections for Spanish minority governments. The strength is moderate (equivalent n≈10), as history is a strong but not absolute guide.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The government's survival is tied to a 2026 budget negotiation with partners who are publicly threatening to vote against it.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Judicial challenges to the amnesty law are creating friction with the government's essential Catalan partners.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Renewed judicial probes against Sánchez's family are increasing personal political pressure and consuming bandwidth.
    *   (↑ Small) Sánchez's personal track record shows a willingness to use snap elections as a strategic tool.
*   **Net effect:** The current evidence strongly amplifies the risks inherent in the base rate. The posterior probability should move **significantly higher** than the prior, likely into the 80-90% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official statements from Junts or ERC formally linking budget approval to new, difficult-to-meet demands.
    *   Sánchez or his ministers beginning to use election-style rhetoric, framing issues as a choice between his government and a right-wing alternative.
    *   A definitive, negative ruling from a high court on a key aspect of the amnesty law.
    *   The formal scheduling of a no-confidence motion by the opposition.
    *   Breakdown of budget negotiations announced by any of the involved parties.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A preliminary budget agreement is announced between PSOE, Sumar, and their parliamentary partners.
    *   Junts and ERC lower their public rhetoric and focus on securing regional funding in the budget.
    *   The opposition becomes embroiled in a major internal crisis, reducing pressure on the government.
    *   A significant international event occurs that creates a "rally 'round the flag" effect for the incumbent.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Sánchez's Survival Skills:** The primary pitfall is underestimating Sánchez's ability to pull a last-minute deal out of the fire. He has a long history of surviving seemingly impossible political situations.
*   **Partners' Reluctance for Elections:** Sánchez's support partners (especially the Catalan parties) may calculate that a new election could weaken their position. This "mutually assured destruction" scenario could force them to compromise and keep the government afloat, even if they are dissatisfied.
*   **"Kicking the Can":** The government could opt to roll over the previous year's budget rather than pass a new one. While politically messy and a sign of weakness, it is a mechanism to avoid an immediate government collapse over a failed budget vote.
*   **Timing Ambiguity:** The question resolves on the *official call* for an election. Political turmoil in late December might not translate into an official decree published in the state gazette (BOE) before January 1, 2026.

**Final Research Summary:** Pedro Sánchez's government is exceptionally fragile, facing a critical budget vote with unreliable partners whose support is wavering. Given his personal history of calling snap elections as a strategic gamble, the current high-pressure environment makes an election call before 2026 highly probable.

To forecast the probability of Pedro Sánchez calling for general elections before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical frequency of early elections in Spain provides a strong base rate. Since 1979, 10 out of 15 Spanish legislatures have ended early, giving a base rate of approximately 67%. Given that Sánchez leads a minority government, which historically has a higher propensity for early elections, the base rate could be adjusted upwards to around 70-75%.
- **Rationale:** This base rate is chosen because it reflects the general instability of Spanish politics and the specific vulnerability of minority governments.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to past instances where minority governments faced challenges in maintaining coalition support, leading to early elections.
- **Differences:** The current government is uniquely dependent on Catalan separatist parties, and the political environment is highly polarized. Additionally, the amnesty law and personal judicial pressures on Sánchez add layers of complexity not present in all past cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Budget Negotiations:** The contentious 2026 budget negotiations with Catalan parties are critical. The likelihood of budget failure is high given the public threats from Junts, increasing the probability of early elections.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High (↑↑) - If elections are called, budget failure is a likely precursor.
- **Judicial Challenges:** The judicial resistance to the amnesty law and renewed probes against Sánchez's family increase political instability.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate (↑) - These factors contribute to instability but are not definitive triggers alone.
- **Sánchez's Track Record:** His history of calling snap elections when politically advantageous suggests a higher probability of doing so again.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate (↑) - His strategic use of elections in the past supports this possibility.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Let's assume a prior probability of 70% (odds of 7:3).
- **Evidence Impact:** The evidence, particularly the budget negotiations and Sánchez's track record, strongly supports an increase in probability.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
  - Adjusting for evidence, the likelihood ratios suggest a significant increase. If we assume a combined likelihood ratio of 2 (doubling the odds), the posterior odds become 14:3.
- **Posterior Probability:** 
  \[
  \text{Posterior Probability} = \frac{14}{14 + 3} = \frac{14}{17} \approx 82.35\%
  \]

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast could be overconfident if Sánchez manages to secure last-minute deals or if the Catalan parties decide against risking elections.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a budget rollover or a temporary compromise that delays elections.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment might be prudent to account for Sánchez's political maneuvering skills and the potential reluctance of partners to face elections.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all factors, including the potential for Sánchez to navigate the crisis, the final probability is adjusted slightly downward to reflect these uncertainties.

Final: 80%

# Will Pedro Sánchez call for general elections before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the historical frequency of early elections in Spain as my primary base rate.

- Since 1979, Spain has had 15 legislatures, with only 5 completing or on track to complete a full four-year term
- This gives a base rate of early elections of approximately 67% (10/15)
- For minority governments specifically (like Sánchez's current one), the rate is even higher at around 70%
- Sánchez himself has called snap elections twice before, never completing a full term

Given these factors, I'll set my prior at **70%** that Sánchez will call early elections before 2026.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Sánchez leads a minority government dependent on fragile coalitions, similar to many previous Spanish governments that called early elections
- The government faces significant political pressure and opposition, a common precursor to early elections
- Budget approval remains a critical test for government stability, as in past cases

**Differences from base case:**
- The current parliamentary arithmetic is uniquely complex, with dependence on separatist parties like Junts
- The amnesty law for Catalan separatists creates a specific point of vulnerability not present in previous governments
- The judicial pressure is unusually personal, targeting Sánchez's immediate family
- Political polarization is exceptionally high, even by Spanish standards

These differences generally increase the likelihood of early elections compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Budget negotiations with unstable partners**
- P(E|H): Very high (~90%) - If Sánchez plans to call elections, we would expect exactly this kind of difficulty with budget negotiations
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~40%) - Even if Sánchez intends to complete his term, some budget friction would be expected, but not this level of public threats
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This significantly increases the probability of early elections

**Evidence 2: Judicial challenges to the amnesty law**
- P(E|H): High (~80%) - If early elections are coming, we would expect judicial challenges creating friction with Catalan partners
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~50%) - These challenges might occur regardless, but would be managed differently if long-term stability was expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Renewed judicial probes against Sánchez's family**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~70%) - Such probes create pressure that could precipitate an election call
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~50%) - These investigations might proceed regardless of election timing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Junts explicitly threatening to withhold budget support**
- P(E|H): Very high (~95%) - This is exactly what we'd expect to see before early elections
- P(E|~H): Low (~20%) - Such explicit threats would likely be avoided or resolved if the government were stable
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75
- This substantially increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 70% (odds of 7:3), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence: Junts threatening to withhold budget support.

Prior odds = 7:3 = 2.33
Likelihood ratio = 4.75
Posterior odds = 2.33 × 4.75 = 11.07

Converting back to probability:
Posterior probability = 11.07 / (1 + 11.07) = 0.917 or about 92%

Considering the other evidence cumulatively would push this even higher, but I'll be cautious and adjust slightly to **88%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Sánchez's political survival skills - he has navigated seemingly impossible situations before
- The "mutually assured destruction" factor: Catalan parties may fear worse outcomes from new elections
- The government could choose to roll over the previous budget rather than pass a new one
- The timing of an election call matters - political turmoil in late December might not translate to an official call before January 1, 2026

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be around 60%, arguing that:
- Sánchez and his partners have strong incentives to avoid elections that could benefit the right
- Budget negotiations often feature brinkmanship before eventual compromise
- The government could survive without passing a new budget

However, this alternative view seems to underweight the severity of the current coalition tensions and Sánchez's history of strategic election calls.

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for Sánchez's survival skills and the possibility of last-minute compromises.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 85%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the historical frequency of early general elections in Spain since its transition to democracy.

*   **Reference Class:** Spanish parliamentary terms (legislatures) from 1979 to the present.
*   **Data:** According to the research report, there have been 15 legislatures in this period. Of these, 10 ended with early elections, and only 5 completed a full four-year term.
*   **Calculation:** This gives a raw base rate of 10/15 = 66.7% for any given legislature ending early.
*   **Refinement:** The current government is a minority coalition. The report notes that at least 7 of the 10 early elections were called by minority governments, making them significantly more prone to collapse. Furthermore, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez himself has a personal track record of calling snap elections in both of his previous terms (2019 and 2023).

Given these refining factors (minority government + Sánchez's personal history), the base rate should be adjusted upwards from the general 67%. I will set the initial prior probability at **P(H) = 70%**, which corresponds to prior odds of 7:3 or 2.33:1. This reflects a high intrinsic probability of an early election even before considering the specific evidence of the current term.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation fits the historical pattern of a fragile minority government dependent on smaller parties to pass key legislation, most notably the annual budget. This is a classic setup for instability in Spain.
*   **Differences:** The current situation is arguably more precarious than the historical average for several reasons:
    1.  **Unprecedented Coalition:** The government relies on the support of a wide and ideologically diverse group of parties, including Catalan separatists like Junts, whose primary political goals are often in direct conflict with national stability. This makes the coalition exceptionally transactional and volatile.
    2.  **Amnesty Law Lynchpin:** The government's formation was contingent on a highly controversial amnesty law for Catalan separatists. This law is the glue holding the coalition together, but it is also a major vulnerability, facing constant legal and political challenges that threaten to break the pact.
    3.  **Personalized Pressure:** The ongoing corruption probes are uniquely focused on Sánchez's immediate family, making the political pressure more personal and potentially leading to more drastic strategic decisions, such as calling an election to reset the narrative.

These differences suggest that the current government is significantly more fragile than the typical Spanish minority government, meaning the probability of an early election should be considerably higher than the 70% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report. Let H be the hypothesis that Sánchez calls an election before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Junts' threat to block the 2026 budget.** (P(E1))
    *   **P(E1 | H):** If an election were imminent, it would most likely be triggered by a major political failure, such as the inability to pass a budget. Therefore, public threats from a key partner to block the budget are highly likely in a world where the government is about to collapse.
    *   **P(E1 | ~H):** If the government were stable and set to complete its term, Junts would still use the budget for leverage, but a credible, public threat that could actually topple the government would be less likely. They would likely negotiate behind the scenes to avoid an election that could bring a hostile right-wing government to power.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** The LR is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability of an early election.

*   **Evidence 2: Judicial resistance to the amnesty law.** (P(E2))
    *   **P(E2 | H):** If the government is heading for collapse, it's plausible that the core deal with its Catalan partners is fraying. Judicial delays and challenges to the amnesty law are a primary mechanism for this, angering the partners and removing their incentive to support Sánchez.
    *   **P(E2 | ~H):** For the government to be stable, it would need to successfully manage the implementation of the amnesty law and keep its partners satisfied. Significant judicial roadblocks make this scenario less likely.
    *   **LR:** The LR is greater than 1. This evidence also increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Renewed corruption probe into Sánchez's wife.** (P(E3))
    *   **P(E3 | H):** This type of personal political pressure consumes the government's political capital, distracts from its agenda, and provides Sánchez with a potential pretext to call a "defensive" election against what he terms "lawfare."
    *   **P(E3 | ~H):** A stable government would be better able to weather such a scandal, but its renewal adds to the cumulative instability.
    *   **LR:** The LR is greater than 1, though perhaps weaker than the budget issue.

All key pieces of recent evidence point towards heightened instability and increase the probability of an early election.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 2.33:1 (from a 70% probability).
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The combined evidence, particularly the direct threat to the budget which is the primary survival test for the government, represents a strong signal of instability. I will estimate a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 3:1. This means the current evidence is about three times more likely if an election is going to be called than if the government were to remain stable.
*   **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds = 2.33 × 3 = 6.99:1
*   **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
    *   Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)
    *   Posterior Probability = 6.99 / (1 + 6.99) ≈ 0.875

This calculation updates the initial 70% probability to approximately **87.5%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Counter-Argument:** The strongest reason this forecast could be wrong is the "mutually assured destruction" principle. Sánchez's partners, especially the Catalan separatists, know that a new election could very well result in a PP-Vox government, which would be far more hostile to their interests. This gives them a powerful incentive to ultimately compromise and keep Sánchez in power, even if they are dissatisfied.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** Instead of calling an election upon failing to pass the 2026 budget, the government could choose to "kick the can down the road" by rolling over the previous year's budget. This is a sign of a weak, "zombie" government, but it is a viable mechanism to avoid an immediate collapse and buy more time.
*   **Rebuttal:** While these points are valid and prevent a forecast near 100%, Sánchez's political character must be considered. He has repeatedly shown a preference for bold, high-risk/high-reward moves (like the 2023 snap election) rather than presiding over a slow, politically painful decline. Faced with a paralyzed government, his history suggests he is more likely to roll the dice on an election than to limp along.
*   **Adjustment:** The possibility of rolling over the budget is the most significant factor that reduces the probability from being in the 90s. My calculated posterior of ~88% seems to appropriately balance the overwhelming evidence of instability against this plausible, albeit difficult, path to survival.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for early elections in Spain is already high (~70%), especially for a minority government led by Pedro Sánchez. The current political evidence—most critically, the high likelihood of a failed 2026 budget negotiation with unreliable partners—points to a level of instability that is even more severe than the historical average. While Sánchez is a known political survivor and his partners have an incentive to avoid an election, the fundamental contradictions of the ruling coalition make its collapse before 2026 highly probable. The most likely trigger is a budget failure in late 2025, leading to an election call before the year's end.

Final: 88%
