### Reference class & base rates
*   **Winners by Region (2013-2024):** In the last 12 World Championships, 7 winners have been from South Korea's LCK and 5 have been from China's LPL. No other region has won since 2012. This establishes a ~99% base rate that the winner will be from the LCK or LPL, and a ~60% base rate for an LCK winner specifically. With three LCK teams and one LPL team in the semifinals, this historical precedent is strongly reflected in the current tournament.
*   **MSI Winner's Performance at Worlds:** Winning the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) is an indicator of strength, but not a guarantee of a Worlds title. In the 9 tournaments since MSI's inception (2015-2024), the MSI winner has gone on to win Worlds in the same year only 3 times (~33%). This suggests that being the MSI champion (Gen.G) provides a significant but not overwhelming prior.
*   **Semifinalist Conversion Rate:** A team that reaches the semifinals has a 1-in-4 chance of winning, a base rate of 25%. However, this assumes all semifinalists are equal. Historically, teams from dominant regions (LCK/LPL) that reach this stage have a much higher conversion rate than teams from minor regions. As all four remaining teams are from the LCK or LPL, this base rate is less useful than regional priors.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-02-23] Hanwha Life Esports (HLE) wins the inaugural LCK Cup. ↑ HLE (initially) — Showed early season form, though this is a minor tournament. HLE has since been eliminated.
*   [2025-07-12] Gen.G wins the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI). ↑ Gen.G — Established Gen.G as the best team in the world mid-season, defeating top international competition.
*   [2025-10-01] Gen.G wins the LCK Season Finals, defeating HLE. ↑ Gen.G — Cemented Gen.G's domestic dominance across the entire 2025 season, making them the undisputed LCK #1 seed.
*   [2025-10-27] All four LCK teams (T1, HLE, KT, Gen.G) advance to Worlds Quarterfinals. ↑ An Asia-Pacific team / LCK teams — Demonstrated the overwhelming strength of the LCK region relative to the rest of the world in the 2025 meta.
*   [2025-10-31] Semifinal matchups are set: Gen.G vs. KT Rolster and T1 vs. Top Esports. ↑ GEN, KT, T1, TES — Dramatically narrowed the field of potential winners to these four teams, eliminating all others.
*   [2025-10-31] T1's quarterfinal match against Anyone's Legend breaks viewership records. ↔ T1 — Indicates high fan engagement and star power but does not directly impact their probability of winning.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Regional Strength & Meta Read (Large):** The LCK's success (all 4 teams in quarterfinals, 3 in semifinals) indicates the region has a superior understanding of the game's current meta. Teams from a dominant region have a significant advantage due to higher quality practice and strategic development.
*   **Player Form & Peak Performance (Large):** On any given day, a best-of-five series can be decided by individual player performance. A star player carrying or a key player underperforming can swing a match and the entire tournament. This is a high-variance driver.
*   **Team Cohesion & Strategy (Moderate):** Beyond individual skill, a team's ability to execute coordinated plays, adapt their draft strategy between games, and maintain composure under pressure is critical. Gen.G's season-long success suggests elite cohesion.
*   **Knockout Bracket Draw (Large):** The bracket draw is a massive factor. Gen.G must face a strong domestic rival in KT. T1 faces the last hope of the LPL, Top Esports. The path to the final is not equal for all remaining teams. The all-LCK semifinal guarantees one LCK finalist.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme LCK Dominance:** While LCK/LPL dominance is the norm, having three out of four semifinalists from a single region is a particularly strong showing. This concentrates the probability of an LCK victory even more than the historical base rate suggests.
*   **Tournament Stage:** The most significant difference is that the tournament is already at the semifinal stage. Pre-tournament predictions are obsolete. The universe of possible winners has collapsed from 17 to 4, making this a forecast about two best-of-five matches and a final, not a month-long event.
*   **Gen.G's Unprecedented Domestic Season:** Gen.G became the LCK's first-ever "single-season champion" under a new format, on top of winning MSI. This level of sustained dominance throughout a single year is rare and suggests they are a stronger favorite than a typical #1 seed.
*   **Sole LPL Representative:** Top Esports carries the weight of the entire LPL region. Historically, the LPL has often had multiple teams in the semifinals, providing a stronger regional challenge. TES stands alone against a trio of LCK powerhouses.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior before the knockout stage would have been centered on Gen.G as the favorite (~25-30%) based on their MSI and LCK season wins, with other top LCK/LPL teams like T1 and TES following.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) **LCK's overall tournament performance:** The region's dominance validates the high prior placed on its teams (Gen.G, T1, KT).
    *   (↑ Large) **Reaching the Semifinals:** Gen.G, KT, T1, and TES have all proven their strength by surviving to the final four, massively increasing their chances from the start of the tournament.
    *   (↑ Moderate) **Gen.G's path:** Facing a familiar domestic opponent (KT) could be seen as an advantage, avoiding an unknown international factor until the final.
    *   (↓ Moderate) **KT's path:** Must defeat the tournament favorite, Gen.G, to even reach the final.
    *   (↔) **T1 vs. TES matchup:** This is a classic LCK vs. LPL showdown. The outcome will be a massive update, but heading into the match, it validates both teams as elite contenders.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior probability should be heavily concentrated on the four remaining teams. Gen.G's position as the favorite should be solidified, but not guaranteed. T1's probability is also high, given their historical tournament prowess. KT is a clear underdog against Gen.G, and TES is a slight underdog against the LCK bloc. The probability for "An Asia-Pacific team" is now 100%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   **Gen.G winning the first semifinal against KT:** This would make them the first confirmed finalist and likely the favorite for the title.
    *   **T1 winning the second semifinal against TES:** This would guarantee an all-LCK final and position T1 as a co-favorite for the championship.
    *   **Dominant individual performance:** A key player (e.g., Gen.G's Chovy, T1's Faker) showing exceptional form in the semifinals.
    *   **TES defeating T1:** This would significantly increase TES's chances, proving they can overcome the strongest LCK competition.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   **Losing a semifinal match:** This is the only down indicator that matters; it reduces a team's probability of winning to zero.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Best-of-Five Variance:** A single series is a small sample size. A team can have an uncharacteristically bad day, or an underdog can peak at the perfect moment. An upset in either semifinal is plausible.
*   **Internal Scrimmage Data:** We lack data on how these teams have been performing against each other in practice scrims during the tournament, which is a key indicator of current power levels.
*   **Player Health/Stamina:** The grueling tournament schedule can lead to burnout or illness, which is not publicly visible but can dramatically affect performance.
*   **Draft Adaptation:** The team that loses the first semifinal may reveal strategic weaknesses in the current meta that the teams in the second semifinal can learn from and exploit, slightly altering the dynamics.

**Final Research Summary:** The championship is guaranteed to be won by a team from the Asia-Pacific region. The field is down to four titans: three from Korea (Gen.G, T1, KT Rolster) and one from China (Top Esports). Gen.G has had a historically dominant season and is the clear favorite, but T1's legendary tournament pedigree and the high stakes of single-elimination make this a volatile and highly anticipated conclusion.

To forecast the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each team or region.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **T1, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster, Gen.G (LCK Teams):** Historically, LCK teams have a strong track record, with a ~60% base rate for winning the championship. Given the current dominance of LCK teams in the semifinals, we will adjust this base rate upwards for these teams.
- **Bilibili Gaming, Anyone's Legend, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming (LPL Teams):** LPL teams have a ~40% base rate historically. However, only Top Esports remains in the semifinals, so we will focus on them.
- **An Asia-Pacific team:** Given the dominance of LCK and LPL, this is effectively 100% since all semifinalists are from these regions.
- **An EMEA team, An Americas team:** Historically, these regions have not won since 2012, so the base rate is effectively 0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The dominance of LCK and LPL is consistent with historical trends.
- **Differences:** The extreme dominance of LCK this year, with three out of four semifinalists, is unusual and suggests a higher probability for an LCK team.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Gen.G's Performance:** Winning MSI and the LCK Season Finals suggests a high likelihood of success (P(E | H) is high for Gen.G).
- **T1's Historical Performance:** T1's strong historical performance and fan engagement suggest they are a strong contender.
- **Top Esports:** As the sole LPL representative, their likelihood is lower compared to the LCK teams.
- **KT Rolster:** Facing Gen.G in the semifinals reduces their likelihood due to Gen.G's dominance.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Gen.G:** Starting with a high prior due to MSI and LCK wins, the evidence further supports their position as favorites.
- **T1:** Given their historical strength and current performance, they remain strong contenders.
- **KT Rolster:** Their path through Gen.G is challenging, reducing their probability.
- **Top Esports:** As the only LPL team, they have a chance but are less favored against the LCK teams.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** Ensure not to overestimate Gen.G's chances despite their strong season.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of an upset in the semifinals, especially in a high-variance best-of-five series.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Gen.G: 40%  
T1: 30%  
KT Rolster: 15%  
Top Esports: 15%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 100%  
An EMEA team: 0%  
An Americas team: 0%  

(Note: The probabilities for individual teams sum to 100% for the winner, while the regional probability reflects the certainty that the winner is from the Asia-Pacific region.)

# Analysis of 2025 League of Legends World Championship Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Looking at the historical data and current tournament state:

- **Regional dominance**: Since 2013, South Korea (LCK) has won 7 championships (~58%) and China (LPL) has won 5 (~42%). No other region has won since 2012.
- **Tournament stage**: We're at semifinals with 3 LCK teams (Gen.G, T1, KT Rolster) and 1 LPL team (Top Esports).
- **MSI indicator**: Gen.G won MSI 2025, and historically MSI winners have a ~33% chance of winning Worlds.
- **Semifinalist base rate**: Each semifinalist has a 25% chance if equally strong, but this needs adjustment based on team strength.

Initial priors based on historical performance and current tournament position:
- Gen.G: 35% (MSI champion, LCK champion, dominant season)
- T1: 25% (Strong LCK team with championship pedigree)
- Top Esports: 22% (Sole LPL representative, historically strong region)
- KT Rolster: 18% (LCK team but facing tournament favorite in semifinals)
- All other options: 0% (eliminated)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- LCK/LPL dominance continues (all semifinalists from these regions)
- Tournament format remains the same (best-of-five knockout matches)
- Elite teams with championship-caliber rosters have advanced

**Key differences**:
- Extreme LCK dominance (3 of 4 semifinalists) is stronger than usual
- Gen.G's unprecedented domestic season (first "single-season champion" in LCK)
- Only one LPL team remains (usually more LPL teams reach late stages)
- We're already at semifinals, dramatically narrowing the field

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**For Gen.G winning**:
- P(MSI champion | Gen.G wins) ≈ 0.8 vs P(MSI champion | Gen.G doesn't win) ≈ 0.2
- P(LCK champion | Gen.G wins) ≈ 0.7 vs P(LCK champion | Gen.G doesn't win) ≈ 0.3
- P(Dominant season | Gen.G wins) ≈ 0.8 vs P(Dominant season | Gen.G doesn't win) ≈ 0.3

**For T1 winning**:
- P(Strong tournament history | T1 wins) ≈ 0.8 vs P(Strong tournament history | T1 doesn't win) ≈ 0.4
- P(Favorable bracket position | T1 wins) ≈ 0.6 vs P(Favorable bracket position | T1 doesn't win) ≈ 0.4

**For Top Esports winning**:
- P(Sole LPL representative | TES wins) ≈ 0.3 vs P(Sole LPL representative | TES doesn't win) ≈ 0.7
- P(LPL team in semifinals | TES wins) ≈ 0.9 vs P(LPL team in semifinals | TES doesn't win) ≈ 0.5

**For KT Rolster winning**:
- P(Facing tournament favorite in semis | KT wins) ≈ 0.2 vs P(Facing tournament favorite in semis | KT doesn't win) ≈ 0.6
- P(LCK team in semifinals | KT wins) ≈ 0.9 vs P(LCK team in semifinals | KT doesn't win) ≈ 0.7

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update Gen.G's probability based on their MSI championship:

Prior odds for Gen.G = 0.35 / 0.65 = 0.538
Likelihood ratio = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4
Posterior odds = 0.538 × 4 = 2.152
Posterior probability = 2.152 / (1 + 2.152) = 0.683 ≈ 68%

This seems too high given tournament variance, so I'll adjust for other factors:
- KT Rolster is still a strong LCK team that could upset Gen.G
- Best-of-five series have inherent variance
- T1's championship pedigree makes them a serious threat

After these considerations, I'll adjust Gen.G down to ~40%.

For T1, their favorable bracket position (facing the sole LPL team rather than Gen.G) increases their chances:
- Prior probability: 25%
- Adjusted for bracket and tournament history: ~30%

For Top Esports, being the sole LPL representative is a negative factor:
- Prior probability: 22%
- Adjusted for regional isolation: ~18%

For KT Rolster, facing Gen.G in semifinals is a significant challenge:
- Prior probability: 18%
- Adjusted for difficult semifinal matchup: ~12%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- Overvaluing Gen.G's regular season performance (playoffs are different)
- Underestimating the variance in best-of-five matches
- Neglecting player-specific factors (e.g., Faker's championship experience)
- Overlooking Top Esports' potential as the sole LPL representative

**Alternative scenarios**:
- KT Rolster could upset Gen.G through superior preparation for this specific matchup
- T1 could leverage their experience to defeat both TES and the Gen.G/KT winner
- Top Esports could prove LPL superiority by defeating multiple LCK teams

After considering these factors, I'll make these adjustments:
- Reduce Gen.G slightly to account for knockout stage variance
- Increase T1 slightly for their championship experience
- Maintain TES and KT probabilities as reasonable

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:
- Gen.G: 38%
- T1: 32%
- Top Esports: 18%
- KT Rolster: 12%
- An Asia-Pacific team: 100% (all remaining teams are from this region)
- All other options: 0% (eliminated)

Since "An Asia-Pacific team" encompasses all four remaining teams, its probability should be 100%. The individual team probabilities sum to 100%.

## 7. Final Forecast

T1: 32%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 0%  
KT Rolster: 12%  
Gen.G: 38%  
Bilibili Gaming: 0%  
Anyone's Legend: 0%  
Top Esports: 18%  
Invictus Gaming: 0%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 100%  
An EMEA team: 0%  
An Americas team: 0%  
(sum = 100% for teams, 100% for regions)

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Given the tournament is at the semifinal stage with four remaining teams, a naive base rate would assign a 25% chance to each team (Gen.G, T1, KT Rolster, Top Esports). However, the teams are not of equal strength. A more informed prior should be based on their performance and regional dominance.

*   **Regional Prior:** Historically, from 2013-2024, South Korea's LCK has won 7 titles and China's LPL has won 5. With three LCK teams and one LPL team remaining, the base rate heavily favors an LCK victory.
*   **Team Strength Prior:** The research report establishes Gen.G as the "undisputed LCK #1 seed" and MSI champion, making them the strongest prior favorite. T1 is a historical powerhouse, making them the second favorite. Top Esports (TES) represents the strong LPL region, while KT Rolster is a strong L_CK team but an underdog compared to Gen.G and T1. This suggests a prior distribution of roughly: Gen.G > T1 > TES > KT.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This forecast differs significantly from a pre-tournament base case because the field has narrowed from 17 teams to just four. The most critical factor is no longer overall tournament structure but the specific semifinal matchups: Gen.G vs. KT Rolster and T1 vs. Top Esports. The evidence of extreme LCK dominance in the 2025 meta (with 3 of 4 semifinalists) is a major deviation, strengthening the probability for the three LCK teams.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The final probability for each team is the product of their probability of winning their semifinal and their probability of winning the final, conditioned on reaching it.

*   **Evidence 1: Semifinal Matchup 1 (Gen.G vs. KT Rolster)**
    *   Gen.G's "historically dominant season" (winning MSI and LCK) makes them a strong favorite against a domestic rival they have likely outperformed throughout the year.
    *   Likelihood Assessment: I estimate **P(Gen.G wins semi) ≈ 70%** and **P(KT wins semi) ≈ 30%**.

*   **Evidence 2: Semifinal Matchup 2 (T1 vs. Top Esports)**
    *   This is a classic LCK vs. LPL clash. The report notes the LCK's "overwhelming strength" in the current meta, giving T1 an edge. However, TES is the last hope of a very strong region.
    *   Likelihood Assessment: I estimate T1 as a moderate favorite, with **P(T1 wins semi) ≈ 60%** and **P(TES wins semi) ≈ 40%**.

*   **Evidence 3: Potential Finals Matchups**
    *   **vs. Gen.G:** As the season's most dominant team, Gen.G would be the favorite against any opponent, though more so against TES (est. 65% win chance) than against the legendary T1 (est. 55% win chance).
    *   **vs. T1:** T1's tournament pedigree makes them a favorite against any team except Gen.G. They would be strongly favored against KT (est. 70% win chance).
    *   **vs. KT/TES:** These teams would be underdogs in most final scenarios, with their highest chances coming against each other in a final where both had scored upsets.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will calculate the posterior probability for each team by multiplying the probabilities along their path to victory.
P(Win Worlds) = P(Win Semi) * P(Win Final | Reached Final)

*   **P(Gen.G wins):** They must beat KT (70%), and then beat either T1 (with a 55% chance) or TES (with a 65% chance). This combines to approximately **41%**.
    *   (0.70) * [ (0.60 * 0.55) + (0.40 * 0.65) ] = 0.413

*   **P(T1 wins):** They must beat TES (60%), and then beat either Gen.G (with a 45% chance) or KT (with a 70% chance). This combines to approximately **32%**.
    *   (0.60) * [ (0.70 * 0.45) + (0.30 * 0.70) ] = 0.315

*   **P(Top Esports wins):** They must beat T1 (40%), and then beat either Gen.G (with a 35% chance) or KT (with a 45% chance). This combines to approximately **15%**.
    *   (0.40) * [ (0.70 * 0.35) + (0.30 * 0.45) ] = 0.152

*   **P(KT Rolster wins):** They must beat Gen.G (30%), and then beat either T1 (with a 30% chance) or TES (with a 55% chance). This combines to approximately **12%**.
    *   (0.30) * [ (0.60 * 0.30) + (0.40 * 0.55) ] = 0.12

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary model relies on estimated win probabilities for Best-of-5 series, which are inherently high-variance.
*   **Risk of Overestimating Gen.G:** A season of dominance does not guarantee a Worlds title (the "MSI curse" is real). T1, in particular, is known for peaking during Worlds. I have slightly tempered Gen.G's chances in a potential final against T1 (55%, not 60%+) to account for this.
*   **Risk of Underestimating TES:** As the sole LPL team, they may be stronger than perceived, having survived a gauntlet to get here. The LCK vs. LPL dynamic is often closer to a coin flip than regional meta reads suggest. I have kept their chances against T1 at a respectable 40%.
*   **Resolution Criteria Ambiguity:** The criteria state, "If the winning team is from the Asia-Pacific... region, this question will resolve as the respective region." A literal interpretation would mean P(An Asia-Pacific team) = 100% and all other options are 0%, as all remaining teams are from APAC. I am assuming the standard convention that the most specific option resolves (i.e., if T1 wins, it resolves as "T1"), as this allows for a meaningful forecast. If this assumption is wrong, the forecast will be incorrect.

### 6. Final Normalization

The calculated probabilities sum to 100% (41.3 + 31.5 + 15.2 + 12.0 = 100). I will round these for the final answer. All eliminated teams or regions have a 0% chance. The "An Asia-Pacific team" option is assigned 0% based on the assumption that the specific team option takes precedence.

T1: 32%
Hanwha Life Esports: 0%
KT Rolster: 12%
Gen.G: 41%
Bilibili Gaming: 0%
Anyone's Legend: 0%
Top Esports: 15%
Invictus Gaming: 0%
An Asia-Pacific team: 0%
An EMEA team: 0%
An Americas team: 0%
