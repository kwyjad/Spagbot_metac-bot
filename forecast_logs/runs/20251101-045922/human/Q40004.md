Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **What is the appropriate reference class for this type of nomination?** I need to determine the historical base rate for (a) NASA Administrator nominations in general, (b) contentious or withdrawn nominations, and (c) the re-nomination of a previously withdrawn candidate for the same post.
2.  **What are the motivations and power dynamics of the key actors?** The core of the question is a power struggle. I need to map the influence and goals of:
    *   **President Trump:** What are his decision-making criteria? Does he favor loyalty (Duffy) or disruptive vision (Isaacman/Musk)? How does he typically resolve internal staff conflicts?
    *   **Jared Isaacman:** What are his qualifications and policy vision for NASA? What is the nature of his relationship with Musk and Trump?
    *   **Sean Duffy:** What is his power base as Secretary of Transportation and acting Administrator? What are the strategic reasons for his push to absorb NASA and block Isaacman?
    *   **Elon Musk:** How much influence does he currently wield with Trump, especially after the reported "falling out"?
3.  **What are the key recent events and their implications?** I must construct a timeline from the provided sources to understand the sequence of the conflict: Isaacman's initial consideration, the withdrawal, Duffy's rise, and Isaacman's re-emergence as a candidate.
4.  **What are the underlying policy and political drivers?** This involves understanding the conflict between "New Space" (commercial, SpaceX-centric) and a more traditional/bureaucratic approach, as well as the proposed budget cuts and their political implications.
5.  **What are the leading indicators that would signal a shift in probability?** I need to identify observable events or statements in the near future that would provide strong evidence for or against Isaacman's chances.

### **Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

*Since the provided sources are fictional but form the basis of the scenario, my "search" will be an analysis of these documents, supplemented by general knowledge of the actors and processes involved.*

1.  **For Reference Class:**
    *   `"historical NASA administrator confirmation rates"`
    *   `"presidential nominee withdrawn then re-nominated same position"`
    *   `"acting cabinet secretary nominated for permanent role success rate"`
2.  **For Actor Dynamics:**
    *   `"Donald Trump decision making loyalty vs expertise"`
    *   `"Sean Duffy political career priorities"`
    *   `"Jared Isaacman space policy views"`
    *   `"Elon Musk political influence Trump administration"`
3.  **For Recent Events & Policy:**
    *   (Synthesize timeline from provided sources: Business Insider, The Space Review, Universe Today, etc.)
    *   `"analysis of proposal to merge NASA with Department of Transportation"`
    *   `"political implications of NASA budget cuts to science"`
    *   `"Artemis program lunar lander contract controversy"`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** The re-nomination of a withdrawn candidate is extremely rare in US politics, suggesting a very low prior. It's far more common for an acting head to be promoted.
*   **Core Conflict:** The situation is a direct contest between two factions vying for Trump's approval. Duffy represents the established, loyalist insider making a bureaucratic power play. Isaacman represents the outsider, "New Space" disruptor, backed by the influential but potentially out-of-favor Elon Musk.
*   **Trump's Role:** The background explicitly states "the decision now lies with Trump." This makes his personal preference the single most important variable, superseding normal political processes. His decision will likely be based on who he perceives as more loyal, more useful to his agenda, or who wins the personal battle for his attention.
*   **Duffy's Strengths:** He is an insider, a current Cabinet member, and his actions (challenging SpaceX, cutting science) appear to align with the administration's stated priorities. He is actively and publicly campaigning for the job.
*   **Isaacman's Strengths:** He represents a bold, commercial-first vision for space that may appeal to Trump's desire for big, visible achievements. His connection to Musk was once a major asset.
*   **Key Weaknesses:** Isaacman's primary weakness is the reported "falling out" between Musk and Trump. Duffy's weakness is that his plan to absorb NASA may be seen as too radical or create unnecessary political battles.
*   **Timeline:** The conflict has escalated rapidly in October, with Duffy making a major move against SpaceX *after* reports that Isaacman was back in contention. This suggests Duffy is playing hardball. The resolution window is very short (approx. two months).

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Cabinet-level nominations:** Historically, over 90% of cabinet-level nominations are confirmed. However, this case involves a pre-nomination conflict.
*   **Acting heads nominated for the permanent role:** This is a common pathway. While precise data is elusive, it is a plausible and frequent occurrence for an acting secretary or administrator to be formally nominated. This class favors a "No" resolution (i.e., favors Duffy). Base rate: ~30-40% of acting heads in a new administration might get the permanent nod.
*   **Re-nomination of a previously withdrawn candidate:** This is exceptionally rare. Candidates are typically withdrawn due to insurmountable opposition or a change in the nominator's preference. A reversal signals significant political realignment. This reference class suggests a very low probability. Base rate: <5%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-22] Duffy aligns NASA policy with Trump's proposed budget cuts, redirecting funds from science to exploration. ↓ — Shows Duffy is an insider actively implementing the President's agenda, strengthening his position.
*   [2025-10-14] Reports emerge that Isaacman is back in talks to become NASA Administrator. ↑ — Re-opens a possibility that seemed closed, making the question non-trivial.
*   [2025-10-23] Acting Admin Duffy announces a "shakeup" of Artemis, opening the lunar lander contract to competition and challenging SpaceX. ↓ — A direct power play against the Musk/Isaacman faction, demonstrating Duffy's confidence and intent to secure the job.
*   [2025-10-25] Eric Berger confirms Duffy is campaigning to absorb NASA into the Dept. of Transportation and block Isaacman. ↓ — Frames the situation as a zero-sum conflict, with Duffy leveraging his current position to eliminate his rival.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Trump's Personal Preference:** The ultimate decision rests with the President. His choice between Duffy's perceived loyalty and Isaacman's disruptive vision is the single largest driver. (Size: Large)
*   **Influence of Elon Musk:** Musk's ability to regain Trump's favor is critical for Isaacman. If the "falling out" is severe and permanent, Isaacman's chances are minimal. (Size: Large)
*   **Duffy's Insider Campaign:** As acting Administrator and a Cabinet Secretary, Duffy can use his institutional power to shape policy and narrative, making himself appear indispensable and Isaacman's appointment disruptive. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Perceived Viability of Artemis Program:** If Duffy successfully frames SpaceX as a bottleneck and his "shakeup" as a necessary fix, it weakens the case for the SpaceX-aligned Isaacman. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Broader Political Alliances:** Support or opposition from key figures in Congress or the administration could tip the balance in this internal struggle, though Trump's personal whim could override this. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Public Power Struggle:** Unlike typical nomination processes, this is a highly visible conflict between a sitting cabinet member and an outside candidate.
*   **Radical Bureaucratic Proposal:** Duffy's proposal to fold NASA into the Department of Transportation is an unconventional and aggressive move, far beyond a typical personnel dispute.
*   **Billionaire-vs-Billionaire Influence:** The outcome is heavily influenced by the relationship between the President and two billionaires (Musk and Isaacman), a unique dynamic for a NASA leadership role.
*   **Candidate's Profile:** Isaacman is not a traditional choice (e.g., former astronaut, scientist, or politician) but a commercial space pioneer, representing a significant break from past NASA leadership profiles.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (~10-15%) based on the extreme rarity of re-nominating a withdrawn candidate, especially after a public rift between key patrons (Trump/Musk). (Equivalent n ≈ 10-15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The core context is a "falling out" between Trump and Musk, Isaacman's primary backer.
    *   (↓ Large) Duffy, a Trump cabinet insider, is actively and publicly campaigning against Isaacman and using his current power to undermine Isaacman's allies (SpaceX).
    *   (↑ Moderate) The October report that Isaacman is "back in talks" is the main positive evidence, preventing the probability from being near-zero.
    *   (↓ Small) Duffy's policy actions (budget alignment) show he is a loyal implementer of the President's agenda, a trait Trump values highly.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly favors "No." The re-emergence of Isaacman in talks is a significant update from a near-zero probability, but it fights against powerful structural factors and the actions of a determined insider. The posterior should remain low, likely in the 15-25% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any public statement of praise from Trump about Isaacman, Musk, or SpaceX.
    *   Reports of Duffy being considered for a different role or ambassadorial post.
    *   Op-eds or public comments from key Trump allies (e.g., in Congress, media) supporting Isaacman.
    *   A reversal or softening of Duffy's anti-SpaceX rhetoric from NASA.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Trump publicly endorsing Duffy or his plan to "shake up" Artemis.
    *   Official movement on the proposal to merge NASA with the Department of Transportation.
    *   Key Republican senators on the Commerce Committee publicly expressing skepticism about Isaacman.
    *   Further negative stories about the Trump-Musk relationship.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Trump's Unpredictability:** The primary driver is one individual's decision, which can be impulsive and reverse established positions without warning.
*   **Information Warfare:** The media reports (e.g., Isaacman "back in talks") could be strategic leaks by either faction to influence the President's thinking, not necessarily reflections of reality.
*   **Resolution Window:** The timeframe is very short (Oct 26 - Dec

To forecast the probability of Jared Isaacman being re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for Re-nomination of Withdrawn Candidates:** Historically, the re-nomination of a previously withdrawn candidate for a high-profile position like NASA Administrator is extremely rare. This suggests a very low base rate, likely less than 5%.
- **Base Rate for Acting Heads Being Nominated:** Acting heads being nominated for the permanent role is more common, but this favors Sean Duffy, not Isaacman.
- **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the rarity of re-nomination after withdrawal, we start with a prior probability of 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves a previously withdrawn candidate, aligning with the base case of low probability for re-nomination.
- **Differences:** The current situation is highly politicized, with significant influence from key figures like Trump and Musk, which could sway the outcome unpredictably.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Isaacman Back in Talks (Moderate Increase):** Reports of Isaacman being back in talks suggest some possibility of re-nomination, slightly increasing the probability.
- **Duffy's Campaign Against Isaacman (Large Decrease):** Duffy's active campaign and policy alignment with Trump significantly decrease the likelihood of Isaacman's re-nomination.
- **Trump's Decision-Making (Large Decrease):** Trump's decision-making often favors loyalty and current insiders, which benefits Duffy over Isaacman.
- **Musk's Influence (Moderate Decrease):** The reported falling out between Musk and Trump reduces Isaacman's chances, as Musk's support is crucial.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 5% probability translates to odds of 0.05 / 0.95 ≈ 0.0526.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed against Isaacman due to Duffy's strong position and Trump's tendencies.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.0526 × (significantly less than 1 due to strong negative evidence).
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability remains low, likely around 10-15% after considering all evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast accounts for Trump's unpredictability, but the strong negative evidence against Isaacman is compelling.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden reconciliation between Musk and Trump or a major political shift could increase Isaacman's chances, but these are unlikely given current dynamics.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strong negative evidence, the probability remains low, but we account for potential surprises by setting it at the higher end of the range.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unexpected developments, the final forecast is 15%.

Final: 15%

# Will Jared Isaacman be re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class for the probability that Jared Isaacman will be re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Re-nomination of a previously withdrawn candidate for the same position
- Probability of an acting administrator (Duffy) being replaced by a new nominee
- Probability of a nomination being influenced by a power struggle between factions

For re-nomination of previously withdrawn candidates, this is extremely rare in U.S. politics. When a nomination is withdrawn, it typically signals insurmountable opposition or a change in the nominator's preference. Historical data suggests this happens less than 5% of the time.

For acting administrators being replaced, this is more common, especially in a new administration that's still settling its personnel. However, acting administrators often have an inside track to permanent nomination.

Given these considerations, I'll set a prior of **15%** - acknowledging the rarity of re-nominating withdrawn candidates while accounting for the unique dynamics of this situation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like most withdrawn nominations, Isaacman's initial nomination was canceled due to a falling out between key stakeholders (Trump and Musk)
- The acting administrator (Duffy) is actively working to secure the permanent position, which is typical
- There's a power struggle between factions, which is common in high-level appointments

**Differences from base case:**
- The explicit power struggle is unusually public and aggressive, with Duffy openly challenging SpaceX and proposing to fold NASA into his department
- There's recent reporting that Isaacman is "back in talks" to become NASA Administrator, which is atypical for withdrawn candidates
- The situation involves billionaires (Musk and Isaacman) with direct personal relationships to the President
- Duffy's proposal to absorb NASA into the Department of Transportation is an unusually radical bureaucratic move

These differences suggest some adjustment to the base rate is warranted, but the direction is mixed.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Let's evaluate the key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Reports that Isaacman is "back in talks" to become NASA Administrator**
- P(E|H): Very high (~90%) - If Isaacman will be re-nominated, we would expect to see reports of him being in talks
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~30%) - Such reports could emerge even if he won't ultimately be nominated, as part of political maneuvering
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence increases the probability of re-nomination

**Evidence 2: Duffy's announcement challenging SpaceX's lunar lander role**
- P(E|H): Low (~20%) - If Isaacman were likely to be nominated, Duffy would be less likely to directly challenge SpaceX
- P(E|~H): High (~80%) - This aggressive move suggests Duffy feels secure in his position
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Duffy's campaign to absorb NASA into Department of Transportation**
- P(E|H): Very low (~10%) - Such a radical proposal would be unlikely if Duffy thought he might be replaced
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~70%) - This indicates Duffy is confident and actively working to consolidate power
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.14
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: The reported "falling out" between Trump and Musk**
- P(E|H): Low (~20%) - A genuine falling out would make Isaacman's nomination less likely
- P(E|~H): High (~80%) - This would explain why Isaacman isn't being nominated
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (Isaacman back in talks):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 3.0 = 0.528
- Posterior probability: 0.528 / (1 + 0.528) = 34.6%

Second update (Duffy challenging SpaceX):
- Prior odds: 0.528
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.528 × 0.25 = 0.132
- Posterior probability: 0.132 / (1 + 0.132) = 11.7%

Third update (Duffy's NASA absorption campaign):
- Prior odds: 0.132
- Likelihood ratio: 0.14
- Posterior odds: 0.132 × 0.14 = 0.0185
- Posterior probability: 0.0185 / (1 + 0.0185) = 1.8%

Fourth update (Trump-Musk falling out):
- Prior odds: 0.0185
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.0185 × 0.25 = 0.0046
- Posterior probability: 0.0046 / (1 + 0.0046) = 0.46%

This seems too low given the recent reports of Isaacman being back in talks. Let me reconsider the strength of my evidence evaluations.

Revised calculation with more moderate likelihood ratios:
- Starting prior: 15%
- After "back in talks" evidence (LR: 2.0): ~26%
- After Duffy's SpaceX challenge (LR: 0.5): ~15%
- After Duffy's absorption campaign (LR: 0.4): ~6.5%
- After considering Trump-Musk relationship (LR: 0.6): ~4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Trump's unpredictability**: Trump is known for sudden reversals and unexpected decisions. My analysis may underestimate the chance that Trump could suddenly favor Isaacman despite the evidence against it.

2. **Information warfare**: The reports about Isaacman being "back in talks" could be strategic leaks by either faction to influence Trump's thinking, not necessarily reflecting reality.

3. **Manifold market disagreement**: The community forecast on Manifold is 53.1%, much higher than my estimate. This suggests I may be missing something important or undervaluing certain evidence.

4. **Short timeframe**: With only two months left in 2025, the window for nomination is narrow, which generally favors the status quo (Duffy).

5. **Overweighting recent actions**: I may be giving too much weight to Duffy's recent aggressive moves, which could backfire if they're seen as overreach.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my estimate upward somewhat, but still remain below the market consensus given the strong evidence against re-nomination.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for re-nominating withdrawn candidates, the specific evidence in this case, and potential blind spots in my reasoning, I believe there is a low probability that Jared Isaacman will be re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026.

The strongest factors against re-nomination are Duffy's aggressive consolidation of power, his direct challenge to SpaceX, and the reported falling out between Trump and Musk. The main factor supporting re-nomination is the recent report that Isaacman is back in talks for the position.

Given Trump's unpredictability and the possibility that the situation could change rapidly, I'll adjust my final estimate to be slightly higher than my Bayesian calculation suggests, but still reflecting the significant evidence against re-nomination.

Final: 12%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is the re-nomination of a previously considered but ultimately withdrawn candidate for the same high-level government post within the same presidential term. This is an exceptionally rare event. Typically, a candidate is withdrawn due to significant political opposition, vetting issues, or a change in the president's preference. A reversal of such a decision is uncommon because the underlying reasons for the withdrawal often persist.

Based on the rarity of this scenario, a low base rate is appropriate. A generous estimate for such an event might be 10%.

*   **Prior Probability P(H):** 10%
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.1 / 0.9 = 1 to 9

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation involves a candidate who was previously in the running and then dropped, fitting the rare reference class. The fundamental process of a presidential nomination is at play.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **The President:** The decision-maker is Donald Trump, whose decision-making style is known to be less constrained by political convention and more influenced by personal relationships and perceptions of loyalty. This could make a reversal (re-nomination) more plausible than with a typical president, but it also elevates the importance of the ongoing power struggle.
    *   **The Nature of the Conflict:** This is not a quiet withdrawal due to a vetting issue. It is a public power struggle between two distinct factions: an insider (Sean Duffy) leveraging his current position, and an outsider (Jared Isaacman) backed by another powerful figure (Elon Musk).
    *   **The Stakes:** The conflict is not just about personnel but about policy and control, specifically Duffy's proposal to absorb NASA into the Department of Transportation and challenge the commercial space model represented by Isaacman and SpaceX.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the 10% prior based on the specific evidence provided.

*   **Evidence 1: A "falling out" between Trump and Elon Musk, Isaacman's key ally, was the reported reason for the initial nomination being cancelled.**
    *   This is the foundational context. It is much more likely that Isaacman would *not* be re-nominated (P(E|~H) is high) given this rift than that he would be (P(E|H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This evidence is the primary reason for the low prior.

*   **Evidence 2: A Reuters report (Oct 14) states Isaacman is "in contention once again" and "in talks" to become the agency's chief.**
    *   P(E|H): If Isaacman is going to be re-nominated, it is very likely that reports of him being back in contention would surface.
    *   P(E|~H): If he is not going to be re-nominated, such reports are less likely, though they could be trial balloons or strategic leaks from his camp.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This is the single most important piece of evidence *for* the nomination and significantly increases the probability from the very low base rate.

*   **Evidence 3: Sean Duffy, the acting Administrator and a Cabinet Secretary, is actively and publicly campaigning against Isaacman and for himself.** This includes his announcement challenging SpaceX's lunar lander contract and his confirmed effort to absorb NASA.
    *   P(E|H): If Trump had already decided on Isaacman, it would be extremely audacious and politically risky for a sitting cabinet member to launch such a direct and public attack on the president's choice and his allies. This scenario is unlikely.
    *   P(E|~H): If Trump is leaning towards Duffy, or has not yet decided, Duffy's actions are perfectly logical. He is using his current power to eliminate a rival and demonstrate his alignment with Trump's agenda (e.g., being tough on contractors). This scenario is highly likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This is powerful evidence *against* Isaacman's chances. Duffy is acting like someone who believes he has the President's backing.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's walk through the updates conceptually.

1.  **Start with the Prior (10%):** The base rate for re-nominating a dropped candidate is very low.
2.  **Update with Positive Evidence:** The Reuters report that Isaacman is "back in talks" is significant. It tells us the possibility is real and not zero. This might increase the odds substantially. Let's say it makes the outcome 4 times more likely, moving the probability from 10% to roughly 31% (Prior odds 1:9 -> Posterior odds 4:9).
3.  **Update with Negative Evidence:** The recent, concrete actions by Sean Duffy are a powerful counter-signal. A powerful insider is actively working to block the nomination and consolidate his own power. This is much more likely to happen if Isaacman is *not* the president's choice. This evidence is arguably stronger than the report of "talks" because it involves concrete actions, not just words. Let's estimate this makes the nomination 5 times less likely.
    *   Posterior Odds = (Initial Odds) × (LR_talks) × (LR_Duffy) = (1/9) × 4 × (1/5) = 4/45.
    *   Posterior Probability = (4/45) / (1 + 4/45) = 4/49 ≈ 8.2%.

This calculation feels too mechanical and perhaps too low. The core uncertainty is Trump's personal decision, which defies simple probabilistic updates. Duffy's actions are strong evidence, but Trump could perceive them as an overreach. The fact that Isaacman is in the conversation at all after the initial fallout is significant. Therefore, the final probability should be higher than the strict calculation suggests, but still well below 50%, as the observable evidence of power dynamics favors Duffy.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis concludes that Isaacman is a significant underdog. Why might this be wrong?

*   **The Manifold market is at 53%**, suggesting the community sees this as a coin flip or better for Isaacman. This could be because they weigh Trump's affinity for celebrity outsiders and "disruptors" like Isaacman and Musk more heavily than I do.
*   **Duffy's actions could be interpreted as desperation, not strength.** He might be fighting so hard publicly precisely because he knows Trump is leaning toward Isaacman, and this is his last-ditch effort to change the President's mind.
*   **The "falling out" with Musk may be overstated or resolved.** Trump's relationships can be transactional and volatile; a reconciliation is plausible, which would remove the main obstacle for Isaacman.

However, the rebuttal to this is that Duffy is a seasoned politician and a current cabinet member. He is more likely to have an accurate read on the President's mood than outside observers. His actions—challenging a major contractor, proposing a radical reorganization—seem more like those of a confident agent than a desperate one. The weight of evidence still points to Duffy having the inside track. My forecast will remain below 50% but will incorporate the uncertainty and the alternative interpretation by moving up from the ~8% calculated result.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for this event is very low. The primary evidence for Isaacman's nomination is a single report that he is "back in talks." The primary evidence against is the series of concrete, public actions by a powerful insider, Sean Duffy, to secure the job for himself and undermine Isaacman's allies. While Trump's unpredictability means a higher-than-normal chance of an unusual outcome, the observable power dynamics strongly favor Duffy. Isaacman is a plausible candidate, but he is the clear underdog in this contest.

Final: 28%
