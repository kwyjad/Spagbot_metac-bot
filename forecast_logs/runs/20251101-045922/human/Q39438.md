### **Research Brief: Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's IEEPA Tariffs**

**TO:** Bayesian Forecasting Panel Statistician
**FROM:** Lead Researcher
**DATE:** 2025-11-01
**RE:** Forecast Update for *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* and *Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc.*

This brief analyzes the likely Supreme Court ruling on the legality of President Trump's tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The core issue is whether the IEEPA grants the President authority to impose broad tariffs by declaring national emergencies related to drug trafficking and trade deficits.

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Executive Action Struck Down by an Appeals Court:** When the Supreme Court reviews a case where a federal appeals court has found an executive branch action unlawful, the government's success rate is diminished. Historically, the government wins reversal in roughly 50-60% of the cases it brings to the Court, but this includes cases where it won below. In cases where it lost below, its odds are lower. **Base Rate:** 40-50% chance the government secures a reversal (i.e., a "Tariffs lawful" ruling).
2.  **Major Statutory Interpretation Cases Involving Executive Power (Post-2020):** The current Court has shown increasing skepticism of broad executive claims of authority not explicitly granted by Congress, especially under the "Major Questions Doctrine." In recent high-profile cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), the Court has ruled against the executive branch. **Base Rate:** 20-30% chance the executive branch's broad interpretation of its authority is upheld ("Tariffs lawful").
3.  **Supreme Court Review of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit:** The Supreme Court reviews few cases from the Federal Circuit, but when it does, it has a high reversal rate (historically >70%). This suggests that when the Court takes a case from the Federal Circuit, it often disagrees with the outcome. **Base Rate:** 70-80% chance of reversal of the *V.O.S. Selections* decision. However, this must be interpreted cautiously, as the Court is also reviewing a D.C. court decision and the core issue is one of general administrative law, not patent law (the Federal Circuit's specialty).

*Limitations:* These classes provide conflicting signals. Class 2 is likely the most relevant due to the current Court's composition and jurisprudential trends. The unprecedented nature of the tariffs makes any historical comparison imperfect.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-09** SCOTUS grants certiorari before judgment in one case and grants cert in the other, consolidating them and setting an expedited schedule. ↑ "Unlawful" / "Mixed" — An expedited schedule signals the Court sees the issue as urgent and of major national importance, often a feature of cases where it intends to curb executive overreach.
*   **2025-08-29** The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the lower court ruling against the tariffs in a 7-4 decision. ↑ "Unlawful" / "Mixed" — A clear appellate ruling against the government, even if divided, solidifies the legal opposition and provides a well-reasoned foundation for the Supreme Court to affirm.
*   **2025-06-17** Plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* petition for certiorari before judgment. ↑ "Unlawful" / "Mixed" — Signals the plaintiffs' confidence in their legal arguments and the urgency of resolving the economic disruption, putting pressure on the Court to intervene.
*   **2025-05-28** Two different federal courts (Court of International Trade, D.C. District Court) rule the tariffs unlawful on different grounds. ↑ "Unlawful" / "Mixed" — The consensus on the *outcome* (unlawful), despite different reasoning, creates a strong cross-current of judicial opinion against the President's actions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (Large Impact):** The Court's conservative majority is highly likely to view the authority to unilaterally restructure U.S. trade policy as a "major question" of economic and political significance. They will require a clear, express statement from Congress in the IEEPA to grant such power, which is absent. This strongly favors an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling.
2.  **Textualism/Statutory Interpretation (Large Impact):** The challengers have strong arguments that the tariffs do not "deal with" the declared threats as required by the IEEPA's text. It is a stretch to argue that a blanket tariff on all Chinese goods "deals with" fentanyl precursors, or that a tariff on Canadian goods "deals with" cross-border drug smuggling. The "reciprocal tariffs" based on a trade deficit are on even weaker textual ground. This favors an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling.
3.  **Deference to Executive in Foreign Policy/National Security (Moderate Impact):** The government's strongest argument is that the President deserves broad deference when acting on national security threats. The Chief Justice and Justice Kavanaugh have sometimes shown sympathy for this view. This is the primary mechanism that could lead to a "Tariffs lawful" ruling.
4.  **Nondelegation Doctrine (Moderate Impact):** Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, and others are skeptical of broad delegations of legislative power (like taxing and regulating commerce) to the executive. They may view this as an unconstitutional delegation, providing another powerful reason to strike down the tariffs. This favors an "Unlawful" ruling.
5.  **Path of Least Resistance - Severability (Moderate Impact):** The Court may distinguish between the two sets of tariffs. The "trafficking tariffs" have a more plausible (though still tenuous) link to a national security threat than the "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits. The Court could strike down the latter while upholding the former, leading to a **"Mixed ruling."** This offers an "off-ramp" to rebuke the President's most extreme claim of authority without completely stripping IEEPA of its power.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions, these tariffs represent a wholesale assumption of Congress's core constitutional power to set trade policy, affecting trillions of dollars in commerce.
*   **Dominance of the Major Questions Doctrine:** This doctrine, solidified in 2022, was not a central feature of jurisprudence in prior eras when executive power was tested. It is now a primary tool for the conservative majority to limit executive authority.
*   **Weak Factual Nexus:** The connection between the "threat" (e.g., trade deficit) and the "solution" (tariffs on all goods) is far more attenuated than in typical national security cases, making judicial deference less likely.
*   **Consensus of Lower Courts:** It is unusual for two different federal courts to independently and quickly conclude that a major presidential action is unlawful, signaling the weakness of the government's legal position.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of SCOTUS reviewing executive action struck down by an appeals court, a reasonable prior might be a 55% chance of "Tariffs unlawful" and a 45% chance of "Tariffs lawful," with small probabilities for other outcomes. (Equivalent n ≈ 4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large) The Major Questions Doctrine provides a powerful, readily available tool for the Court's majority to invalidate the tariffs.
    *   ↑ (Large) The textualist argument that the tariffs do not "deal with" the threat is straightforward and compelling, especially for the reciprocal tariffs.
    *   ↑ (Moderate) The nondelegation concerns of several justices provide a constitutional backstop to the statutory arguments.
    *   ↓ (Moderate) Traditional deference to the executive on national security remains the government's most potent argument and could sway key justices like Roberts or Kavanaugh.
    *   ↔ (Splits probability) The Court's ability to sever the two tariff types makes a "Mixed ruling" a highly plausible outcome, drawing probability away from a clean "Unlawful" or "Lawful" result.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly pushes the posterior away from "Tariffs lawful." The probability mass should shift significantly toward "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling," with the latter being a strong contender.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Unlawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from Roberts, Kavanaugh, or Barrett focusing on the lack of a limiting principle for the President's claimed power.
    *   Questions invoking the Major Questions Doctrine or asking if Congress would "hide an elephant in this mousehole."
    *   Skeptical questions about the nexus between tariffs on all goods and the specific threats of drug trafficking or trade deficits.
    *   Amicus briefs filed by a bipartisan group of former national security or trade officials arguing against the tariffs.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "Lawful"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from the same justices focusing on the President's need for flexibility in a national emergency.
    *   Questions expressing concern about the judiciary interfering in foreign policy and national security.
    *   Government lawyers successfully framing the issue as a direct response to foreign threats rather than as economic policy.
    *   Justices expressing satisfaction with the government's attempts to distinguish this case from *West Virginia v. EPA*.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **"Mixed Ruling" vs. "Unlawful":** The resolution criteria are precise. If the Court strikes down the reciprocal tariffs but upholds the trafficking tariffs, it resolves as "Mixed." This is a very different outcome from striking down both, which would be "Unlawful." This distinction is the key source of uncertainty.
*   **Judicial Politics:** While unlikely to be explicit, the Court may be wary of issuing a sweeping ruling that completely ties the hands of future presidents in emergencies. This could push them toward a narrower, "Mixed" ruling.
*   **"Other Ruling" Possibility:** While the expedited grant makes it unlikely, the Court could still issue a procedural ruling (e.g., a GVR - Grant, Vacate, Remand) that punts on the ultimate merits until 2026, resolving the question as "Other ruling."
*   **Oral Argument Misinterpretation:** Oral arguments are not perfectly predictive. Justices may play devil's advocate, and their final votes may differ from the impression they give during questioning.
*   **No 2025 Ruling:** The Court is on an expedited schedule, making a ruling before Jan 1, 2026 highly likely. However, an unforeseen delay or a deeply fractured court struggling to form a majority could push the decision into 2026.

**Final Research Summary:**
The legal arguments against the tariffs, particularly those rooted in the Major Questions Doctrine and textualism, are very strong and align with the current Supreme Court's jurisprudence. The most probable outcome is that the Court will find at least some, and likely all, of the

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each of the given options.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, when the Supreme Court reviews cases where a lower court has struck down executive action, the government has a lower success rate. The base rate for the government securing a reversal in such cases is approximately 40-50%. However, given the current Court's skepticism towards broad executive power claims, especially under the Major Questions Doctrine, a more conservative base rate of 20-30% is appropriate.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The base rate for the Supreme Court ruling against broad executive interpretations of statutory authority, especially in recent cases, is higher. Given the Court's recent trends, a base rate of 55-65% is reasonable.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: The possibility of a mixed ruling, where some tariffs are upheld and others struck down, is plausible given the Court's ability to sever different tariff types. A base rate of 10-20% is appropriate.
  
- **Other ruling**: Historically, procedural rulings or dismissals without a merits decision are less common but possible. A base rate of 5-10% is reasonable.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, the likelihood of no ruling by the end of 2025 is low. A base rate of 0-5% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current case is similar to past cases where the Supreme Court has reviewed executive actions struck down by lower courts. However, it differs due to the unprecedented scope of the tariffs and the strong application of the Major Questions Doctrine, which increases the likelihood of an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Major Questions Doctrine**: Strongly favors "Unlawful" or "Mixed" due to the Court's recent rulings against broad executive power claims.
  
- **Textualism/Statutory Interpretation**: Favors "Unlawful" or "Mixed" as the tariffs do not clearly "deal with" the identified threats.
  
- **Deference to Executive**: Provides some support for "Lawful," but is weaker given the Court's current composition.
  
- **Nondelegation Doctrine**: Supports "Unlawful" due to skepticism of broad delegations of power.
  
- **Severability**: Increases the likelihood of a "Mixed ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with the prior probabilities, we update based on the evidence:

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior 25%, evidence slightly decreases this due to strong arguments against broad executive power. Posterior ~15%.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior 60%, evidence strongly supports this due to the Major Questions Doctrine and textualism. Posterior ~50%.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: Prior 15%, evidence increases this due to severability and the Court's potential preference for a narrower ruling. Posterior ~25%.
  
- **Other ruling**: Prior 5%, evidence slightly decreases this due to the expedited schedule. Posterior ~5%.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior 5%, evidence decreases this due to the expedited schedule. Posterior ~5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

Consideration of alternative scenarios suggests that a "Mixed ruling" is a strong contender due to the Court's ability to sever different tariff types. The possibility of a procedural ruling ("Other ruling") remains, but is less likely given the urgency and importance of the case.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 50%
- Mixed ruling: 25%
- Other ruling: 5%
- No 2025 ruling: 5%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 50%  
Mixed ruling: 25%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 5%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Tariffs lawful (20%):**
- Historical data suggests the government wins reversal in 40-50% of cases where it lost below, but this is reduced by the current Court's skepticism of broad executive power claims.
- The research report notes that in major statutory interpretation cases involving executive power post-2020, the Court has ruled against the executive branch 70-80% of the time.
- The Major Questions Doctrine has been consistently applied to limit executive authority in recent years.

**Tariffs unlawful (40%):**
- Two different federal courts have already ruled the tariffs unlawful.
- The Federal Circuit affirmed this ruling in a 7-4 decision.
- The Court's conservative majority has shown skepticism toward broad executive authority without clear congressional authorization.

**Mixed ruling (30%):**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically sensitive cases.
- The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible (though still tenuous) national security justification than the reciprocal tariffs.
- This provides a "path of least resistance" that allows the Court to rebuke the most extreme claims while preserving some executive flexibility.

**Other ruling (5%):**
- Procedural rulings without reaching the merits are rare when the Court has granted expedited review.
- However, the Court occasionally issues unexpected procedural rulings.

**No 2025 ruling (5%):**
- The Court has set an expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025.
- Historically, the Court issues opinions within 2-3 months of argument, making a 2025 ruling likely.
- However, complex cases can occasionally be delayed, especially if the Court is deeply divided.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- Like other major questions doctrine cases, this involves an executive branch claim of broad authority without explicit congressional authorization.
- The case follows the pattern of lower courts striking down executive action, followed by Supreme Court review.
- The Court's current composition remains skeptical of expansive executive power claims.

**Key differences:**
- The unprecedented scope of these tariffs affects trillions of dollars in commerce, making this case more economically significant than typical executive power cases.
- The national security justification provides a stronger argument for executive deference than in purely domestic regulatory cases.
- The case involves two distinct sets of tariffs with different justifications, creating more potential for a mixed ruling.
- The expedited review schedule signals the Court views this as exceptionally important.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Two different federal courts ruled the tariffs unlawful on different grounds (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.2)
- The Federal Circuit affirmed in a 7-4 decision (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- The Major Questions Doctrine provides a ready tool for invalidation (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- The textualist argument that tariffs don't "deal with" the threat is compelling (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- Traditional deference to executive on national security (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- The IEEPA explicitly grants the President power to regulate commerce during emergencies (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.5)

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically sensitive cases (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- The Court may want to preserve some executive flexibility while setting limits (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.4)

**Evidence favoring "No 2025 ruling" or "Other ruling":**
- The expedited schedule makes these outcomes unlikely (P(E|H) = 0.2, P(E|~H) = 0.8)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let me update the probability for "Tariffs unlawful" based on the evidence that two different federal courts ruled the tariffs unlawful:

Prior probability P(H) = 0.40
P(E|H) = 0.9 (Likelihood if tariffs are ruled unlawful)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (Likelihood if tariffs are not ruled unlawful)

Bayes' Rule:
P(H|E) = [P(E|H) × P(H)] / [P(E|H) × P(H) + P(E|~H) × P(~H)]
P(H|E) = [0.9 × 0.4] / [0.9 × 0.4 + 0.2 × 0.6]
P(H|E) = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.12)
P(H|E) = 0.36 / 0.48
P(H|E) = 0.75

This would suggest a dramatic increase to 75% for "Tariffs unlawful," but I need to consider other evidence and avoid overconfidence.

The Major Questions Doctrine evidence further supports "Tariffs unlawful," but the national security deference argument moderates this somewhat.

For "Mixed ruling," the evidence that the trafficking tariffs have a more plausible national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs significantly increases its probability.

After considering all evidence, I adjust my probabilities:
- Tariffs lawful: 15% (decreased from 20%)
- Tariffs unlawful: 45% (increased from 40%)
- Mixed ruling: 35% (increased from 30%)
- Other ruling: 3% (decreased from 5%)
- No 2025 ruling: 2% (decreased from 5%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to executive authority in national security matters.
- The Court's conservative majority might be more sympathetic to a Republican president's policy goals than my analysis suggests.
- I might be overestimating the importance of the Major Questions Doctrine relative to other interpretive approaches.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would give more weight to "Mixed ruling" (perhaps 45%) and less to "Tariffs unlawful" (perhaps 35%), reasoning that the Court will want to preserve executive flexibility for genuine national security threats while still setting limits on presidential power.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The textual arguments against both sets of tariffs are strong, and the Court may prefer a clean ruling that clearly delineates executive power rather than a complicated mixed ruling.

**Adjustment:**
After this red-teaming, I'll slightly increase the probability of a "Mixed ruling" at the expense of "Tariffs unlawful."

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations, my final probabilities are:
- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 42%
- Mixed ruling: 38%
- Other ruling: 3%
- No 2025 ruling: 2%

Sum: 100%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%
Tariffs unlawful: 42%
Mixed ruling: 38%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will primarily use the reference class of "Major statutory interpretation cases involving executive power (post-2020)." This class, which includes cases like *West Virginia v. EPA*, is the most relevant because the current case hinges on the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence, particularly the Major Questions Doctrine, which curtails broad executive authority derived from ambiguous statutes. This reference class suggests a 20-30% chance of the executive's interpretation being upheld. I will select a prior of **P(Tariffs lawful) = 25%**.

The remaining 75% must be distributed among the other outcomes. Given that there are two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking and reciprocal), a "Mixed ruling" is a plausible outcome. A complete rejection ("Tariffs unlawful") is also highly plausible. Procedural outcomes ("Other ruling") or delays ("No 2025 ruling") are possible but less likely after an expedited grant of certiorari.

My initial prior distribution is:
*   P(Tariffs lawful): 25%
*   P(Tariffs unlawful): 40%
*   P(Mixed ruling): 30%
*   P(Other ruling): 3%
*   P(No 2025 ruling): 2%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case strongly resembles the Major Questions Doctrine base case. The executive is claiming a transformative power—to unilaterally set broad national trade policy—based on an old, general statute (IEEPA). This is precisely the type of "elephants in mouseholes" statutory interpretation the current Court majority has rejected.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the context of national security and foreign affairs. The Court has historically granted the President significant deference in these areas. This is the government's strongest argument and distinguishes this case from purely domestic regulatory cases like *West Virginia v. EPA*. This difference pushes the probability of "Tariffs lawful" *up* compared to a purely domestic case. However, the unprecedented scope of the tariffs and the weak factual link between the tariffs and the declared emergencies (especially the "reciprocal tariffs" for trade deficits) push the probability of "Tariffs lawful" back *down*. The existence of two severable tariff policies makes a "Mixed ruling" a more probable outcome than in a case with a single, indivisible regulation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence from the research report:

*   **Evidence 1: The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) and Textualism.** The report identifies these as the primary drivers. The power to impose trillions of dollars in tariffs is a "major question." The statutory text requiring the President's action to "deal with" the threat is a high bar that the tariffs, especially the reciprocal ones, likely do not meet.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* This evidence is highly probable if the outcome is "Unlawful" or "Mixed," and much less probable if the outcome is "Lawful." The likelihood ratio P(Evidence | Unlawful or Mixed) / P(Evidence | Lawful) is very high. This strongly pushes probability *away* from "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Evidence 2: Deference to the Executive in National Security.** This is the government's main argument and the primary mechanism for a "Lawful" ruling.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* This factor is the core of the government's case. The likelihood ratio P(Evidence | Lawful) / P(Evidence | Unlawful or Mixed) is greater than 1. This is the main evidence pushing probability *towards* "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Evidence 3: Consensus of Lower Courts.** Two different federal courts have ruled the tariffs unlawful.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* While the Supreme Court is not bound by lower courts, a consensus on the outcome (even with different reasoning) signals the weakness of the government's legal position. This makes an affirmation ("Unlawful") or partial affirmation ("Mixed") more likely than a full reversal ("Lawful").

*   **Evidence 4: Severability and the "Off-Ramp" for a Mixed Ruling.** The existence of two distinct tariff regimes provides the Court a path to strike down the more legally tenuous "reciprocal tariffs" while potentially upholding the "trafficking tariffs" on national security grounds.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* This structural feature of the case doesn't favor lawful vs. unlawful per se, but it significantly increases the probability of a "Mixed ruling" relative to the other two merits outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will now update my priors based on the evidence.

*   **Initial Step:** Start with the prior P(Lawful) = 25%.
*   **Update:** The combined weight of the MQD, textualism, and lower court consensus (Evidence 1 & 3) is extremely strong. Let's estimate this evidence makes an unlawful/mixed outcome four times more likely. The prior odds for Lawful were 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3. The new odds become (1/3) * (1/4) = 1/12. This corresponds to a probability of P(Lawful) ≈ 8%.
*   **Counter-Update:** Now, consider the counter-evidence of national security deference (Evidence 2). This is a significant factor that could sway key justices. Let's say this evidence makes a lawful outcome twice as likely. The odds of 1/12 become (1/12) * 2 = 2/12 = 1/6. This corresponds to a final probability of P(Lawful) = (1/6) / (1 + 1/6) = 1/7 ≈ 14%.

This is a significant downward revision from the 25% prior. The remaining 86% must be distributed among the other options. The expedited schedule makes "No 2025 ruling" very unlikely (I'll set it to 1%). An "Other ruling" is also unlikely but possible (2%). This leaves 83% for "Unlawful" and "Mixed." The severability of the tariffs (Evidence 4) makes a "Mixed ruling" a very plausible path for judicial compromise. However, the legal arguments against *both* tariff regimes are powerful, making a complete rejection ("Unlawful") also highly likely. I will assign a slightly higher probability to a complete rejection, as a consistent application of the MQD would likely invalidate both schemes.

*   P(Unlawful): 42%
*   P(Mixed): 41%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I am forecasting that the government has a high chance (83%) of losing at least in part. Could I be wrong? The primary reason for an upset would be if a majority of the Court (likely including Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett) decides that the national security context of IEEPA makes it fundamentally different from the domestic statutes in prior MQD cases, granting the President the broad deference he claims. This is a plausible alternative view. To account for this, I will shift a few percentage points from "Unlawful" and "Mixed" to "Lawful."

*   Increase P(Lawful) from 14% to 18%.
*   Decrease P(Unlawful) from 42% to 40%.
*   Decrease P(Mixed) from 41% to 39%.
*   Keep P(Other) at 2% and P(No 2025 ruling) at 1%.

This revised distribution still reflects that the tariffs are likely unlawful but gives more weight to the strongest counterargument. The split between "Unlawful" and "Mixed" remains very close, reflecting the deep uncertainty over whether the Court will seek a compromise or issue a sweeping ruling.

### 6. Final Normalization

My final probabilities are:
*   Tariffs lawful: 18%
*   Tariffs unlawful: 40%
*   Mixed ruling: 39%
*   Other ruling: 2%
*   No 2025 ruling: 1%
*   **Total: 100%**

The probabilities are normalized and reflect the reasoning above.

Tariffs lawful: 18%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 39%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
