### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Uncontested COP Host Selection within a Regional Group:** In most years, the designated regional group internally agrees on a single candidate who is then formally endorsed. This is the standard, frictionless process.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~80-90%. This is the most common scenario for COP hosting decisions.
    *   **Reasoning:** The rotational system is designed to be collegial. Regional groups typically pre-negotiate to present a unified front, avoiding public disputes.
2.  **Contested COP Host Selection within a Regional Group:** A situation where two or more members from the same regional group launch formal bids and cannot immediately agree. This is a rarer and more complex scenario.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~10-20%.
    *   **Reasoning:** These situations arise from geopolitical rivalries or competing interests within a group. They are typically resolved through intense negotiation, with one candidate withdrawing, or a compromise being reached. The recent selection of Azerbaijan for COP29 after a deadlock in the Eastern European Group is a prime example of a compromise resolution.
3.  **Default to Bonn, Germany due to No Consensus:** The outcome if a regional group completely fails to achieve consensus on a host.
    *   **Base Rate:** <5%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the "failure" option. It represents a political breakdown within the regional group and is an outcome all parties are strongly incentivized to avoid. While a credible threat that shapes negotiations, it has rarely materialized for a full COP.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-13** Australia submits its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC. — **↑ Australia** — Demonstrates climate ambition and leadership, a key implicit requirement for a COP host, strengthening its bid's credibility.
*   **2025-09-22** Australia's COP31 bid and new, ambitious 2035 emissions targets are highlighted at the UN General Assembly. — **↑ Australia** — Signals a high-level, sustained political push and international campaign for its bid.
*   **2025-07-28** UN officials are reported to be pressing Turkey and Australia to resolve the deadlock. — **↓ Germany** — Indicates external pressure on the WEOG group to find a candidate and avoid the default Bonn option, making a negotiated outcome more likely.
*   **2024-11-26** The decision on the COP31 host is officially postponed from COP29. — **↔ Neutral/Stalemate** — Confirmed the deadlock was serious and could not be resolved quickly, entrenching the two competing bids.
*   **2024-11-20** Reports emerge of a "standoff" between Australia and Turkey, noting Australia has significant support but lacks the required consensus. — **↔ Neutral/Stalemate** — Established the core dynamic of the contest: Australia's likely majority support vs. the hard constraint of the consensus rule.
*   **2024-10-17** South Australia formally launches its bid for Adelaide to host. — **↑ Australia** — Solidified the logistical and financial commitment from the proposed host state, making the bid more concrete.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Consensus Rule:** (Large) The single most important driver. Any of the 28 WEOG members, including Turkey, can veto a proposal. This transforms the decision from a majority vote into a negotiation where a single actor can block the frontrunner.
2.  **Geopolitical Alliances & Horse-Trading:** (Large) The decision is inherently political. Support for a bid may be traded for support on other, unrelated UN matters or geopolitical issues. Turkey's relationships with specific European nations and the US are critical.
3.  **Narrative and Symbolic Value:** (Moderate) Australia's bid, co-hosted with vulnerable Pacific Island nations, has a powerful, climate-centric narrative. This aligns well with the goals of the Paris Agreement and resonates strongly with many nations, creating soft power and diplomatic pressure.
4.  **Host Country Climate Credibility:** (Moderate) A host country is expected to lead by example. Australia's recently strengthened climate targets (NDCs) are a significant asset. Conversely, any perceived hypocrisy (e.g., new fossil fuel projects) could be used against it in negotiations.
5.  **Pressure to Avoid Group Failure:** (Moderate) The WEOG group has a collective interest in not failing to select a host, which would be a minor international embarrassment. This pressure incentivizes compromise and pushes the parties away from the Bonn default scenario.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Prolonged Public Standoff:** Unlike typical, quiet internal negotiations, this contest has been a public and prolonged standoff for over a year. This suggests both sides are deeply entrenched and believe they have a viable path to success or leverage.
*   **Innovative Co-Host Model:** The Australia-Pacific partnership is a significant departure from the standard single-host-country model. It introduces new actors (Pacific nations) and a powerful moral and political argument that is unusual for these contests.
*   **Diverse and Complex Regional Group:** WEOG is a uniquely heterogeneous group, including Western Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey. This creates more complex political dynamics than in more geographically or culturally cohesive groups.
*   **Explicit Threat of Default Host:** The Bonn/Germany option is being discussed more openly than is typical, indicating the genuine risk of deadlock and its use as a negotiating threat by the UNFCCC and potentially by the bidders themselves.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior would place Australia as the slight favorite due to its strong narrative and reported support, but with high uncertainty. E.g., Australia 45%, Turkey 35%, Germany 15%, Other 5%. This reflects a competitive race where the consensus rule prevents a clear frontrunner. (Equivalent n ≈ 10, low confidence).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Australia's co-bid with Pacific nations provides a compelling narrative that is difficult for other developed nations in WEOG to oppose publicly.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Australia's recent submission of an ambitious 2035 NDC strengthens its credentials and leadership claim at a critical moment.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The consensus mechanism is a hard barrier. As long as Turkey does not concede, Australia's majority support is insufficient. The persistence of the deadlock confirms Turkey's resolve.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The postponement of the decision from COP29 to a later date suggests that Australia's momentum was not enough to force a quick resolution, giving Turkey more time to negotiate.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The lack of public withdrawal by Turkey after more than a year implies they have secured enough backing (or have enough leverage) to prevent consensus and believe they can still win or force a major concession.
*   **Net effect:** Recent evidence slightly favors Australia (new NDCs, high-level political push). However, the structural reality of the consensus rule remains the dominant factor, capping Australia's probability. The posterior should shift slightly towards Australia, but the probability for Turkey should remain high, and the chance of a German default remains a significant possibility. The overall uncertainty is still very high.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support for the Australian bid from major WEOG powers (e.g., France, Germany, UK, Canada).
    *   Reports of a "package deal" where Turkey agrees to withdraw in exchange for support for a future bid or another UN position.
    *   A high-profile, coordinated diplomatic push by Pacific Island leaders at COP30.
    *   Turkey's state media going quiet on their COP31 bid.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Any major WEOG member publicly expressing neutrality or preference for Turkey's bid.
    *   Reports of Turkey securing support from a bloc of countries within WEOG.
    *   UNFCCC officials beginning to speak more openly about the logistical preparations for a Bonn conference.
    *   Negative international headlines about Australian domestic climate policy (e.g., approval of new fossil fuel infrastructure).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Negotiations:** The final decision will be made in closed-door WEOG meetings. Public statements can be posturing; the real deal-making is hidden from view.
*   **Geopolitical Linkages:** The outcome could be determined by factors entirely unrelated to climate change, such as trade, security partnerships, or other diplomatic horse-trading.
*   **Compromise Candidate Risk:** While not currently on the table, a deadlock could theoretically be broken by a third WEOG country emerging as a compromise candidate (the "Other" option).
*   **Resolution Timing:** The decision is expected "before COP30" (Nov 2025), but continued deadlock could push the decision into 2026, increasing uncertainty.
*   **Definition of "Host":** The bid is "Australia in partnership with Pacific nations." The resolution will be "Australia" if Adelaide is the host city. There is a very small chance the partnership is formalized in a way

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the strong narrative and support for Australia's bid, a prior of 45% is reasonable. This reflects Australia's significant backing and climate leadership, but acknowledges the consensus rule's barrier.
- **Turkey**: With Turkey being the only other official bid and the consensus rule allowing them to block Australia's bid, a prior of 35% is appropriate. This reflects Turkey's potential leverage in negotiations.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: As the default host city in case of no consensus, a prior of 15% is reasonable. This accounts for the possibility of a deadlock.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Since no specific bid from another Pacific Island nation is mentioned, this option is unlikely. A prior of 2% is reasonable, acknowledging the co-hosting model but its low likelihood of being the sole host.
- **Other**: The possibility of another country emerging as a compromise candidate is very low, given the current dynamics. A prior of 3% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The situation is similar to the base case of a strong candidate with significant support. However, the consensus rule and Turkey's bid create a unique challenge.
- **Turkey**: Similar to a contested scenario where a country can leverage the consensus rule. The prolonged standoff is unusual but not unprecedented.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: The open discussion of Bonn as a fallback is more prominent than usual, indicating a higher risk of deadlock.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely given the current bids, but the co-hosting model introduces a new dynamic.
- **Other**: The emergence of a new candidate is rare, but possible in a deadlock scenario.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**:
  - **Likelihood of Evidence**: High for Australia's bid being strong (new NDCs, political push).
  - **Likelihood if Not True**: Moderate, as these efforts could still be part of a broader diplomatic strategy.
- **Turkey**:
  - **Likelihood of Evidence**: High for Turkey maintaining its bid (no withdrawal, geopolitical leverage).
  - **Likelihood if Not True**: Low, as Turkey would likely have withdrawn if it had no chance.
- **Germany (Bonn)**:
  - **Likelihood of Evidence**: Moderate, given the open discussion of Bonn as a fallback.
  - **Likelihood if Not True**: Low, as Bonn is only considered if no consensus is reached.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**:
  - **Likelihood of Evidence**: Low, as no specific bid is mentioned.
  - **Likelihood if Not True**: High, as the co-hosting model is primarily led by Australia.
- **Other**:
  - **Likelihood of Evidence**: Very low, as no other bids are currently known.
  - **Likelihood if Not True**: High, as the current bids are well-established.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 45/55. Likelihood ratio slightly favors Australia due to recent NDCs and political push. Posterior odds increase slightly.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 35/65. Likelihood ratio supports Turkey's continued bid. Posterior odds remain stable.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: Prior odds = 15/85. Likelihood ratio slightly increases due to deadlock risk. Posterior odds increase slightly.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Prior odds = 2/98. Likelihood ratio does not favor this option. Posterior odds decrease slightly.
- **Other**: Prior odds = 3/97. Likelihood ratio does not favor this option. Posterior odds decrease slightly.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Ensure probabilities reflect the high uncertainty and potential for negotiation outcomes.
- **Tail Risks**: Consider the possibility of a compromise candidate or unexpected geopolitical shifts.
- **Alternative Forecast**: A plausible alternative is Turkey leveraging geopolitical alliances to secure the bid. Adjust probabilities to reflect this possibility.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 47%  
Turkey: 33%  
Germany: 16%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%  
Other: 2%

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on the WEOG rotation and historical patterns:

**Australia**: 
- Prior: 40%
- Rationale: Australia has a formal bid with significant reported support, Pacific Island partnership narrative, and recent climate commitment strengthening. In contested bids, the country with broader support typically prevails.

**Turkey**:
- Prior: 35%
- Rationale: Turkey has a formal bid and the consensus requirement gives them significant blocking power. Their persistence suggests they have meaningful support or leverage.

**Germany**:
- Prior: 20%
- Rationale: As the default option (Bonn) if consensus fails, this has a non-trivial probability. Historical deadlocks in regional groups occasionally result in default locations.

**Another Pacific Island Nation**:
- Prior: 3%
- Rationale: While part of Australia's co-hosting proposal, the likelihood of a Pacific Island becoming the primary host is very low given infrastructure requirements.

**Other**:
- Prior: 2%
- Rationale: A compromise WEOG candidate emerging is possible but unlikely given the advanced stage of negotiations.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical COP host selection:**
- Follows the established regional rotation system (WEOG's turn)
- Formal bids submitted through proper channels
- Decision expected before the preceding COP

**Key differences:**
- Unusually public and prolonged standoff (over a year)
- Novel co-hosting arrangement proposed by Australia
- Explicit discussion of the default option (Bonn)
- Higher geopolitical tensions within WEOG than typical

These differences increase uncertainty and raise the probability of both the default option (Germany) and potential compromise solutions.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring Australia:**
- Co-hosting with Pacific Islands creates a compelling climate justice narrative (P(E|Australia) = 0.9, P(E|~Australia) = 0.1)
- Recent submission of ambitious 2035 NDC strengthens climate leadership credentials (P(E|Australia) = 0.8, P(E|~Australia) = 0.3)
- South Australia's formal commitment of funds and feasibility studies (P(E|Australia) = 0.9, P(E|~Australia) = 0.2)
- High-profile promotion at UN General Assembly (P(E|Australia) = 0.7, P(E|~Australia) = 0.3)

**Evidence favoring Turkey:**
- Continued persistence in bid despite reported Australian support (P(E|Turkey) = 0.8, P(E|~Turkey) = 0.3)
- Consensus requirement gives Turkey effective veto power (P(E|Turkey) = 0.6, P(E|~Turkey) = 0.6) - neutral evidence
- Postponement of decision from COP29 suggests Turkey has sufficient backing to prevent quick resolution (P(E|Turkey) = 0.7, P(E|~Turkey) = 0.4)

**Evidence favoring Germany:**
- Explicit mention of Bonn as default option in official discussions (P(E|Germany) = 0.7, P(E|~Germany) = 0.3)
- Prolonged deadlock increases likelihood of falling back to default (P(E|Germany) = 0.8, P(E|~Germany) = 0.2)
- UN officials pressing for resolution suggests real concern about default scenario (P(E|Germany) = 0.6, P(E|~Germany) = 0.4)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on Australia's recent NDC submission and high-level diplomatic push:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 40%
- Prior odds: 40/60 = 0.67
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 2.67 = 1.79
- Posterior probability: 1.79/(1+1.79) = 64%

However, we must also update on the consensus requirement and Turkey's persistence:

- Posterior probability from above: 64%
- Posterior odds: 64/36 = 1.78
- Likelihood ratio for Turkey's persistence: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67
- Adjusted posterior odds: 1.78 × (1/2.67) = 0.67
- Adjusted posterior probability: 0.67/(1+0.67) = 40%

This brings us back near our prior, reflecting the balanced nature of the evidence.

For Germany, the prolonged deadlock increases its probability:
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio for prolonged deadlock: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 4 = 1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+1) = 50%

However, this is too high given the pressure to avoid the default option. Adjusting for the UN pressure to resolve:
- Posterior probability from above: 50%
- Posterior odds: 50/50 = 1
- Likelihood ratio for UN pressure: 0.6/0.4 = 1.5
- Adjusted posterior odds: 1 × (1/1.5) = 0.67
- Adjusted posterior probability: 0.67/(1+0.67) = 40%

This seems too high still, as the default option remains a last resort. Further qualitative adjustment brings Germany to ~25%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the power of backroom diplomatic deals that could suddenly resolve the standoff
- The consensus requirement may be more flexible in practice than in theory
- I might be overestimating Australia's reported support without seeing concrete endorsements
- Turkey's geopolitical leverage within WEOG could be stronger than public reporting suggests

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A compromise where Turkey withdraws in exchange for hosting a future COP or another major UN event
- A formal co-hosting arrangement where both countries share responsibilities
- A third WEOG country emerging as a compromise candidate at the last minute

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly increase Turkey's probability given the power of the consensus requirement
- Slightly decrease Germany's probability given the strong incentives to avoid the default
- Maintain a non-zero probability for "Other" to account for compromise candidates

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:

Australia: 42%
Turkey: 30%
Germany: 23%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 42%
Turkey: 30%
Germany: 23%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The selection of a COP host rotates between five UN regional groups. The process *within* a group provides the relevant reference class.

*   **Scenario A: Uncontested Selection.** A single candidate emerges from the regional group and is approved by consensus. This is the most common scenario. Base Rate: ~85%.
*   **Scenario B: Contested Selection.** Two or more candidates from the same group compete. This is less common and requires negotiation, compromise, or one party withdrawing. Base Rate: ~10-15%.
*   **Scenario C: Failed Selection (Default to Bonn).** The regional group cannot reach a consensus, and the conference defaults to the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany. This is a rare failure state. Base Rate: <5%.

The current situation for COP 31 is firmly in **Scenario B: Contested Selection**. Therefore, our priors should be based on the likely outcomes of such a contest, not the overall frequency of contests. In a two-way contest governed by a consensus rule, the outcomes are not 50/50. The frontrunner has an advantage, but the challenger has significant blocking power. A reasonable prior distribution for the outcome of a contested bid might be:

*   **Frontrunner Wins (Australia):** 50%
*   **Challenger Wins (Turkey):** 30%
*   **Deadlock/Default (Germany):** 15%
*   **Compromise/Other Candidate Emerges (Other):** 5%
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** 0% (This is part of Australia's bid, not a separate one).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case follows the pattern of a contested bid where geopolitical negotiations within a regional group are paramount. The consensus rule is the key mechanism, as seen in past deadlocks (e.g., the Eastern European Group for COP29).
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Heterogeneous Group:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is uniquely diverse (Western Europe, US, Canada, Australia, NZ, Israel, Turkey), making consensus potentially harder to achieve than in more geographically or politically cohesive groups. This slightly increases the probability of deadlock (Germany).
    2.  **Unique Bid Structure:** Australia's proposal to co-host with Pacific Island nations is novel. This creates a powerful moral and political narrative ("giving a voice to the most vulnerable") that is difficult for other developed nations in WEOG to oppose openly. This significantly strengthens Australia's position compared to a standard bid.
    3.  **Prolonged Public Standoff:** The contest has been public and unresolved for over a year. This indicates both sides are deeply entrenched, which also increases the probability of a persistent deadlock that could lead to the Bonn default.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probabilities.

*   **Evidence 1: Australia's co-bid with Pacific Island nations.**
    *   P(E | Australia wins): High. This narrative is a major asset, creating soft power and making it politically costly for other WEOG members to block the bid.
    *   P(E | ~Australia wins): Low. This narrative puts significant pressure on Turkey and any potential supporters, making their opposition harder to maintain.
    *   **Impact:** Strongly increases the probability for Australia.

*   **Evidence 2: The consensus rule and Turkey's persistent bid.**
    *   P(E | Turkey wins): High. Turkey's continued candidacy is only viable *because* of the consensus rule. It demonstrates they have enough leverage or backing to block Australia indefinitely.
    *   P(E | Australia wins): Moderate. For Australia to win, they must convince Turkey to stand down. The persistence of the bid is evidence that this has not yet happened and may not.
    *   **Impact:** This is the strongest piece of evidence *against* Australia being a runaway favorite. It significantly increases the probability for Turkey (as a spoiler or winner) and Germany (as the default).

*   **Evidence 3: Australia's recent high-level diplomatic push and ambitious 2035 targets (NDC).**
    *   P(E | Australia wins): High. This is precisely the action a serious candidate would take to demonstrate leadership and build momentum.
    *   P(E | Turkey wins): Moderate. Australia would likely update its NDC regardless, but the high-profile campaign is more indicative of a winning effort.
    *   **Impact:** Moderately increases the probability for Australia.

*   **Evidence 4: The decision was postponed from COP29, and UN officials are pressing for a resolution.**
    *   P(E | Germany wins): High. This is a clear signal of a serious, prolonged deadlock, which is the direct pathway to a Bonn COP.
    *   P(E | Australia or Turkey wins): Moderate. It shows that neither side could force a resolution, confirming the stalemate. It slightly favors the challenger (Turkey) by giving them more time to negotiate.
    *   **Impact:** Increases the probability for Germany and, to a lesser extent, Turkey, while decreasing it for Australia.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with the prior: Australia 50%, Turkey 30%, Germany 15%, Other 5%.

1.  **Update for Australia's strong narrative (Pacific partnership) and recent diplomatic push:** This is powerful evidence. It likely shifts the odds in Australia's favor. Let's move 10 percentage points towards Australia, primarily from Turkey and Germany.
    *   *Intermediate probabilities:* Australia 60%, Turkey 25%, Germany 12%, Other 3%.

2.  **Update for the prolonged deadlock, consensus rule, and postponement:** This is strong counter-evidence, showing the power of Turkey's blocking position and the real risk of failure. This pushes probability away from the frontrunner (Australia) and towards the blocker (Turkey) and the default (Germany). This effect is significant, likely reversing the previous gain and then some. Let's move 20 points away from Australia.
    *   Where does it go? The deadlock directly benefits Turkey's leverage and makes the Germany scenario more plausible. Let's assign +11 to Turkey and +9 to Germany.
    *   *Posterior probabilities:* Australia (60-20) = 40%, Turkey (25+11) = 36%, Germany (12+9) = 21%, Other remains ~3%.

This leaves Australia as the slight favorite, but highlights that Turkey has a very strong chance of either winning or forcing a deadlock, making the Germany outcome a major possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast shows a tight race with high uncertainty. Is there a blind spot?

*   **Over-weighting the narrative:** Am I, like many Western observers, too swayed by the Australia-Pacific narrative? The decision is made by diplomats in a closed room, where hard geopolitical interests (e.g., Turkey's relationship with key EU states, its role in NATO, other UN horse-trading) could easily outweigh the "soft power" of a good story. Turkey's persistence suggests they believe their geopolitical leverage is sufficient. This suggests the odds between Australia and Turkey might be even closer.
*   **The "Compromise Candidate" (Other):** If the deadlock becomes truly toxic, could a third party like Canada or New Zealand be asked to step in to save face for the WEOG group? This is a plausible, though low-probability, path to resolution. I have this at 2-3%, which seems reasonable.
*   **"Another Pacific Island Nation":** The bid is formally "Australia in partnership with Pacific nations," with Adelaide as the host city. For this option to resolve, the bid would have to be fundamentally changed to a Pacific Island nation being the primary host, which is extremely unlikely. I will assign this a minimal probability.

Considering the red team analysis, the gap between Australia and Turkey may be even smaller than my posterior suggests. I will slightly adjust my final numbers to reflect this heightened uncertainty and Turkey's strong blocking power. I will reduce Australia by 2% and add it to Turkey.

### 6. Final Normalization

After the final adjustment, the probabilities are:

*   **Australia:** 38% (Slight favorite due to strong narrative and broad support, but faces a hard veto).
*   **Turkey:** 38% (Almost equal chance due to the power of the consensus rule, allowing them to block and negotiate from a strong position).
*   **Germany:** 21% (A very significant probability, as a prolonged and intractable deadlock is a plausible outcome).
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** 1% (A tail risk representing a fundamental, unexpected restructuring of the current bid).
*   **Other:** 2% (Represents the small chance of a compromise candidate emerging to break the deadlock).

The sum is 38 + 38 + 21 + 1 + 2 = 100%. This distribution reflects a situation with no clear favorite and a high degree of uncertainty. I've made Australia and Turkey co-favorites to reflect the tension between Australia's broader support and Turkey's veto power.

### Output Format

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 38%
Germany: 21%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 2%
