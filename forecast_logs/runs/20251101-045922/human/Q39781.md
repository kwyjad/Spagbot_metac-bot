### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoE) under President Noboa (Nov 2023 - Present):** Since taking office, Noboa has frequently used SoEs to address security and social crises. This includes a nationwide (24 provinces) SoE in January 2024 for gang violence and the current, more targeted SoE (16 provinces) for social protests. In this reference class, the government has a low threshold for declaring an SoE. The base rate for *any given day* having at least one province in an SoE is high, perhaps 40-50%. The number of provinces is typically bimodal: either nationwide (24) for major security crises or targeted (10-16 provinces) for protests concentrated in the Andean and Amazonian regions.
2.  **SoEs in Ecuador for Social Protests (2019-Present):** Major indigenous-led protests in 2019, 2022, and now 2025 have all prompted SoE declarations. These are typically not nationwide but focus on provinces with high protest activity. The base rate suggests that if major protests are active or imminent, an SoE covering 10-16 key provinces is a likely outcome. These SoEs are often declared for 60 days and may or may not be renewed depending on negotiations.
3.  **SoEs in Latin American countries with high organized crime (2020-Present):** Countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Ecuador have increasingly used SoEs to grant expanded powers to security forces. These are often long-lasting, repeatedly renewed, and frequently nationwide. This class suggests that once a government adopts a "mano dura" (iron fist) security policy, SoEs become a semi-permanent governance tool. The base rate here points towards a higher probability of a nationwide (24 province) SoE being in effect.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** Alleged assassination attempt on President Noboa during protests in Cañar province. — ↑ — Hardens the government's stance, making a negotiated settlement less likely and justifying a continued security-focused response to protests.
*   **2025-10-06** SoE expanded from 10 to 16 provinces to include key coastal regions and others. — ↑ — Demonstrates the government's willingness to broaden the scope of the SoE in response to spreading unrest, setting a precedent for wider application.
*   **2025-10-04** Noboa declares a 60-day SoE in 10 provinces due to protests over subsidy cuts. — ↑ — Establishes the current baseline. The 60-day duration means this specific decree will expire in early December, before the resolution date.
*   **2025-10-04** Noboa administration explicitly links protests to the Tren de Aragua cartel. — ↑ — This rhetoric conflates social protest with terrorism, providing a strong justification for extending or re-issuing an SoE on national security grounds.
*   **2024-01-09** Noboa declared a nationwide "internal armed conflict" in response to gang violence. — ↑ — This foundational policy shift remains in effect and provides the legal and political framework for rapid, widespread military deployment, making future SoEs easier to implement.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Protest Escalation/De-escalation:** The primary driver for a protest-related SoE. If negotiations between the government and indigenous groups (like CONAIE) fail and protests resume or intensify in December, a new SoE is highly probable. (Size: Large)
2.  **Major Security Incident:** A large-scale prison riot, escape of a high-level narco leader (like 'Fito' in 2024), or a high-profile political assassination would almost certainly trigger an immediate, nationwide (24 province) SoE. (Size: Large)
3.  **Noboa's Political Strategy:** Noboa's high approval ratings are tied to his tough security stance. He may use an SoE as a tool to project strength and control the political narrative, especially if facing other challenges. His incentive is to appear decisive. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Economic Pressures:** The underlying cause of the protests (fuel subsidy cuts) stems from the government's need to meet fiscal targets, possibly related to IMF agreements. This pressure is unlikely to disappear, making a full policy reversal and lasting peace difficult to achieve. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Season Dynamics:** The government may be more inclined to impose an SoE to prevent disruptive protests during the economically important Christmas season. Conversely, protest movements may strategically pause during this period, reducing the immediate need for an SoE. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **"Internal Armed Conflict" Framework:** Unlike previous administrations, Noboa's government operates under a self-declared "internal armed conflict," which normalizes military involvement in public security and lowers the political cost of declaring SoEs.
*   **Conflation of Protests and Organized Crime:** The government's explicit and repeated linking of indigenous protesters to transnational cartels is a significant rhetorical escalation. This tactic attempts to delegitimize the protests and justify a military response over a political one.
*   **President's High Approval & Security Focus:** Noboa enjoys significant political capital derived almost entirely from his security-first agenda. This gives him more latitude and incentive to use exceptional measures compared to his less popular predecessors who faced similar protests.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The resolution date is less than two months away. This means the current crisis dynamics are paramount. The key question is not if an SoE will happen in the next year, but if the current one will be extended/re-issued or if a new crisis will erupt in the next 7 weeks. The inertia of the current crisis is a powerful factor not present in a generic base rate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on recent Ecuadorian history should be centered on 0 but have thick tails, with significant probability mass around 10-16 provinces (protest-driven SoE) and at 24 provinces (security-driven SoE). An equivalent n of ~10 observations seems appropriate, reflecting a volatile but patterned environment.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The current SoE will expire just before Dec 25, but the root cause (subsidy cuts) is unresolved, making a December flare-up and a new SoE highly plausible.
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's established pattern of using SoEs and his "internal armed conflict" framework make it his default crisis response tool.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The government's rhetoric linking protesters to cartels makes de-escalation difficult and a security response more likely.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The underlying gang-related security crisis is unabated and could trigger a nationwide SoE at any moment, independent of the protests.
    *   (↓ Small) An SoE is an exceptional measure, and there is always a baseline chance of a return to normalcy, especially if negotiations make progress or protests pause for the holidays.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision from a simple base rate. The probability of the outcome being 0 should decrease significantly. The posterior distribution should be multi-modal, with peaks at 0 (but lower than the prior), ~16 (a renewed protest-related SoE), and 24 (a new security-related SoE).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from CONAIE or other social movements calling for a new national strike in late November or December.
    *   A significant prison riot or the assassination of a prosecutor, judge, or mayor.
    *   Breakdown of dialogue between the government and protest leaders.
    *   Government announcements of further austerity measures.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A formal, signed agreement between the government and indigenous leaders on fuel subsidies.
    *   A period of sustained calm with no major security incidents through November.
    *   Statements from the government emphasizing dialogue and de-escalation.
    *   Successful, high-profile arrests of gang leaders without triggering widespread violence.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** Resolution requires a formal, decreed "state of emergency." Be cautious not to confuse this with localized military/police interventions or "militarized zones" which may not meet the formal criteria.
*   **Extreme Volatility:** The security situation is a tinderbox. A single event, like the TV station attack in 2024, can change the country's status in hours. The forecast is highly sensitive to unpredictable "black swan" events.
*   **Renewal vs. New Declaration:** The current SoE expires in early December. The outcome on Dec 25 depends on either a formal extension, a brief lapse followed by a new declaration, or a completely new SoE for a different reason. The exact mechanism matters less than the outcome.
*   **Information Reliability:** Initial reports on violence or political events in Ecuador can be contradictory. Government and opposition sources will have competing narratives.

**Final Research Summary:** The current state of emergency is set to expire before the resolution date, but the underlying drivers—unresolved social protests and a persistent severe security crisis—remain potent. President Noboa's demonstrated preference for "iron fist" policies makes a renewal or a new declaration for either reason a high-probability outcome, suggesting a forecast distribution with significant weight on 0, 16, or 24 provinces.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is informed by the historical use of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, particularly under President Noboa. The base rate distribution is bimodal, with peaks at 0 provinces (no SoE) and 10-16 provinces (protest-driven SoE), and a significant probability at 24 provinces (nationwide SoE). This reflects the frequent use of SoEs for both security and protest-related issues. The mean of this distribution might be around 8-12 provinces, with a wide variance due to the bimodal nature.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the base case in that there is ongoing unrest and security concerns, which have historically led to SoEs. However, the explicit linking of protests to organized crime and the "internal armed conflict" framework are significant differences that could increase the likelihood of a nationwide SoE.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The unresolved subsidy cuts and recent escalation in violence make a new SoE likely, increasing the probability of 10-16 provinces being affected.
   - Noboa's rhetoric and political strategy suggest a higher likelihood of a nationwide SoE (24 provinces) if security issues escalate.
   - The holiday season might slightly reduce the likelihood of protests, but the government's need to maintain order could counteract this.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with the prior distribution, the evidence of unresolved protests and security threats increases the probability of both 16 and 24 provinces being under SoE. The likelihood of 0 provinces decreases due to the persistent unrest.
   - The posterior distribution will have peaks at 0 (lower than prior), around 16, and at 24 provinces, reflecting the increased likelihood of a significant SoE.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of a peaceful resolution or a temporary de-escalation due to holiday dynamics, which could increase the probability of 0 provinces under SoE.
   - Conversely, a major security incident could push the distribution towards 24 provinces.
   - Adjust the forecast to account for these tail risks and ensure the distribution reflects the current volatile environment.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the percentiles are calculated to reflect the bimodal nature and the increased likelihood of significant SoEs.

P10: 0  
P20: 8  
P40: 16

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Recent states of emergency (SoE) in Ecuador under President Noboa (2023-2025)
- Nationwide SoE (24 provinces) in January 2024 for gang violence
- Current SoE (16 provinces) for protests against subsidy cuts
- Prior SoEs in specific provinces for security concerns

This suggests a multi-modal distribution with peaks at:
- 0 provinces (no SoE in effect)
- ~10-16 provinces (targeted SoE for regional protests)
- 24 provinces (nationwide SoE for major security threats)

The prior mean is approximately 10-12 provinces, with high variance reflecting the bimodal nature of SoE declarations in Ecuador.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Same president (Noboa) with established pattern of using SoEs as governance tools
- Ongoing security challenges from organized crime and cartels
- Similar economic pressures driving subsidy cuts and resulting protests
- Indigenous-led protest movements with similar grievances and tactics

**Key differences**:
- The current 60-day SoE declared on October 4, 2025 will expire in early December, before our resolution date
- Noboa has escalated rhetoric by linking protesters to cartels, raising stakes
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa creates a new security justification
- The December 25 date falls during holiday season, which may affect both government and protest dynamics

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher number of provinces under SoE**:
- Current SoE covers 16 provinces and was expanded from initial 10, showing willingness to broaden scope (+2)
- Noboa's rhetoric linking protests to Tren de Aragua cartel creates justification for security-based SoE (+3)
- The alleged assassination attempt provides strong pretext for continued emergency measures (+3)
- Noboa's political brand is built on security-first governance, creating incentives to maintain SoEs (+2)
- The underlying economic issues (subsidy cuts) remain unresolved, suggesting protests could resume (+2)

**Evidence for lower number of provinces under SoE**:
- SoEs are technically temporary measures that require renewal or new justification (-1)
- Holiday season might reduce protest activity temporarily (-1)
- International pressure against prolonged emergency measures (-1)
- Possibility of negotiated settlement with indigenous leaders (-2)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 10-12 provinces with significant probability mass at 0 and 24:

**First update**: The current SoE will expire before December 25, requiring either renewal or a new declaration. This shifts probability mass toward 0, but less than might be expected because:
- Noboa has shown a pattern of renewing or quickly declaring new SoEs
- The "internal armed conflict" framework established in January 2024 normalizes exceptional measures

**Second update**: The evidence of escalating rhetoric and the assassination attempt strongly shifts probability mass upward, particularly toward either:
- 16 provinces (renewal of current protest-related SoE)
- 24 provinces (expansion to nationwide SoE justified by security threats)

The posterior distribution now has three distinct peaks:
- ~20% probability at 0 provinces (no active SoE on December 25)
- ~40% probability around 16 provinces (renewed protest-related SoE)
- ~25% probability at 24 provinces (nationwide security-based SoE)
- ~15% probability distributed across other values

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overestimating the government's willingness to maintain SoEs during Christmas, which is culturally significant in Ecuador
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a negotiated settlement before December
- The situation is highly volatile - a single major security incident could trigger a nationwide SoE
- I may be overlooking the possibility of a partial reduction in scope (e.g., from 16 to 8 provinces)

**Alternative forecast**: A reasonable alternative would be a distribution more heavily weighted toward 0 provinces, arguing that:
- SoEs are meant to be temporary
- The holiday season provides natural incentives for de-escalation
- The government might prefer to avoid emergency measures during Christmas

However, this alternative underestimates Noboa's established pattern of using SoEs and the unresolved nature of both the security crisis and the economic grievances driving protests.

After consideration, I'll slightly increase probability mass at 0 and decrease at 24 to account for holiday considerations.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 10

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the number of provinces in Ecuador under a state of emergency on December 25, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the use of States of Emergency (SoEs) under President Daniel Noboa's administration (November 2023 - present). This period is characterized by a dual threat: severe organized crime and significant social unrest. This has led to a bimodal pattern of SoE declarations:
1.  **Nationwide Security SoE:** A 24-province SoE, as seen in January 2024, in response to a major gang-related security crisis.
2.  **Targeted Protest SoE:** An SoE covering 10-16 provinces, as seen in October 2025, in response to indigenous-led protests, primarily in the Andean and Amazonian regions.

Given that SoEs are temporary, the default state on any given day is zero. A reasonable prior distribution, reflecting this volatile pattern, would be:
*   P(0 provinces) = 60% (baseline state of normalcy)
*   P(10-18 provinces) = 25% (protest-driven scenario)
*   P(24 provinces) = 15% (nationwide security crisis scenario)

This prior has a median of 0 but a mean pulled upwards by the high-impact, high-province-count events.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns well with the base case, as it involves one of the primary triggers (social protest). However, there are critical differences:
*   **Proximity to Resolution Date:** The forecast is for December 25, 2025, less than two months from the context date (November 1, 2025). This means the dynamics of the current crisis are paramount.
*   **Expiration of Current SoE:** The 60-day SoE declared in early October will expire in early December, before the resolution date. Therefore, the outcome cannot be a simple continuation; it must be a *renewal* or a *new declaration*.
*   **"Internal Armed Conflict" Framework:** Noboa's government operates under a declared "internal armed conflict," which normalizes military responses and lowers the political threshold for declaring SoEs compared to previous administrations.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several pieces of evidence strongly suggest the probability of an SoE on Dec 25 is much higher than the 40% base rate.
*   **(↑ Large) Unresolved Root Cause:** The protests are driven by fuel subsidy cuts, a fundamental economic issue that is highly unlikely to be resolved before December. This makes a renewed wave of protests and a corresponding government response very likely. This evidence makes an outcome of 0 provinces much less likely.
*   **(↑ Large) Noboa's Established Strategy:** President Noboa's political capital is built on his "mano dura" (iron fist) security policy. His consistent use of SoEs and his rhetoric linking protesters to cartels indicate a strong preference for security measures over negotiation, making a renewal or new declaration his default tool.
*   **(↑ Moderate) Persistent Underlying Security Crisis:** The threat from organized crime that prompted the nationwide SoE in January 2024 has not abated. A major security incident (e.g., prison riot, high-profile assassination) could occur at any time, which would almost certainly trigger a nationwide (24 province) SoE, independent of the protest situation.
*   **(↓ Small) Holiday Season De-escalation:** There is a small chance that both the government and protest leaders might favor a temporary truce over the Christmas period to allow for economic activity and reduce social strain. This provides a potential, though unlikely, off-ramp to a 0-province outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
The prior probability of 0 provinces (60%) is too high given the immediate context. The evidence strongly points to a continuation of the crisis. Let's re-evaluate the probabilities of three key scenarios for Dec 25:

1.  **Scenario A (Peace):** The current SoE expires, and no new crisis or renewal occurs.
2.  **Scenario B (Protest SoE):** Protests re-ignite, prompting a new SoE similar to the current one (~16 provinces).
3.  **Scenario C (Security SoE):** A major gang-related incident triggers a nationwide SoE (24 provinces).

*   **Prior:** P(A)=60%, P(B)=25%, P(C)=15%.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (unresolved conflict, Noboa's strategy) makes Scenario B much more likely relative to Scenario A. The persistent gang threat keeps Scenario C as a significant risk.
*   **Posterior:** A conceptual update dramatically lowers the probability of Scenario A and increases Scenario B. The probability of Scenario C remains a significant tail risk. My updated (posterior) probability assessment is:
    *   **P(0 provinces) ≈ 28%:** The chance of a holiday truce or a surprise resolution.
    *   **P(~10-18 provinces) ≈ 52%:** The most likely outcome, where the unresolved protest triggers a renewed, targeted SoE.
    *   **P(24 provinces) ≈ 20%:** The significant risk of a nationwide security meltdown.

The posterior distribution is multi-modal, with a median in the mid-teens and a mean around 14.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
A key counterargument is that SoEs are costly and disruptive, and the holiday season provides a strong incentive for both sides to de-escalate. A forecast centered on 0 might argue that the default is a return to normalcy once the current decree expires. However, this view likely underestimates the intractability of the subsidy issue and the degree to which President Noboa has staked his political identity on a security-first approach. The rhetoric used (linking protesters to cartels) makes it politically difficult for the government to back down. The risk of a nationwide security crisis (24 provinces) is also a real and independent factor. The multi-modal distribution (peaks at 0, ~16, and 24) seems robust to these considerations, as it explicitly accounts for the "return to normal" scenario while weighting the crisis scenarios more heavily based on recent evidence.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The percentiles are derived from the posterior distribution with ~28% probability mass at 0, ~52% spread around a central value of 16 (from 10-18), and ~20% at 24.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 12
P60: 15
P80: 18
