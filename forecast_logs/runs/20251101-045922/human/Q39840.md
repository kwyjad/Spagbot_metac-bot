Here is my research plan.

**Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** What is the typical range for the *highest daily* global surface air temperature anomaly during November-December in recent years? This requires defining appropriate reference classes.
2.  **Analyze the Primary Driver (ENSO):** What is the current state and forecasted strength of the La Niña event? How does its timing and intensity typically affect global temperatures, and is there a lag?
3.  **Quantify the Secular Trend:** How strong is the underlying global warming trend? How much warmer is the 2025 baseline compared to previous La Niña years?
4.  **Assess Recent Performance:** How have global temperature anomalies behaved in the last 6 months (May-October 2025)? Does the data show La Niña's cooling effect taking hold, or is the system retaining heat?
5.  **Identify Other Factors:** Are there other significant climate drivers active (e.g., Indian Ocean Dipole, volcanic aerosols, record ocean heat content) that could amplify or dampen the La Niña effect?
6.  **Convert Monthly to Daily Peaks:** What is the typical relationship between average monthly anomalies and the highest daily anomaly within that month? This is crucial for translating monthly forecasts into a daily peak prediction.

**Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

1.  **Baseline/Reference Class:**
    *   `Copernicus Climate Change Service monthly bulletin November 2023` (and for 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019)

6.  **Daily vs. Monthly:**
    *   `Copernicus daily vs monthly global temperature anomaly comparison`
    *   `statistical relationship daily peak and monthly mean temperature anomaly`

**Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Reference Data:** Recent Nov/Dec monthly anomalies (vs 1991-2020 baseline) range from ~+0.6°C (La Niña year 2020) to a record +1.17°C (El Niño year 2023). Daily peaks are typically 0.1°C to 0.3°C higher than the monthly average. The 2023 peak daily anomaly was around +1.4°C.
*   **La Niña:** The sources confirm La Niña conditions emerged late 2024/early 2025 and are expected to persist through the end of the year. Its cooling effect on global temperatures typically peaks 3-6 months after the oceanic event peaks. The event is described as potentially weak to moderate.
*   **Underlying Trend:** The background warming trend is powerful. The sources note that January 2025 was the warmest on record *despite* the emerging La Niña, demonstrating that the warming trend and residual heat from the prior El Niño can temporarily overwhelm La Niña's cooling effect.
*   **Recent Data (from prompt):** The chart shows 2025 started as record warm, then cooled relative to 2023/2024, and has stagnated in recent months. This suggests La Niña's cooling is being counteracted by other factors, leading to a plateau rather than a steep decline. The September 2025 anomaly appears to be around +0.9°C.
*   **Other Drivers:** Ocean Heat Content (OHC) is at a record high, providing a massive reservoir of heat that buffers against atmospheric cooling. The effects of the Hunga-Tonga eruption (stratospheric water vapor, a warming agent) are still being debated but likely contribute a small warming effect.
*   **Conclusion:** The forecast period will be a contest between the cooling pressure of a mature La Niña and the immense warming pressure from the long-term trend and record OHC. The outcome will likely be an anomaly significantly lower than the 2023 El Niño peak but exceptionally high for a La Niña year.

**Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Recent Nov/Dec Periods (2019-2023):** This class captures the strong underlying warming trend. The highest monthly anomaly was Nov 2023 at +1.17°C (vs 1991-2020 baseline). Daily peaks in this period likely ranged from **+1.0°C to +1.4°C**. This class suggests a high baseline due to secular trends.
*   **Recent La Niña Nov/Dec Periods (2020, 2021, 2022):** This class isolates the effect of the key climate driver. Monthly anomalies ranged from +0.55°C to +0.70°C. This implies highest daily anomalies in the range of **+0.7°C to +1.0°C**. This class suggests a lower outcome due to ENSO state.
*   **Limitation:** No past La Niña has occurred with the current level of background warming and record-high ocean heat content, making historical analogues imperfect. The key is to blend the cooling effect from the second reference class with the high thermal baseline from the first.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-27] NOAA reports La Niña is present and favored to persist through Dec 2025-Feb 2026. (↓) — Confirms the primary cooling mechanism will be active throughout the resolution period.
*   [2025-10-26] Reports note La Niña could result in colder regional winters (e.g., India). (↓) — Reinforces that the atmospheric response to La Niña is occurring, suggesting a global cooling impact.
*   [2025-09-XX] Copernicus data shows September 2025 as the third warmest on record, with anomalies stagnating. (↑) — Indicates that despite La Niña, the Earth system is retaining significant heat, resisting a rapid cool-down.
*   [2025-02-07] Copernicus reports January 2025 was the warmest on record despite emerging La Niña. (↑) — Strong evidence that the underlying warming trend and residual heat can overwhelm the initial cooling effects of La Niña.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** A mature La Niña event causes cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central/eastern Pacific, exerting a net cooling effect on global air temperatures. (Large)
*   **Long-term Warming Trend:** Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions create a persistent, powerful warming pressure on the climate system, raising the baseline temperature for any given year. (Large)
*   **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** Record-high OHC acts as a massive heat reservoir, providing a floor for temperatures and buffering the atmosphere against the full cooling impact of La Niña. (Large)
*   **Short-term Weather Variability:** Random, unpredictable weather patterns can cause significant daily temperature spikes or dips, creating volatility around the monthly average. This is the primary source of difference between the monthly mean and the daily peak. (Moderate)
*   **Arctic Sea Ice Extent:** Lower-than-average sea ice (a likely scenario) reduces Earth's albedo, leading to more heat absorption in the Arctic, which can contribute to higher global anomalies. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Baseline Warmth:** The global energy imbalance is higher than during any previous La Niña event. The "cooling" of La Niña is occurring from a much hotter starting point.
*   **Record Ocean Heat Content:** The sheer amount of thermal energy stored in the oceans is unprecedented, providing strong resistance to atmospheric cooling and making it harder for La Niña to have the same impact as in the past.
*   **Post-Super El Niño State:** The system is still shedding residual heat from the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño, which warmed the entire climate system. This thermal inertia is a key reason 2025 has remained so warm.
*   **Persistent Warmth Despite La Niña:** As seen in early 2025, the system has already demonstrated an ability to post record-warm months even with La Niña conditions present, a departure from typical La Niña year behavior.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **+1.05°C** seems appropriate, blending the cooling expectation from a La Niña year (~0.85°C peak) with the very high anomalies of recent non-La Niña years (~1.25°C peak). Set a moderate strength (equivalent n≈10).

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection:** The base rate is derived from historical data on global surface air temperature anomalies during La Niña years and recent years with high global warming trends.
- **Historical Averages:** Recent La Niña years (e.g., 2020, 2021) had monthly anomalies ranging from +0.55°C to +0.70°C, with daily peaks typically 0.1°C to 0.3°C higher.
- **Recent Trends:** Recent years with strong warming trends (e.g., 2023) showed monthly anomalies up to +1.17°C, with daily peaks around +1.4°C.
- **Chosen Base Rate:** A blended base rate considering both La Niña cooling and the strong warming trend, centered around +1.05°C with a moderate variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation includes a La Niña event, similar to past La Niña years, which typically results in lower anomalies.
- **Differences:** The unprecedented baseline warmth and record ocean heat content in 2025 create a higher starting point for anomalies, unlike previous La Niña years.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **La Niña Conditions:** Expected to persist through the end of 2025, typically leading to cooler anomalies (downward pressure).
- **Record Ocean Heat Content:** Provides a buffer against cooling, suggesting higher anomalies (upward pressure).
- **Recent Temperature Trends:** Stagnation in recent months indicates a balance between La Niña cooling and warming trends (neutral to slight upward pressure).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at +1.05°C, considering both La Niña and warming trends.
- **Evidence Impact:** La Niña suggests a downward adjustment, but record ocean heat content and recent trends suggest upward adjustments.
- **Posterior Mean Shift:** Slightly higher than the prior due to the strong warming trend and ocean heat content, resulting in a posterior centered around +1.10°C.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of stronger La Niña effects or unexpected cooling factors.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A stronger-than-expected La Niña could lead to lower anomalies, while continued warming trends could push anomalies higher.
- **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Calibrated Percentiles:**
  - P10: 0.90°C
  - P20: 0.95°C
  - P40: 1.05°C
  - P60: 1.15°C
  - P80: 1.25°C
  - P90: 1.30°C

These percentiles reflect a balanced consideration of the cooling effects of La Niña and the warming pressures from the underlying trend and ocean heat content.

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly (Nov-Dec 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

1. **Recent Nov-Dec periods (2019-2023)**: The highest monthly anomalies ranged from +0.55°C to +1.17°C, with daily peaks likely between +0.7°C to +1.4°C.

2. **Recent La Niña Nov-Dec periods (2020-2022)**: Monthly anomalies ranged from +0.55°C to +0.70°C, with daily peaks likely between +0.7°C to +1.0°C.

Given that we're looking for the highest daily anomaly during a two-month period, I'll use a prior centered around **+0.95°C**, which balances the cooling expectation from La Niña with the strong underlying warming trend. The standard deviation is approximately 0.2°C, reflecting the variability in daily peaks.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- La Niña conditions will be present during the forecast period
- The underlying warming trend continues
- We're examining the same seasonal period (Nov-Dec)

**Key differences:**
- The 2025 La Niña follows an exceptionally strong 2023-2024 El Niño, leaving residual heat in the system
- Ocean heat content is at record levels, providing thermal inertia
- The baseline warming is higher than during previous La Niña events
- 2025 has already demonstrated unusual warmth despite La Niña conditions emerging

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
- Early 2025 showed record warmth despite emerging La Niña conditions (strong evidence, +0.15°C)
- September 2025 was the third warmest on record with anomalies stagnating rather than declining (moderate evidence, +0.10°C)
- Record ocean heat content provides a thermal buffer against cooling (strong evidence, +0.15°C)
- The underlying warming trend is stronger than during previous La Niñas (moderate evidence, +0.10°C)

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
- La Niña conditions are confirmed and expected to persist through the forecast period (strong evidence, -0.20°C)
- Regional cooling patterns consistent with La Niña are already being observed (moderate evidence, -0.10°C)
- The chart shows 2025 temperatures have stagnated below 2023/2024 levels (moderate evidence, -0.10°C)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at +0.95°C, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - La Niña presence:**
- Prior: +0.95°C
- Evidence: Confirmed La Niña conditions (likelihood ratio favors lower values)
- Posterior: +0.85°C

**Second update - Record ocean heat content and baseline warmth:**
- Prior: +0.85°C
- Evidence: Unprecedented thermal inertia (likelihood ratio favors higher values)
- Posterior: +0.95°C

**Third update - Recent temperature behavior:**
- Prior: +0.95°C
- Evidence: Stagnation rather than decline despite La Niña (likelihood ratio slightly favors higher values)
- Posterior: +1.00°C

My posterior distribution is centered around +1.00°C, with a slightly reduced standard deviation of approximately 0.18°C, reflecting increased confidence from the evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating La Niña's cooling effect if it strengthens beyond current expectations
- I could be overestimating the thermal inertia from ocean heat content
- Daily temperature spikes can be more volatile than monthly averages suggest
- Unpredictable short-term weather patterns could create anomalous warm or cold days

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Stronger La Niña scenario: If La Niña intensifies more than expected, we could see anomalies closer to +0.7°C
- Weaker La Niña scenario: If La Niña weakens or the warming trend dominates, we could see anomalies up to +1.2°C
- Extreme weather event: A significant weather pattern could create a brief spike up to +1.3°C

I should widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these possibilities, particularly in the tails.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to center around +1.00°C with appropriate uncertainty:

P10: 0.75
P20: 0.83
P40: 0.95
P60: 1.05
P80: 1.17
P90: 1.25

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the highest daily global surface air temperature anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025. A suitable prior requires blending two reference classes to account for conflicting drivers:
1.  **Recent La Niña Years (2020-2022):** This class accounts for the primary cooling driver, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) state. During the Nov/Dec periods of these years, monthly anomalies were in the +0.55°C to +0.70°C range. The highest daily anomalies are typically 0.1°C to 0.3°C above the monthly mean, suggesting a base rate for peak daily anomalies centered around **+0.85°C** for a "typical" modern La Niña.
2.  **All Recent Years (2020-2024):** This class captures the powerful underlying secular warming trend and high ocean heat content. This period includes the 2023 El Niño peak, where daily anomalies reached ~+1.4°C. This class suggests a much higher baseline.

A blended prior is necessary because 2025 is a La Niña year occurring in an unprecedentedly warm climate. I will form a prior by averaging the central tendencies of these two classes, resulting in a distribution centered around **1.10°C**, with a wide 80% confidence interval from roughly 0.90°C to 1.30°C to reflect the high uncertainty from these competing forces.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the 2020-2022 reference class in that a La Niña is the dominant ENSO phase, which exerts a global cooling pressure.

However, it is critically different in several ways that push the forecast higher:
*   **Higher Baseline Temperature:** The underlying warming trend means the "starting point" for 2025 is significantly warmer than it was in 2020-2022. Each year adds to the baseline, making a repeat of 2020's temperatures highly unlikely.
*   **Record Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The world's oceans have stored a record amount of energy. This acts as a massive heat reservoir, buffering the atmosphere and muting the cooling effect of La Niña.
*   **Thermal Inertia:** The climate system is still radiating excess heat from the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño. This was evident when early 2025 set record temperature highs despite the emerging La Niña. Some of this residual heat will persist into the forecast period.

These differences strongly suggest that the 2025 La Niña will be anomalously warm, and the outcome will be significantly higher than the 2020-2022 base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence 1: Confirmed La Niña.** (Source: NOAA CPC). This is the primary evidence supporting a lower outcome. It makes values above 1.3°C (i.e., approaching El Niño levels) much less likely. This evidence pushes the distribution down relative to 2023/2024.
*   **Evidence 2: Temperature Stagnation in mid-to-late 2025.** (Source: Background chart). The chart shows that after an initial cooling from the record peaks, the 2025 temperature anomaly has plateaued at a very high level (September monthly anomaly appears to be ~+0.9°C). This is strong evidence that the cooling power of La Niña is being effectively counteracted by warming forces. This makes a steep drop to "classic" La Niña levels (<0.8°C peak) unlikely and pushes the forecast up.
*   **Evidence 3: Record Warmth in Early 2025.** (Source: Background). The fact that January 2025 was the warmest on record *despite* an emerging La Niña demonstrates the dominance of the background warming trend and thermal inertia. This evidence significantly reduces the likelihood of the lower tail of the distribution, pushing the median forecast higher.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Centered at 1.10°C, with a wide spread.
*   **Update:** The evidence from the 2025 temperature evolution (record warm start, high-level stagnation) is very compelling. It suggests that the warming factors (high baseline, OHC) are winning the "tug-of-war" against the La Niña's cooling. My prior, a simple blend of past years, likely underestimates this new reality.
*   **Conceptual Update:** `Posterior ∝ Prior(centered at 1.10°C) × Likelihood(stagnation makes low outcomes <1.0°C less likely)`.
*   **Posterior Shift:** I will shift the median of my distribution slightly upward from my initial 1.10°C prior to **1.12°C**. More importantly, I will significantly trim the left tail of the distribution. The probability of the peak anomaly falling below 1.0°C is now considerably lower than the prior suggested. The right tail remains plausible, as short-term weather variability can always produce a spike. The overall variance of the distribution is slightly reduced as the outcome becomes more constrained to "exceptionally warm for a La Niña year."

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario (La Niña's delayed impact):** Could the cooling effect of La Niña have a longer lag, causing a sharp drop in Nov/Dec? This would lead to a much lower outcome, perhaps a peak around 0.95°C. While possible, the persistent high ocean heat content and the temperature data from the preceding months make this a less likely scenario. The system appears to be in a new, hotter equilibrium.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Warming factors dominate completely):** Could the La Niña be so weak and the background warming so strong that the peak challenges 2024 levels (~1.3°C)? This is plausible and represents the primary upside risk. The climate is in uncharted territory, and the resistance to cooling could be even stronger than anticipated.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast is centered on an outcome with no direct historical analogue (a La Niña in a world this warm). This warrants a reasonably wide distribution to account for this uncertainty. My proposed 80% confidence interval (P10 to P90) spans 0.35°C. This seems appropriate to capture the potential for surprises in either direction, while still reflecting the strong evidence of a "warm La Niña". I will ensure my tails are wide enough to account for these alternative scenarios.
