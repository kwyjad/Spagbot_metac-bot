Here is my research plan.

**Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **Reference Class & Base Rate:** What is the historical precedent for a former UK Prime Minister or major party leader returning to the leadership after being forced out by their own party? How often does this happen in modern UK politics (post-WWII)?
2.  **Current Status & Barriers:** What is Boris Johnson's current political status as of November 2025? Specifically, is he a Member of Parliament (MP)? What are the Conservative Party's rules regarding its leader being an MP?
3.  **Political Environment:** What is the current state of the Conservative Party? Who is the leader? How are they performing in polls? Is there a significant "Bring Back Boris" movement within the party's membership or parliamentary group?
4.  **Mechanisms for Return:** What specific sequence of events would need to occur for Johnson to become leader before January 1, 2026? This includes triggering a leadership contest and Johnson securing a parliamentary seat. How plausible is this sequence within the short timeframe?
5.  **Arguments For vs. Against:** What are the primary drivers supporting a potential comeback (e.g., electoral appeal, member popularity)? What are the main inhibitors (e.g., Partygate scandal, divisiveness among MPs, public opinion)?
6.  **Recent Developments:** What has happened in the last 6-12 months (mid-to-late 2025) that would either enable or obstruct a comeback attempt? Has he made any significant political interventions?

**Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** The return of a party leader after being ousted by their own MPs is exceptionally rare in modern UK politics. While figures like Churchill returned, he was voted out by the electorate in 1945, not his party, and crucially, he remained an MP and Leader of the Opposition. The precedent is virtually non-existent for this specific scenario.
*   **The MP Barrier:** This is the most critical finding. Johnson resigned as an MP in June 2023. The Conservative Party constitution (specifically, the rules for the election of the leader) requires that candidates for the leadership must be sitting Members of Parliament. This creates a two-step problem for Johnson: a safe seat must become available, and he must win it *before* a leadership contest concludes.
*   **Timeline:** The resolution date is less than two months away. A by-election process, from the vacancy being declared to the election, typically takes several weeks at a minimum. A leadership contest also takes weeks. Orchestrating both successfully before January 1, 2026, is logistically almost impossible.
*   **Political Appetite:** While sources from early 2025 suggest some lingering popularity among party members, Johnson remains a deeply divisive figure among Conservative MPs. Many hold him responsible for the party's reputational damage and would actively work to block his return. The "Bring Back Boris" sentiment exists but appears to be a minority view without institutional power.
*   **Recent Signals:** As of late 2025, Johnson has remained a media commentator (e.g., his Daily Mail column) but has made no concrete moves to re-enter Parliament. The 2025 party conference passed without any significant comeback bid. The lack of any preparatory action is a strong negative signal.

**Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Former UK Prime Ministers returning to leadership:** Extremely rare. The most cited modern example is Winston Churchill, but the parallel is weak. Churchill lost a general election in 1945 but remained an MP and Leader of the Opposition, returning as PM in 1951. He was not forced out by his own party over scandal. A better, though still imperfect, reference class is leaders forced out by their own party (e.g., Thatcher, May). None have ever returned. **Base rate: < 5%**.
*   **Leaders returning from outside Parliament:** Virtually zero in the modern era. Party rules are now formalized to require leadership candidates to be sitting MPs. Historical examples from the 19th or early 20th century (e.g., Bonar Law) are not applicable due to vastly different party structures and rules. **Base rate: < 1%**.
*   **Limitations:** The sample size of former Prime Ministers is small, making statistical inference difficult. Johnson's unique political persona could be argued to break from historical patterns, but institutional barriers remain.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-07** Conservative Party Conference concludes — ↓ — The event passed with no significant comeback bid or organized "Bring Back Boris" movement, indicating a lack of serious momentum for his return.
*   **2025-09-15** Speculation on next general election timing firms up — ↓ — With a general election likely in 2028-2029, there is no imminent electoral event that would create the chaos needed for a Johnson return.
*   **2025-07-01** Johnson continues writing his widely-read newspaper column — → — Maintains his public profile and ability to influence debate but does not represent a concrete step towards re-entering parliamentary politics.
*   **2025-05-23** HuffPost reports on lingering comeback speculation — ↑ (small) — Shows the idea has not completely vanished from political discourse, but frames it as facing "significant practical and political hurdles."

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Lack of a Parliamentary Seat:** (Large, Downward) The Conservative Party constitution requires leadership candidates to be MPs. Johnson resigned his seat in June 2023. This is the single largest barrier to his return.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** (Large, Downward) With less than two months to the resolution date, the sequence of a safe seat becoming vacant, Johnson being selected, winning a by-election, *and* a leadership contest being triggered and won is logistically infeasible.
*   **Opposition from Conservative MPs:** (Large, Downward) A significant portion of the parliamentary party, including many senior figures, would actively oppose his return due to the chaos of his premiership and the manner of his exit.
*   **Popularity with Party Members:** (Moderate, Upward) Polling has consistently shown Johnson remains popular with a segment of the Conservative grassroots membership. In a final two leadership vote, he could be a formidable candidate if he were on the ballot.
*   **Party Desperation:** (Small, Upward) If the party's polling were to enter a catastrophic tailspin, a faction might clamor for a "proven election winner." However, this driver is currently weak and insufficient to overcome the structural barriers.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Resigned as MP:** Unlike Churchill or other former leaders who remained in Parliament, Johnson preemptively resigned his seat while facing suspension. This self-removal from the field of play is a crucial, and perhaps unique, difference.
*   **Exit via Scandal & Censure:** Johnson's departure was not due to policy disagreement or electoral loss, but a string of scandals culminating in the Privileges Committee finding he knowingly misled Parliament. This creates a significant character and integrity barrier to his return.
*   **Formalized Leadership Rules:** Modern party rules are far more rigid than in the past. The requirement for leadership candidates to be MPs is a hard constraint, not a flexible convention.
*   **Short Timeframe to Resolution:** The question resolves in under two months. Historical comebacks, even when possible, were multi-year projects. The current timeframe allows for no strategic maneuvering.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<5%) based on the reference class of leaders returning after being ousted by their own party, especially from outside Parliament. Equivalent n of ~20 cases with 0 successes.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Johnson is not an MP, and party rules require it.
    *   (↓ Large) The <2 month timeline makes the necessary sequence of events (by-election + leadership contest) practically impossible.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The lack of any organized comeback attempt at recent key events (e.g., party conference) suggests no serious effort is underway.
    *   (↑ Small) He retains some popularity with members, which keeps the idea alive in commentary but doesn't overcome the hard barriers.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the very low prior. The posterior probability should be moved further downwards, approaching a floor near zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An MP in a very safe Conservative seat announces their immediate resignation.
    *   Johnson is announced as the candidate for that by-election.
    *   The current Conservative leader suddenly resigns, triggering a leadership contest.
    *   A serious push emerges to change party rules to allow a non-MP to stand for leader.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The UK Parliament enters its Christmas recess without any of the above events occurring.

To forecast the probability of Boris Johnson returning as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026, let's follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical precedent for a former UK Prime Minister or major party leader returning to leadership after being forced out by their own party is extremely rare. The most notable example is Winston Churchill, but he was not forced out by his party and remained an MP. The base rate for a leader returning after being ousted by their own party is virtually non-existent in modern UK politics. Therefore, a reasonable base rate is less than 5%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Johnson, like Churchill, is a former leader with significant public recognition. However, unlike Churchill, Johnson was forced out due to scandals and resigned as an MP.
   - Differences: Johnson's resignation as an MP and the requirement for Conservative leadership candidates to be MPs are significant barriers. The timeline to the resolution date is also very short, making a comeback logistically challenging.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Not an MP**: The Conservative Party requires leaders to be MPs, and Johnson resigned his seat. This is a strong negative indicator.
   - **Short Timeline**: With less than two months to the resolution date, the sequence of events needed for a comeback is highly improbable.
   - **Lack of Movement**: No significant moves or organized efforts for a comeback have been observed, further decreasing the likelihood.
   - **Popularity with Members**: While Johnson retains some popularity among party members, this is insufficient to overcome the structural barriers.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: Let's assume a prior probability of 5% (odds of 0.05/0.95).
   - Likelihood ratio: The evidence strongly suggests a decrease in probability. The lack of an MP position and the short timeline are significant barriers.
   - Posterior odds: Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability should be adjusted downward significantly, approaching a floor near zero.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast might underestimate Johnson's ability to mobilize support quickly, but the structural barriers remain significant.
   - Alternative Scenarios: A sudden resignation of an MP in a safe seat or a change in party rules could alter the landscape, but these are unlikely within the timeframe.
   - Adjustments: Given the evidence and barriers, the probability remains very low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and barriers, the probability of Boris Johnson returning as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will Boris Johnson return as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class of former UK party leaders who were forced out by their own party and later returned to leadership, particularly those who had to return from outside Parliament.

**Historical precedents:**
- No modern UK party leader who resigned due to scandal/party pressure has returned to lead their party
- Winston Churchill returned as PM, but he lost a general election and remained an MP throughout
- No former leader has returned after leaving Parliament entirely

Given these factors, I'll set a very low base rate: **2%**

This reflects the extreme rarity of such comebacks in British politics, especially for someone who is no longer an MP.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Johnson maintains some popularity with Conservative Party members
- He remains a public figure through his newspaper column
- Some speculation about his return persists in political commentary

**Critical differences:**
- Johnson is not currently an MP (resigned June 2023)
- Conservative Party rules require leadership candidates to be sitting MPs
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than 2 months until resolution)
- Johnson left amid scandal with the Privileges Committee finding he misled Parliament
- No visible preparation for a comeback has been observed in recent months

These differences, particularly his lack of a parliamentary seat and the short timeframe, make his situation significantly less favorable than even the rare historical cases of returning leaders.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key Evidence 1: Johnson is not an MP**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return as leader, it's extremely unlikely he would do so without being an MP first (~0.05)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson does not return as leader, him not being an MP is very likely (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Key Evidence 2: Timeline constraints**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return by Jan 2026, we would expect to see concrete steps already underway (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson does not return, the lack of visible preparation is expected (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.111
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Key Evidence 3: No recent comeback signals at 2025 Party Conference**
- P(E|H): If a comeback were imminent, we would expect signals at the conference (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If no comeback is planned, the quiet conference is expected (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.95 = 0.842
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Key Evidence 4: Continued media presence**
- P(E|H): If planning a return, maintaining public profile is expected (~0.9)
- P(E|~H): If not planning a return, still likely to maintain profile (~0.7)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.7 = 1.286
- This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2%:
- Prior odds: 0.02/0.98 = 0.0204

First update (not being an MP):
- Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 0.053 = 0.00108
- Posterior probability = 0.00108/(1 + 0.00108) = 0.108%

Second update (timeline constraints):
- Posterior odds = 0.00108 × 0.111 = 0.00012
- Posterior probability = 0.00012/(1 + 0.00012) = 0.012%

Third update (no conference signals):
- Posterior odds = 0.00012 × 0.842 = 0.0001
- Posterior probability = 0.0001/(1 + 0.0001) = 0.01%

Fourth update (media presence):
- Posterior odds = 0.0001 × 1.286 = 0.000129
- Posterior probability = 0.000129/(1 + 0.000129) = 0.013%

The evidence overwhelmingly points to an extremely low probability, primarily due to the practical barriers of Johnson not being an MP and the very short timeframe remaining.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the Conservative Party's willingness to change rules in desperate circumstances
- There could be a secret plan already in motion that hasn't been leaked to the press
- A catastrophic political event could create unprecedented circumstances

**Alternative scenarios:**
- An MP in a safe seat could suddenly resign, creating an opening
- The party could theoretically change its rules to allow non-MPs to stand
- A caretaker arrangement could be created that technically makes Johnson leader

However, even these scenarios face extreme practical difficulties:
- The timeline for a by-election + leadership contest exceeds the resolution timeframe
- Rule changes would face significant opposition within the party
- The definition excludes caretaker arrangements

After consideration, I don't see sufficient reason to significantly adjust my forecast upward.

## 6. Final Forecast

The combination of institutional barriers (not being an MP), procedural timelines (less than 2 months remaining), and lack of preparatory signals makes Johnson's return as Conservative leader before 2026 virtually impossible. While maintaining a small probability to account for truly unexpected scenarios, the evidence points to a probability near zero.

Final: 0.1%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class is former UK party leaders who were forced out of their position by their own parliamentary party in the post-WWII era. Examples include Margaret Thatcher, Iain Duncan Smith, and Theresa May. None of them returned to the leadership. The often-cited comeback of Winston Churchill is a poor analogy; he lost a general election in 1945 but remained an MP and Leader of the Opposition, returning to power after winning the 1951 election. He was not ousted by his own party.

A stricter reference class would be leaders who were forced out and also left Parliament. In the modern era, there is no precedent for such a figure returning to lead a major party.

Based on this, the historical base rate is extremely low, effectively 0 successes in the relevant sample. To account for the unpredictable nature of politics and the small sample size, I will set a conservative prior probability of **1%**. This acknowledges the event is exceptionally rare but not strictly impossible.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with Boris Johnson has crucial differences from historical precedents that make a return even less likely:

*   **He is not a Member of Parliament (MP):** Johnson resigned his seat in June 2023. Unlike Churchill, Thatcher, or May, who all remained in the Commons after losing the leadership, Johnson is outside Parliament. The Conservative Party's constitution explicitly requires that candidates for the leadership must be sitting MPs. This is the single largest barrier.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves on January 1, 2026. As of today (November 5, 2025), there are less than two months remaining. This period includes the Christmas parliamentary recess, making any complex political or procedural maneuver virtually impossible.
*   **Nature of Departure:** Johnson's exit was driven by scandals related to personal conduct and integrity (Partygate, Privileges Committee findings), not primarily by policy disagreements. This leaves a legacy of deep division and distrust among many Conservative MPs, who would actively work to block his return.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "Boris Johnson returns as leader before 2026" and ~H be the alternative.

*   **Evidence 1: Johnson is not an MP.**
    *   P(E1 | H) is extremely low. A comeback plan would almost certainly have involved securing a parliamentary seat by now.
    *   P(E1 | ~H) is very high. If he is not returning, it is entirely expected that he would remain outside Parliament.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H) is very small (<< 1), strongly decreasing the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The resolution deadline is less than two months away.**
    *   P(E2 | H) is extremely low. The sequence of events required for a return—a safe seat vacancy, a by-election campaign and victory for Johnson, a leadership contest being triggered, and Johnson winning that contest—cannot logistically be completed in under eight weeks.
    *   P(E2 | ~H) is very high. The short timeline is perfectly consistent with no comeback occurring.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E2|H)/P(E2|~H) is also very small (<< 1), further decreasing the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Johnson retains some popularity with the party membership.**
    *   P(E3 | H) is high. This is a necessary precondition for any comeback attempt.
    *   P(E3 | ~H) is also reasonably high. He can remain popular with members while being blocked from leadership by the parliamentary party and procedural rules.
    *   The likelihood ratio is slightly greater than 1, but this factor is completely overwhelmed by the hard constraints above.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), the evidence acts as a powerful update.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:99
*   **Evidence:** The combination of Johnson not being an MP and the impossibly short timeline provides an extremely strong negative update. The likelihood ratio for this combined evidence is minuscule. For a comeback to happen, a series of low-probability events must occur in perfect sequence (e.g., a sudden resignation of the leader, a simultaneous by-election vacancy, and the party suspending its own rules).
*   **Posterior:** The posterior odds are driven down significantly from the already low prior. The procedural and logistical barriers are so formidable that they reduce the probability to a level that accounts only for a "black swan" or "political miracle" scenario. The posterior probability is well below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Could I be wrong? The only conceivable path to a "Yes" resolution involves a catastrophic crisis for the Conservative Party in the next few weeks, leading to the simultaneous resignation of the current leader and an MP in a safe seat. The party would then have to take the extraordinary step of suspending its constitution to allow a non-MP to become leader, anointing Johnson in a panic.

This scenario requires a cascade of multiple, independent, low-probability events. The internal opposition to Johnson among MPs remains a huge obstacle, even in a crisis. They would likely view his return as pouring fuel on the fire. While not metaphysically impossible, this chain of events is so improbable that it belongs in the realm of extreme tail risk. My forecast should reflect this, being very close to zero but not exactly zero.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such a comeback is near zero. The specific evidence—Johnson's status as a non-MP, the party's constitutional rules, and the extremely short timeline—makes the probability even lower. The path to a "Yes" resolution is blocked by what appear to be insurmountable logistical and political barriers. The forecast must be very low.

Final: 1%
