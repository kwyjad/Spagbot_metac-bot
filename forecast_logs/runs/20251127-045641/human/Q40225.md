### Reference class & base rates
*   **Pre-emptive, non-disaster urban evacuations (>100k people):** This is the tightest reference class. Historically, governments rarely order large-scale, pre-emptive evacuations of major cities for chronic issues like resource scarcity or environmental degradation. Such events are typically reactive (e.g., post-Chernobyl) or related to immediate, acute threats like war or natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes). The base rate for a pre-emptive evacuation on this scale within a one-month timeframe is extremely low, likely **<1%**.
*   **Major capital city relocation announcements:** A broader class involves governments initiating the process of moving a capital (e.g., Brazil to Brasília, Kazakhstan to Astana, Indonesia to Nusantara, Egypt's New Administrative Capital). While announcements are more common, they almost always involve multi-year or multi-decade phased plans to move administrative functions, not a sudden order to evacuate a large portion of the general population. The transition from announcement to a rapid, large-scale population move is rare.
*   **"Managed retreat" policies due to environmental stress:** This class involves relocating smaller communities (typically hundreds or thousands) due to slow-moving disasters like sea-level rise or desertification. These are logistically complex and politically fraught even at a small scale, highlighting the immense difficulty of the proposed action in Tehran. This class suggests the action is plausible in theory but exceptionally difficult in practice.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-20** President Pezeshkian explicitly states evacuation is a necessary measure due to the water crisis, framing it as a move to garner public support. — ↑ — Direct, high-level rhetoric from the head of state dramatically increases the salience of the issue, making a policy order more conceivable.
*   **2025-11-20** Pezeshkian reiterates the need to move the capital due to an "unsolvable" water scarcity issue. — ↑ — Reinforces the president's commitment and the perceived severity of the underlying driver, suggesting policy action is being seriously considered.
*   **2025-11-14** Pezeshkian links a potential evacuation directly to a short-term weather condition (no rain by Nov 21), creating a clear, imminent trigger. — ↑↑ — This is the most significant development, shifting the discussion from a long-term problem to a potential short-term emergency response.
*   **2025-11-02** Iran announces plans to build eight new nuclear power plants with Russia. — ↓ — This signals a focus on long-term, capital-intensive energy projects, which compete for the same state resources required for a massive evacuation and relocation effort.
*   **2024-10-22** The 1404 (Mar 2025-Mar 2026) budget proposal shows a significant increase in defense and security spending. — ↓↓ — The allocation of state funds is a primary indicator of priorities. Funneling resources to defense, amid economic strain, strongly suggests a massive, non-security civil project like an evacuation is not a funded priority.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Acute Water Crisis (Large ↑):** The primary driver. If the drought situation mentioned by Pezeshkian is as severe as stated, it could create a genuine state of emergency, forcing the government's hand and providing political cover for a drastic measure that would otherwise be unpalatable.
*   **Presidential Fiat/Advocacy (Large ↑):** President Pezeshkian has personally and repeatedly championed this issue. A determined executive in Iran's political system can potentially overcome bureaucratic inertia, especially if he secures the Supreme Leader's backing.
*   **Logistical & Financial Incapacity (Large ↓):** Evacuating and providing for 100,000 people requires immense, pre-planned logistical capacity (transport, housing, food, security) and funding. The 1404 budget's focus on defense over civil projects indicates this capacity is likely non-existent and not a priority.
*   **Political Rhetoric vs. Reality (Moderate ↓):** The statements could be a political tool to manage public discontent over the water crisis. By framing the problem as existential and proposing a radical (if impractical) solution, the government can appear decisive while deflecting blame and delaying less dramatic but costly infrastructure solutions.
*   **Bureaucratic & Elite Inertia (Moderate ↓):** Decades of discussion with no action suggest powerful vested interests in Tehran (political, economic, military elites) would resist any move that dilutes their power base. Overcoming this inertia in a matter of weeks is highly improbable.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Imminent Trigger:** Unlike typical, decades-long capital relocation plans, the Iranian government has publicly tied a potential evacuation to a short-term, verifiable trigger (rainfall by a specific date). This creates a sense of urgency not present in the reference class.
*   **Crisis-Driven vs. Strategic:** Most capital relocations are strategic, long-term projects aimed at development or decentralization. This case is framed as a reactive, emergency measure to a cascading environmental collapse, making a disorderly or rapid decision more plausible.
*   **Severe Economic Constraints:** Iran is attempting to consider this under severe economic strain, unlike countries that moved capitals during periods of relative prosperity (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan). This makes the financial feasibility of a large-scale evacuation exceptionally low.
*   **Rhetorical Intensity:** The direct and repeated high-level rhetoric from the President himself, explicitly using the word "evacuate," is a significant departure from the more measured, bureaucratic language typically associated with urban planning and relocation studies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the extreme rarity of pre-emptive, large-scale urban evacuations. The strength of this prior (equivalent n) should be high due to the strong historical precedent against such events.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Pezeshkian's recent, repeated, and urgent rhetoric explicitly linking a lack of rain to a potential evacuation order.
    *   (↓ Large) The 1404 budget's focus on defense spending, which indicates a severe lack of financial preparation or intent to execute a massive civil project before March 2026.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The long history of inaction on this issue in Iran, suggesting powerful structural inertia.
    *   (↓ Small) The "garnering public support" angle, suggesting the statements may be political maneuvering rather than a literal statement of intent for the next 35 days.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, intense rhetoric significantly pulls the probability up from the near-zero prior. However, the overwhelming evidence of financial and logistical unpreparedness acts as a powerful anchor. The posterior should be revised upwards but remain low, likely in the single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcement of an emergency inter-agency task force to manage the "Tehran Water Crisis & Relocation."
    *   State media begins a public information campaign preparing citizens for water rationing or movement.
    *   Noticeable, large-scale movements of military/logistical assets (e.g., transport vehicles, temporary housing) towards Tehran or designated relocation zones.
    *   Any supplementary or emergency budget allocation for the Interior Ministry or a related body.
    *   Reports of government ministries beginning to move documents or personnel out of Tehran.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   President Pezeshkian's rhetoric shifts to other topics after the November 21st "deadline" passes without comment.
    *   Official statements focus on alternative solutions: desalination plants, cloud seeding, or pipeline construction.
    *   Senior officials (e.g., the Mayor of Tehran, key cabinet ministers) publicly contradict or downplay the feasibility of an evacuation.
    *   Life in Tehran continues as normal with no visible state-level preparations.
    *   Announcement of a new, multi-year study on the issue, kicking the can further down the road.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional ambiguity:** The resolution requires an "order" to evacuate. This could be ambiguous. A "strong recommendation" or an order to evacuate a much smaller, symbolic group (<100,000) would not resolve as Yes.
*   **Information opacity:** Information from Iran is heavily controlled. Public statements may be for domestic/international consumption and not reflect actual policy. Verifying the logistics and scale of any announced evacuation will be difficult.
*   **"Black Swan" event:** A moderate earthquake or the discovery of a catastrophic failure in water infrastructure could dramatically accelerate the timeline and override all logistical and financial constraints, making a hasty evacuation order more likely.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Action:** The primary evidence for "Yes" is rhetorical. There is a high risk of mistaking strong words, intended to manage a political crisis, for a literal plan of action, especially on such a short timeline.
*   **Timeline:** The resolution window is extremely short (just over one month). The bureaucratic and logistical inertia of a state, particularly one under economic pressure, makes executing the necessary preparations for such a monumental task before Jan 1, 2026, highly improbable.

**Final Research Summary:**
President Pezeshkian's recent, urgent rhetoric has made a previously unthinkable short-term evacuation order plausible, but the complete lack of budgetary allocation and logistical preparation makes it highly improbable to occur before 2026.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for pre-emptive, large-scale urban evacuations due to chronic issues like resource scarcity is extremely low, likely less than 1%. This is because such evacuations are rare and typically reactive rather than pre-emptive.
   - Initial prior: <1% probability.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a chronic issue (water scarcity) that could potentially lead to an evacuation, aligning with the reference class of rare pre-emptive evacuations.
   - Differences: The Iranian government has tied the potential evacuation to a specific short-term trigger (lack of rain by November 21), which is unusual compared to typical long-term planning for capital relocations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Pezeshkian's Rhetoric (↑ Large):** The President's explicit and urgent rhetoric linking the water crisis to a potential evacuation increases the likelihood of the event. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Budget Allocation (↓ Large):** The focus on defense spending over civil projects suggests a lack of financial preparation for an evacuation, decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Historical Inaction (↓ Moderate):** Decades of discussion without action suggest bureaucratic inertia, decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Political Maneuvering (↓ Small):** The rhetoric may be a political tool rather than a literal plan, slightly decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Start with a prior probability of <1%.
   - The President's rhetoric significantly increases the probability, but the lack of budgetary and logistical preparation acts as a strong counterbalance.
   - Posterior probability remains low, likely in the single digits, after considering all evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could underestimate the impact of a sudden crisis or political decision.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden environmental disaster could force an evacuation, but this is not currently indicated.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong counter-evidence, maintain a low probability but slightly higher than the initial base rate due to the President's rhetoric.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final probability is adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood due to recent developments but remains low due to logistical and financial constraints.

Final: 5%

# Will Iran announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a government ordering a large-scale evacuation of a capital city due to environmental concerns.

The most relevant reference class is **pre-emptive, non-disaster urban evacuations of major cities (>100,000 people)**. These are extremely rare events globally. Governments rarely order large-scale evacuations of major cities for chronic issues like resource scarcity or environmental degradation. Most large evacuations are reactive (responding to immediate disasters) or related to acute threats like war.

Historical examples of capital relocations (Brazil to Brasília, Kazakhstan to Astana, Indonesia to Nusantara) involved multi-year or multi-decade phased plans, not sudden evacuation orders.

Given the extreme rarity of such events and the short timeframe (just over one month until January 1, 2026), I'll set a very low prior probability of **1%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other proposed capital relocations, Tehran's issues (water scarcity, pollution, seismic risk) have been known and discussed for decades without decisive action
- The logistical challenges of moving large populations remain enormous
- The economic constraints facing Iran make a massive relocation project particularly difficult

**Differences from base case:**
- President Pezeshkian has explicitly used the word "evacuate" and tied it to a specific trigger (no rain by November 21, 2025)
- The water crisis appears to be reaching a critical point, framed as an emergency rather than a long-term planning issue
- The rhetoric has intensified significantly in recent weeks, with the president personally championing the issue
- The timeframe is extremely compressed compared to typical capital relocations

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's explicit statements about evacuation**
- P(E|H): If Iran were planning to announce an evacuation, the president would very likely make statements like these (90%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran were not planning an evacuation, such statements could still occur as political rhetoric or pressure tactics (30%)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: The 1404 budget (Mar 2025-Mar 2026) prioritizes defense spending**
- P(E|H): If Iran were planning an imminent evacuation, we would expect to see budget allocations for this massive undertaking (10%)
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation is planned, we would expect normal budget priorities (90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Decades of inaction despite similar proposals**
- P(E|H): If Iran were about to evacuate Tehran, previous proposals might have progressed further (20%)
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation is planned, we would expect to see exactly this pattern of discussion without action (95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: The severe water crisis and drought conditions**
- P(E|H): If an evacuation were imminent, we would expect severe environmental conditions (95%)
- P(E|~H): Even without evacuation plans, these conditions could exist and prompt other responses (70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 5: Lack of visible logistical preparations**
- P(E|H): If an evacuation were imminent, we would expect to see significant logistical preparations (95%)
- P(E|~H): Without evacuation plans, we would not see such preparations (95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.0 (neutral)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 1% (odds of 1:99)

First update (President's statements):
- Prior odds: 1:99
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3:99 ≈ 1:33
- Posterior probability: 3/102 ≈ 2.9%

Second update (Budget priorities):
- Prior odds: 1:33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.11:33 ≈ 1:300
- Posterior probability: 0.33%

Third update (History of inaction):
- Prior odds: 1:300
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21
- Posterior odds: 0.21:300 ≈ 1:1429
- Posterior probability: 0.07%

Fourth update (Water crisis severity):
- Prior odds: 1:1429
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36
- Posterior odds: 1.36:1429 ≈ 1:1051
- Posterior probability: 0.095%

The evidence strongly suggests that despite the rhetoric, an actual evacuation order before January 1, 2026 is extremely unlikely. The budget priorities and historical pattern of inaction are particularly strong evidence against it happening.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of the water crisis. If Tehran literally runs out of water, even the most unprepared government might be forced to act.
- I might be overweighting the importance of budgetary preparations. In an emergency, Iran could reallocate resources rapidly.
- The president's statements could reflect internal government discussions not visible to outside observers.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A symbolic "evacuation" of a small portion of Tehran could be announced to demonstrate action while avoiding the full logistical challenge.
- A sudden environmental catastrophe (major aquifer collapse) could force immediate action regardless of preparation.
- The November 21st deadline has passed, but the government might still act if conditions worsen dramatically in December.

**Best alternative forecast:**
The best case for a higher probability would be that President Pezeshkian's statements reflect genuine intent and internal preparations that aren't publicly visible. If the water situation is truly catastrophic, the government might feel compelled to act despite the enormous challenges.

**Rebuttal:**
Even with catastrophic water shortages, the logistical impossibility of evacuating millions of people in a matter of weeks without visible preparation makes a formal evacuation order extremely unlikely. More probable responses would include water rationing, emergency imports, or targeted relocations of vulnerable populations.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I maintain that an evacuation announcement before January 1, 2026 is extremely unlikely. The combination of:
1. The extremely short timeframe (just over one month)
2. Lack of budgetary allocation
3. No visible logistical preparations
4. Historical pattern of rhetoric without action
5. The enormous practical challenges of moving 100,000+ people

All point to a very low probability. However, given the president's explicit statements and the genuine water crisis, I will adjust slightly upward from my calculated posterior.

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the frequency of governments ordering a pre-emptive, large-scale (>100,000 people) evacuation of a major city due to a chronic, slow-moving environmental crisis (like water scarcity or land subsidence) within a very short timeframe (approximately one month).

Historically, this event is exceptionally rare, bordering on unprecedented. Large-scale evacuations are almost always reactive to acute, immediate threats like war (e.g., Kyiv), industrial disasters (e.g., Chernobyl), or imminent natural catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes, volcanic eruptions). No major city has been pre-emptively evacuated for water scarcity. The reference class of "managed retreat" policies typically involves much smaller communities over much longer timescales.

Therefore, the base rate for such an event occurring in any given month for any given city is extremely low. I will set the prior probability **P(H) at 0.5%**. This is equivalent to prior odds of 1:199 against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   Tehran's underlying problems—water stress, subsidence, pollution—are chronic issues faced by many megacities worldwide.
*   The decades-long discussion about relocating the capital with no concrete action is typical of the immense political and economic inertia that prevents such drastic measures, aligning with the base case's rarity.

**Differences:**
*   **Direct and Urgent Rhetoric:** The primary difference is the explicit, repeated, and urgent rhetoric from the head of state, President Pezeshkian. He has personally framed evacuation not as a long-term strategic goal but as a potential short-term emergency response.
*   **Imminent Trigger:** The President publicly linked the potential evacuation to a specific, near-term condition (lack of rain by November 21). This creates a sense of immediate crisis rarely seen in the base case of slow-moving environmental degradation. This shifts the problem from the "important" category to the "urgent" one, making a rash decision more plausible.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Iran announces an evacuation of Tehran before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's recent, urgent statements.**
    *   P(E | H): If the government were seriously considering an imminent evacuation order, we would expect the President to be preparing the public and justifying the decision. These statements are highly consistent with such a plan. P(E | H) is high.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the government were *not* planning an evacuation, these statements could be a political tool to manage public anger over water shortages, justify severe rationing, or build long-term support for an eventual capital move. This is also plausible. However, making such a specific, time-bound threat and not acting carries political risk.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly **increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The 1404 (March 2025-March 2026) budget's focus on defense and security spending.**
    *   P(E | H): A massive, non-military logistical operation like evacuating 100,000 people would require enormous financial resources. A budget that prioritizes defense over civil projects is strong evidence that no such operation is funded or planned. P(E | H) is very low.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no evacuation is planned, the budget reflects the regime's existing priorities, which is perfectly consistent with the status quo. P(E | ~H) is high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is much less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The November 21 "deadline" has passed (current date is Nov 27) with no apparent follow-up.**
    *   The President's statement framed Nov 21 as a decision point for rationing, with evacuation as a potential *further* step. However, the lack of any visible preparatory action in the week since—no emergency task force, no state media campaign—is a negative signal.
    *   P(E | H): If an order were coming in the next 34 days, we would expect preparatory activity to have started. The absence of this makes H less likely.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the statements were just rhetoric, we would expect the deadline to pass with little to no action, which is what has happened.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:199 (0.5%), the President's rhetoric is a powerful update in favor of H. If this were the only evidence, the odds might shift to something like 1:15 (approx. 6%).

However, the budgetary evidence acts as a massive counterweight. The lack of funding and logistical preparation is a "show me the money" reality check. This evidence is so strong that it largely cancels out the rhetorical evidence. If prior odds are 1:199, and the rhetoric has a likelihood ratio of (e.g.) 15 while the budget has a likelihood ratio of (e.g.) 0.1, the updated odds would be:

Posterior Odds = (1:199) × 15 × 0.1 = 1.5 : 199 ≈ 1:133 (approx. 0.75%).

The subsequent lack of action after the soft deadline further reduces these odds. The synthesis suggests that while the President's words have made the unthinkable plausible, the practical realities make it highly improbable on this timeline. The final probability should be higher than the base rate but remain in the low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My reasoning heavily relies on the idea that rhetoric is cheap but logistics are hard. Could I be wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The water crisis is far more acute than is publicly known. The regime is keeping preparations secret to avoid panic. The President's statements were a deliberate leak to begin preparing the populace. An order could be issued suddenly, overriding normal budgetary processes through an emergency decree backed by the Supreme Leader. The resolution criterion is only an "order," not a successful evacuation, which is a lower bar. A chaotic, symbolic, or poorly executed order is more plausible than a well-managed one.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this scenario requires assuming a level of both crisis and competence in secrecy that is not supported by evidence. The most straightforward interpretation is that the government is using strong language to manage a severe but not yet cataclysmic problem. The lack of any leaks about logistical preparations in a system like Iran's is also a strong signal that they are not happening.
*   **Adjustment:** The possibility of a symbolic or panicked order to "do something" in the face of a worsening crisis means the probability is not zero. My final forecast should account for this tail risk. A probability of 3% (or about 1-in-33) seems to capture this: it's an unlikely event, but the specific circumstances created by the President's rhetoric make it a non-trivial possibility.

### 6. Final Forecast
The forecast is a contest between the President's highly unusual and urgent rhetoric and the overwhelming logistical, financial, and bureaucratic inertia against such a move. The lack of any visible preparation in terms of budget or on-the-ground action is the most compelling evidence. While the President's statements have made a previously near-impossible event plausible, the practical constraints make it highly improbable within the next 34 days.

Final: 3%
