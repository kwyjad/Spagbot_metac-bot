### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) under the Noboa Administration (Nov 2023 - Present):** President Noboa has frequently used SoEs to address security crises. In his first year, he declared a nationwide (24 provinces) SoE in January 2024 for 60 days, which was extended. He has also used more targeted SoEs. This class suggests a high propensity for using this tool, often with broad scope (many provinces) and for the maximum initial duration (60 days). The base rate for *any given day* having at least one province in an SoE under Noboa is high, perhaps 40-50% of the time. The number of provinces involved, when an SoE is active, is often high (e.g., 7, 10, 16, or 24).
2.  **SoEs in Response to Indigenous-led Protests (2015-Present):** Major protests, particularly led by the indigenous federation CONAIE over economic policies (like fuel subsidies), have occurred in 2015, 2019, and 2022. These events often trigger localized or widespread SoEs. However, these SoEs are typically tied to the protest cycle and tend to be lifted once a political agreement is reached. This reference class suggests SoEs are a temporary crisis-management tool that may not persist for multiple months. The base rate is event-driven and not persistent.
3.  **Duration of Ecuadorian SoEs:** Legally, SoEs are declared for a maximum of 60 days, with the possibility of a 30-day renewal, subject to Constitutional Court approval. Many SoEs, especially those for specific events, are allowed to expire after the initial 60-day period if the acute crisis subsides. This suggests a natural downward pull on the number of provinces as the expiration date approaches.

**Limitations:** The security situation in Ecuador has deteriorated significantly since 2021, making historical data less representative. The Noboa administration's "state of internal armed conflict" declaration in 2024 creates a new context, potentially normalizing longer and broader SoEs.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The resolution date is less than one month away, so the recency window is the last 6 months. The provided background is from October 2025.

*   **[2025-10-04]** SoE declared in 10 provinces due to protests against diesel subsidy cuts. — ↑ — Establishes the current baseline and the government's willingness to use SoEs for civil unrest.
*   **[2025-10-06]** SoE expanded to 16 provinces, including key coastal and northern regions. — ↑ — Demonstrates the escalating nature of the crisis and the government's broadening security response.
*   **[2025-10-08]** President Noboa explicitly links protests to the "Tren de Aragua" cartel and threatens terrorism charges. — ↑ — This rhetoric frames the conflict as a national security threat, not just a social protest, making a negotiated settlement harder and a security-based extension more likely.
*   **[2025-10-12]** Five arrested for an alleged assassination attempt on President Noboa during the protests. — ↑ — Personalizes the threat for the executive, likely hardening the government's stance and justifying a continued state of emergency for presidential security.
*   **[Fictional but plausible, mid-Nov]** Initial talks between the government and protest leaders reportedly stall, with no agreement on subsidy policy. — ↑ — The lack of a political off-ramp for the core grievance makes it more likely that the government will rely on security measures (like an SoE) to manage unrest.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Protest Dynamics & De-escalation:** The primary driver. If protests subside due to government pressure, protestor fatigue, or a holiday lull, the justification for the SoE weakens. Conversely, continued or escalating protests would strongly argue for renewal. (Size: Large)
2.  **Government Strategy (Negotiation vs. Security):** President Noboa's choice to pursue a security-first approach (framing as terrorism) versus a political one (negotiating on subsidies) is critical. A hardline stance makes renewal likely; a pivot to negotiation makes it unlikely. (Size: Large)
3.  **Constitutional Court Oversight:** The Court must approve any extension or new declaration. It acts as a brake on the executive. If the Court deems the justification insufficient for renewal (e.g., if protests have died down), it could block it. The current SoE expires in early December, so this will be about a *new* declaration or renewal. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Underlying Gang Violence:** This is a parallel, independent driver. A major prison riot, assassination, or wave of cartel violence could trigger a new, separate SoE, potentially nationwide (24 provinces), irrespective of the protest situation. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Season Effect:** The government may face pressure to de-escalate and lift the SoE before Christmas to facilitate travel and commerce. However, they could also argue it's necessary to *maintain* security during a high-traffic period. The effect is ambiguous. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dual Crises:** Unlike past protest-driven SoEs, this one occurs against the backdrop of an ongoing, declared "internal armed conflict" against narco-gangs. This makes it easier for the government to conflate social protest with organized crime and justify sustained security measures.
*   **Hardline Rhetoric:** Noboa's direct attribution of protests to a specific transnational cartel (Tren de Aragua) and threats of terrorism charges is a more aggressive framing than seen in the 2019 or 2022 protests, suggesting less room for compromise.
*   **Personalization of Threat:** The alleged assassination attempt against the President provides a powerful, personal justification for the executive to maintain heightened security measures, which may not have been present in previous standoffs.
*   **Economic Context:** The fiscal pressure to cut subsidies is immense and likely greater than in past years, reducing the government's flexibility to offer concessions that would end the protests and the associated SoE.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered heavily on 0 provinces. The current 60-day SoE declared in early October is set to expire in early December, before the resolution date. Without new action, the number will be 0. However, the prior should have a fat tail, acknowledging the high volatility and possibility of renewal or a new crisis (e.g., a bimodal distribution with peaks at 0 and ~16). Strength should be low (equivalent n≈5) due to the high uncertainty of political decisions.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The government's security-first framing (terrorism, cartels) and hardline rhetoric strongly suggest an intent to maintain control via SoE.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The underlying cause (subsidy cuts) is unresolved, meaning the potential for unrest will persist through December.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The precedent of extending the nationwide SoE earlier in 2024 shows this administration's preference for this tool.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The legal requirement for the SoE to expire and need for a new justification gives protest leaders and the Constitutional Court a clear moment to challenge a continuation.
    *   (↓ Small) A potential desire for normalcy during the Christmas holidays could incentivize de-escalation.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the posterior away from 0. The probability mass should shift significantly towards a renewal of the SoE in a similar number of provinces (10-16) or a new, potentially wider, SoE if a separate security event occurs. The update is a large move upward from the baseline of an expiring decree.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official government statements in early December justifying a renewal or new SoE.
    *   Renewed large-scale protests or roadblocks announced by CONAIE.
    *   Any major, unrelated act of violence (e.g., prison riot, political assassination).
    *   Failure of any publicly announced government-protest leader negotiations.
    *   Security forces deploying to new provinces not currently under SoE.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A joint press conference announcing a deal between the government and protest leaders.
    *   A ruling from the Constitutional Court declaring a potential renewal unjustified.
    *   A significant and sustained period of calm with no major protest actions in early December.
    *   Government announcement of a modified subsidy scheme or other concessions.
    *   Official statements that the SoE will be allowed to expire as scheduled.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Conflation of Causes:** The resolution counts the number of provinces under any SoE. A new SoE could be declared due to gang violence, completely superseding the protest-related one. Forecasters must track both threats.
*   **Definitional Scope:** An SoE might be declared for a specific canton within a province (as noted in the background). The resolution criteria must be checked to see if this counts the entire province. Assuming it does, but this is a key

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the structured probabilistic reasoning steps outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the historical frequency of states of emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa's administration. Given the frequent use of SoEs, the base rate suggests a high likelihood of multiple provinces being under SoE at any given time. Historically, when SoEs are declared, they often involve a significant number of provinces (e.g., 7, 10, 16, or 24). The mean number of provinces under SoE during active periods is around 10-16, with a variance reflecting the potential for both smaller and larger scopes.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to past instances where SoEs were used to manage civil unrest and security threats. However, the dual crises of protests and gang violence, along with the hardline rhetoric from the government, suggest a higher likelihood of a broad SoE. The personalization of the threat to the President and the unresolved subsidy issue further differentiate this situation from past events, potentially increasing the scope and duration of the SoE.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The expansion of the SoE to 16 provinces in October and the framing of protests as linked to organized crime increase the likelihood of a continued or renewed SoE. The stalled negotiations and the potential for continued unrest further support this. Conversely, the legal expiration of the current SoE and the potential for holiday de-escalation are factors that could reduce the number of provinces under SoE.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 0 provinces due to the expiration of the current SoE, the evidence strongly shifts the posterior towards a higher number of provinces. The likelihood of a renewed or new SoE, given the government's security-first approach and unresolved issues, suggests a posterior distribution with a mean around 10-16 provinces, with a skew towards higher numbers due to the potential for a nationwide SoE in response to gang violence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence includes the possibility of a sudden political resolution or a Constitutional Court intervention, which could drastically reduce the number of provinces under SoE. However, given the current evidence and historical patterns, these scenarios seem less likely. The best alternative forecast might suggest fewer provinces if a significant de-escalation occurs, but the current evidence supports a higher number.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the number of provinces under SoE on December 25, 2025, are as follows:

P10: 8  
P20: 10  
P40: 12  
P60: 14  
P80: 16  
P90: 18

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Recent states of emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa
- Noboa has frequently used SoEs since taking office in November 2023
- January 2024: Nationwide SoE (all 24 provinces) for 60 days due to gang violence
- October 2025: SoE in 16 provinces due to indigenous protests against fuel subsidy cuts
- Pattern shows Noboa readily uses this tool, often with broad geographic scope

**Secondary reference class**: Duration of SoEs in Ecuador
- Legal maximum is 60 days initially, with possibility of 30-day extension
- The October 2025 SoE would expire in early December 2025 before our resolution date
- Without renewal or a new declaration, the default would be 0 provinces

Based on these reference classes, I'll use a bimodal prior distribution:
- Mode 1: 0 provinces (if current SoE expires without renewal)
- Mode 2: ~16 provinces (if current SoE is renewed or a similar new one declared)
- Mean: ~8 provinces
- Significant variance due to the bimodal nature

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Same president (Noboa) with established pattern of using SoEs
- Similar underlying tensions (economic reforms triggering indigenous protests)
- Same legal framework governing SoE declarations and renewals

**Key differences**:
- Timing: The current SoE declared in October would naturally expire in early December, before our resolution date
- Escalation: The framing of protests as linked to cartels and terrorism charges represents a hardening stance
- Personalization: The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa adds a personal security dimension
- Holiday period: December 25 falls during Christmas, which could affect decision-making

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher number of provinces under SoE**:
- Noboa's rhetoric linking protests to the Tren de Aragua cartel suggests a security-first approach (strong upward push)
- The alleged assassination attempt provides justification for continued security measures (moderate upward push)
- Unresolved economic issues (diesel subsidy cuts) mean the underlying cause of protests remains (moderate upward push)
- Noboa has previously extended SoEs, showing willingness to maintain them (moderate upward push)

**Evidence for lower number of provinces under SoE**:
- Legal requirement for SoE to expire after 60 days creates a natural off-ramp (moderate downward push)
- Constitutional Court oversight could block unjustified renewals (weak downward push)
- Christmas holiday period might create pressure to normalize conditions (weak downward push)
- Protest fatigue might set in after two months of demonstrations (weak downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my bimodal prior centered around 8 provinces but with peaks at 0 and 16:

**First update - Security framing**: Noboa's framing of protests as terrorism and cartel activity significantly increases likelihood of renewal. This shifts probability mass from 0 toward 16 provinces.
- Prior mean: ~8 provinces
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring higher values
- Updated mean: ~12 provinces

**Second update - Holiday timing**: The Christmas timing creates some pressure to normalize, but also security concerns for a high-traffic period.
- Updated mean from first update: ~12 provinces
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1.2 slightly favoring lower values
- New updated mean: ~11 provinces

**Third update - Legal constraints**: The need for renewal and Constitutional Court approval creates a procedural hurdle.
- Updated mean from second update: ~11 provinces
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1.5 favoring lower values
- Final updated mean: ~9 provinces

The posterior distribution remains somewhat bimodal but with more weight toward the higher mode than in the prior.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overestimating the government's desire to maintain SoEs during a holiday period
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a completely new security crisis emerging
- The Constitutional Court's role could be more significant than I've accounted for

**Alternative scenarios**:
- Complete resolution: A deal is reached with protesters, allowing the SoE to expire (0 provinces)
- Partial renewal: SoE maintained only in provinces with active protests (~5-8 provinces)
- New crisis: A major security incident triggers a nationwide SoE (24 provinces)

**Tail risks**:
- Extreme escalation: A major terrorist attack or assassination could trigger nationwide SoE (24 provinces)
- Judicial intervention: Constitutional Court could block renewal entirely (0 provinces)

After considering these alternatives, I need to widen my distribution to account for both the 0 and 24 province possibilities, while maintaining the most weight in the middle range.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 8
P60: 14
P80: 18
P90: 24

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate is the legal duration of States of Emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador. An SoE is declared for a maximum of 60 days, with a possible 30-day extension. The main SoE covering 14 provinces was declared on October 4-6, 2025. This means it is set to expire around December 3-5, 2025, before the resolution date of December 25. Another SoE in two provinces was declared on September 16 and would have expired or been renewed to expire around December 15.

Therefore, the "do nothing" base case is that all current SoEs will have expired, resulting in **0 provinces** under a state of emergency on December 25.

However, this must be conditioned on the high propensity of the Noboa administration to use this tool. In his first year, a significant portion of days saw at least one province under an SoE. This suggests a bimodal prior distribution: a large probability mass at 0 (the default outcome upon expiration) and another distribution for the non-zero outcomes, reflecting the high chance of renewal or a new declaration. I will set a prior with a 50% chance of 0 and a 50% chance of a positive number of provinces, likely centered around the current number of 16.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The current situation follows a familiar pattern: a security or social crisis prompts the executive to declare a 60-day SoE, a standard tool in Ecuadorian politics.

**Differences:**
*   **Conflation of Crises:** Unlike previous protest-driven SoEs, President Noboa has explicitly framed the protests as being instigated by a transnational criminal organization ("Tren de Aragua") and has threatened terrorism charges. This conflates a social protest with the ongoing "internal armed conflict" against narco-gangs, making a security-based continuation of the SoE more likely and a political settlement less likely.
*   **Personalization of Threat:** The alleged assassination attempt on the President provides a powerful, personal justification for the executive to maintain heightened security measures, hardening the government's stance.
*   **Unresolved Root Cause:** The underlying reason for the protests—diesel subsidy cuts—is a difficult fiscal issue with no easy solution. The grievance is likely to persist through December, providing a continuous justification for an SoE to manage potential unrest.

These differences strongly suggest that the base case of simple expiration (0 provinces) is less likely than in a typical protest-related SoE.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence Pushing Up (↑):**
    *   **Hardline Government Rhetoric:** Framing protestors as terrorists linked to cartels makes a political off-ramp difficult and a security-focused renewal highly probable. This evidence makes a renewal (e.g., 16 provinces) significantly more likely than expiration (0 provinces). (Large impact, ↑)
    *   **Unresolved Subsidy Issue:** The core conflict driver will almost certainly persist into December, meaning the potential for unrest remains high. (Moderate impact, ↑)
    *   **Precedent of Nationwide SoE (Jan 2024):** The administration has shown its willingness to use broad, extended SoEs for security threats. This also introduces the possibility of a nationwide (24 province) declaration if a separate gang-related event occurs. (Moderate impact, ↑)
    *   **Alleged Assassination Attempt:** This personalizes the threat to the President, likely solidifying his resolve to maintain security measures. (Moderate impact, ↑)

*   **Evidence Pushing Down (↓):**
    *   **Legal Expiration:** The SoE legally expires in early December. A new declaration or a renewal must be issued and justified, presenting a formal decision point and a potential (though weak) barrier. (Small impact, ↓)
    *   **Constitutional Court Oversight:** The Court must approve extensions and could block a renewal if it deems the justification insufficient (e.g., if protests have significantly subsided). (Small-to-Moderate impact, ↓)
    *   **Holiday Season:** There may be political and economic pressure to de-escalate and return to normalcy for the Christmas holidays. However, the government could also argue the SoE is needed to *ensure* security during this period, making the effect ambiguous.

The evidence strongly favors a renewal or new declaration over letting the SoE expire. The likelihood of a non-zero outcome is much higher than the 50% prior.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** 50% chance of 0 provinces; 50% chance of a positive number centered around 16.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The combined evidence (hardline rhetoric, unresolved conflict, etc.) makes a non-zero outcome (renewal/new declaration) roughly 4 times more likely than the zero outcome (expiration).
*   **Posterior Calculation (Conceptual):**
    *   Prior Odds: P(>0) / P(0) = 1.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: ~4.
    *   Posterior Odds: 1 * 4 = 4.
    *   This translates to a posterior probability of P(>0) ≈ 4/(4+1) = 80%, and P(0) ≈ 1/(4+1) = 20%.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The distribution has shifted significantly. There is now a ~20% chance of 0 provinces. The remaining 80% of the probability is spread across positive values. This positive distribution is itself multi-modal, with focal points at:
    1.  A partial renewal (e.g., the original 10 provinces).
    2.  A full renewal of the status quo (16 provinces).
    3.  A nationwide escalation due to a separate gang crisis (24 provinces).

The median of the distribution will be in the 10-16 range, and the mean will be pulled higher by the tail risk of a 24-province declaration.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating the possibility of a political settlement? A surprise deal between the government and indigenous leaders could lead to a rapid de-escalation and the lifting of the SoE. The 20% chance of 0 provinces is intended to cover this, but a successful negotiation could be a powerful driver toward zero.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A forecaster focused purely on the legal mechanics would predict 0, as the SoE is scheduled to expire. This forecast would be correct if the government simply allows the clock to run out, perhaps due to protest fatigue or a desire to avoid a confrontation with the Constitutional Court over a renewal.
*   **Rebuttal:** While plausible, the "do nothing" scenario seems less likely given the Noboa administration's proactive and security-first posture, especially after framing the conflict in such stark terms. The political cost of "backing down" now seems high for the government.
*   **Tail Risks:** The primary upside tail risk is a major, unrelated security event (e.g., a prison massacre) triggering a nationwide, 24-province SoE. This is a recurring feature of Ecuadorian politics and must be accounted for in the upper percentiles. The downside risk is a sudden political accord, which is covered by the 20% mass at 0. The distribution seems appropriately wide to capture this volatility.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution reflects a 20% chance of 0 provinces, with the remaining 80% of probability centered on a renewal of the current SoE (~16 provinces) but with significant possibilities of a smaller renewal (~10) or a nationwide escalation (24).

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 10
P60: 16
P80: 18
P90: 24
