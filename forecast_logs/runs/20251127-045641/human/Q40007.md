### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Iranian responses to IAEA Board of Governors censure resolutions.** Iran has a long history of responding to diplomatic pressure from the IAEA with defiance and escalation. When censured, Iran typically reduces cooperation, removes cameras, or increases enrichment, rather than immediately capitulating. Agreements to restore access often take many months or years of negotiation. **Base rate for a quick (<2 month) agreement following censure is very low, perhaps <10%.**
*   **Reference Class 2: Nuclear negotiations following a major crisis or military action.** This is a rarer class. Examples could include Libya's decision to dismantle its program after the Iraq War or North Korea's behavior after military threats. In these cases, the actor either capitulates fully (Libya) or uses the crisis to double down on defiance (North Korea). Iran's historical pattern leans towards the latter. **Base rate for de-escalatory cooperation within a month of a direct military strike is low, estimated at 15-25%.**
*   **Reference Class 3: Short-term diplomatic agreements between Iran and Western powers.** Iran sometimes engages in tactical, short-term agreements to relieve pressure or buy time (e.g., the temporary agreement in September 2025). However, these are often fragile and prone to collapse over minor provocations or domestic political shifts. **The base rate of these agreements being successfully implemented and sustained for more than a few months is moderate, but the rate of reaching one in a ~30 day window under current conditions is low, perhaps 20%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-21** Iran formally terminates the September inspection agreement. — ↓↓ — This is the most recent, definitive action. It follows a Western-backed IAEA resolution and signals a hardline stance, making a reversal before year-end highly unlikely.
*   **2025-10-20** Reuters reports the September deal has been scrapped by Iran. — ↓ — This was the first public signal that the brief period of post-war cooperation was over, setting the stage for the formal termination.
*   **2025-09-09** Iran and the IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections at bombed sites. — ↑ — This event demonstrates that a path to "Yes" exists. Iran was, for a time, willing to allow access, likely to de-escalate and control the narrative around the damage.
*   **2025-07-15** IISS analysis suggests the 400kg HEU stockpile may have been moved. — ↓ — If the material is no longer at the declared sites, Iran has a strong incentive to deny access to conceal this fact, complicating any potential inspection deal.
*   **2025-06-25** Iranian lawmakers vote overwhelmingly to suspend IAEA cooperation. — ↓ — Occurring immediately after the ceasefire, this reflects a strong domestic political consensus for defiance, which will be difficult to reverse quickly.
*   **2025-06-24** A ceasefire ends the brief Iran-Israel/US war; key nuclear sites are heavily damaged. — (ambiguous) — The strikes create a powerful incentive for Iran to either hide the extent of the damage and its remaining capabilities (favoring NO) or allow limited access to de-escalate and prevent further attacks (favoring YES).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Domestic Politics & National Pride (Large ↓):** After a direct military attack on its sovereign territory and flagship scientific sites, the Iranian regime is under immense pressure to project strength and defiance. Allowing foreign inspectors to survey the damage could be framed by hardliners as a national humiliation and capitulation.
*   **Leverage & Bargaining (Large ↓):** The 400kg stockpile of 60% enriched uranium is Iran's single greatest point of leverage. Denying access to it creates ambiguity and international anxiety, which Tehran can use as a bargaining chip to demand sanctions relief or security guarantees. Giving up this chip for free is highly improbable.
*   **Fear of Further Military Action (Moderate ↑):** The June 2025 strikes proved that the US is willing and able to inflict devastating damage. A complete refusal to cooperate could be seen as a precursor to a breakout attempt, potentially triggering a second, more comprehensive round of strikes. This fear could motivate a tactical agreement to allow inspections to de-escalate.
*   **Concealment of Program Status (Moderate ↓):** Iran has a strong incentive to hide the true disposition of the 400kg stockpile. It may have been moved, partially destroyed, or its status may reveal sensitive information about weaponization. Denying access is the simplest way to maintain ambiguity and prevent the IAEA from establishing a new baseline.
*   **International Diplomatic Pressure/Incentives (Small ↑):** A sufficiently attractive offer from the P5+1 (e.g., significant, immediate sanctions relief) could persuade Iran to cooperate. However, the recent IAEA censure resolution shows that the current international approach is one of pressure, not incentives, which has proven counterproductive.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Physical Damage:** Unlike previous standoffs centered on diplomatic papers or undeclared sites, this dispute is about access to facilities that have been physically attacked by foreign powers. The political and security stakes are fundamentally higher.
*   **Known, High-Risk Stockpile:** The focus is not on suspected activities but on a known, large stockpile of near-weapons-grade material (400kg of 60% HEU). This raises the stakes for all parties and reduces the room for diplomatic ambiguity.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in ~34 days. Typical IAEA-Iran disputes unfold over many months or years. Reaching a durable agreement from the current position of open hostility in such a short period would be an extreme outlier.
*   **Recent, Failed Agreement:** A deal was reached in September and collapsed by November. This demonstrates both that a deal is technically possible but also that the current environment is exceptionally volatile and trust is non-existent, making any new agreement much harder to forge.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior for "Yes" (~15%), reflecting the base rate of Iran quickly capitulating to IAEA demands, especially after a crisis. This is a strong prior, equivalent to n≈10 observations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓ Large) Iran's formal termination of the inspection deal in November in response to an IAEA resolution is a powerful signal of a defiant policy.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The overwhelming parliamentary vote in June to suspend cooperation indicates a unified hardline domestic political front against inspections.
    *   (↓ Small) The possibility that the HEU stockpile has been moved gives Iran a strong technical reason to deny access to conceal its new location.
    *   (↑ Small) The fact that a deal was briefly reached in September shows that a diplomatic pathway is not impossible, but its subsequent failure heavily discounts its positive weight.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the low prior. The posterior probability for "Yes" should be revised significantly downward.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   Reports of secret back-channel talks, likely hosted by Oman or Qatar.
    *   Public statements from the US/E3 offering a specific, tangible concession (e.g., unfreezing specific assets) in exchange for inspections.
    *   Unusually conciliatory statements from Iran's Supreme Leader or Foreign Ministry.
    *   Public pressure on Iran from Russia or China to cooperate with the IAEA.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   Continued defiant rhetoric from Tehran, linking inspections to the lifting of all sanctions.
    *   Announcement of new sanctions on Iran by the US or EU.
    *   Israeli officials making public threats of further military action.
    *   IAEA Director General reports a complete breakdown of communication with Tehran.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on an "announcement of an agreement." This could be a vague joint statement with no firm timeline, which Iran could agree to for tactical reasons without intending to follow through.
*   **Deception Risk:** Iran could agree to inspections of the rubble at the sites, knowing the material has been moved. This would technically resolve the question as "Yes" while defeating the spirit of the inspection regime.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** An unrelated regional crisis (e.g., a leadership change in a key country, a major terrorist attack) could dramatically alter the strategic calculations of all parties involved.
*   **Information Gaps:** The true state of the bombed facilities, the location of the HEU stockpile, and the internal deliberations of the Iranian leadership are all highly uncertain.

### Final Research Summary
The probability of Iran agreeing to IAEA inspections before 2026 is very low. The recent, explicit termination of a prior inspection deal, combined with a domestic political climate favoring defiance after the June 2025 military strikes, creates formidable obstacles that are highly unlikely to be overcome in the ~30-day timeframe.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 2** is most applicable: Nuclear negotiations following a major crisis or military action. Historically, Iran tends to respond to military threats with defiance rather than cooperation. The base rate for de-escalatory cooperation within a month of a direct military strike is estimated at 15-25%. Given the recent military action and Iran's historical pattern, I will use a prior probability of 20%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities**: The current situation involves a recent military strike and subsequent diplomatic tensions, similar to past instances where Iran has resisted cooperation.
   - **Differences**: The unprecedented physical damage to nuclear sites and the known stockpile of enriched uranium increase the stakes, potentially reducing the likelihood of cooperation even further.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Termination of Inspection Deal (↓↓ Large)**: Iran's formal termination of the inspection deal in November signals a strong defiant stance. Likelihood ratio significantly favors "No".
   - **Parliamentary Vote (↓ Moderate)**: The overwhelming vote to suspend cooperation reflects a strong domestic consensus against inspections. Likelihood ratio favors "No".
   - **Possibility of Moved Stockpile (↓ Small)**: If the stockpile has been moved, Iran has a technical reason to deny access. Likelihood ratio slightly favors "No".
   - **September Deal (↑ Small)**: The brief agreement in September shows a pathway to "Yes" exists, but its collapse heavily discounts its positive weight. Likelihood ratio slightly favors "Yes".

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds**: 20% probability translates to odds of 0.25.
   - **Likelihood Ratios**: The strong evidence against cooperation (termination of the deal, parliamentary vote) outweighs the weak evidence for cooperation (September deal).
   - **Posterior Odds**: Prior odds (0.25) × Combined likelihood ratio (significantly <1) results in much lower odds.
   - **Posterior Probability**: The posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior, reflecting the strong evidence against cooperation.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of a sudden diplomatic breakthrough or external pressure leading to a change in Iran's stance.
   - **Alternative Scenarios**: A major geopolitical shift or internal political change in Iran could alter the current trajectory.
   - **Adjustments**: Given the strong evidence against cooperation and the short timeframe, the probability remains low, but not zero.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final probability of Iran allowing IAEA inspections before 2026 is very low.

Final: 5%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on Iran's historical behavior regarding IAEA inspections, particularly following military actions or international pressure.

The most relevant reference class is Iran's response to major crises involving its nuclear program, especially after military actions. Looking at historical patterns:

- Iran typically responds to military actions or IAEA censures with defiance and reduced cooperation
- The timeframe is extremely short (only about 34 days until 2026)
- Iran has a consistent pattern of using access to nuclear sites as leverage in negotiations

Based on these considerations, I'll set a low prior probability of 15% that Iran will allow IAEA inspections before 2026. This reflects the historical rarity of Iran quickly agreeing to inspections after military actions or during periods of heightened tension.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran is facing international pressure regarding its nuclear program
- The IAEA is seeking access to verify compliance with non-proliferation commitments
- Iran's leadership is using access as a bargaining chip for sanctions relief

**Key differences:**
- The severity of the military action (direct bombing of nuclear facilities) is unprecedented
- The extremely short timeframe (34 days) gives little room for diplomatic maneuvering
- Iran recently agreed to inspections in September 2025 but then formally terminated this agreement in November 2025
- The specific focus is on a known 400kg stockpile of 60% enriched uranium, raising the stakes

These differences generally make cooperation less likely than the base case, as the military strikes represent a more severe provocation, and the recent termination of the September agreement indicates a hardening position.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran formally terminated the September inspection agreement on November 21, 2025**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections by January, this termination would be highly unlikely (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Iran will not allow inspections, this termination is very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Iran and IAEA briefly reached an agreement in September 2025**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, a previous agreement makes sense (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, a previous temporary agreement is still somewhat likely (~0.4)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.4 = 2.0
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Iranian lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to suspend IAEA cooperation after the strikes**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this vote would be unlikely (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this vote is very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: The 400kg HEU stockpile may have been moved from the bombed sites**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this movement would be somewhat unlikely (~0.4)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this movement is quite likely (~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (formal termination of agreement):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability: 0.019/(1+0.019) = 1.9%

Second update (previous September agreement):
- Prior odds: 0.019
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.019 × 2.0 = 0.038
- Posterior probability: 0.038/(1+0.038) = 3.7%

Third update (parliamentary vote to suspend cooperation):
- Prior odds: 0.038
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.038 × 0.33 = 0.013
- Posterior probability: 0.013/(1+0.013) = 1.3%

Fourth update (possible movement of HEU stockpile):
- Prior odds: 0.013
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.013 × 0.5 = 0.0065
- Posterior probability: 0.0065/(1+0.0065) = 0.65%

This extremely low probability (0.65%) seems too confident given the inherent uncertainties, so I should consider additional factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the pressure Iran faces from Russia or China to cooperate
- I might be overlooking the possibility of secret negotiations already underway
- The fear of additional military strikes could be a stronger motivator than I've accounted for
- Iran might agree to limited inspections as a tactical move while still concealing key information

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could announce a conditional agreement on December 31 as a diplomatic maneuver
- A major geopolitical shift could occur (e.g., change in US policy, regional crisis)
- Iran might agree to inspections of the bombed sites knowing the material is no longer there

**Adjustments needed:**
The probability seems too low given these considerations. While the evidence strongly points to "No," the possibility of tactical cooperation or diplomatic surprises warrants a modest upward adjustment. I'll increase my estimate from 0.65% to approximately 5%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that there is a 5% probability that Iran will allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026.

The extremely short timeframe (34 days), Iran's recent formal termination of the previous inspection agreement, the unprecedented military strikes on its nuclear facilities, and the domestic political pressure to maintain a defiant stance all make cooperation highly unlikely in this timeframe.

Final: 5%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is nuclear negotiations with a state like Iran following a major military crisis. Historical examples are rare, but they tend towards extremes: either full capitulation (like Libya) or entrenched defiance (like North Korea). Iran's history of brinkmanship and using its nuclear program for leverage suggests it leans towards the latter. The research report provides a base rate of 15-25% for de-escalatory cooperation within a month of a direct military strike. This seems like a reasonable starting point, as it captures the possibility that the shock of the attack could force a tactical de-escalation.

I will select a prior probability of **20%** for Iran agreeing to inspections. This translates to prior odds of 1:4 in favor of "No".

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from a generic post-conflict negotiation in several ways that make an agreement less likely:

*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The question resolves by January 1, 2026, leaving only about 34 days. Major international agreements, especially between adversaries, are rarely concluded this quickly.
*   **Recent Diplomatic Failure:** A previous agreement to allow inspections was reached in September 2025 but was formally and publicly terminated by Iran on November 21, 2025. Rebuilding trust and negotiating a new deal so soon after a public collapse is exceptionally difficult.
*   **Nature of the Inspection:** The inspections would cover sites recently bombed by foreign powers. Allowing this would be politically humiliating for the Iranian regime, which is under intense domestic pressure to project strength and defiance.

These factors suggest the probability should be significantly lower than the 20% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several key pieces of evidence must be considered:

*   **Evidence 1: Iran's formal termination of the September inspection deal on November 21.**
    *   This is the most powerful and recent piece of evidence. The likelihood of Iran formally terminating a deal just to turn around and agree to a new one within 34 days (P(E | H)) is extremely low. Conversely, this action is highly consistent with a decision to stonewall for the foreseeable future (P(E | ~H)).
    *   The likelihood ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)) is therefore very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability of "Yes".

*   **Evidence 2: Domestic political consensus for defiance.**
    *   The parliamentary vote in June to suspend cooperation and the need for the regime to save face after the bombing create a strong internal political barrier to what would be perceived as capitulation. This evidence also points towards "No".

*   **Evidence 3: Fear of further military action.**
    *   This is the primary driver for a "Yes" outcome. If the Iranian leadership believes that refusing inspections creates an unacceptable risk of a second, more devastating attack, they might be compelled to agree.
    *   However, Iran's recent defiant actions suggest they either do not believe another attack is imminent or that they have calculated that defiance is the better strategic option. This evidence provides a slight upward pressure on the probability but appears to be outweighed by the negative factors.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's perform a conceptual update using the most critical piece of evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:4 (a 20% probability of "Yes").
*   **Evidence:** Iran formally terminates the existing inspection agreement on November 21.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** This action is far more likely if Iran does *not* plan to agree to inspections than if it does. Let's estimate this makes a "No" outcome at least 10 times more likely. The likelihood ratio is approximately 0.1.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/4) × 0.1 = 0.025.
*   **Posterior Probability:** Odds / (1 + Odds) = 0.025 / 1.025 ≈ 2.4%.

This update demonstrates that the recent, concrete action by Iran to terminate the deal drastically reduces the initial probability. The posterior probability is now in the low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My reasoning heavily relies on the public signals from Iran, which point overwhelmingly to "No". I must consider how this could be wrong.

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible path to a "Yes" is a surprise diplomatic breakthrough. The public termination of the deal could have been posturing, intended to appease hardliners, while secret back-channel negotiations are happening to restore inspections in exchange for a new, quiet concession from the West (e.g., unfreezing specific assets).
*   **Gaming the Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves on an "announcement of an agreement." Iran could agree to a vague, non-binding "agreement in principle" to de-escalate tensions without committing to firm dates or access. This would technically resolve the question as "Yes" while allowing Iran to continue delaying. This is a significant risk to a low forecast.

While these scenarios are possible, they are unlikely to materialize in the 34-day window. The current diplomatic environment is hostile, and the trust required for a rapid, secret deal is absent. However, the possibility of a face-saving, vague announcement means the probability cannot be near-zero. I will adjust my posterior slightly upward from the calculated ~2.4% to account for this tail risk. A probability of 7% implies roughly a 1-in-14 chance of such a surprise, which feels appropriate for a low-probability but not impossible event.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a quick de-escalatory agreement after a military strike is already low, around 20%. The specific circumstances—particularly the extremely short timeline and Iran's very recent, formal termination of a prior inspection deal—provide powerful evidence that pushes the probability down significantly. The primary argument for "Yes" rests on Iran's fear of another attack, but its current posture is one of defiance. While a surprise, face-saving agreement remains a possibility, it is a distinct outlier scenario. The overwhelming balance of evidence points to a continued stalemate through the end of the year.

Final: 7%
