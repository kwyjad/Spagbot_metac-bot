### Reference class & base rates
-   **Longest Field Goal per Season (2010-2020):** This period represents the modern kicking era before the recent surge in extreme distances. The median longest kick was ~61 yards. The maximum was 64 yards (Matt Prater, 2013 in Denver). This class suggests a baseline expectation in the low 60s.
-   **Longest Field Goal per Season (2021-2024):** This class captures the recent acceleration. It includes Justin Tucker's NFL record 66-yarder (2021), a 62-yarder (2022), a 61-yarder (2023), and a 62-yarder (2024). The average longest kick is ~63 yards. This class suggests a higher baseline and demonstrates that a new record is a plausible, but not annual, event.
-   **Longest Field Goal Attempts per Season (2018-2024):** The number of attempts from 60+ yards is a key driver of makes. Historically, there are only 2-4 such attempts per season. The conversion rate on these is low (~25%), but the existence of attempts is a prerequisite for a make.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-10-03** Two field goals of 64 and 65 yards made in the first four weeks of the season. — ↑ (Large) — Establishes a high floor for the season's longest kick (65 yards) and indicates conditions are highly favorable for extreme distances. The season's max is already the 2nd longest in history.
-   **2025-08-13** Jaguars rookie Cam Little makes a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. — ↑ (Moderate) — While unofficial, this event demonstrates the raw leg strength of new kickers and resets the psychological barrier for what coaches and kickers believe is possible.
-   **2025-08-01** NFL implements new "K-ball" rule, allowing teams to practice with kicking balls all week. — ↑ (Moderate) — This rule change provides a plausible mechanism for increased distance and consistency on long kicks, as kickers can "break in" the notoriously hard K-balls.
-   **2025-10-03** Reports note that overall 50+ yard FG accuracy is flat compared to 2024. — ↓ (Small) — Suggests the new K-ball rule may not be a universal tide lifting all long kicks, but perhaps a niche benefit for maximum-distance attempts by elite specialists.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Kicker Talent & Specialization (Large):** The pool of kickers is more specialized and powerful than ever. Athletes are training for leg strength and technique from a younger age, creating a pipeline of talent capable of hitting from 60+ yards.
-   **Altitude (Large):** Kicks in Denver's Empower Field at Mile High travel ~5-10% further. The stadium has been the site of 3 of the 10 longest field goals in history. Any game in Denver, especially with a strong-legged kicker, dramatically increases the probability of a very long field goal.
-   **Game Situation (Moderate):** The vast majority of 60+ yard attempts occur at the end of a half or game, when the low-probability attempt is the only or best option. The frequency of these specific scenarios is a key driver of opportunity.
-   **Weather Conditions (Moderate):** Warm, dry, and calm conditions are optimal. Cold, wet, and windy conditions, common late in the season in many NFL cities, significantly reduce maximum kicking distance and a coach's willingness to attempt a long FG.
-   **"K-Ball" Rule Change (Moderate):** The new rule allowing kickers to prepare the game balls is a structural change. A broken-in ball is softer and has better energy transfer, plausibly adding 1-3 yards of range for elite kickers.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Early Season Success:** A 65-yard field goal has already been made. In most prior seasons (the base rate), the season-long maximum did not reach this distance. This sets an extremely high floor with over two-thirds of the season remaining.
-   **Structural Rule Change:** The K-ball preparation rule is a new variable not present in any historical reference class. Its effect is uncertain but plausibly positive for maximum distance.
-   **Psychological Barriers Eroding:** The 70-yard preseason kick, while unofficial, serves as a proof of concept. Coaches and kickers may now view attempts from 65-68 yards as more feasible, potentially increasing the number of attempts from that range.
-   **Concentration of Talent:** The league features several kickers with demonstrated 60+ yard range (e.g., Justin Tucker, Evan McPherson, Brandon Aubrey, Jake Moody, Cam Little), increasing the number of potential actors who could break the record if given the opportunity.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A distribution based on the 2021-2024 reference class, centered around 63 yards, with a right tail extending to the record of 66 and a small probability of exceeding it. Equivalent n: ~10 seasons.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑↑ Large) A 65-yard FG has already been made. This truncates the distribution, setting a new floor, and provides a massive update toward the extreme right tail.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The new K-ball rule provides a causal reason to believe the entire distribution of potential maximum distances has shifted upward this season.
    -   (↑ Small) The 70-yard preseason kick provides supporting evidence of increased potential and willingness to attempt longer kicks.
    -   (↔ Small) The flat overall 50+ yard FG% suggests the effect is not universal, slightly dampening the strength of the K-ball mechanism but not negating it for elite attempts.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift dramatically upward. The probability mass below 65 yards is now zero. The median of the posterior should be around 66 yards, with a significantly increased probability for a new record (67+ yards).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Any 60+ yard attempts, even misses, especially if they have the distance but are wide.
    -   Upcoming games in Denver, particularly with visiting teams that have strong-legged kickers.
    -   Games played in domes or warm-weather locations in December/January.
    -   Media reports or coach interviews discussing a kicker's expanded range in practice.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Injuries to any of the league's premier long-distance kickers.
    -   A stretch of games for top kickers in poor weather conditions (e.g., snow, high winds in Chicago, Green Bay, Buffalo).
    -   Teams with strong-legged kickers falling out of playoff contention, reducing the number of high-leverage end-of-game situations.
    -   A lack of 60+ yard attempts in the coming weeks, suggesting the early season makes were outliers.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Small Sample Size:** The 64 and 65-yard makes are only two data points. They could be high-variance outliers rather than the new normal.
-   **Opportunity is a Bottleneck:** A kicker may have the ability, but the specific game situation required for a record attempt is rare. A lack of opportunity, not ability, could cap the season's maximum.
-   **Weather's Dominant Effect:** The remaining schedule is in late fall and early winter. The increasing likelihood of cold and windy weather could counteract the positive drivers and suppress further long kicks.
-   **Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves on the regular season only. A longer kick in the playoffs would not count.

### Final Research Summary
The 2025 season is an outlier. With a 65-yard field goal already on the books and a new rule aiding kickers, the environment is primed for a record-breaking year. The forecast should be anchored at 65 yards as a floor, with a significant probability of a new NFL record (67+ yards) being set.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will apply Bayesian reasoning using the steps outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the longest field goals per season from 2021-2024, with an average of ~63 yards. This period reflects recent trends in kicking performance, including Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021. The variance is moderate, as the longest kicks in this period range from 61 to 66 yards.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation continues the trend of increasing field goal distances, with multiple kicks over 60 yards already recorded.
   - Differences: The 2025 season has seen a 65-yard kick early on, and the new K-ball rule could enhance kicking performance. These factors suggest a shift towards longer kicks.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - A 65-yard field goal has already been made, setting a high floor and increasing the likelihood of longer kicks.
   - The K-ball rule change is expected to improve kick distance, suggesting a shift in the distribution towards longer kicks.
   - The 70-yard preseason kick by Cam Little indicates potential for longer kicks, though it was unofficial.
   - Flat 50+ yard FG accuracy suggests the K-ball rule may not universally enhance performance, slightly moderating the upward shift.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Centered around 63 yards, with a right tail extending to 66 yards.
   - Evidence: The 65-yard kick and K-ball rule shift the distribution upwards.
   - Posterior: The mean shifts to around 66 yards, with increased probability for a new record (67+ yards).

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks: Weather conditions and lack of opportunities could limit long kicks.
   - Alternative forecast: A conservative estimate might place the longest kick at 65 yards, but given the evidence, a new record is plausible.
   - Adjustments: Account for potential weather impacts and game situations that could limit attempts.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood of longer kicks, with a significant probability of a new record.

P10: 65  
P20: 66  
P40: 67

# Forecast: Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference distributions to establish my prior:

**Primary Reference Class**: Longest field goal per NFL season from 2010-2024
- Mean/Median: ~62 yards
- Range: 58-66 yards (Justin Tucker's 66-yarder in 2021 is the NFL record)
- Distribution: Right-skewed with most seasons having a longest kick in the 60-63 yard range

**Secondary Reference Class**: Longest field goal attempts per season
- Typically only 2-4 attempts from 60+ yards per season
- Conversion rate on extreme attempts (~25%)

I'm selecting these reference classes because they capture both the historical pattern of maximum distances and the opportunity structure that constrains extreme values.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Same fundamental task (kicking field goals in NFL games)
- Same physical constraints (field dimensions, ball specifications)
- Similar pool of elite kickers (many top kickers from recent years remain active)

**Key differences:**
- A 65-yard field goal has already been made in the first four weeks of the 2025 season, establishing a floor significantly higher than most historical season maximums
- New "K-ball" rule allowing teams to practice with kicking balls all week, potentially adding 1-3 yards of range
- Preseason demonstration of a 70-yard field goal by Cam Little, resetting psychological barriers
- Continued evolution of kicker specialization and technique

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- **65-yard field goal already made** (Strong, +3-4 yards): This establishes a floor and indicates conditions are favorable for extreme distances.
- **New K-ball rule** (Moderate, +1-2 yards): Allowing kickers to break in balls provides a plausible mechanism for increased distance.
- **70-yard preseason kick** (Moderate, +1 yard): While unofficial, demonstrates raw capability exists and may increase coach willingness to attempt longer kicks.
- **Multiple 60+ yard capable kickers in the league** (Moderate, +1 yard): Increased pool of kickers with extreme distance capability increases chances.

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- **Flat 50+ yard FG percentage vs 2024** (Weak, -0.5 yards): Suggests the K-ball effect may not be universal.
- **Weather deterioration** (Moderate, -1 yard): Remaining games will be played in increasingly cold/windy conditions.
- **Rarity of opportunity** (Moderate, -1 yard): Game situations allowing 65+ yard attempts remain extremely rare.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 62 yards with a right tail extending to 66 yards:

**First update - 65-yard make already occurred:**
- This truncates my distribution at 65 yards (zero probability below this)
- Shifts significant probability mass toward 65-68 yard range
- Increases probability of a new record (67+ yards)

**Second update - K-ball rule change:**
- Further shifts distribution rightward by ~1-2 yards
- Increases probability in the 67-69 yard range

**Third update - Weather and opportunity constraints:**
- Slightly moderates the extreme right tail (70+ yards)
- Creates a more concentrated distribution in the 65-68 yard range

The posterior distribution is now centered around 66-67 yards, with significant probability mass in the 65-69 yard range and a smaller but meaningful probability extending to 70+ yards.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of early-season makes. The 65-yarder could be an outlier rather than indicative of a new normal.
- I might be underestimating the impact of weather. Late-season games in cold/windy conditions could severely limit opportunities for record attempts.
- The K-ball rule's impact might be overstated. The flat 50+ yard percentage suggests its effect may be minimal.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more conservative forecast would center around 65-66 yards, arguing that the early-season 65-yarder will stand as the season maximum. This is plausible because:
- Opportunity is the primary constraint, not capability
- Weather conditions will deteriorate
- The 65-yarder itself may have been a perfect confluence of factors unlikely to be repeated

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While the conservative case has merit, it underweights:
- The demonstrated capability of multiple kickers to hit from 65+ yards
- The structural change from the K-ball rule
- The increased willingness of coaches to attempt extreme distances
- The fact that we still have 13 weeks of games remaining, including some in domes and Denver

I'll adjust my distribution slightly to account for these considerations, widening my uncertainty bands.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My prior distribution is based on the longest field goal made in each NFL regular season from 2021 to 2024. This period is the most relevant reference class as it captures the recent trend of increasing kicking distances and includes the current NFL record.

*   **Reference Class:** Longest FG per season, 2021-2024.
*   **Data Points:** 66 yards (2021), 62 yards (2022), 61 yards (2023), 62 yards (2024).
*   **Distribution:** This gives a median of 62 yards and a mean of 62.75 yards. The distribution is tight, with a maximum of 66 yards (the current all-time record). This prior suggests that a typical season's longest kick is in the low 60s, with a record-breaking kick being a rare event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base case due to several key factors:

*   **Similarity:** The league structure, talent pool, and general game situations that prompt long field goal attempts are consistent with the 2021-2024 period.
*   **Difference (Major):** A 65-yard field goal has *already been made* within the first four weeks of the season. This is an extraordinary event that sets a hard floor for the final outcome. The question is no longer "what will the longest kick be?" but rather "will the current 65-yard mark be surpassed?".
*   **Difference (Moderate):** A new rule allows teams to practice with the official "K-balls" all week. This provides a plausible physical mechanism for increased kicking distances, as kickers can "break in" the notoriously hard footballs, potentially improving energy transfer and adding range.
*   **Difference (Moderate):** Psychological barriers have been lowered. A 70-yard field goal in the preseason, while unofficial, serves as a proof-of-concept for what is physically possible, potentially encouraging coaches to attempt kicks from previously unthinkable distances (66+ yards).

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of new information to update my prior.

*   **Evidence 1: 65-yard FG already made.** This is the single most important piece of information. It is not just evidence; it's a constraint. It makes any outcome below 65 impossible and provides a massive update towards the extreme right tail of the original distribution. The likelihood of the season's longest kick being ≥65 yards is now 100%.
*   **Evidence 2: New "K-ball" rule.** This provides a causal reason for the observed increase in distance. It suggests the early-season long kicks are not just a fluke but potentially the result of a systemic change. This evidence makes outcomes higher than the historical base rate (e.g., 66, 67, 68 yards) significantly more likely.
*   **Evidence 3: 70-yard preseason FG.** This demonstrates that the physical potential for a 67+ yard kick exists within the current pool of NFL kickers. It increases the likelihood of a new record by showing the "ceiling" is higher than previously demonstrated in games.
*   **Counter-Evidence: Overall 50+ yard FG% is flat.** This suggests the K-ball rule's effect may not be universal. It might only benefit elite kickers on maximum-effort attempts, rather than making all long kicks easier. This slightly dampens the effect of Evidence 2, but doesn't negate it for the specific question of the *single longest* kick.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 62-63 yards, with a tail extending to the record of 66.
*   **Update Step 1 (Hard Constraint):** The observation of a 65-yard field goal truncates the prior distribution. All probability mass below 65 is shifted to values of 65 and above. The minimum possible value is now 65.
*   **Update Step 2 (Likelihoods):** The K-ball rule and the 70-yard preseason kick act as strong likelihood multipliers for outcomes above 65. They make a new record (≥67 yards) seem much more plausible than in a typical year. Given these factors and that over 75% of the season remains, the probability of the 65-yard kick being surpassed is high.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is anchored with a hard floor at 65 yards. I estimate a substantial probability (~75%) that a longer kick will be made before the season ends. The median (P50) of my posterior therefore shifts to 66 yards, indicating it's more likely than not that the current NFL record is at least tied. The distribution has a significant right tail, reflecting the increased possibility of a new record.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The longest kick of the season remains 65 yards. This could happen if the two early long kicks were high-variance outliers and not indicative of a new trend. Furthermore, as the season progresses into late fall and winter, weather conditions will worsen in many outdoor stadiums, suppressing opportunities for long-range attempts. The specific game situations required for a record attempt are rare, and it's possible one doesn't materialize for the league's top kickers in favorable conditions for the rest of the season.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Am I overweighting the K-ball rule and the preseason kick? Their true effects are unknown. The flat 50+ yard success rate suggests caution. However, the fact that a 65-yarder has *already been made* is not a theory; it's a fact. This fact alone justifies a massive upward revision.
*   **Adjustment:** My forecast already assigns a non-trivial probability (~25%) to the 65-yard kick holding as the season's longest. This accounts for the "regression to the mean" and weather-related risks. The primary driver of the forecast remains the hard evidence of the 65-yard make, which makes a high forecast unavoidable.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is truncated at 65 yards. The median is 66 yards, reflecting a belief that the current record will likely be tied or broken. The upper percentiles account for the significant possibility of a new NFL record this season.
