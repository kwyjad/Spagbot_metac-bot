### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Appropriations Bills Enacted in December After a CR:** In fiscal years where a continuing resolution (CR) is passed to avert/end a shutdown around the start of the fiscal year (Oct 1), Congress often uses the time until the CR expires to negotiate a final package. Action typically occurs just before the CR deadline. In cases where a CR extends funding past the new year, it is rare for any additional regular appropriations bills to be enacted in the interim December period. The base rate of passing *additional* individual bills or minibuses in December when a CR is already in place until late January is very low, likely **<10% of instances**, with the number of bills passed in such a window usually being 0.
2.  **Lame-Duck Session Productivity:** Congressional sessions between a November election and the start of the new Congress in January ("lame-duck" sessions) can be either highly productive or completely gridlocked. When a large omnibus spending bill is the main agenda item, the outcome is often bimodal: either all remaining bills are passed in one package right before a deadline, or none are, and a longer-term CR is passed instead. The base rate for passing *some but not all* remaining bills is low. Given this, the number of additional bills passed is often **0 or the remaining 9**, not a number in between.
3.  **Post-Shutdown Legislative Action:** Following major, contentious government shutdowns, the immediate aftermath is characterized by exhaustion and a desire to avoid repeating the crisis. The deal that ends the shutdown often sets the legislative path for the near future. If that deal includes a CR that pushes the next deadline out by several months, it signals a truce. The base rate for enacting further controversial legislation in the month immediately following the end of a long shutdown is very low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-21** CR and Minibus Enacted — **↓** — The deal ended the shutdown but also set the next funding deadline for the remaining 9 bills to Jan 30, 2026. This removes the "cliff" that would force action in December.
*   **2025-11-13** Bipartisan Leadership Announces Shutdown Deal Framework — **↓** — The framework explicitly separated the three "easier" bills from the more contentious ones, signaling an agreement to disagree and postpone the harder fights until after the holidays.
*   **2025-10-01** FY 2026 Government Shutdown Begins — **↓** — The start of the "longest federal government shutdown in US history" indicates extreme partisan division and bitterness, making subsequent compromise on difficult bills harder.
*   **2025-08-01** Senate Passes MilCon-VA Bill — **↑** — Bipartisan passage of some individual bills in committee and on the floor over the summer showed that some regular order was possible before the pre-shutdown breakdown.
*   **2025-06-22** House Appropriations Committee Advances Partisan Bills — **↓** — Early versions of bills passed out of House committees with partisan provisions ("poison pills"), setting the stage for the conflict that led to the shutdown.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Deadline Pressure:** The most powerful driver for appropriations action is a hard deadline that forces a choice between a deal and a shutdown. The current CR pushes this deadline to January 30, largely deactivating this mechanism for December. (Large)
2.  **Partisan Polarization:** The issues that caused the longest shutdown in history (likely spending levels, culture-war policy riders) have not been resolved for the remaining nine, more contentious bills (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security). This gridlock remains the primary obstacle. (Large)
3.  **Holiday Recess:** Members of Congress are strongly incentivized to leave Washington D.C. for the holidays. This can either force a last-minute deal or, more likely, encourage punting all major decisions until the new year. Given the January 30 cushion, punting is the easier option. (Moderate)
4.  **Shutdown Aversion/Fatigue:** Having just endured a painful, multi-week shutdown, both parties have an incentive to avoid another crisis. However, this is more likely to manifest as a clean CR extension in January rather than a difficult compromise in December. (Moderate)
5.  **Deal-making Momentum (or lack thereof):** The passage of the three-bill "minibus" could theoretically create momentum. However, it's more probable that it represents the exhaustion of all available consensus, leaving only the most difficult issues unresolved. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Three Bills Already Enacted:** Unlike many appropriations cycles that end in an all-or-nothing omnibus, three bills are already law. This is unusual and confirms that the remaining nine are the most difficult ones where compromise has so far failed.
*   **Post-Crisis "Cooling Off" Period:** The resolution occurred after a historically long and damaging shutdown. The reference class for this level of political toxicity is small. The political climate is likely far more bitter and trust-depleted than in a typical appropriations cycle.
*   **The January 30 Deadline:** This is the most critical difference. The base rate for December action is driven by a pre-Christmas deadline. The current structure provides a five-week cushion *after* the new year begins, fundamentally altering the strategic timeline for leadership. There is no compelling reason to force a painful negotiation in December.
*   **Known Sticking Points:** The shutdown itself has made the specific points of contention (e.g., funding levels for specific agencies, policy riders) crystal clear to all parties. These are not new issues to be negotiated; they are known battle lines where both sides have already dug in.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on **3** (i.e., 0 additional bills) seems appropriate, based on the historical rarity of passing major legislation in December when a CR is already in place until the following month. This prior should be reasonably strong (equivalent n ≈ 10-15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The CR deadline of Jan 30, 2026, removes the primary driver for December action.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The extreme polarization evidenced by the historic shutdown suggests the remaining bills are deadlocked on fundamental issues.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The holiday recess provides a powerful incentive to defer complex work.
    *   **↔ (Small):** The passage of three bills confirms that the easy work is done, leaving only the hard work, which argues against further progress.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior distribution should be more sharply peaked at **3** than the prior was. The probability of any additional bills passing before Jan 1 should be considered very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   House and Senate leadership announce a formal "pre-conference" to negotiate a second minibus package.
    *   Public statements from party leaders indicating a desire to "clear the decks" before the holidays.
    *   Key committee chairs (e.g., House/Senate Appropriations) announce a bipartisan agreement on spending totals for one of the remaining bills.
    *   Rumors of a "grand bargain" that trades appropriations for other legislative priorities.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Leadership schedules a short legislative calendar for December, focused only on non-controversial items.
    *   Public statements from leadership blaming the other party for the shutdown and vowing not to concede on remaining bills.
    *   Key negotiators state that talks will resume "in the new year."
    *   The House or Senate adjourns for the holiday recess earlier than expected.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Event:** A major domestic or international crisis could scramble political incentives and force rapid, bipartisan action, though this is highly unlikely.
*   **Leadership Surprise:** A surprise deal could be struck by the "four corners" (House/Senate, Dem/GOP leaders) and pushed through with little warning, though the current political environment makes this difficult.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution depends on the CRS table. A bill could be passed by Congress in late December but not signed by the President or processed by CRS until January, which would not count.
*   **Misinterpreting "Talks":** News of ongoing staff-level "talks" is common and does not necessarily indicate progress; it can be a substitute for it. Focus on announcements of concrete agreements.
*   **The "Christmas Miracle" Narrative:** Pundits may speculate about a last-minute deal driven by holiday spirit. This is a narrative trope, not a reliable causal mechanism.

**Final Research Summary:**
Three of twelve bills are already enacted. The continuing resolution that ended the recent historic shutdown pushes the next funding deadline to January 30, 2026, removing the deadline pressure that would be necessary to force a compromise on the nine remaining, more contentious bills before the new year.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the number of additional appropriations bills enacted in December when a CR is already in place until late January is historically very low, likely less than 10% of instances. This suggests a prior distribution centered around 3 bills (the number already enacted), with a strong likelihood of 0 additional bills being passed before January 1. The variance is low, reflecting the historical rarity of additional bills being passed in such a scenario.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation aligns with the base case in that a CR is in place until late January, removing immediate deadline pressure. The situation differs due to the extreme polarization following the longest shutdown in history, which may further reduce the likelihood of additional bills being passed.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The CR deadline of January 30, 2026, significantly reduces the likelihood of additional bills being passed in December (strong downward pressure).
   - The extreme partisan polarization and recent shutdown suggest a deadlock on the remaining bills (moderate downward pressure).
   - The holiday recess provides an incentive to defer complex negotiations (small downward pressure).
   - The passage of three bills suggests that the easier work is done, leaving only the contentious bills (small downward pressure).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 3 bills, the evidence strongly supports the likelihood of no additional bills being passed. The posterior distribution is more sharply peaked at 3, with a very low probability of additional bills being enacted before January 1.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a major crisis forcing action or a surprise deal, suggests these are unlikely given the current political climate. The forecast remains robust against these scenarios, with the primary risk being an unexpected political shift or external event.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the number of appropriations bills enacted before January 1, 2026, are as follows:

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 3  
P80: 3  
P90: 3

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the base rate of appropriations bills enacted before January 1 in fiscal years that:
- Started with a government shutdown
- Had a continuing resolution (CR) extending into January of the following year
- Had some bills already enacted by late November

The most appropriate prior is centered at **3 bills** (the three already enacted), with a narrow distribution. This is because:
- When CRs extend past January 1, there is rarely legislative action on appropriations in December
- The historical pattern shows that once a CR is in place with a late January deadline, Congress typically waits until close to that deadline
- The three bills already enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA) represent the "easy" consensus bills

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- A CR is in place with a deadline after January 1 (January 30, 2026)
- Some bills have already been enacted (3 of 12)
- Congress is highly polarized, making compromise difficult

**Differences from base case:**
- This shutdown was historically long, suggesting deeper divisions than usual
- Three bills are already enacted, which is somewhat unusual (often it's all or none)
- The CR extends particularly far (to January 30), giving even less incentive for December action

These differences generally strengthen the case that no additional bills will be enacted before January 1.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for no additional bills (staying at 3):**
- The CR deadline of January 30 removes deadline pressure (very strong evidence, ~5:1 likelihood ratio)
- The "longest shutdown in US history" indicates extreme partisan division (moderate evidence, ~3:1)
- The holiday recess creates incentives to defer work (moderate evidence, ~2:1)
- The three enacted bills were explicitly separated as the "easier" ones (moderate evidence, ~2:1)

**Evidence for additional bills (more than 3):**
- Some bipartisan work occurred over the summer (weak evidence, ~1:2)
- Post-shutdown cooperation could theoretically build momentum (very weak evidence, ~1:3)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered at 3 bills with a narrow distribution:
- The strongest evidence is the January 30 CR deadline, which strongly reinforces the prior
- The evidence of extreme partisan division further reinforces the prior
- The holiday recess timing adds additional weight to the prior

Posterior calculation (conceptual):
- Prior: ~80% probability of 3 bills, ~15% probability of 4-6 bills, ~5% probability of 7+ bills
- After updating on the CR deadline: ~90% probability of 3 bills, ~8% probability of 4-6 bills, ~2% probability of 7+ bills
- After updating on partisan division: ~93% probability of 3 bills, ~6% probability of 4-6 bills, ~1% probability of 7+ bills
- After updating on holiday recess: ~95% probability of 3 bills, ~4% probability of 4-6 bills, ~1% probability of 7+ bills

The posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at exactly 3 bills, with a small probability of 4 bills and a very small probability of more than 4.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a surprise deal on a small package of additional bills
- There could be political incentives to clear some bills before the new year that I'm not accounting for
- The reference class might be too narrow, as shutdowns of this magnitude are rare

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be to place more weight on 4-6 bills, considering that leadership might want to show progress. However, the lack of deadline pressure and the clear separation of "easy" vs. "hard" bills in the November deal strongly suggests that the remaining bills will wait until January.

**Tail risks:**
- A major national security crisis could force rapid passage of the Defense bill
- A surprise grand bargain could emerge that bundles remaining appropriations with other priorities

After consideration, I'll slightly increase the probability of 4-5 bills to account for these possibilities, but maintain the strong concentration at 3.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 4

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of FY2026 appropriations bills enacted before January 1, 2026. We know 3 are already enacted. The question is how many of the remaining 9 will pass.

The most relevant base rate is the frequency of legislative action on appropriations during a lame-duck session (November-December) when a Continuing Resolution (CR) is already in place that funds the government into the next year. In such situations, the primary driver for action—a funding deadline—is absent. Historically, Congress uses this time for recess and defers major fiscal fights until the new deadline approaches. Therefore, the base rate for passing *additional* appropriations bills in this window is very low. The most common outcome is 0 additional bills.

My prior distribution for the total number of bills is therefore heavily concentrated at 3, with a very low probability of any other outcome. I'll model this as a discrete distribution with P(X=3) ≈ 85% and a small chance of a "grand bargain" where all remaining 9 bills pass (P(X=12) ≈ 10%), with very little probability for intermediate outcomes.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is highly similar to the reference class, but with exacerbating factors.
*   **Similarity:** A CR is in place, pushing the deadline to January 30, 2026. This aligns perfectly with the base case where the incentive for December action is removed.
*   **Difference (strengthening the base case):** The CR was passed to end the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This indicates extreme partisan polarization and bitterness, making the kind of trust and compromise needed for a major spending deal even less likely than in a typical year.
*   **Difference (strengthening the base case):** The three bills already passed were the "easier" ones (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA). This is a selection effect; the remaining nine are known to be the most contentious, containing the "poison pills" and spending disagreements that caused the shutdown in the first place.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence in terms of how it affects the probability of passing additional bills (outcome > 3) versus passing no additional bills (outcome = 3).

*   **Evidence 1: CR expires January 30, 2026.** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It removes the primary forcing mechanism for a deal in December. This makes the "no additional bills" scenario vastly more likely. (Strong evidence pushing the forecast toward 3).
*   **Evidence 2: A historically long and bitter shutdown just ended.** This signals that political trust is at a nadir and the parties are deeply entrenched on the issues concerning the remaining 9 bills. This makes a sudden compromise in the next month highly improbable. (Strong evidence pushing the forecast toward 3).
*   **Evidence 3: Upcoming holiday recess.** Members of Congress are strongly incentivized to leave Washington D.C. The January 30 deadline gives them the political cover to do so without being accused of dereliction of duty. (Moderate evidence pushing the forecast toward 3).
*   **Evidence 4: The three easiest bills are already done.** This confirms that the remaining work is the hardest work. There is no "low-hanging fruit" left to create a small, easy minibus package. Any deal would have to tackle the core of the disagreement. (Moderate evidence pushing the forecast toward 3).

All significant evidence points in the same direction: no further legislative action on appropriations is likely before 2026.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** P(X=3) ≈ 85%, P(X=12) ≈ 10%, P(other) ≈ 5%.
*   **Likelihoods:** The combined evidence (Jan 30 deadline, political bitterness, etc.) is highly consistent with the X=3 outcome and highly inconsistent with the X=12 (or any other >3) outcome. The likelihood ratio P(Evidence | X=3) / P(Evidence | X>3) is very large.
*   **Posterior:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. I will update my belief in the X=3 outcome to be even higher.
    *   Posterior P(X=3) increases from ~85% to >90%.
    *   Posterior P(X=12) decreases from ~10% to <5%.
    *   Posterior P(other) decreases to <5%.

My final posterior distribution is now overwhelmingly concentrated at X=3. I estimate the probability of the total number of enacted bills being exactly 3 is approximately 95%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I am forecasting an extreme outcome where all my percentiles are the same. Could I be overconfident?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** A "Christmas Miracle." The public backlash from the historic shutdown is so severe that leaders from both parties feel compelled to strike a deal on the remaining 9 bills to demonstrate they can govern. They announce a surprise omnibus package in mid-December and pass it before the recess.
*   **Why this is unlikely:** While plausible in theory, the Jan 30 deadline provides a much easier path for leaders to manage public opinion. They can credibly claim they are "working on a deal" and will "resolve it early in the new year," thus avoiding both a December fight and immediate political blowback. The shutdown fatigue likely makes both sides risk-averse, and the riskiest move would be to re-engage in a high-stakes negotiation immediately. The path of least resistance is to wait.
*   **Conclusion:** The alternative scenario is a tail risk. My confidence that the number of bills will not change from 3 is very high. A probability of ~95% that the outcome is 3 seems appropriate. This distribution implies that the 10th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th, and 90th percentiles will all be 3, as the cumulative probability at X=3 (95%) exceeds all of these thresholds. This is a correct representation of a highly skewed forecast.
