### **Research Plan**

My research process to answer the question "Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?" will proceed in four stages:

**1. Identify Core Questions:**
*   **Q1: What is the historical base rate of MP departures?** I need to determine how frequently Canadian MPs resign, cross the floor, or become independents during a typical parliamentary session, especially within a short, non-election timeframe. This will establish a statistical prior.
*   **Q2: What are the specific political dynamics of the current (fictional) 45th Parliament?** The background describes a precarious minority government, a recent floor-crossing, and a forced resignation. I need to analyze the incentives and pressures on both the Liberal and Conservative caucuses created by this specific situation.
*   **Q3: What are the primary mechanisms driving MP departures?** I will investigate the general causal factors for such events—ideological rifts, personal ambition, party pressure, scandal, health—and assess which are most salient in the current context, particularly regarding the Conservative Party under Pierre Poilievre's leadership.
*   **Q4: How does the current situation differ from historical precedents?** The proximity to a majority (2 seats), the explicit mention of leadership conflict, and the short, high-stakes timeline around a budget vote may make this situation unique. I need to identify these differences to justify adjusting the base rate.
*   **Q5: What are the leading indicators of an impending departure?** I will identify observable signals, such as media speculation, unusual voting patterns, or public statements, that could provide near-term evidence for or against a departure.

**2. Propose Search Queries:**
*   **For Q1 (Base Rate):**
    *   `"history of Canadian MPs crossing the floor"`
    *   `"list of Canadian MP resignations between elections"`
    *   `"Canadian Parliament statistics MP tenure and departure"`
    *   `"Library of Parliament data MP floor crossing resignation"`
*   **For Q2 & Q3 (Current Dynamics & Mechanisms):**
    *   `"Pierre Poilievre leadership style caucus management"`
    *   `"Canadian minority government confidence and supply agreement history"`
    *   `"incentives for floor crossing Canada cabinet appointment"`
    *   `"party discipline Conservative Party of Canada"`
    *   `"political consequences for crossing the floor Canada"`
*   **For Q4 & Q5 (Differences & Indicators):**
    *   `"historical examples of tight minority governments Canada"`
    *   `"media speculation MP defection Canada"`
    *   `"MP voting against party lines Canada consequences"`
    *   `"rumours of MP resignations Ottawa"`

**3. Synthesize Key Findings:**
After gathering information, I will synthesize it by first calculating a plausible base rate for any MP departure within a ~45-day window. Next, I will analyze the specific scenario provided, focusing on the intense pressure cooker environment. The key insight will likely be the tension between the powerful *incentives* for Liberals to encourage a defection and the equally powerful *disincentives* (coercion) the Conservatives are using to prevent one. The recent departures serve as a powerful catalyst, suggesting the situation is already unstable.

**4. Draft the Comprehensive Answer:**
Using the synthesized findings, I will structure the final brief according to the required format. I will begin with the calculated base rate, detail the recent events, explain the causal mechanisms at play, highlight what makes this situation unusual, and provide a clear Bayesian update sketch for the statistician. The brief will conclude with actionable indicators to watch and a summary of key uncertainties.

### **Research Brief**

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Mid-Parliament MP Departures (Resignations & Floor Crossings):** In a typical 4-year Canadian Parliament (338 MPs), there are approximately 15-25 total departures (resignations for personal/health reasons, appointments, or floor crossings). This yields a rate of roughly 4-6 events per year.
    *   **Base Rate Calculation:** With ~5 events per year among 338 MPs, the probability of at least one event in a 45-day period (approx. 1/8th of a year) is roughly **35-50%**. This is calculated using a Poisson approximation (1 - e^-(λt)), where λ is the annual event rate and t is the time period. This serves as a broad, initial prior.
    *   **Limitations:** This rate averages over stable periods and crisis periods. The current situation is explicitly a period of heightened political stress, suggesting the base rate may be an underestimate.

2.  **Floor Crossings in Minority Parliaments:** Floor crossings are historically rare, with roughly one per year on average since the 1990s. However, they can occur in clusters, often driven by leadership rifts or party realignments (e.g., the formation of the Conservative Party). The current context, with a tight minority and leadership friction, fits this pattern.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** Matt Jeneroux (CPC) resigns — ↑ — His resignation, reportedly under duress to prevent a floor-crossing, signals deep discontent and active negotiations between Conservative MPs and other parties, making another departure more likely.
*   **2025-11-05** Chris d'Entremont (CPC) crosses floor to Liberals — ↑↑ — This event breaks the dam, establishing a credible path for other disaffected Conservatives. It proves the Liberals are actively recruiting and provides them with momentum toward a majority.
*   **2025-10-28** (Hypothetical) Finance Minister presents Fall Economic Statement — ↑ — The statement outlines the government's agenda, forcing opposition MPs to take a stance and potentially exacerbating internal caucus divisions ahead of the formal budget vote.
*   **2025-09-15** (Hypothetical) Conservative Convention reveals policy rifts — ↑ — Media reports from a recent party convention highlighting contentious policy debates could indicate pre-existing fractures within the Conservative caucus that the Liberals can now exploit.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The primary driver. The ability to secure a majority by poaching just two more MPs provides an enormous incentive for the Liberals to offer significant rewards (e.g., cabinet positions, committee chairs, future appointments) to potential defectors.
2.  **Conservative Caucus Discontent (Moderate ↑):** The explicit reason for d'Entremont's defection was disagreement with Poilievre's leadership. If this sentiment is shared by even a small faction of MPs, it creates a pool of potential movers.
3.  **Conservative Party Discipline & Coercion (Large ↓):** The "consequences" threatened against Jeneroux are a powerful counter-force. The party leadership will be on high alert, using threats (e.g., blocking future nominations, stripping of duties) and peer pressure to enforce loyalty and prevent a cascade.
4.  **The Budget as a Forcing Function (Moderate ↑):** The impending budget is a confidence vote. This creates a hard deadline, forcing MPs who are considering a move to act soon. It provides a clear, high-profile policy reason for an MP to justify their decision to switch allegiance or resign in protest.
5.  **Political Contagion/Momentum (Moderate ↑):** D'Entremont's successful defection and Jeneroux's near-defection create a "blood in the water" effect. It makes the idea of leaving less taboo and may embolden other MPs who were previously hesitant.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Knife-Edge Mathematics:** Unlike most parliaments, this one is on the brink of a majority. The value of a single MP crossing the floor is extraordinarily high, amplifying incentives far beyond the norm.
*   **Precedent and Proximity:** Two departures from the same party in two days is highly unusual and indicates an acute, active crisis, not a slow burn of dissatisfaction. The base rate does not account for such a rapid cascade.
*   **Specific, Public Leadership Rift:** The departures are not due to vague "personal reasons" but are explicitly linked to the Opposition Leader. This suggests a specific, potentially unresolvable fissure rather than general political fatigue.
*   **Extreme Time Compression:** The entire drama is unfolding in a very short window defined by the resolution criteria and the budget vote. This intensity increases the likelihood of a rash or strategic decision, unlike the more measured pace of mid-term politics.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the reference class base rate, suggesting a prior probability of around **40%** that *any* MP departs in this window. This reflects that such events are not rare, but not guaranteed. Use a relatively low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=10) to reflect the high variance in the base rate data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Extreme incentive for Liberals to gain a majority.
    *   (↑ Large) Recent cascade of two departures signals an unstable equilibrium.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Specific, public friction with Conservative leadership.
    *   (↓ Large) Countervailing coercive pressure from the Conservative Party to enforce discipline.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests this is not a typical period. The powerful, specific, and recent "up" factors likely overwhelm both the base rate and the "down" factor of party discipline (which has already shown signs of failing). The posterior should move **significantly upward**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Media reports (even anonymous) of other "unhappy" Conservative MPs.
    *   A Conservative MP publicly praising a Liberal budget measure or the Prime Minister.
    *   Unusual travel patterns or private meetings involving known moderate Conservative MPs.
    *   An opposition MP missing or abstaining from a key preliminary vote.
    *   Escalating public rhetoric from Poilievre's office demanding loyalty.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A well-attended, unified Conservative caucus meeting with a strong statement of support for the leader.
    *   Key moderate Conservative MPs giving firm, on-the-record statements ruling out a departure.
    *   The Liberal Party signaling it will seek a compromise on the budget with another party (e.g., NDP, Bloc).
    *   No further credible media rumors of discontent after a week or two.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opacity of Negotiations:** Any deals are happening behind closed doors. We are reliant on media leaks, which could be strategic disinformation from either side.
*   **Individual Psychology:** An MP's final decision is personal and can be influenced by family, health, or career considerations that are impossible for outsiders to model.
*   **Misinterpretation of Coercion:** The Conservative threat of "consequences" could either be highly effective (a strong DOWN factor) or it could backfire, angering an MP and becoming the final push they need to leave (an UP factor).
*   **Resolution Definition:** The resolution includes becoming an "independent." An MP could resign from caucus to sit as an independent in protest without any intention of joining the Liberals, a lower-stakes action that is

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for MP departures (resignations or floor crossings) in Canada is approximately 4-6 events per year among 338 MPs. This translates to a probability of about 35-50% for at least one event in a 45-day period. Given the current political context, this base rate might be an underestimate, but it provides a starting point.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically increases the likelihood of political maneuvering and defections.
   - Differences: The current political environment is highly charged, with recent defections and resignations indicating instability. The proximity to a majority for the Liberals and the explicit leadership rift within the Conservative Party are significant deviations from the norm.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent defections and resignations (Chris d'Entremont and Matt Jeneroux) suggest a higher likelihood of further departures. The likelihood ratio for these events is high, as they are more probable if another defection is imminent.
   - The Liberal Party's strong incentive to secure a majority and the Conservative Party's internal discontent increase the probability of further defections.
   - Conservative Party discipline and coercion act as a counterbalance, reducing the likelihood of defections, but recent events suggest this pressure may not be fully effective.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior probability: 40% (based on historical base rate).
   - Evidence suggests a significant increase in probability due to recent defections and political incentives.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio. Given the strong evidence, the likelihood ratio is greater than 1, suggesting an increase in probability.
   - Posterior probability: Adjusting for the evidence, the probability increases significantly from the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of recent defections. The Conservative Party's coercive measures could be more effective than anticipated.
   - Alternative scenario: The Liberals might seek a compromise with another party, reducing the need for defections.
   - Adjust probability to account for these considerations.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, recent evidence, and potential counterarguments, the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026 is estimated to be higher than the base rate.

Final: 70%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a base rate for MP defections or resignations in a short timeframe (Nov 27-Dec 31, 2025, approximately 34 days), I'll consider historical patterns of MP departures.

In a typical 4-year Canadian Parliament with 338 MPs, there are approximately 15-25 total departures (resignations, floor crossings, etc.), yielding roughly 4-6 events per year. This translates to about 0.33-0.5 events per month.

For a 34-day period, the base rate would be approximately:
- 4 events/year = 0.011 events/day × 34 days = 0.37 events
- 6 events/year = 0.016 events/day × 34 days = 0.55 events

Using a Poisson distribution, the probability of at least one event in this period would be:
- P(at least 1 event) = 1 - P(0 events) = 1 - e^(-λ)
- 1 - e^(-0.37) to 1 - e^(-0.55) ≈ 31% to 42%

However, this is clearly not a typical period. I'll use a base rate of **40%** as my prior, representing the upper end of the typical range.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Canadian parliamentary system remains the same
- The total number of MPs (338) is unchanged
- Normal political pressures and personal factors that lead to resignations still apply

**Differences from base case:**
- We are in an extremely unusual situation with two MPs from the same party leaving in two consecutive days (Nov 5-6)
- The Liberal government is just 2 seats away from a majority (170/338 seats)
- There is explicit leadership conflict within the Conservative Party
- The budget vote creates a forcing function and deadline
- The Conservative Party has demonstrated it will apply pressure to prevent defections

These differences significantly increase the likelihood of additional departures compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Two Conservative MPs have already left in consecutive days**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If more MPs are going to leave, we would expect to see initial departures creating momentum
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If no more MPs will leave, seeing two quick departures is unusual
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Explicit leadership conflict with Poilievre cited**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If more MPs will leave, we'd expect clear ideological rifts
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if no more leave, some disagreement is normal
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Conservative Party applying explicit pressure ("consequences")**
- P(E|H): High (~0.7) - If more MPs are considering leaving, the party would take preventive action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - The party might apply pressure regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Liberals need just 2 more MPs for a majority**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Creates strong incentives for Liberals to recruit
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - This situation would exist regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~3
- This strongly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 40:60 (0.4/(1-0.4) = 0.67)

Updating with evidence:
- Posterior odds = 0.67 × 4.5 × 2 × 1.4 × 3 ≈ 25.3
- Posterior probability = 25.3/(1+25.3) ≈ 0.96 or 96%

This seems too high given the uncertainties involved. Let me reconsider the likelihood ratios more conservatively:

More conservative update:
- Evidence 1 LR: 2.5 (instead of 4.5)
- Evidence 2 LR: 1.5 (instead of 2)
- Evidence 3 LR: 1.2 (instead of 1.4)
- Evidence 4 LR: 2 (instead of 3)

Revised posterior odds = 0.67 × 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.2 × 2 ≈ 6.03
Revised posterior probability = 6.03/(1+6.03) ≈ 0.86 or 86%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Overestimating momentum effects**: The two departures might represent the entire pool of dissatisfied MPs, with no others willing to leave.

2. **Underestimating party discipline**: Conservative leadership may have implemented extremely effective measures to prevent further defections.

3. **Time constraint**: With only 34 days remaining, potential defectors might decide to wait until after the new year.

4. **Selection bias**: The background information may highlight unusual events while normal parliamentary stability goes unreported.

5. **Alternative scenarios**: MPs might be negotiating for concessions rather than planning departures.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability downward somewhat. The most compelling counterargument is that the Conservative Party, now on high alert, will successfully prevent further departures through intense pressure and monitoring.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026 is high but not certain.

The unusual cluster of departures, explicit leadership conflict, and the high stakes of a potential Liberal majority create strong incentives for both more departures and for preventing them. The Conservative Party will be working extremely hard to prevent further defections, but the precedent has been set and the incentives for the Liberals to recruit are enormous.

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the departure of a Canadian Member of Parliament (MP)—through resignation, floor-crossing, or becoming an independent—within a specific 34-day window (November 27, 2025, to December 31, 2025).

To establish a prior probability, I will use the historical frequency of such events. The research brief indicates that in a typical 4-year Canadian Parliament of 338 MPs, there are 15-25 departures. Taking the midpoint of 20 departures over 4 years gives an average rate of 5 departures per year.

The probability of at least one such event in a 34-day period (approximately 34/365 = 0.093 of a year) can be estimated using a Poisson distribution. The expected number of events (λ) in this window is 5 events/year * 0.093 years ≈ 0.465.

The probability of one or more events is P(X ≥ 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - e^(-λ).
P(H) = 1 - e^(-0.465) ≈ 1 - 0.628 = 0.372.

Therefore, a reasonable starting base rate is that in any given 34-day period, there is approximately a **37%** chance of at least one MP departing. This corresponds to prior odds of 0.37 / 0.63 ≈ **0.59 to 1**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs dramatically from the historical average, which smooths over periods of stability and crisis.

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental parliamentary structure and the pool of 338 MPs are the same as the reference class.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Acute Political Crisis:** The base rate assumes a random distribution of events. The current scenario is a concentrated crisis, with two departures from the same party in two days. This suggests a non-random, systemic cause, making further events in the immediate future more likely.
    *   **Extraordinary Incentives:** The Liberal government is just two seats shy of a majority. This creates an unprecedented incentive for them to actively recruit defectors, offering significant rewards (e.g., cabinet positions). Simultaneously, it creates immense pressure on the Conservative party.
    *   **Specific Causal Mechanism:** The departures are explicitly linked to disagreement with the Conservative leader. This points to a specific, ongoing fissure within that caucus, rather than random personal reasons for departure.
    *   **Forcing Function:** The impending budget vote is a matter of confidence, creating a hard deadline that focuses the minds of any wavering MPs and forces a decision within the resolution window.

These differences strongly suggest the base rate is a conservative floor and that the actual probability is much higher.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that another MP departs before 2026, and ~H be the hypothesis that no other MP departs.

*   **Evidence 1: The recent cascade of two Conservative departures (d'Entremont's defection, Jeneroux's resignation).**
    *   P(E | H): If another departure were imminent, it would very likely be preceded by signs of instability like this. A cascade is a common failure mode in party discipline. This evidence is highly probable under H.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the situation were now stable, it would mean these two events were isolated and fully resolved the internal conflict. This is less likely than the alternative that they are symptoms of a wider problem.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The high stakes (Liberals are 2 seats from a majority).**
    *   P(E | H): A departure is much more likely to be successfully engineered when the governing party has a massive incentive to make it happen.
    *   P(E | ~H): No departure would mean that even with maximum incentive, a deal could not be made. This is possible, but less likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This structural factor increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The Conservative Party's coercive response (threat of "consequences").**
    *   P(E | H): If another MP departs, they will have done so in defiance of these threats. This is plausible, as such tactics can backfire and harden an MP's resolve to leave.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no one else departs, it is highly likely that the party's crackdown was the reason. This is a very strong argument for stability.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This is the primary piece of evidence that decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will start with the prior odds of 0.59 to 1 (a 37% probability).

1.  **Update for Instability:** The combined evidence of the two recent departures, the specific cause, and the high stakes makes this a moment of extreme political volatility. This is not a small update. I estimate that this cluster of facts is at least 4 times more likely to be observed if another departure is coming than if the crisis is already over.
    *   Prior Odds = 0.59 to 1
    *   Likelihood Ratio (Instability) ≈ 4.0
    *   Intermediate Odds = 0.59 × 4.0 = 2.36 to 1.
    *   This corresponds to an intermediate probability of 2.36 / (1 + 2.36) ≈ 70%.

2.  **Update for Containment:** Now, I must account for the Conservative Party's counter-measures. This is a powerful force for stability. However, it has already shown its limits by *causing* a resignation instead of preventing a departure entirely. It might deter some, but it might also anger others. I will assign a likelihood ratio of 0.6, meaning this evidence makes a departure less likely, but does not negate the instability.
    *   Intermediate Odds = 2.36 to 1
    *   Likelihood Ratio (Containment) ≈ 0.6
    *   **Posterior Odds** = 2.36 × 0.6 = 1.42 to 1.

3.  **Final Probability:** Converting the posterior odds back to a probability:
    *   Posterior Probability = 1.42 / (1 + 1.42) ≈ 0.587.

This calculation brings the probability to approximately 59%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if I am overestimating the "contagion" effect and underestimating the "containment" effect. The alternative scenario is that d'Entremont and Jeneroux were the only two MPs seriously considering a move, and the Conservative party has now successfully made an example of them, terrifying the rest of the caucus into line. In this view, the crisis has peaked and is now over.

However, this seems less likely than the scenario where a known leadership rift affects more than just two members. The heavy-handed tactics could easily backfire on a third MP, who might choose to resign in protest or become an independent—both of which would resolve the question as "Yes." The existence of three possible exit paths (resign, defect, independent) for any unhappy MP makes it more likely that at least one will be taken. The incentives for the Liberals to poach are at an absolute maximum, and the situation is clearly fluid. My estimate of ~60% reflects that a departure is more likely than not, but that the success of the party's disciplinary measures remains a major uncertainty. I will nudge my forecast slightly higher to account for the multiple resolution pathways.

### Final Forecast
Considering the strong base rate, the acute political crisis, the powerful incentives at play, and the recent precedent of two departures, the probability of another MP leaving their party or post is significantly elevated. While the Conservative party's efforts to enforce discipline provide a strong counter-argument, the "blood in the water" effect and the multiple ways an MP can depart (resign, cross the floor, become independent) make another event more likely than not in the short, high-stakes period before the new year.

Final: 62%
