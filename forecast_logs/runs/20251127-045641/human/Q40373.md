### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Any Game of the Year (GOTY) Nominee:** Since 2014, there have been 6 nominees each year (except for 5 in 2014, 2015, 2017). A flat prior would assign each of the 6 nominees a **~17% base rate**. This is a weak prior, assuming all nominees are equally likely.
2.  **Nominee with the Most Nominations:** The game with the most nominations has a significantly higher chance of winning GOTY. In recent years, this has been a powerful predictor (e.g., *Baldur's Gate 3* in 2023, *Elden Ring* in 2022, *The Last of Us Part II* in 2020). This reference class suggests the leading nominee has a **~50-60% chance** of winning the top award.
3.  **AAA, Critically-Acclaimed (90+ Metacritic) Action-Adventure/RPG:** The vast majority of TGA GOTY winners fall into this category (*Baldur's Gate 3*, *Elden Ring*, *The Last of Us Part II*, *God of War*, *Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, *The Witcher 3*). The only major exception is *It Takes Two* (2021). This suggests games fitting this archetype have a much higher base rate than indie or non-traditional AAA titles.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-17** Nominations announced for The Game Awards 2025. — **↑ (large) for *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*** — The game leads the field with 12 nominations, a historically strong indicator of jury preference and a high likelihood of winning GOTY.
*   **2025-11-20** *Hollow Knight: Silksong* wins "Most Wanted Game" at the Golden Joystick Awards. — **↑ (small) for *Hollow Knight: Silksong*** — This confirms the game has immense public hype, which will boost its 10% public vote share. However, it is not an indicator of critical reception by the TGA jury.
*   **2025-11-20** *Ghost of Yotei* wins Console Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. — **↓ (small) for the entire field** — The fact that a major award body's GOTY is not even nominated at TGA suggests a fractured critical landscape with no single consensus game dominating the year, potentially making the race less predictable.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Critical Acclaim (e.g., Metacritic Score):** The single most important driver. A score below 90 makes a win highly unlikely. A score of 94+ makes a game a top contender. **(Large effect)**
*   **Total TGA Nominations:** Serves as a proxy for the jury's overall admiration for a game's craft and execution across multiple categories. The game with the most nominations is the presumptive favorite. **(Large effect)**
*   **Genre & "Prestige" Factor:** The jury has historically favored large-scale, narrative-driven, technologically ambitious single-player experiences (typically Western RPGs or Action-Adventure). This creates a headwind for indie games, platformers, or more niche genres. **(Moderate effect)**
*   **Innovation and Novelty:** Games that are perceived as pushing the medium forward or offering a unique, groundbreaking experience often gain an edge with critics (e.g., *Zelda: BOTW*, *It Takes Two*). **(Moderate effect)**
*   **Public Vote:** Accounts for 10% of the final tally. While it cannot typically overcome a strong jury consensus, it can be a deciding factor in a close race. Games with massive, passionate fanbases (*Silksong*, *Hades II*) have an advantage here. **(Small effect)**
*   **Developer Pedigree:** Renowned developers/directors (e.g., Hideo Kojima for *Death Stranding 2*, Nintendo for *Donkey Kong*) often receive more attention and benefit of the doubt from critics. **(Small effect)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **A New IP as the Nominations Leader:** It is somewhat unusual for a brand-new IP (*Clair Obscur*) to dominate the nomination count so thoroughly. This suggests it is an exceptional critical darling, possibly in the vein of *Elden Ring* (though that had FromSoftware's pedigree).
*   **Two "Indie Darling" Sequels:** The presence of two sequels to beloved, critically masterful indie games (*Hades II*, *Hollow Knight: Silksong*) is a significant feature of this year's lineup. While indie games are often nominated, having two of this caliber as serious contenders is rare.
*   **Absence of a Clear "Zeitgeist" Game:** Unlike years dominated by the discourse around *Elden Ring* or *Baldur's Gate 3*, the field appears more open. The Golden Joystick result points to a lack of a single game that has captured universal acclaim across all award bodies.
*   **The Kojima Factor:** *Death Stranding 2* represents a unique "auteur" choice. The original was critically divisive, and the sequel's chances depend entirely on whether it refined its formula to achieve broader critical appeal, making it a high-variance contender.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the "Any Nominee" reference class, a uniform prior of ~17% for each option, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=6) to allow for strong updates.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33:** **↑ (large)** — The 12 nominations are the single strongest piece of evidence, aligning with the most predictive reference class.
    *   **Hades II:** **↑ (small)** — Strong pedigree from its predecessor and likely high Metacritic score, making it the most plausible indie winner.
    *   **Hollow Knight: Silksong:** **↑ (small)** — Similar to *Hades II*, but with even greater public hype, boosting its public vote chances. Faces the same "indie" headwind.
    *   **Death Stranding 2:** **↔ (neutral)** — Auteur pedigree is a plus, but the divisive nature of the first game suggests it may not achieve the broad jury consensus needed to win.
    *   **Donkey Kong Bananza:** **↓ (small)** — High-quality Nintendo titles are perennial nominees but have not won the top prize since 2017, often being perceived as less "serious" or ambitious than the competition.
    *   **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II:** **↓ (moderate)** — Likely the biggest underdog. The original was respected but not a universal critical darling. It would need to be a monumental leap in quality to compete in this field.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift decisively in favor of **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**. The probabilities for *Hades II* and *Hollow Knight: Silksong* should remain notable but distant, while the other three candidates become long shots.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for *Clair Obscur*):**
    *   Pre-show analysis from major gaming outlets (IGN, GameSpot, etc.) overwhelmingly predicting it as the winner.
    *   Early wins during the ceremony in major categories like Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, or Best Art Direction.
    *   Strong positive sentiment in social media discussions among journalists and developers on the voting jury.
*   **DOWN indicators (for *Clair Obscur*):**
    *   A groundswell of support for an "upset" pick, particularly *Hades II* or *Silksong*, among industry pundits.
    *   Losing key "major" awards (e.g.,

To forecast which game will win the 2025 Game of the Year Award, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: Given it leads with 12 nominations, we start with a base rate of 50-60% based on historical trends where the most nominated game often wins.
- **Death Stranding 2: On the Beach**: As a sequel from a renowned developer, but with a divisive predecessor, we assign a base rate of 10%.
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Historically, Nintendo games have not won since 2017, so we assign a base rate of 5%.
- **Hades II**: As a sequel to a critically acclaimed indie game, we assign a base rate of 10%.
- **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Similar to Hades II, with strong public hype, we assign a base rate of 10%.
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: As an underdog with less critical acclaim, we assign a base rate of 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Clair Obscur**: Similar to past winners with high nominations; different as a new IP, which is less common.
- **Death Stranding 2**: Similar in having a renowned developer; different due to its divisive predecessor.
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Similar in being a high-quality Nintendo game; different as it lacks the "serious" narrative.
- **Hades II** and **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Similar in being critically acclaimed indie sequels; different as indie games face headwinds.
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: Similar in being a sequel; different due to lack of critical acclaim.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Clair Obscur**: High likelihood of winning given 12 nominations (P(E | H) very high).
- **Death Stranding 2**: Moderate likelihood due to pedigree but offset by divisive nature (P(E | H) moderate).
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Low likelihood due to genre and historical trends (P(E | H) low).
- **Hades II** and **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Moderate likelihood due to indie status but strong fanbase (P(E | H) moderate).
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: Low likelihood given lack of critical acclaim (P(E | H) low).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Clair Obscur**: Prior odds of 60% increase with strong evidence of 12 nominations.
- **Death Stranding 2**: Prior odds of 10% remain stable with neutral evidence.
- **Donkey Kong Bananza**: Prior odds of 5% decrease slightly due to genre bias.
- **Hades II** and **Hollow Knight: Silksong**: Prior odds of 10% increase slightly due to public hype.
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**: Prior odds of 5% decrease due to lack of critical acclaim.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of an upset by an indie game due to strong fan support.
- Re-evaluate the impact of public vote and critical acclaim on indie games.
- Adjust probabilities to account for these considerations.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 55%  
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 10%  
Donkey Kong Bananza: 5%  
Hades II: 12%  
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 13%  
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and historical trends, with adjustments for potential biases and uncertainties.

# Forecasting the 2025 Game of the Year Award Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish appropriate base rates for each option:

**Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**
- Base rate: 30%
- Rationale: Leading with 12 nominations, which historically is the strongest predictor of GOTY success. Games with the most nominations typically have a 50-60% chance of winning, but I'm being more conservative since it's a new IP without established pedigree.

**Death Stranding 2: On the Beach**
- Base rate: 15%
- Rationale: AAA title from a renowned auteur (Kojima). The original was divisive but had strong artistic merit. Sequels to established franchises have moderate success rates at TGA.

**Donkey Kong Bananza**
- Base rate: 10%
- Rationale: Nintendo titles are consistently nominated but rarely win the top prize (last Nintendo GOTY was Zelda: BOTW in 2017). Platformers face genre bias compared to action-RPGs.

**Hades II**
- Base rate: 18%
- Rationale: Sequel to a critically acclaimed indie game (Hades was nominated for GOTY in 2020). Supergiant Games has exceptional pedigree, and the original had universal acclaim.

**Hollow Knight: Silksong**
- Base rate: 20%
- Rationale: Extremely anticipated sequel to a beloved indie masterpiece. Won "Most Wanted Game" at Golden Joystick Awards, indicating massive public support.

**Kingdom Come: Deliverance II**
- Base rate: 7%
- Rationale: The original was respected but not universally acclaimed. Historical RPGs without fantasy elements have a lower win rate at TGA.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- The nomination pattern follows historical precedent where one game leads in total nominations
- The mix of AAA and indie titles is typical of recent GOTY nominee lists
- The genre distribution (action-adventure, RPG, platformer) aligns with past ceremonies

**Key differences:**
- A new IP (Clair Obscur) leading nominations is unusual - most nomination leaders are established franchises
- Two highly anticipated indie sequels (Hades II, Silksong) with massive followings creates unusual competition
- The Golden Joystick GOTY winner (Ghost of Yotei) not being nominated suggests a fractured critical landscape
- No clear "zeitgeist" game dominating the industry conversation (unlike Elden Ring or Baldur's Gate 3)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Clair Obscur leads with 12 nominations**
- P(E|H): If Clair Obscur is the true GOTY, we'd expect it to lead nominations (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If Clair Obscur is not GOTY, it could still lead nominations but less likely (~30%)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0

**Evidence: Hollow Knight: Silksong won "Most Wanted Game" at Golden Joystick**
- P(E|H): If Silksong is GOTY, it would likely have high anticipation (~80%)
- P(E|~H): Even if not GOTY, Silksong could still be highly anticipated (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33

**Evidence: Ghost of Yotei won Golden Joystick GOTY but isn't nominated at TGA**
- P(E|H for any nominee): If any of our options is truly deserving of GOTY, we'd expect some disagreement between award bodies (~50%)
- P(E|~H for any nominee): If none of our options is truly exceptional, we'd expect award disagreement (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.625 (slightly negative for all nominees)

**Evidence: Critical acclaim (Metacritic scores)**
- Without actual scores (games not all released yet), I'll use developer track record:
  - Supergiant Games (Hades II): Consistently 90+ Metacritic
  - Team Cherry (Silksong): Original Hollow Knight was 90+
  - Kojima Productions (Death Stranding 2): Original was 82-86 (divisive)
  - Nintendo (Donkey Kong): Typically 85-90 for the franchise
  - Warhorse Studios (Kingdom Come II): Original was 76-84

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update Clair Obscur's probability based on the nomination evidence:

- Prior odds: 30/70 = 0.429
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.429 × 3.0 = 1.287
- Posterior probability: 1.287/(1+1.287) = 56.3%

For Hollow Knight: Silksong, updating based on the Golden Joystick award:

- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 1.33 = 0.3325
- Posterior probability: 0.3325/(1+0.3325) = 24.9%

For all nominees, the fractured award landscape slightly reduces confidence:

- Applying a 0.625 likelihood ratio across the board
- For Clair Obscur: 56.3% → ~45%
- For Silksong: 24.9% → ~18%

Additional qualitative updates:
- Hades II benefits from Supergiant's track record (+2%)
- Death Stranding 2 faces headwinds from the divisive nature of the original (-3%)
- Kingdom Come: Deliverance II lacks the critical pedigree of competitors (-2%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting nomination count as a predictor
- The public vote (10%) could be more influential in a close race than historical data suggests
- I might be underestimating Nintendo's ability to create a truly exceptional Donkey Kong game
- Kojima's auteur status could generate more jury support than expected

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Hades II could be a generational masterpiece that overcomes the indie bias
- Death Stranding 2 could refine its formula to achieve universal acclaim
- The jury might deliberately choose to recognize an indie title to balance recent AAA winners

**Adjustments:**
- Reducing Clair Obscur slightly to account for new IP uncertainty
- Increasing Hades II slightly based on Supergiant's consistent excellence
- Maintaining a non-trivial probability for all options given the uncertain landscape

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations, my final probabilities are:

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 42%
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 18%
Hades II: 17%
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 12%
Donkey Kong Bananza: 8%
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 3%

## 7. Output Format

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 42%
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 12%
Donkey Kong Bananza: 8%
Hades II: 17%
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 18%
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 3%

```md

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the winner of the 2025 Game of the Year Award, following the specified reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most neutral starting point is to consider the "Any Nominee" reference class. With six nominees for the Game of the Year (GOTY) award, a uniform prior assigns each game an equal chance of winning.
*   **Base Rate:** P(Win | Nominee) = 1/6 ≈ 16.7%.
This initial prior assumes we know nothing about the individual games, their reception, or historical voting patterns, creating a level playing field before introducing specific evidence.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This year's award cycle has key similarities and differences compared to a generic base case:
*   **Similarities:** The structure of the award (6 nominees, 90% jury / 10% public vote) and the mix of genres (RPGs, action-adventure, indie darlings) are consistent with previous years.
*   **Differences:**
    *   A brand-new IP, *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*, leads with a historically high number of 12 nominations, making it an unusually strong frontrunner on paper.
    *   The presence of two powerhouse indie sequels (*Hades II*, *Hollow Knight: Silksong*) creates a unique dynamic, potentially splitting the "indie-friendly" vote or signaling a particularly strong year for independent games.
    *   The fact that another major award body (Golden Joysticks) gave its top prize to a game not even nominated here (*Ghost of Yotei*) suggests a fractured critical landscape without a single, universally agreed-upon "zeitgeist" game like *Elden Ring* or *Baldur's Gate 3*. This increases the potential for an upset.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence provided for each option.

*   **Evidence 1: *Clair Obscur* leads with 12 nominations.**
    *   This is the single most powerful piece of evidence. The TGA jury that votes on GOTY also votes on the other categories. A high number of nominations indicates broad and deep support across that jury.
    *   P(12 nominations | *Clair Obscur* wins GOTY) is very high.
    *   P(12 nominations | *Clair Obscur* does not win GOTY) is very low.
    *   This creates a very strong likelihood ratio in favor of *Clair Obscur*.

*   **Evidence 2: Genre and "Prestige" Factor.**
    *   The TGA jury historically favors large-scale, narrative-driven RPGs and Action-Adventure games. This helps *Clair Obscur*, *Death Stranding 2*, and *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*.
    *   It acts as a headwind for *Hades II* and *Hollow Knight: Silksong* (as indie titles, despite their acclaim) and *Donkey Kong Bananza* (as a platformer, often seen as less "serious").

*   **Evidence 3: Public Hype and the 10% Public Vote.**
    *   *Hollow Knight: Silksong*'s win for "Most Wanted Game" at the Golden Joysticks is a strong indicator of massive public enthusiasm. *Hades II* shares a similar level of intense fan anticipation.
    *   This evidence significantly increases the likelihood that these two games will dominate the 10% public vote, which could be decisive in a close race.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
Let's walk through an update for the frontrunner, *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*.

*   **Prior:** 16.7% (from the uniform base rate).
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.167 / (1 - 0.167) ≈ 0.20.
*   **Evidence:** Leading the field with 12 nominations. Historically, the most-nominated game wins roughly 50% of the time, but 12 is an exceptionally high number, suggesting stronger-than-average support. I'll estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of 4.0 (i.e., this evidence is four times more likely if *Clair Obscur* is the winner than if it isn't).
*   **Posterior Odds:** 0.20 (Prior Odds) × 4.0 (Likelihood Ratio) = 0.80.
*   **Posterior Probability:** 0.80 / (1 + 0.80) ≈ 44.4%.

This single piece of evidence dramatically shifts the probability for *Clair Obscur* to become the clear favorite. The remaining probability is then redistributed among the other contenders based on their respective strengths and weaknesses. *Hades II* and *Hollow Knight: Silksong* are the most plausible challengers due to their critical pedigree and public support. *Death Stranding 2* is a high-variance "auteur" pick, while *Donkey Kong* and *Kingdom Come II* are significant longshots due to genre bias and a lower "prestige" factor, respectively.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk is over-weighting the nomination count. This signal has failed in recent years (*God of War Ragnarok* in 2022, *Ratchet & Clank* in 2021). The fractured awards landscape this year could indicate a jury that is not monolithic. A scenario where the jury vote is split (e.g., 30% *Clair Obscur*, 25% *Hades II*, 20% *Silksong*) is plausible. In such a case, the 10% public vote, which will heavily favor *Hades II* and *Silksong*, could easily tip the scales and cause an upset. Therefore, while *Clair Obscur* is the rightful favorite, its probability should be kept below 50% to reflect this significant uncertainty and the strength of its main competitors. I have adjusted my initial ~55% estimate down to 45% to account for this.

### 6. Final Normalization
The final probabilities are adjusted to reflect the relative strengths of all contenders while summing to 100%.

*   **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (45%)**: The clear frontrunner due to its massive nomination count, which is the strongest available predictor of jury support.
*   **Hades II (20%)**: The most likely challenger. It is a sequel to a universally acclaimed masterpiece, fits into the popular Action-RPG genre, and will have enormous public support.
*   **Hollow Knight: Silksong (15%)**: A very strong contender with immense public hype, but its Metroidvania genre is slightly more niche than an Action-RPG, placing it just behind *Hades II*.
*   **Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (10%)**: The high-variance "auteur" pick. Its chances depend entirely on whether Kojima delivered a consensus masterpiece or another divisive-but-brilliant title.
*   **Donkey Kong Bananza (6%)**: Represents the high-quality, but often overlooked, Nintendo first-party title. Unlikely to win against epic RPGs unless it is truly revolutionary.
*   **Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (4%)**: The biggest underdog. It would need to be a monumental leap in quality over its predecessor to overcome the other contenders.

These probabilities sum to 100%.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: 45%
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach: 10%
Donkey Kong Bananza: 6%
Hades II: 20%
Hollow Knight: Silksong: 15%
Kingdom Come: Deliverance II: 4%
