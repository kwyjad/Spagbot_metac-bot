### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Major Executive Actions Challenged on Statutory Grounds:** This is the most relevant class. In recent years, the Supreme Court has frequently reviewed significant executive branch actions that push the boundaries of statutory authority. In high-profile cases where the executive claims broad power from an old or ambiguous statute to address a major new problem (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. DHHS*), the executive branch has often lost.
    *   **Base Rate:** The executive branch's position is struck down in whole or in part in approximately **60-70%** of such cases before the current Court. This is derived from observing outcomes in cases involving the major questions doctrine or similar non-delegation concerns.
2.  **Supreme Court Review of Presidential Actions on National Security/Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. Cases like *Trump v. Hawaii* show the Court's willingness to uphold actions grounded in a national security rationale, even if controversial.
    *   **Base Rate:** The President's action is upheld in approximately **70-80%** of these cases. This reference class is less applicable here because the core issue is economic (tariffs) and statutory, not a direct exercise of foreign relations or military power.
3.  **Supreme Court Review of Cases with Unanimous Lower Court Outcomes:** The Supreme Court often takes cases to reverse a lower court consensus. However, in this instance, the two lower courts reached the same outcome (tariffs unlawful) via *different* legal reasoning. This suggests the government's position is weak on multiple fronts, making affirmation more likely than in a typical case with a uniform lower court rationale.
    *   **Base Rate:** Difficult to quantify, but the divergent negative reasonings in lower courts likely increase the probability of at least a partial loss for the government at the Supreme Court, placing the odds of a full reversal (i.e., "Tariffs lawful") below **40%**.

**Conclusion:** The most appropriate reference class is #1, suggesting a baseline probability favoring an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-09** SCOTUS agrees to consolidate and expedite review of both cases. — ↑ for "No 2025 ruling" being highly unlikely; neutral for other outcomes. — Matters because it confirms a decision is imminent, focusing the forecast on the merits.
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held in the consolidated cases. — (Direction uncertain without transcript, but assume skeptical questioning of government's broad authority based on current judicial trends). — The tenor of questioning, especially from median justices like Roberts and Kavanaugh, is often predictive of the final outcome.
*   **2025-11-14** Trump administration lifts tariffs on over 200 agricultural products. — ↓ for "Tariffs lawful". — This unilateral concession may be seen as a sign of legal weakness or an attempt to mitigate the most politically damaging effects of the tariffs, implicitly acknowledging they are not essential in their entirety.
*   **2025-11-25** News highlights potential for $750B-$1T in refunds if tariffs are ruled unlawful. — ↓ for "Tariffs lawful". — While not a legal argument, the massive economic and fiscal stakes of the decision may make the Court more cautious about endorsing such a sweeping and novel assertion of executive power.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The current Court is highly skeptical of executive agencies asserting broad, transformative power over major economic and political questions without exceptionally clear authorization from Congress. Imposing tariffs on nearly all global trade is arguably a textbook "major question." (Large driver toward **Unlawful** or **Mixed**).
2.  **Textualism:** The text of the IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate" foreign commerce, but it does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties," which are traditionally the domain of Congress's taxation power. A textualist interpretation would likely find this omission significant. (Large driver toward **Unlawful** or **Mixed**).
3.  **Foreign Affairs Deference:** The government's strongest argument is that the President deserves deference when acting to counter a foreign-sourced "unusual and extraordinary threat." The Court may be reluctant to second-guess the President's declaration of a national emergency. (Moderate driver toward **Lawful**).
4.  **Severability of Rationales:** The tariffs have two distinct justifications: a national security nexus for the "trafficking tariffs" (drugs from Mexico, Canada, China) and a purely economic one for the "reciprocal tariffs" (trade deficits). The Court could easily find the national security nexus more plausible, striking down the reciprocal tariffs while upholding (or remanding) the trafficking tariffs. (Large driver toward **Mixed**).
5.  **Nexus Requirement ("deal with"):** The IEEPA requires that the President's actions "deal with" the declared threat. The Court of International Trade found the tariffs failed this test. The connection between across-the-board tariffs and stopping specific drug flows or rectifying trade imbalances is indirect, making it vulnerable to judicial scrutiny. (Moderate driver toward **Unlawful** or **Mixed**).
6.  **Precedent (Nixon's 1971 Surcharge):** The administration can point to President Nixon's use of the similar Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) for a 10% import surcharge. However, that action was never definitively upheld by the Supreme Court and occurred under a different statute and a different era of judicial philosophy regarding executive power. (Small driver toward **Lawful**).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scale:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions, this application imposes tariffs on the majority of U.S. imports, fundamentally altering U.S. trade policy. The sheer economic and political magnitude elevates it far beyond a typical executive action.
*   **Dominance of the Major Questions Doctrine:** The current 6-3 conservative majority has made curbing the administrative state a signature issue. This case presents a prime opportunity to apply or expand that doctrine to limit presidential power, a significant shift from the judicial environment of previous decades.
*   **Dual Justifications:** The case consolidates two legally distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal). This structure provides the Court a clear path to a split or "mixed" decision, which is not always available in challenges to a single, monolithic executive policy.
*   **Statutory Basis:** The use of an *emergency powers* act for what appears to be long-term, structural *economic policy* (reciprocal tariffs) is a novel legal stretch that invites skepticism. The emergency is not a sudden crisis like the Iran hostage situation that prompted prior IEEPA jurisprudence (*Dames & Moore*).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the "Major Executive Action" reference class, a reasonable prior might be a 65% probability that the tariffs are found at least partially unlawful (i.e., Unlawful or Mixed). Equivalent n=5, reflecting moderate confidence.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ **Large:** The applicability of the Major Questions Doctrine to an action of this economic scale is a powerful argument against the government's position.
    *   ↓ **Moderate:** The textualist argument is strong; "regulate" is not a clear authorization for "tax" (tariff).
    *   ↑ **Large (for Mixed):** The two distinct tariff rationales create a strong off-ramp for a split decision, upholding the more security-related tariffs while striking down the broader economic ones.
    *   ↓ **Small:** Recent administrative action (lifting agricultural tariffs) signals potential legal or political weakness.
    *   ↑ **Moderate (for Lawful):** The Court's historical deference in foreign affairs/national security provides the government its most plausible path to victory, at least on the trafficking tariffs.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior, pushing the posterior away from a clean "Tariffs lawful" ruling. The probability should be concentrated on **"Unlawful"** and **"Mixed,"** with "Mixed" being a particularly strong contender due to the case's structure.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Tariffs lawful:** Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential actions in national security and foreign affairs, with a base rate of 70-80% in favor of the President's actions. However, this case is more about economic policy, so this base rate is less applicable.
- **Tariffs unlawful:** In cases involving major executive actions challenged on statutory grounds, the executive branch's position is struck down in 60-70% of cases. This is the most relevant reference class here.
- **Mixed ruling:** Given the dual justifications for the tariffs (national security vs. economic), there is a plausible path for a mixed ruling. This is supported by the structure of the case and the Court's potential willingness to differentiate between the two types of tariffs.
- **Other ruling:** Historically, the Supreme Court resolves most cases on the merits, so this is less likely.
- **No 2025 ruling:** The expedited schedule and consolidation of cases make this unlikely.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The case involves a major executive action with broad implications, similar to past cases where the Court has struck down executive overreach.
- **Differences:** The dual nature of the tariffs (national security vs. economic) and the unprecedented scale of the action make this case unique.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** Strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful, as the Court is skeptical of broad executive power without clear congressional authorization.
- **Textualism:** The IEEPA does not explicitly authorize tariffs, which is a strong argument against the tariffs being lawful.
- **Foreign Affairs Deference:** Provides some support for the tariffs being lawful, especially for the trafficking tariffs.
- **Severability of Rationales:** Strong evidence for a mixed ruling, as the Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs while striking down the reciprocal tariffs.
- **Nexus Requirement:** Supports the tariffs being unlawful, as the connection between the tariffs and the declared threats is weak.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **Prior for Tariffs unlawful:** 65% based on the major executive action reference class.
- **Likelihoods:** The major questions doctrine and textualism strongly reinforce this prior, increasing the probability.
- **Mixed ruling:** The severability of rationales and the dual justifications provide a strong case for a mixed ruling, increasing its probability.
- **Tariffs lawful:** The foreign affairs deference provides some support, but the overall evidence against the tariffs is stronger.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence:** Consider the possibility that the Court might defer more to the President due to the national security rationale.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** The Court could find a procedural reason to avoid ruling on the merits, but this is unlikely given the expedited schedule.
- **Adjustments:** Increase the probability for a mixed ruling slightly to account for the dual justifications.

### 6. Final Normalization
Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format
Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 35%  
Mixed ruling: 45%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a base rate based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs lawful:**
- Base rate: 25%
- Rationale: In cases where the Supreme Court reviews executive actions claiming broad authority under statutes, especially when lower courts have unanimously ruled against the executive (albeit with different reasoning), the Court typically sides with the executive 20-30% of the time. The Court's recent jurisprudence (e.g., West Virginia v. EPA) shows skepticism toward expansive executive power claims without clear congressional authorization.

**Tariffs unlawful:**
- Base rate: 40%
- Rationale: When multiple lower courts have ruled against an executive action using different legal theories, the Supreme Court affirms these outcomes in roughly 40-50% of cases. The Court's current composition has shown willingness to limit executive authority when it stretches statutory boundaries.

**Mixed ruling:**
- Base rate: 25%
- Rationale: In complex cases with multiple distinct legal issues (here, trafficking tariffs vs. reciprocal tariffs), the Court issues split decisions approximately 20-30% of the time. This allows the Court to draw nuanced distinctions while respecting some aspects of executive authority.

**Other ruling:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Rationale: Procedural dispositions without reaching the merits occur in roughly 5-10% of high-profile cases, particularly when circumstances change during litigation.

**No 2025 ruling:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Rationale: Given the expedited schedule with arguments already held in November 2025, and the Court's practice of deciding most cases within the same term, the probability of no ruling by December 31, 2025 is low (5-10%).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- This case involves judicial review of executive action claiming authority under a statute (IEEPA)
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against the executive branch
- The case involves questions of statutory interpretation and executive power limits
- The Court has granted expedited review, indicating recognition of the issue's importance

**Key differences from base rate scenarios:**
- Unprecedented scale: These tariffs affect a majority of U.S. imports, making this a uniquely consequential case
- Dual justifications: The tariffs have both national security (trafficking) and economic (reciprocal) rationales
- Economic magnitude: The potential for $750B-$1T in refunds creates extraordinary fiscal stakes
- Recent concession: The administration's removal of agricultural tariffs suggests potential weakness in their position
- Consolidated cases: The Court is reviewing two different lower court decisions simultaneously

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Major Questions Doctrine applicability**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 - The doctrine strongly disfavors finding broad authority for major economic actions without clear congressional authorization
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 - The doctrine strongly supports finding the tariffs exceed statutory authority
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.6 - The doctrine may apply differently to trafficking vs. reciprocal tariffs

**Evidence 2: Textualist interpretation of IEEPA**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.4 - "Regulate" commerce is ambiguous but doesn't clearly authorize tariffs
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.7 - Textualists would likely find "regulate" doesn't encompass "tax" (tariffs)
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.6 - Different textual interpretations could apply to different tariff justifications

**Evidence 3: National security deference**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.7 - Courts traditionally defer to the executive on national security matters
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.3 - This deference is weaker when the connection to security is attenuated
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.8 - The Court could uphold trafficking tariffs on deference grounds while striking down reciprocal tariffs

**Evidence 4: Trump administration's removal of agricultural tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 0.3 - This suggests legal weakness or hedging against an adverse ruling
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 0.6 - This may indicate the administration expects to lose
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 0.7 - This could be strategic positioning for a partial victory

**Evidence 5: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.1 - With arguments in November, a decision by year-end is highly likely

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on the Major Questions Doctrine evidence:

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43 (comparing to "Tariffs unlawful")
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.43 = 0.1075
- Normalized posterior: 0.1075/(0.1075 + 0.4) ≈ 0.21

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 0.40
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67 (compared to "Tariffs lawful")
- Posterior odds: 0.4 × 2.67 = 1.068
- Normalized posterior: 1.068/(1.068 + 0.25) ≈ 0.47

For "Mixed ruling" (updating from the national security deference evidence):
- Prior probability: 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67 (compared to "Tariffs unlawful")
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2.67 = 0.6675
- Normalized posterior: 0.6675/(0.6675 + 0.47) ≈ 0.31

For "No 2025 ruling" (updating from expedited schedule evidence):
- Prior probability: 0.05
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.05 × 0.11 = 0.0055
- Normalized posterior: ≈ 0.01

After considering all evidence, the probabilities shift:
- "Tariffs lawful" decreases due to Major Questions Doctrine and textualist interpretation
- "Tariffs unlawful" increases due to lower court consensus and textual arguments
- "Mixed ruling" increases significantly due to the dual nature of the tariffs and the Court's opportunity to draw distinctions
- "No 2025 ruling" decreases due to the expedited schedule

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to the executive on matters framed as national security
- The Court's 6-3 conservative majority might be more sympathetic to Trump's policies than historical patterns suggest
- The economic consequences of invalidating the tariffs might push the Court toward a more cautious ruling

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could find the tariffs lawful based on a broad reading of "regulate" in IEEPA and historical precedent (Nixon's 1971 import surcharge)
- The Court might issue a narrow procedural ruling that avoids the merits entirely
- The Court could remand for further factual development on the nexus between tariffs and the declared emergencies

**Adjustments:**
- I'll slightly increase "Mixed ruling" probability given the dual nature of the tariffs and the Court's tendency to find compromise positions in politically charged cases
- I'll slightly decrease "No 2025 ruling" given the expedited schedule and the Court's likely desire to resolve this consequential issue quickly

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations, my final forecast is:

Tariffs lawful: 18%
Tariffs unlawful: 42%
Mixed ruling: 35%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum = 100%)

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 18%
Tariffs unlawful: 42%
Mixed ruling: 35%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%

```md

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information, following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of **major executive actions challenged at the Supreme Court on statutory grounds.** This is the most relevant class because the core issue is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) grants the President the authority to impose these wide-ranging tariffs.

In recent years, the Supreme Court has shown significant skepticism toward executive branch claims of broad authority based on older, ambiguous statutes to address major economic and political issues (the "major questions doctrine"). Cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* and the CDC eviction moratorium case (*Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. DHHS*) suggest the executive branch often loses these challenges. Based on the research report, a reasonable base rate is that the executive action is struck down in whole or in part approximately 65% of the time.

This leads to the following initial priors:
*   P(Tariffs lawful) = 35%
*   P(Tariffs unlawful OR Mixed ruling) = 65%

Given the structure of the case, which involves two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal), a mixed outcome is plausible. I will initially split the 65% as follows:
*   P(Tariffs unlawful) = 35%
*   P(Mixed ruling) = 30%
*   P(Other/No ruling) = 0% (to be adjusted later)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** This case fits the base rate scenario well. It involves a sweeping executive action with immense economic impact, justified by a broad interpretation of a pre-existing statute (IEEPA). This is a classic setup for the application of the major questions doctrine.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Foreign Affairs Nexus:** Unlike domestic regulatory cases, these tariffs involve foreign commerce and national security justifications (especially the "trafficking tariffs"). The Supreme Court has historically shown greater deference to the President in these areas (*Trump v. Hawaii*). This is the government's strongest argument and pushes against the base rate.
    2.  **Dual Justifications:** The case bundles two distinct policies: the security-related trafficking tariffs and the purely economic reciprocal tariffs. This structural difference makes a "Mixed ruling" a significantly more plausible outcome than in cases challenging a single, monolithic policy.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the priors.

*   **Evidence 1: The Major Questions Doctrine and Textualism.** The current Court is highly likely to view the imposition of tariffs on nearly all global trade as a "major question" requiring clear congressional authorization. The text of the IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate" commerce but does not explicitly mention "tariffs," a power traditionally reserved for Congress.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence is much more likely if the tariffs are ultimately found unlawful or partially unlawful than if they are found fully lawful. P(E | Unlawful or Mixed) >> P(E | Lawful).
    *   **Impact:** This strongly shifts probability *away* from "Tariffs lawful" and *towards* "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

*   **Evidence 2: The Two Distinct Tariff Regimes.** The case consolidates challenges to both the trafficking tariffs (Mexico, Canada, China) and the reciprocal tariffs (most trading partners). The former has a national security rationale, while the latter is based on an economic argument about trade deficits.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This structure makes a split decision highly probable. P(E | Mixed ruling) is very high compared to P(E | Unlawful) or P(E | Lawful). The Court can curb the broader economic power grab while still showing deference on the national security-adjacent claim.
    *   **Impact:** This dramatically increases the probability of "Mixed ruling" relative to all other outcomes.

*   **Evidence 3: Lower Court Rulings.** Two separate federal courts have ruled against the government, but on different grounds. The Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit used a narrower rationale (tariffs don't "deal with" the threat), while the D.C. District Court used a broader one (IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all).
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** The government's position being found weak on two independent legal grounds makes a complete reversal at the Supreme Court less likely. P(E | Tariffs lawful) is low.
    *   **Impact:** This reinforces the shift away from "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Evidence 4: Expedited Supreme Court Review.** The Court agreed to hear the case on an expedited schedule with a decision expected in 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is extremely unlikely if the Court intended to delay or avoid a decision. P(E | No 2025 ruling) is very low. It also makes a procedural dismissal ("Other ruling") less likely, as the Court is signaling its intent to resolve the important merits question.
    *   **Impact:** This concentrates almost all probability mass on the three merits-based outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
Let's walk through a conceptual update.

*   **Start with Priors:** P(Lawful) = 35%, P(Unlawful) = 35%, P(Mixed) = 30%.
*   **Apply Evidence 1 (Major Questions/Textualism):** This is powerful evidence against the government. The odds of "Lawful" vs. "Not Lawful" (Unlawful or Mixed) were roughly 1:2. This evidence might shift the odds to 1:8, dropping P(Lawful) to around 12% and raising P(Unlawful or Mixed) to 88%.
*   **Apply Evidence 2 (Dual Justifications):** This evidence strongly favors "Mixed" over a complete "Unlawful" ruling. Within the 88% probability for "Not Lawful," the dual structure of the case provides a clear path for a split decision. I assess that a mixed ruling is about twice as likely as a complete loss for the government. This would split the 88% into roughly P(Mixed) ≈ 58% and P(Unlawful) ≈ 30%.
*   **Final Polish:** The other evidence reinforces this general direction. I will allocate a small amount of probability (1% each) to "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling" to account for unexpected procedural issues or delays, however unlikely. This requires slightly reducing the main probabilities.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the Court's recent major questions jurisprudence. The primary risk is underestimating the Court's deference to the executive in foreign affairs and national security. A majority could decide that the President's determination of a "national emergency" is largely unreviewable and that IEEPA provides the necessary broad authority. The 4 dissenting judges in the Federal Circuit (including 2 Democratic appointees) show that the government's arguments have some traction.

To account for this, I will slightly increase the probability of "Tariffs lawful" by taking a few points from the leading option, "Mixed ruling." This acknowledges the small but significant possibility that a majority prioritizes executive power in this domain over its recent skepticism of the administrative state.

### 6. Final Normalization
After the red team adjustment, I arrive at the following distribution, which sums to 100%.

*   **Mixed ruling (54%):** This remains the most likely outcome. It allows the Court to strike down the unprecedented "reciprocal tariffs" via the major questions doctrine while upholding the "trafficking tariffs" out of deference to the President's national security powers.
*   **Tariffs unlawful (29%):** This is the second most likely outcome. The Court could adopt the broad D.C. District Court reasoning that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs at all, striking down both policies.
*   **Tariffs lawful (15%):** While an uphill battle for the government, there is a real chance the Court defers entirely to the President's emergency declarations and finds both tariff regimes permissible under IEEPA.
*   **Other ruling (1%):** A small chance of a procedural dismissal (e.g., mootness, GVR).
*   **No 2025 ruling (1%):** A very small chance the Court fails to issue a decision by the end of 2025 despite the expedited schedule.
