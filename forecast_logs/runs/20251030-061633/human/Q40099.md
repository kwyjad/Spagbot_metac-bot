### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-GFC, Pre-COVID Expansion (2011-2019):** This period represents a "normal" modern economic expansion with stable growth and low inflation. The average monthly nonfarm payroll (NFP) gain was approximately **+190,000 jobs**. This serves as a baseline for a healthy, growing economy but may be too optimistic given the current restrictive monetary policy.
2.  **Pre-Recessionary Slowdowns (e.g., 2006-2007, 2019):** In the 12-18 months preceding a recession, job growth typically decelerates significantly. The monthly average often falls into the **+50,000 to +125,000 range**, eventually trending towards zero or negative. This class seems highly relevant given the current signs of a cooling labor market.
3.  **Post-Pandemic Recovery (2021-2023):** This period was characterized by exceptionally strong, catch-up job growth, averaging well over **+350,000 jobs** per month. This class is useful as a point of contrast, as the economy is clearly exiting this high-growth phase.

Given the recent data, the "Pre-Recessionary Slowdown" reference class appears most applicable to the current environment.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-24** September CPI data released (3.0% YoY) — **↓** — Sticky inflation above the Fed's 2% target reinforces the case for maintaining restrictive monetary policy, which dampens hiring activity.
*   **2025-09-17** Fed releases Summary of Economic Projections — **↓** — The Fed's median projection for year-end 2025 unemployment is 4.5%. Reaching this from August's 4.3% requires very weak or negative job growth in the coming months.
*   **2025-09-09** BLS preliminary benchmark revision announced — **↓ (Large)** — The finding that 911,000 fewer jobs were created through March 2025 fundamentally reframes the recent past as much weaker, suggesting underlying momentum is lower than previously thought.
*   **2025-09-05** August Employment Situation released (+22,000 jobs) — **↓ (Large)** — This near-zero print is a sharp deceleration and the most recent hard data point. It signals that the slowdown is not just a revisionist story but is occurring in real-time.
*   **2025-09-05** August unemployment rate rises to 4.3% — **↓** — The increase to the highest level since 2021 is a clear sign of growing slack in the labor market, consistent with weakening payrolls.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Restrictive Monetary Policy:** The elevated Federal Funds Rate increases borrowing costs for businesses, discouraging investment and expansion, which directly curtails hiring. This is the primary driver of the slowdown. (Size: Large)
2.  **Aggregate Demand:** As consumer savings dwindle and the impact of high interest rates bites, spending on goods and services is likely to slow. Reduced demand for output leads directly to reduced demand for labor. (Size: Large)
3.  **Business Confidence & Investment:** Uncertainty about the economic outlook and high capital costs can lead firms to pause hiring plans or initiate layoffs as a precautionary measure. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Labor Supply Normalization:** The labor force participation rate has largely recovered from the pandemic. With supply no longer a major constraint, hiring is now more sensitive to shifts in labor demand. (Size: Small)
5.  **Sector-Specific Dynamics:** While some sectors like healthcare continue to show resilient growth due to structural demand, others like construction, manufacturing, and temporary help services are highly sensitive to economic cycles and are likely to weaken first. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Pace of Monetary Tightening:** The speed and magnitude of the Fed's rate hikes in 2022-2023 were the most aggressive in decades, suggesting the lagged effects could be more pronounced than in typical slowdowns (e.g., 2006-2007).
*   **Information Shock of Benchmark Revision:** The scale of the recent downward revision is unusually large. This means that policymakers and forecasters are operating with a new understanding of the economy's recent trajectory, which was significantly weaker than real-time data suggested.
*   **Persistent Inflation:** Unlike the pre-GFC slowdown where inflation was less of a concern, today's sticky inflation above 2% limits the Federal Reserve's ability to pivot to easier policy, even as the labor market weakens.
*   **Post-Pandemic Economic Distortions:** The economy is still normalizing from unprecedented fiscal stimulus and supply-chain shocks. This makes it difficult to compare cleanly to past cycles, as unique factors in services consumption and government employment may persist.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the "Pre-Recessionary Slowdown" reference class, would be a distribution centered around **+75,000 jobs**, with significant variance. (Equivalent n ≈ 10, reflecting moderate confidence in a slowdown).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The -911k benchmark revision is a powerful signal that the prior understanding of labor market strength was flawed and requires a substantial downward adjustment.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The +22k August NFP report provides concrete, recent evidence that the slowdown is sharp and has already brought job growth to near-stagnation levels.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The Fed's own projection of a 4.5% unemployment rate by year-end implies an expectation of, at best, zero net job growth for the remainder of the year.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Sticky inflation data reinforces the "higher for longer" policy stance, removing a potential upside catalyst for hiring.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to a much weaker labor market than the prior assumed. The posterior distribution should shift significantly downward, with a median likely near zero or slightly negative. The variance should also be high, reflecting the possibility of a contraction.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Weekly jobless claims falling consistently below 200,000.
    *   ISM Services PMI (Employment sub-index) unexpectedly jumping back above 53.
    *   Stronger-than-expected retail sales or personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data.
    *   A significant positive revision to the September or October NFP numbers.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Weekly jobless claims trending up towards 250,000 or higher.
    *   ISM Manufacturing or Services PMI (Employment sub-indices) falling below 50.
    *   A negative print for employment in the Temporary Help Services industry (often a leading indicator).
    *   An increase in the unemployment rate in the October report (to be released early November).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Volatility & Revisions:** The initial NFP release is an estimate based on a sample and is subject to significant revisions in the following two months, as well as the annual benchmark revision. The "true" number for Nov-25 may differ substantially.
*   **Seasonal Adjustment Quirks:** November includes the Thanksgiving holiday, and seasonal adjustment models can sometimes struggle to accurately account for shifting holiday hiring patterns (e.g., in retail), potentially adding noise to the initial print.
*   **Defining the Regime:** It is uncertain whether the economy is in a "soft landing" (stabilizing at low growth) or the initial stages of a recession. A recession would imply a rapid shift to sustained negative payrolls, a dynamic not fully captured by the slowdown prior.
*   **Strikes and One-Off Events:** Major industrial actions (e.g., auto worker or transport strikes) can temporarily distort the monthly numbers and may not reflect the underlying trend in the labor market.

**Final Research Summary:** The labor market has cooled dramatically, a fact confirmed by both the near-zero August job growth and a massive downward benchmark revision. Given restrictive monetary policy and the Fed's own forecasts, the central expectation for November's NFP change should be near zero, with a substantial probability of a negative reading.

To forecast the change in seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll employment for November 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant reference class is the "Pre-Recessionary Slowdown" period, where monthly job growth typically ranges from +50,000 to +125,000. Given the current economic indicators, a prior centered around +75,000 jobs with significant variance is appropriate. This reflects a moderate slowdown in job growth.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current economic environment shows signs of a slowdown, similar to pre-recessionary periods, with restrictive monetary policy and rising unemployment.
   - Differences: The pace of monetary tightening and the recent large benchmark revision are more pronounced than in typical slowdowns, suggesting a sharper deceleration in job growth.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **↓ (Large):** The benchmark revision indicating 911,000 fewer jobs suggests a weaker labor market than previously thought.
   - **↓ (Large):** The August NFP report of +22,000 jobs indicates a sharp deceleration.
   - **↓ (Moderate):** The Fed's projection of a 4.5% unemployment rate by year-end implies weak job growth.
   - **↓ (Small):** Persistent inflation supports continued restrictive monetary policy, limiting job growth.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at +75,000, the evidence strongly suggests a downward shift. The large benchmark revision and recent NFP data push the expected job growth towards zero or negative. The posterior distribution should reflect a median near zero, with increased variance to account for uncertainty.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of overestimating the slowdown. Factors like unexpected positive revisions or stronger-than-expected consumer spending could lead to higher job growth. However, given the weight of current evidence, the risk of a negative outcome remains significant.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast for November 2025 nonfarm payroll employment change is as follows:

P10: -50,000  
P20: -25,000  
P40: 0  
P60: 25,000  
P80: 50,000  
P90: 75,000

# Forecasting Nonfarm Payroll Employment Change for November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the "Pre-Recessionary Slowdown" reference class, which appears most applicable to the current economic environment. During periods like 2006-2007 and 2019, when the economy was slowing before a potential recession, monthly job growth typically ranged from +50,000 to +125,000 jobs.

Given the recent data showing significant cooling in the labor market, I'll center my prior at **+75,000 jobs** with a relatively wide standard deviation of about 100,000 jobs to reflect uncertainty.

This base rate is appropriate because:
- The economy is clearly exiting the high-growth post-pandemic recovery phase
- Monetary policy is restrictive, similar to pre-recessionary periods
- Recent job growth has decelerated significantly

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Restrictive monetary policy is in place, similar to pre-recessionary periods
- The unemployment rate is rising (now at 4.3%), consistent with labor market cooling
- Business confidence is declining as economic uncertainty increases

**Differences from base case:**
- The recent benchmark revision (-911,000 jobs) is unusually large, suggesting the labor market was much weaker than previously understood
- August 2025 job growth was only +22,000, which is significantly below even the pre-recessionary average
- The Fed's projection of 4.5% unemployment by year-end implies continued deterioration
- Inflation remains sticky at 3.0%, limiting the Fed's ability to ease policy despite weakening employment

These differences suggest the current slowdown may be more severe than typical pre-recessionary periods.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- **August 2025 jobs report (+22,000)**: This near-zero print is much weaker than my prior of +75,000. This makes values below +50,000 approximately 3× more likely than my prior would suggest.
- **BLS benchmark revision (-911,000 jobs)**: This massive downward revision indicates the labor market has been significantly weaker than real-time data suggested. This makes negative job growth about 2× more likely than my prior would suggest.
- **Rising unemployment rate (4.3%)**: The increase to the highest level since 2021 is consistent with a rapidly cooling labor market. This makes values below +50,000 about 1.5× more likely.
- **Fed's unemployment projection (4.5% by year-end)**: This implies continued labor market deterioration. This makes values below +25,000 about 1.5× more likely.

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- **Seasonal hiring patterns**: November typically includes some holiday-related hiring, which could temporarily boost numbers. This makes values above +100,000 about 1.2× more likely.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at +75,000 jobs (SD = 100,000), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update based on August jobs report (+22,000):**
- This suggests a much weaker labor market than my prior
- Shifting my distribution downward, the new mean becomes approximately +30,000 jobs
- The variance remains high due to monthly volatility

**Update based on benchmark revision (-911,000 jobs):**
- This fundamentally reframes our understanding of labor market strength
- Further shifting my distribution downward, the new mean becomes approximately +10,000 jobs
- The probability of negative job growth increases substantially

**Final posterior distribution:**
- Mean: approximately +10,000 jobs
- The distribution is now right-skewed, with significant probability mass below zero
- P50 (median) is around 0 to +5,000 jobs
- Standard deviation remains high at approximately 90,000 jobs

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overreacting to recent weak data. Labor markets can be volatile month-to-month.
- The benchmark revision affects historical data but doesn't necessarily predict future performance.
- I might be underestimating the resilience of certain sectors like healthcare and government.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around +50,000 jobs, arguing that:
- The August report was an outlier, not a trend
- Holiday hiring could provide a temporary boost in November
- The Fed might signal a pivot, improving business confidence

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The weight of evidence (benchmark revision, rising unemployment, Fed projections) suggests a fundamental shift in labor market dynamics
- Even with holiday hiring, the underlying trend appears to be deterioration
- Without actual rate cuts, business hiring plans are unlikely to change significantly

**Tail risk considerations:**
- Negative tail: A financial shock or rapid deterioration could lead to job losses of -100,000 or worse
- Positive tail: Unexpected easing of inflation could prompt the Fed to signal rate cuts, potentially boosting hiring

After this consideration, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties.

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class for the current economic environment is the period leading into past economic slowdowns or recessions. The research report identifies the "Pre-Recessionary Slowdowns" class (e.g., 2006-2007, 2019) as most relevant. During these periods, monthly job growth decelerated significantly, averaging between **+50,000 to +125,000**. I will select a prior distribution centered on the midpoint of this range, approximately **+85,000**, with a wide variance (e.g., a standard deviation of ~100,000) to reflect the inherent volatility and uncertainty as an economy approaches a turning point.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current slowdown is driven by restrictive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, a classic feature of late-cycle dynamics seen in past slowdowns.
*   **Differences:** The current situation is more acute than a typical slowdown for several reasons. First, the pace of monetary tightening in 2022-2023 was the fastest in decades, suggesting its lagged effects could be more severe. Second, persistent inflation above the Fed's target limits its ability to ease policy, removing a potential support for the labor market. Third, and most critically, the recent massive downward benchmark revision (-911,000 jobs) reveals that the labor market's starting point was much weaker than previously understood. These differences all suggest the base rate of +85,000 is likely too optimistic.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The recent evidence overwhelmingly points toward a much weaker labor market than the prior suggests.
*   **August Employment Report (+22,000 jobs):** This is a very strong piece of evidence. A near-zero print is far more consistent with an economy on the brink of contraction than one experiencing a mild slowdown. This observation provides a strong likelihood ratio in favor of a much lower true mean for job growth, pulling the forecast down significantly.
*   **BLS Benchmark Revision (-911,000 jobs):** This is a fundamental "information shock." It invalidates the premise that the labor market had strong momentum. It implies that the underlying trend is substantially weaker than previously believed, requiring a large downward revision to my prior beliefs about the economy's health.
*   **Fed Projections (4.5% Unemployment by year-end):** The Fed's own forecast implies that job growth must be at or below zero for the remainder of the year to push the unemployment rate up from its August level of 4.3%. This is a moderately strong piece of evidence from a key institutional forecaster that aligns with the weak data.
*   **Sticky Inflation (3.0% YoY):** This reinforces the "higher for longer" policy stance, ensuring that the primary headwind for hiring (restrictive policy) will remain in place. This reduces the probability of any upside surprises.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at +85,000 (representing a typical slowdown).
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence (especially the +22k August print and the -911k revision) is highly inconsistent with the prior. This new information acts as a powerful multiplier, shifting the entire distribution downwards.
*   **Update Step:** Starting with a prior median of +85,000, the benchmark revision alone forces a re-evaluation, suggesting the true underlying trend was already near stall speed. This might shift the median down to +20,000. Then, incorporating the actual August print of +22,000 and the Fed's forecast for rising unemployment pushes the median further, into negative territory.
*   **Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution is centered slightly below zero. My median forecast (P50) is now **-10,000**. The variance remains high, as the economy is at an inflection point where either stagnation around zero or a slide into a recession with larger job losses are both plausible. The distribution is also skewed to the downside, reflecting the greater risk of a sharp contraction.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the most recent data points, which could be noisy or subject to revision. An alternative "soft landing" scenario, where job growth stabilizes in the low positive range (e.g., +50k to +75k), is still possible, though less likely given the evidence. This scenario would require the lagged effects of monetary policy to be less severe than anticipated. Conversely, I might be underestimating the risk of a rapid deterioration. If business and consumer confidence falters, the +22k print could be the prelude to a series of significantly negative reports (-150k or worse). My forecast attempts to balance these risks, but the downside tail is significant. The possibility of seasonal adjustment quirks in November adds noise, which justifies keeping the P90 at a reasonably high positive number, even if the central tendency is negative. I will maintain a wide and left-skewed distribution to account for these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: -100000
P40: -40000
P60: 20000
