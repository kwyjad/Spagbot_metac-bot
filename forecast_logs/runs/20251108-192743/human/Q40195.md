### Reference class & base rates
*   **All Months (1985-Present):** The long-term mean of the US EPU index is approximately 125, with a median of around 100. However, the distribution is highly right-skewed, with a standard deviation of ~100. This class suggests a baseline around 100-125 but is a poor guide for volatile periods.
*   **First Year of a New Presidential Administration:** Uncertainty is typically higher during the first year of a new administration as markets and businesses adapt to new policy priorities. For example, the index averaged ~130 in 2017 (Trump's first year) and ~215 in 2021 (Biden's first year). This reference class suggests a higher baseline, perhaps in the 150-250 range.
*   **Periods of Active Trade Disputes/Tariff Implementation:** The US-China trade war from 2018-2019 saw the index frequently spike above 200 and occasionally exceed 300. Given the background's emphasis on tariffs in 2025, this is a highly relevant class, suggesting values could persist in the 200-400 range.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-06] Reports of increased entrepreneurship amid layoffs and a recent federal shutdown highlight shaken financial confidence. (↑) — Indicates that policy-driven instability (shutdown) is having tangible, uncertainty-inducing effects on the economy and is a current media topic.
*   [2025-04-17] St. Louis Fed blog notes the EPU index began rising persistently in late 2024 and spiked by February 2025. (↑) — Confirms the establishment of a new, higher-uncertainty regime early in the year, setting a high baseline for H2 2025.
*   [2025-03-19] Forbes article directly links the second Trump administration's tariff policies to a significant EPU increase. (↑) — Reinforces that trade policy is the primary, high-impact driver of the elevated index values seen in 2025.
*   [2025-03-14] ProFarmer reports the March 2025 EPU index at an elevated 369.42, below the record high but well above average. (↑) — Provides a concrete, high anchor point for EPU levels earlier in the year, against which the current value can be compared.
*   [2025-01-30] Washington Post notes businesses are delaying purchases due to uncertainty from the new administration's tariff plans. (↑) — Shows that policy uncertainty is translating into real economic behavior, a theme likely to persist in media coverage.
*   [2025-01-09] Boston Fed President speech highlights high uncertainty from noisy data and potential policy changes at the start of the year. (↑) — Establishes that policy uncertainty has been a key concern for monetary policymakers throughout 2025.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Trade Policy & Tariffs:** (Large) Announcements, threats, or implementation of tariffs, particularly concerning China, are the most significant driver in the current context. This directly triggers media coverage using the index's keywords.
*   **Fiscal Policy & Congressional Conflict:** (Large) Debates over the federal budget, debt ceiling, or the recent government shutdown are major sources of uncertainty and media attention.
*   **Presidential Rhetoric:** (Moderate to Large) Unpredictable statements or social media posts from the White House regarding economic policy can cause sharp, short-term spikes in the index.
*   **Federal Reserve Policy:** (Moderate) Uncertainty surrounding the path of interest rates, especially if Fed communication is perceived as ambiguous or in conflict with the administration, contributes to the index.
*   **Regulatory Changes:** (Small to Moderate) The introduction or rollback of significant regulations in key sectors (e.g., energy, finance) can create uncertainty for affected industries.
*   **Geopolitical Events:** (Small to Moderate) Tensions beyond trade (e.g., military posturing) can spill over into economic policy uncertainty if they threaten supply chains or international cooperation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Second Trump Administration:** Unlike a first term, this administration has a prior track record on tariffs and deregulation. This may lead to markets reacting more quickly and media coverage being more intense, as threats are perceived as more credible.
*   **Recent Federal Shutdown:** The November 2025 context is immediately preceded by a government shutdown. This creates a specific backdrop of fiscal dysfunction that amplifies uncertainty beyond the long-term average.
*   **Post-Pandemic Economic Conditions:** The economy is still navigating unusual dynamics (e.g., persistent inflation concerns, shifting labor markets) compared to the pre-2020 era, making the impact of policy changes harder to predict.
*   **Consolidated Policy Focus:** The primary driver is currently concentrated on tariffs and fiscal conflict, unlike other periods where uncertainty might be more diffuse across monetary policy, healthcare, and other areas.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the "Active Trade Dispute" reference class, perhaps a Lognormal or Gamma distribution with a mean around 220, reflecting a sustained high-uncertainty environment. Equivalent n should be moderate, acknowledging the relevance of this regime.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The combination of a new, disruptive administration and a specific, ongoing focus on tariffs has already pushed the index to very high levels (e.g., 369 in March).
    *   (↑ Large) The recent federal shutdown adds a powerful, proximate source of fiscal policy uncertainty, ensuring continued media coverage.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The persistence of these themes throughout the year (as seen in sources from Jan to Nov) suggests this is a stable, high-uncertainty regime, not a transient spike.
    *   (↓ Small) The background memo notes the index has "since decreased" from its first-half peak. This is key evidence against a value >400 and pulls the estimate down from the March highs.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should be significantly higher than the historical mean (~125) and the "new administration" mean (~150-250). The evidence strongly supports a value in the high-200s to low-300s, below the March peak but still reflecting acute and ongoing policy conflicts.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Specific new tariff announcements or deadlines issued by the White House.
    *   Breakdown in continuing resolution/budget talks, raising the specter of another shutdown.
    *   Escalation in US-China rhetoric or diplomatic incidents.
    *   Unexpectedly hawkish statements from the Federal Reserve.
    *   Contentious legislative battles gaining significant media traction.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A successful, long-term budget agreement passing Congress.
    *   Official de-escalation of trade tensions (e.g., a joint US-China statement).
    *   Clear forward guidance from the Fed that reduces monetary policy uncertainty.
    *   Major news cycles dominated by non-economic, non-policy events.
    *   Positive economic data (e.g., lower inflation, strong growth) that calms markets.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Index Lag:** The index for November is calculated based on articles published throughout the month and released in early December. Events in late November carry as much weight as events in early November.
*   **Media-Driven Proxy:** The index measures media coverage of uncertainty, not uncertainty itself. A highly salient but ultimately minor policy dispute could inflate the index, while a complex but under-reported issue might not.
*   **Keyword Sensitivity:** The index relies on a fixed set of keywords. Novel sources of uncertainty not captured by terms like 'congress', 'deficit', or 'federal reserve' may be missed.
*   **Retrospective Revisions:** The index data can be revised, although this is typically minor for the most recent months.
*   **Non-Linearity:** The index does not move linearly with the perceived severity of an event. A flurry of articles about a moderate issue can have a larger impact than a few articles about a severe one.

**Final Research Summary:** Expect an elevated EPU value for November 2025, likely in the 250-350 range. The environment is defined by persistent, high-impact uncertainty from the administration's trade policies and recent fiscal conflict, keeping the index far above historical norms but likely shy of the extreme peaks seen earlier in the year.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, the most relevant base rate is the "Periods of Active Trade Disputes/Tariff Implementation" class, given the ongoing trade tensions and tariff policies in 2025. This class suggests a mean in the 200-400 range, reflecting heightened uncertainty due to trade disputes.
   - The mean of this base rate is approximately 300, with a high variance due to the potential for spikes during intense periods of policy uncertainty.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution due to ongoing trade tensions and tariff policies, which are significant drivers of economic policy uncertainty.
   - Differences include the recent federal shutdown and the second Trump administration's established track record, which may lead to quicker market reactions and more intense media coverage, potentially increasing the index further.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Increased entrepreneurship amid layoffs and a recent federal shutdown indicate heightened uncertainty (↑).
   - Persistent rise in the EPU index since late 2024 and a spike by February 2025 confirm a high baseline for uncertainty (↑).
   - Direct links between tariff policies and EPU increases reinforce the impact of trade policy on the index (↑).
   - The March 2025 EPU index at 369.42 provides a high anchor point, suggesting elevated levels (↑).
   - The index has decreased since its peak, indicating some moderation (↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 300, the evidence of ongoing trade tensions and recent fiscal conflicts supports maintaining a high level of uncertainty.
   - The decrease from the peak suggests a slight downward adjustment, but the overall environment remains highly uncertain.
   - The posterior distribution is centered around 280-320, reflecting the sustained high uncertainty with some moderation from earlier peaks.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The index could be lower if trade tensions de-escalate or if positive economic data emerges.
   - Tail risks include potential new tariff announcements or further fiscal conflicts, which could push the index higher.
   - An alternative forecast might suggest a lower range if recent decreases continue, but the persistent drivers of uncertainty support a higher estimate.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the high uncertainty environment while accounting for recent decreases from peak levels.

P10: 250  
P20: 270  
P40: 290  
P60: 310  
P80: 330  
P90: 350

# Forecasting the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of reference classes:

- **Periods of Active Trade Disputes (2018-2019)**: During the first US-China trade war, the EPU index frequently exceeded 200 and occasionally reached 300+
- **First Year of Second-Term Administrations**: While we have limited data points, second terms typically have less uncertainty than first terms but still elevated compared to baseline
- **Recent High-Uncertainty Period**: The March 2025 value of 369.42 provides a concrete anchor point from earlier this year

Based on these reference classes, I'll use a prior distribution with:
- Median: ~250 (reflecting elevated but not peak uncertainty)
- Spread: Right-skewed with significant mass between 200-350
- Standard deviation: ~75 (reflecting the high volatility of this measure)

This prior acknowledges that we're in a high-uncertainty regime but accounts for the background information that the index has decreased from its first-half peak.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- We're in a period of active trade disputes with tariff announcements, similar to 2018-2019
- We have a president with a known policy style and approach to trade (second Trump administration)
- Economic policy uncertainty is a major media focus

**Differences from reference distribution:**
- The recent federal government shutdown adds an additional layer of uncertainty not present in all historical periods
- The background explicitly states the index has "decreased" from first-half peaks, suggesting we're past the initial shock
- November is post-election season in non-presidential years, which typically has less policy uncertainty than pre-election periods
- The tariff issue is now established rather than novel, potentially reducing some surprise elements

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing the forecast upward:**
- Recent federal shutdown (November 2025 context): Strong evidence (+50%) for elevated uncertainty as fiscal dysfunction is a direct EPU driver
- Persistent tariff focus throughout 2025: Moderate evidence (+30%) that trade policy remains a major uncertainty source
- Reports of businesses delaying purchases due to policy uncertainty: Moderate evidence (+20%) that economic actors are responding to uncertainty
- Increased entrepreneurship amid layoffs: Weak evidence (+10%) of economic instability

**Evidence pushing the forecast downward:**
- Background states index has "decreased" since first-half peaks: Strong evidence (-40%) against values near the March high of 369
- Several months have passed since initial tariff announcements: Moderate evidence (-20%) that media coverage may have normalized somewhat
- November is typically post-midterm election, reducing political uncertainty: Weak evidence (-10%)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 250, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - Federal shutdown impact:**
- Prior median: 250
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5x more likely to see higher values given the shutdown
- Posterior median shifts upward to ~275

**Second update - "Decreased since first half" statement:**
- Interim prior median: 275
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.6x as likely to see values near March peak
- Posterior median shifts downward to ~260

**Third update - Persistent tariff focus:**
- Interim prior median: 260
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3x more likely to see sustained elevated values
- Final posterior median: ~270

The posterior distribution is:
- More concentrated than the prior (reduced uncertainty)
- Centered higher than the historical average but lower than the March 2025 peak
- Right-skewed with potential for spikes above 350 in case of major policy announcements

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the normalization effect - media attention can fade even when issues persist
- I might be overweighting the impact of the federal shutdown if it was quickly resolved
- I haven't fully accounted for potential new policy initiatives that could emerge in November
- The EPU index is media-based, so major non-economic news could crowd out policy uncertainty coverage

**Alternative forecasts:**
- A lower forecast (~200) could be justified if the tariff issue has become "background noise" in media coverage
- A higher forecast (~350) could be justified if new trade escalations or fiscal battles emerge in November

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for the volatility of the index
- I'll maintain the right skew to account for potential upside surprises from new policy announcements

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 190
P20: 220
P40: 255
P60: 285
P80: 325
P90: 360

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the US Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, which is known to be volatile and right-skewed. I will select a reference class based on periods with similar macroeconomic and political drivers.

*   **Long-Term Average (1985-Present):** Mean ~125, Median ~100. This is a poor prior as the current context is explicitly one of heightened uncertainty.
*   **First Year of a New Administration:** 2017 (Trump) averaged ~130, 2021 (Biden) averaged ~215. This is a better reference class, suggesting a higher baseline.
*   **Periods of Active Trade Disputes (2018-2019):** During the US-China trade war under the first Trump administration, the index frequently ranged between 200 and 350. This is the most relevant reference class, as the background and research explicitly identify tariffs as the primary driver of uncertainty in 2025.

I will select the 2018-2019 trade war period as my primary reference class. This suggests a prior distribution with a median around 200 and a mean around 220, with significant right skew.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in November 2025 has strong similarities and key differences compared to the 2018-2019 base case.

*   **Similarities:** The primary driver is a Trump administration's tariff policy, creating uncertainty for businesses and generating significant media coverage.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Second Administration:** Unlike the first term, this administration's threats may be perceived as more credible, potentially leading to sharper market and media reactions.
    2.  **Additive Shocks:** The research report for November 2025 explicitly mentions a "recent federal shutdown." This is a major source of fiscal policy uncertainty that adds to the existing trade policy uncertainty, suggesting a higher value than the trade-war-driven baseline alone.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of information as evidence that shifts my prior distribution.

*   **Evidence for Higher Values (↑):**
    *   **(Strong ↑) March 2025 Peak at 369.42:** This provides a high anchor point, demonstrating that the 2025 environment can produce EPU levels at the upper end of or exceeding the 2018-2019 range. This evidence stretches the right tail of my distribution.
    *   **(Strong ↑) Recent Federal Shutdown (Nov 2025):** This is a powerful, proximate driver of uncertainty. Historically, government shutdowns cause sharp spikes in the EPU index (e.g., the late 2018/early 2019 shutdown pushed the index above 300). This strongly suggests the November value will be significantly elevated.
    *   **(Moderate ↑) Sustained Focus:** Reports from early 2025 confirm that policy uncertainty has been a dominant theme throughout the year, making a return to low levels highly unlikely.

*   **Evidence for Lower Values (↓):**
    *   **(Moderate ↓) "Index has since decreased" (from the first-half peak):** This is a crucial piece of countervailing evidence. It implies that the index did not remain at its peak level of ~370. Before the shutdown, it likely settled at a lower, though still elevated, level. This pulls the forecast down from the extreme high seen in March.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My conceptual update process is as follows:

1.  **Start with Prior:** A distribution centered around a median of 200, based on the 2018-2019 trade war.
2.  **Incorporate 2025-Specific Evidence:** The March peak of ~370 and the sustained focus on tariffs throughout the year confirm we are in a high-uncertainty regime, likely more intense than the 2018-2019 baseline. This shifts the entire distribution to the right. The median might move from 200 to ~260-280.
3.  **Incorporate Shutdown Evidence:** The news of a recent federal shutdown in November is a powerful new shock. This acts as a strong upward update. If the "settled" level post-March was ~270, a shutdown shock could plausibly add 50-80 points, pushing the expected value well into the 300s.
4.  **Final Posterior:** The posterior distribution is centered significantly higher than the prior. The "decrease since the peak" evidence is counteracted by the "recent shutdown" evidence. The resulting distribution should have a median around 300-320, reflecting both the chronic trade uncertainty and the acute fiscal uncertainty. The distribution remains highly right-skewed.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I will challenge my forecast to identify potential blind spots.

*   **Alternative Scenario (Bullish):** What if the shutdown is resolved very early in November and a surprise trade de-escalation occurs? The monthly average could be lower than my central estimate. My P10 and P20 should account for this, reflecting a return to a "high-but-not-crisis" level of uncertainty, perhaps in the low-to-mid 200s.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Bearish):** What if the shutdown crisis escalates and merges with new, aggressive tariff threats? This combination could easily push the index above the March peak of 369. My P80 and P90 must account for this tail risk, allowing for values approaching or exceeding 400.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast relies heavily on pattern-matching the current situation to past events (2018-19 trade war and shutdown). While the drivers are similar, the magnitudes could differ. The combination of these two major uncertainty drivers simultaneously is relatively rare, making the outcome more unpredictable. Therefore, I will maintain a wide distribution to reflect this high volatility. My central estimate of ~300-320 seems a reasonable balance of the competing factors.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is a right-skewed distribution reflecting a high-uncertainty environment driven by both trade and fiscal policy conflicts.

P10: 210
P20: 240
P40: 280
P60: 320
P80: 360
P90: 400
