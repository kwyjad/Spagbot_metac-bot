### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Peaceful sovereignty transfers of populated, autonomous territories between OECD countries (post-WWII):** This is the most specific reference class. There are virtually no instances of such a transfer via sale. The norm is for territories to gain independence or remain in their current status. The base rate for a given year is extremely low, effectively **<0.1%**. This class is limited by its small sample size (n≈0) but captures the modern political context of self-determination and national identity.
2.  **US acquisitions of foreign territory by purchase:** The US has a history of this (Louisiana Purchase 1803, Alaska 1867, Danish West Indies/US Virgin Islands 1917). However, the last occurrence was over a century ago in a vastly different geopolitical era, before Greenland had home rule. Averaging these few events over ~250 years yields a very low annual base rate, **~1-2%**, but this is likely an overestimate as the conditions that enabled past purchases no longer exist.
3.  **Major, unexpected foreign policy shifts by a Trump administration:** President Trump's first term included several such shifts (e.g., meeting with Kim Jong Un, threatening to leave NATO, moving the US embassy to Jerusalem). While this class doesn't speak to territorial transfers specifically, it suggests that a highly unusual foreign policy action is more plausible under this specific actor. The base rate for a major, norm-breaking announcement in a given year could be estimated at **5-10%**, but this is a very broad category.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-21** Trump Regulatory Policy: 2025 Compendium published. (↑) — Matters because it reinforces the central theme of a second Trump term: aggressive use of executive power and a disregard for established norms and processes.
*   **2025-01-23** YouGov poll shows Americans expect more executive orders and trade disputes. (↑) — Indicates public expectation of a disruptive, transactional foreign policy, creating a permissive environment for unconventional proposals like the Greenland purchase.
*   **2025-01-10** CFR's Preventive Priorities Survey highlights a perilous global landscape. (↔) — While not directly related, it suggests the administration's attention will be consumed by more immediate, high-impact crises, making a complex, long-shot project like this a lower priority.
*   **2024-11-08** CBS News explains Project 2025's plan for a government overhaul. (↑) — The existence of a detailed, pre-vetted plan and personnel list increases the administration's capacity to execute radical policy shifts quickly, slightly raising the chances of this idea being pursued.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **President Trump's Personal Interest & Transactional Worldview:** Trump has a documented, personal interest in the idea. His transactional approach to foreign policy means he may view this as a large "real estate deal" beneficial to the US, ignoring the diplomatic and cultural obstacles. (Size: Large)
2.  **US Strategic Imperatives in the Arctic:** Greenland's location is critical for US missile defense (Thule Air Base) and for monitoring Russian/Chinese activity in the increasingly accessible Arctic. Its vast rare-earth mineral deposits are a key resource in the strategic competition with China. This provides a strong national security rationale. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Greenlandic Self-Determination and Political Will:** Under the 2009 Act on Greenland Self-Government, any change to sovereignty requires Greenland's consent, likely via a referendum. There is a near-unanimous political and public consensus in Greenland against a sale. This is the single largest barrier. (Size: Large)
4.  **Danish Political and Public Consensus:** The idea was dismissed as "absurd" by the Danish Prime Minister in 2019 and is deeply unpopular. No mainstream Danish government could survive entering into such negotiations. It would be seen as a colonial-era betrayal of the Greenlandic people. (Size: Large)
5.  **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves at the end of 2025. A new US administration would have less than a year to overcome immense diplomatic, political, and legal hurdles in two countries to even reach the stage of "formal negotiations." The inertia is immense. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Actor Specificity:** Unlike the generic "US Government" in the historical reference class, the potential initiator is a specific individual (Donald Trump) with a known history of floating this exact proposal and a demonstrated willingness to break diplomatic norms.
*   **Greenland's Autonomy:** Unlike the Danish West Indies in 1917 or Alaska in 1867, modern Greenland has a high degree of autonomy and a strong national identity. Its government and people have a decisive voice, which they have already used to reject the idea.
*   **Nature of the Alliance:** The US and Denmark are close NATO allies. A hostile or coercive attempt to force negotiations would be extraordinarily damaging to the alliance, a much higher cost than in 19th-century transactions with Tsarist Russia or a weaker Denmark.
*   **Geopolitical Context:** The strategic value of the Arctic is far more salient now due to climate change and great power competition with Russia and China, providing a stronger *motive* for the US than at any point in the last 70 years.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the reference class of sovereignty transfers between modern Western democracies. The historical record is strong (high "equivalent n"), suggesting such events are exceptionally rare.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑, Moderate) Trump's personal interest and transactional foreign policy style make the unthinkable slightly more conceivable.
    *   (↑, Small) The strategic importance of the Arctic and Project 2025's ethos provide a rationale and a potential implementation framework.
    *   (↓, Large) The unified and vehement political opposition in both Greenland and Denmark, rooted in legal and cultural realities, acts as a near-insurmountable barrier.
    *   (↓, Large) The requirement for Greenland's consent via referendum is a structural veto point that did not exist in historical analogues.
    *   (↓, Moderate) The extremely short time-to-resolution (approx. 1 month from today's date) makes the complex diplomatic maneuvering required virtually impossible.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for "Yes" (Trump's personality) is idiosyncratic and faces overwhelming structural counter-evidence. The posterior should be updated slightly upwards from the near-zero base rate but should remain in the very low single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   High-level US officials (e.g., Secretary of State, National Security Advisor) publicly mentioning Greenland's strategic importance in the context of new arrangements.
    *   Reports of a massive, unprecedented US economic/aid package being offered to Greenland, separate from Denmark.
    *   Any notable shift in rhetoric from Greenlandic or Danish officials suggesting an openness to discussion (extremely unlikely).
    *   Trump himself tweeting or making public statements about the Greenland "deal."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official statements from the governments of Denmark or Greenland explicitly rejecting any possibility of a sale, likely in response to US rumors.
    *   A new US-Denmark agreement on enhancing the American presence at Thule Air Base, indicating a preference for the status quo.
    *   The new US administration becomes embroiled in a major domestic or international crisis, consuming all its political capital.
    *   No public mention of the topic by any relevant official by mid-December 2025.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on "formal negotiations." A preliminary conversation or a US public offer does not count. Both governments must announce a formal process is beginning.
*   **Trump's Rhetoric vs. Government Action:** Be cautious not to mistake a presidential tweet or rally comment for an official announcement by the "government of the United States." The resolution criteria require a formal government act.
*   **Overweighting US Agency:** It is easy to focus on the US president's desires and underestimate the absolute veto power held by the Greenlandic and Danish governments. Their agency is the dominant factor.
*   **"Black Swan" Possibility:** A sudden, severe economic collapse in Denmark or a geopolitical crisis that dramatically realigns incentives could theoretically change the calculus, but such scenarios are themselves extremely low-probability.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability is extremely low. While a second Trump administration makes the *proposal* plausible, the insurmountable political, legal, and cultural barriers in both Denmark and Greenland make the *commencement of formal negotiations* a remote possibility on such a short timeline.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this event is the transfer of sovereignty of populated, autonomous territories between OECD countries post-WWII. This base rate is effectively <0.1% due to the rarity of such events in modern times, especially involving Western democracies where self-determination and national identity are strong.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The event involves a potential territorial transfer between Western powers, akin to historical acquisitions by the US.
   - Differences: Unlike historical cases, Greenland has significant autonomy and a strong national identity, with legal and political structures that require its consent for sovereignty changes. The geopolitical context and alliance dynamics are also vastly different, making such a transfer more complex and unlikely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Trump's Personal Interest & Transactional Worldview: Increases probability slightly, as he has shown interest in unconventional deals.
   - US Strategic Imperatives in the Arctic: Provides some rationale but not enough to overcome political barriers.
   - Greenlandic and Danish Opposition: Strongly decreases probability due to legal and cultural barriers.
   - Short Timeline: Decreases probability as the time required for such negotiations is insufficient.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 0.1% (0.001 in probability terms)
   - Likelihood ratio for Trump's interest: Slight increase, but overwhelmed by strong opposition.
   - Posterior odds remain very low due to overwhelming evidence against the event occurring.
   - Posterior probability remains in the very low single digits, reflecting the near-impossibility of the event.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: Considered the possibility of a sudden geopolitical shift, but such scenarios are extremely low-probability.
   - Alternative Forecast: A scenario where Denmark faces an economic crisis that changes incentives, but this is unlikely within the timeframe.
   - Adjustments: No significant adjustments needed as the analysis already accounts for potential tail risks.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the overwhelming evidence against the event and the extremely low base rate, the final probability remains very low.

Final: 1%

# Will the US and Denmark announce formal negotiations over the transfer of Greenland before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of formal negotiations over territorial transfers between developed democracies in the modern era.

The most relevant reference class is **peaceful sovereignty transfers of populated, autonomous territories between OECD countries in the post-WWII era**. This class has essentially zero instances, as such transfers have become extremely rare in the modern international system where self-determination is a core principle.

A slightly broader reference class is **US acquisitions of foreign territory by purchase**, which includes the Louisiana Purchase (1803), Alaska (1867), and the Danish West Indies/US Virgin Islands (1917). However, these occurred in fundamentally different geopolitical contexts before the modern international order.

Given these considerations, I'll set a very low prior probability of **0.5%**. This reflects:
- The near-zero historical precedent for such transfers in the modern era
- The extremely short timeline (only about 5 weeks remain until the end of 2025)
- The significant legal, political, and diplomatic barriers to such negotiations

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental structure of international relations still discourages territorial transfers
- Both the US and Denmark remain democratic states where public opinion matters
- Greenland has significant autonomy and self-determination rights

**Key differences:**
- Donald Trump has explicitly expressed interest in purchasing Greenland during his first term
- Trump's demonstrated willingness to pursue unconventional foreign policy initiatives
- Increased strategic importance of the Arctic due to climate change and great power competition
- Project 2025 and other indicators suggest a more aggressive use of executive power

These differences suggest a slight upward adjustment from the base rate, but the structural barriers remain overwhelming.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's personal interest in acquiring Greenland**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If negotiations were to be announced, Trump's personal interest would almost certainly be a driving factor
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.2) - Trump has many interests that don't translate into formal policy
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This evidence increases the probability moderately

**Evidence 2: Greenlandic and Danish political opposition**
- P(E|H): Very low (~0.1) - It's highly unlikely formal negotiations would be announced in the face of such opposition
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - The strong opposition is consistent with no negotiations occurring
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Legal requirement for Greenlandic consent**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Formal negotiations would likely require some indication of Greenlandic openness
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.95) - The legal barriers are consistent with no negotiations occurring
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.21
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeline (5 weeks remaining)**
- P(E|H): Very low (~0.15) - Formal negotiations would require rapid diplomatic movement
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - The short timeline makes inaction more likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.17
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 0.5% (odds of 1:199)

First update (Trump's interest):
- Prior odds: 1:199
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 4.5:199 ≈ 1:44.2
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+44.2) ≈ 2.2%

Second update (Political opposition):
- Prior odds: 1:44.2
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.11:44.2 ≈ 1:401.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+401.8) ≈ 0.25%

Third update (Legal requirements):
- Prior odds: 1:401.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21
- Posterior odds: 0.21:401.8 ≈ 1:1913.3
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+1913.3) ≈ 0.05%

Fourth update (Short timeline):
- Prior odds: 1:1913.3
- Likelihood ratio: 0.17
- Posterior odds: 0.17:1913.3 ≈ 1:11254.7
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+11254.7) ≈ 0.009%

This extremely low probability reflects the multiple strong barriers to such negotiations occurring.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Black swan events**: I may be underestimating the possibility of a sudden geopolitical crisis that dramatically changes incentives.

2. **Alternative arrangements**: The question specifically requires "formal negotiations over the possible transfer of sovereignty." I should consider whether partial sovereignty arrangements or enhanced US presence might be more likely.

3. **Overconfidence in structural barriers**: While the barriers are real, history shows that seemingly impossible diplomatic developments can sometimes occur rapidly.

4. **Trump's unpredictability**: Trump has demonstrated an ability to pursue unconventional policies despite institutional resistance.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my extremely low probability upward slightly. While the structural barriers remain overwhelming, the unique factors of Trump's interest and unpredictability warrant a small probability.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, I believe the probability of formal negotiations being announced before 2026 is extremely low but not literally zero. The combination of Trump's personal interest, the strategic importance of Greenland, and the possibility of unexpected developments justifies a small but non-negligible probability.

Final: 0.5%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is **peaceful transfers of sovereignty of populated, autonomous territories between developed, allied Western nations since World War II**. This type of event is exceptionally rare. In the modern era, principles of national sovereignty and self-determination are paramount, making the sale of a territory with its own government and population almost unthinkable.

Instances in this reference class are virtually zero. While borders have been adjusted and territories have gained independence, a direct sale or transfer between two stable, allied OECD countries is without modern precedent.

Therefore, the base rate for such an event occurring in any given year is extremely low. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **0.1%**. This reflects the immense structural and normative barriers against such an event. In odds form, this is 1:999.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation involves two long-standing NATO allies (the US and Denmark) operating within the established post-WWII international order. Greenland possesses a high degree of autonomy and a distinct national identity, consistent with the modern context where self-determination is a key principle.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the specific political actor, Donald Trump, who is President in this scenario. Unlike a generic US president, he has a documented personal interest in this specific proposal and a well-established history of pursuing transactional, norm-breaking foreign policy. A secondary difference is the heightened geopolitical competition in the Arctic, which provides a stronger strategic motive for the US to seek greater control over Greenland than in past decades. However, a crucial difference from historical US territory purchases (e.g., the US Virgin Islands in 1917) is that modern Greenland has a home-rule government and its population has the legal right to consent to any change in sovereignty, a right they are overwhelmingly against exercising in this manner.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event that formal negotiations are announced before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Donald Trump's presidency and stated interest.**
    *   This evidence makes the *proposal* of a sale much more likely than under a generic president.
    *   P(E1 | H) is very high; this is almost a necessary precondition for the event.
    *   P(E1 | ~H) is also high, as Trump could be president and want to buy Greenland, but still be rebuffed by Denmark and Greenland.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H) is significantly greater than 1. It transforms the event from "unthinkable" to "merely extremely unlikely." This evidence **increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Unified political and public opposition in Denmark and Greenland.**
    *   When the idea was floated in 2019, it was met with universal condemnation and dismissed as "absurd" by the Danish Prime Minister and Greenlandic officials. There is no indication this sentiment has changed.
    *   P(E2 | H) is extremely low. For formal negotiations to begin, this deep-seated opposition would have to be overcome.
    *   P(E2 | ~H) is very high. This opposition is the default state and the primary reason negotiations would not happen.
    *   The likelihood ratio is very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability and is the most significant barrier.

*   **Evidence 3: The extremely short timeline.**
    *   The forecast is being made on November 23, 2025. The question resolves at the end of December 2025, leaving just over one month.
    *   P(E3 | H) is very low. The diplomatic, legal, and political groundwork to get two other governments (Denmark and Greenland) to agree to such a monumental and controversial negotiation in five weeks is almost impossible to imagine.
    *   P(E3 | ~H) is very high. Inertia is a powerful force, and the default outcome for any complex government action on a short timeline is that it does not happen.
    *   The likelihood ratio is very small (<< 1). This evidence also strongly **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** The odds are 1:999 against (0.1% probability).
2.  **Update for the Trump Factor:** Trump's unique presidency makes this specific unconventional act perhaps 10-20 times more likely than it would be otherwise. Let's use a likelihood ratio of 15.
    *   Posterior Odds = 1:999 × 15 ≈ 15:999 ≈ 1:67.
    *   This updates the probability to roughly 1.5%.
3.  **Update for Danish/Greenlandic Opposition and Short Timeline:** These two factors are overwhelming structural barriers. Combined, they make the event at least 100 times less likely. A conservative likelihood ratio for this combined evidence would be 0.01.
    *   Final Odds = 1:67 × 0.01 = 1:6700.
    *   Final Probability = 1 / (1 + 6700) ≈ 0.015%.

This formal update suggests a probability far below 1%. However, this method is sensitive to the chosen likelihood ratios. An alternative approach is to consider the chain of events required. The US would have to make an unprecedented offer, and both the Danish and Greenlandic governments would have to reverse their deeply entrenched positions, all within five weeks. The probability of this entire chain holding is exceptionally low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis points to a sub-1% probability. Could I be wrong? The primary way this could happen is if the Trump administration makes an astronomical or coercive "offer they can't refuse." For example, a multi-trillion-dollar package combined with threats to withdraw from NATO or impose severe sanctions. This could, in theory, force the Danish government to the negotiating table against its will. This scenario is itself a very low-probability event, but it is the most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution. The existence of this path, however unlikely, means the probability is not zero. My initial Bayesian update might be too mechanically low and under-account for the sheer unpredictability of the specific actor involved. Acknowledging this tail risk, I should adjust the final probability upward from the calculated 0.015% to a round number that captures this "unconventional actor" risk. A 1% forecast implies this would happen once in a hundred similar situations, which feels like an appropriate level for a shocking but not physically impossible event.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such a territorial transfer is near zero. While the presidency of Donald Trump makes the *proposal* of such a deal plausible, the structural barriers are immense. The unified and vehement opposition in both Denmark and Greenland, combined with the legal necessity of Greenlandic consent, acts as a near-certain veto. Furthermore, the extremely short timeline of just over one month makes overcoming the diplomatic and political inertia required for a joint announcement of "formal negotiations" a remote possibility. The most plausible, albeit still highly unlikely, scenario involves an unprecedented coercive or financial offer from the US. Accounting for this small possibility, the final probability remains very low.

Final: 1%
