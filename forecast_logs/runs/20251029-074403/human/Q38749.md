### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the base rate of indictment for CEOs of high-profile, high-valuation US technology companies?** This establishes the prior probability.
*   **Q2: What were the specific allegations or concerns that led to Sam Altman's November 2023 ouster?** Understanding the root cause is critical to assessing potential criminality.
*   **Q3: What was the outcome of the internal investigation into the ouster?** The WilmerHale report is a key piece of evidence regarding the severity of the initial claims.
*   **Q4: Are there any known, active state or federal investigations into Sam Altman or OpenAI?** This is the most direct pathway to an indictment.
*   **Q5: What is the typical timeline for a white-collar investigation to proceed to indictment?** This helps contextualize the likelihood of resolution within the short remaining timeframe (~2 months).
*   **Q6: What specific actions or events have occurred in the last 6-12 months that would update the probability?** This focuses on recent, relevant information.

**2. Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1:** `base rate indictment tech CEO`, `list of indicted Fortune 500 CEOs`, `securities fraud cases against tech founders`.
*   **Q2:** `Sam Altman "not consistently candid" details`, `Helen Toner on Sam Altman firing`, `reasons for OpenAI board firing Altman`.
*   **Q3:** `WilmerHale OpenAI investigation findings summary`, `OpenAI board statement March 2024 Altman`.
*   **Q4:** `SEC investigation Sam Altman OpenAI update 2025`, `DOJ antitrust investigation OpenAI`, `FTC inquiry OpenAI Microsoft`.
*   **Q5:** `average length of federal white collar investigation`, `timeline from SEC inquiry to indictment`, `DOJ investigation process duration`.
*   **Q6:** `Sam Altman news 2025`, `OpenAI regulatory news 2025`, `Sam Altman investor relations 2025`.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   The base rate for indictment of a CEO of a major tech company is extremely low. Cases like Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos) or SBF (FTX) are notable for their rarity and the scale of the underlying fraud.
*   The initial "not candid" charge from the old board remains vague. Subsequent comments from former board members suggest it related to a pattern of manipulative behavior and lack of transparency on safety issues, not necessarily financial or securities fraud.
*   The WilmerHale investigation, commissioned by the new board, concluded the ouster was due to a "breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust," and that Altman's conduct *did not warrant removal*. This is a powerful counter-signal to the idea of underlying criminality.
*   The SEC was reportedly investigating whether Altman misled investors. However, there has been a notable lack of public updates on this probe for over a year. The DOJ and FTC are also conducting antitrust inquiries, but these are less likely to result in a *criminal indictment* of a CEO and typically move very slowly.
*   White-collar investigations are lengthy, often taking multiple years. An indictment before January 1, 2026, would imply an investigation is already in its final stages. The current lack of public signals (e.g., leaks about grand jury subpoenas, witness interviews) makes this seem unlikely.
*   Recent events show Altman and OpenAI operating in a "business-as-usual" mode, focusing on product development, governance restructuring, and public commentary on the future of AI, not on defending against an imminent indictment.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

The synthesized findings will now be structured into the required format for the final answer.

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **CEOs of major US technology companies (>$50B valuation):** The indictment of a sitting or recent CEO in this class is exceptionally rare. Over the last two decades, with hundreds of such companies, there have been only a handful of high-profile indictments (e.g., related to options backdating in the 2000s, or massive fraud like Enron/WorldCom which are not tech-specific). The annual base rate is likely well below 1%.
*   **Founders of "Unicorn" Startups:** This class has a slightly higher rate of legal trouble, often related to misleading investors about technology or financials (e.g., Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos, Charlie Javice of Frank). However, even here, indictment is the exception, not the rule. The base rate is still very low, perhaps in the 1-2% range over a multi-year period of intense scrutiny.
*   **Limitations:** These base rates are estimates. The unique non-profit/capped-profit structure of OpenAI and the intense public and regulatory spotlight on AI as a sector may make historical comparisons less reliable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-28] OpenAI announces progress on its new business structure, reviewed by state AGs. ↓ — This signals a move toward regulatory compliance and long-term stability, not crisis management ahead of an indictment.
*   [2025-06-07] Altman makes public predictions about AI's future at a summit. ↓ — Shows him operating as a public-facing CEO focused on vision, suggesting low concern about imminent legal jeopardy.
*   [2025-05 to 2025-10] Absence of public updates on the SEC investigation. ↓ — Federal investigations that are progressing toward indictment often generate leaks or public filings. The continued silence with the deadline approaching suggests the probe is either slow, dormant, or has been closed.
*   [2024-03-08] OpenAI board expresses "full confidence" in Altman after a WilmerHale investigation, reinstating him to the board. ↓ — This is the most significant recent event. An internal, albeit potentially biased, review found his conduct did not merit removal, strongly undermining the idea that his "lack of candor" was criminal.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **SEC investigation into misleading investors:** The probe, reportedly opened in late 2023, is the most direct potential path to indictment. If investigators found Altman knowingly deceived investors about OpenAI's governance, finances, or technology, it could lead to securities fraud charges. (Size: Large)
*   **Whistleblower testimony:** A disgruntled former board member or employee could provide new, damaging information to federal investigators, reigniting a stalled probe. (Size: Moderate)
*   **DOJ/FTC antitrust inquiries:** While primarily focused on market competition (e.g., Microsoft's influence), these investigations could uncover criminal conduct. However, this is a low-probability outcome, and these cases rarely lead to criminal charges against individuals. (Size: Small)
*   **Unrelated personal conduct:** An indictment could stem from issues entirely unrelated to OpenAI (e.g., taxes, other investments). There is no public information to suggest this is a risk. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Public accusation by a board:** Unlike most CEO scandals that are uncovered by journalists or regulators, this one was initiated by OpenAI's own board with the public statement that Altman was "not consistently candid." This invited intense scrutiny.
*   **Rapid reversal and internal exoneration:** The near-unanimous employee revolt, Altman's swift return, and the subsequent WilmerHale investigation that cleared him is highly unusual. Most CEOs fired for cause do not return and are not publicly vindicated by the company.
*   **Unique corporate structure:** OpenAI's complex non-profit parent and capped-profit subsidiary structure could create novel avenues for misleading stakeholders (investors, donors, the public) that don't fit typical corporate fraud templates.
*   **Extreme regulatory and media focus:** As the face of the AI revolution, Altman is under a level of scrutiny far exceeding that of a typical tech CEO, potentially increasing the probability that any misstep is investigated.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<2%) based on the reference class of major tech CEOs being indicted. The strength of this prior is high (equivalent n > 100), as the base rate is stable and well-established.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The Nov 2023 ouster for being "not candid" and the launch of an SEC probe created a significant initial shock, suggesting a non-trivial risk of serious misconduct.
    *   (↓↓ Very Large) The March 2024 WilmerHale investigation findings, which cleared Altman of conduct warranting removal, act as a powerful rebuttal, effectively neutralizing much of the negative signal from the ouster.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The passage of over 1.5 years since the event and nearly a year of public silence from the SEC significantly lowers the probability of an indictment materializing.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (~2 months) makes an indictment highly improbable, as the final stages of an investigation are rarely this swift and silent.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior probability should be revised sharply downwards from any peak concern in late 2023/early 2024. The evidence strongly suggests the issue was one of internal governance and trust, not criminal fraud. The posterior should be very close to, or even below, the initial base rate.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the indictment of CEOs of major US technology companies is extremely low. Historical data suggests that the annual base rate is likely well below 1%. This is due to the rarity of such events, with only a few high-profile cases over the past two decades. Therefore, I will start with a prior probability of 1%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Sam Altman, as a CEO of a high-profile tech company, fits the reference class of major tech CEOs. The initial concerns about his lack of candor align with situations where CEOs have faced scrutiny.
   - Differences: The rapid reversal of Altman's ouster and the internal investigation clearing him are unusual. Most CEOs in similar situations do not return and are not publicly vindicated by their companies. This suggests a lower likelihood of criminality compared to typical cases leading to indictment.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **WilmerHale Investigation Findings**: The investigation concluded that Altman's conduct did not warrant removal, which strongly suggests that the initial concerns were not indicative of criminal behavior. This decreases the probability of indictment.
   - **Lack of Public Updates on SEC Investigation**: The absence of updates or leaks about the SEC investigation over a significant period suggests that the investigation may not be progressing towards an indictment. This decreases the probability.
   - **Short Timeframe**: With only two months remaining until the deadline, the likelihood of an indictment occurring within this period is low, given the typical length of white-collar investigations. This further decreases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1% or 0.01 in probability terms.
   - Likelihood ratio: The evidence (WilmerHale findings, lack of SEC updates, short timeframe) collectively suggests a strong decrease in probability. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 0.1 (indicating a 90% reduction in probability).
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.01 × 0.1 = 0.001
   - Posterior probability = 0.001 / (1 + 0.001) ≈ 0.1%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the potential for new evidence or developments. However, the lack of current indicators and the short timeframe make significant changes unlikely.
   - Alternative scenarios, such as a sudden whistleblower revelation, could increase the probability, but there is no current evidence to suggest this is imminent.
   - Adjusting for these considerations, the probability remains low, but I will slightly increase it to account for unforeseen developments.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability is 0.5%.

Final: 0.5%

# Will Sam Altman be indicted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for the probability that a high-profile tech CEO like Sam Altman would be indicted within a specific timeframe.

**Appropriate reference classes:**
- CEOs of major US technology companies (>$50B valuation)
- Founders of "unicorn" startups who faced public scrutiny
- Tech executives who faced specific allegations of misconduct

Looking at historical data, indictments of major tech CEOs are extremely rare. Over the past two decades, with hundreds of such companies, only a handful of high-profile indictments have occurred (e.g., cases like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos or Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX). These cases typically involved massive, systematic fraud.

The annual base rate for indictment of a major tech CEO is likely well below 1%. Even for the slightly higher-risk category of unicorn startup founders who face public scrutiny, the rate might be around 1-2% over a multi-year period.

Given that we're looking at a specific timeframe (now until January 1, 2026, which is about 2 months), and considering the rarity of such events, I'll set a conservative prior of **2%**.

**Prior probability (P(H)) = 2%**
**Prior odds = 0.02/0.98 = 1:49**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Altman is a high-profile tech CEO of a company with enormous valuation and influence
- Like most tech CEOs, he has significant public visibility and scrutiny
- The tech industry generally has low indictment rates for executives

**Key differences:**
- The November 2023 board statement that Altman was "not consistently candid" created unusual public scrutiny
- OpenAI has an atypical corporate structure (non-profit/capped-profit) that differs from typical tech companies
- The AI industry faces heightened regulatory attention due to its potential societal impact
- There was an explicit SEC investigation reported following his brief ouster
- The WilmerHale investigation subsequently cleared Altman of conduct warranting removal
- Nearly two years have passed since the initial allegations without an indictment

These differences cut in both directions. The unusual board statement and SEC investigation increase the probability relative to the base rate, while the WilmerHale exoneration and passage of time without action decrease it.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: The November 2023 board statement that Altman was "not consistently candid"**
- P(E1|H): If Altman were to be indicted, it's very likely (90%) there would have been concerns about his candor
- P(E1|~H): Even if he's not indicted, such concerns could arise for non-criminal reasons (20%)
- Likelihood ratio: 90%/20% = 4.5
- This evidence increases the probability of indictment

**Evidence 2: The March 2024 WilmerHale investigation finding that Altman's conduct did not warrant removal**
- P(E2|H): If Altman were to be indicted, it's unlikely (10%) an investigation would clear him
- P(E2|~H): If he's not going to be indicted, it's quite likely (80%) an investigation would clear him
- Likelihood ratio: 10%/80% = 0.125
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of indictment

**Evidence 3: The passage of time (nearly 2 years) without public updates on the SEC investigation**
- P(E3|H): If an indictment were forthcoming, it's unlikely (20%) there would be complete silence for so long
- P(E3|~H): If no indictment is forthcoming, it's quite likely (90%) the investigation would fade without updates
- Likelihood ratio: 20%/90% = 0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of indictment

**Evidence 4: The extremely short remaining time window (2 months until January 2026)**
- P(E4|H): If an indictment were coming, it's very unlikely (5%) it would happen with no signals this close to deadline
- P(E4|~H): If no indictment is coming, it's very likely (95%) we'd see this pattern of no activity
- Likelihood ratio: 5%/95% = 0.053
- This evidence very significantly decreases the probability of indictment

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with our prior odds of 1:49 (2%), let's update sequentially:

**Update on Evidence 1 (Board statement about lack of candor):**
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (1/49) × 4.5 = 4.5/49 = 0.092
- Posterior probability = 0.092/(1+0.092) = 0.084 or 8.4%

**Update on Evidence 2 (WilmerHale investigation clearing Altman):**
- Posterior odds = 0.092 × 0.125 = 0.0115
- Posterior probability = 0.0115/(1+0.0115) = 0.011 or 1.1%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Passage of time without updates):**
- Posterior odds = 0.0115 × 0.22 = 0.00253
- Posterior probability = 0.00253/(1+0.00253) = 0.0025 or 0.25%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Short remaining time window):**
- Posterior odds = 0.00253 × 0.053 = 0.000134
- Posterior probability = 0.000134/(1+0.000134) = 0.00013 or 0.013%

This extremely low probability seems too aggressive. Let me reconsider the strength of my evidence and likelihood ratios, as I may have overweighted some factors.

Taking a more conservative approach and recognizing the inherent uncertainty, I'll adjust my final estimate upward. The key facts remain that:
1. The initial concerns were serious enough to warrant an SEC investigation
2. The WilmerHale investigation cleared Altman
3. Nearly two years have passed without public developments
4. Only two months remain until the resolution deadline

A more reasonable posterior probability would be around 0.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of sealed indictments or non-public investigations
- There could be whistleblowers or evidence I'm unaware of
- The SEC or DOJ might be moving more quickly than typical historical cases
- I might be overweighting the significance of the WilmerHale investigation, which was commissioned by a board friendly to Altman

**Alternative scenarios:**
- There could be an investigation into matters unrelated to the November 2023 board concerns
- Regulatory pressure on AI companies might accelerate timelines for legal action
- The unique structure of OpenAI might create novel legal vulnerabilities

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 5%, arguing that:
- The SEC investigation was real and might still be active
- High-profile cases sometimes move in unexpected ways
- The initial board concerns might have revealed serious issues
- The short timeframe doesn't completely preclude an indictment

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome:
- The explicit clearing of Altman by the WilmerHale investigation
- The complete lack of public signals of an advancing investigation
- The extremely short remaining timeframe
- The continued normal operation of OpenAI with Altman at the helm

Considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward from 0.5% to 1% to account for unknown factors and tail risks.

## 6. Final Forecast

Based on the extremely low base rate of tech CEO indictments, the WilmerHale investigation clearing Altman, the passage of time without developments, and the short remaining window, I assess the probability of Sam Altman being indicted before 2026 at 1%.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is CEOs of high-profile, high-valuation (> $50 billion) U.S. technology companies.
*   **Reasoning:** Indictment of a CEO in this category is an extremely rare event. Over the past two decades, there have been hundreds of "CEO-years" in this class (e.g., Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft), with only a handful of indictments, typically related to widespread, company-destroying fraud (e.g., Enron, WorldCom, which are not even pure tech examples) or specific scandals like options backdating in the 2000s. High-profile fraud cases like Theranos or FTX involved private companies whose core business was later revealed to be fraudulent, which is a distinct subclass. A conservative estimate for the annual indictment rate for a CEO in this reference class is well below 1%.
*   **Initial Prior (P(H)):** Given the ~2-year window of the question (Nov 2023 to Dec 2025), a reasonable prior probability, before considering any specific evidence about Sam Altman, is around **2%**. This is slightly higher than a simple annual base rate to account for the "founder-CEO" archetype which can sometimes have a higher risk profile.
*   **Prior Odds:** A 2% probability corresponds to prior odds of 0.02 / 0.98, or approximately **1-to-49**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Sam Altman is the CEO of a globally recognized, high-valuation technology company, placing him under intense media and regulatory scrutiny, which is typical for the reference class. The initial allegations involved a lack of candor, which can be a precursor to findings of misleading investors.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Origin of Accusation:** The crisis was triggered by his own board's public statement, which is an unusually direct and high-signal event compared to a typical investigation sparked by journalists or regulators.
    *   **Rapid Reversal and Vindication:** The near-unanimous employee revolt, his swift reinstatement, and the subsequent internal investigation by law firm WilmerHale that publicly concluded his conduct did not warrant removal are highly atypical. Most CEOs fired under a cloud of suspicion do not return, let alone get publicly cleared by the company. This sequence of events strongly suggests the conflict was related to internal governance and trust rather than criminal activity.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

We start with the 2% prior and update based on the key events.

*   **Evidence 1: The November 2023 Firing and SEC Probe.** The board's statement that Altman was "not consistently candid" and the subsequent opening of an SEC investigation are strong evidence *for* the hypothesis of indictment.
    *   P(E1 | H: Altman committed an indictable offense): High. A board discovering criminal-level dishonesty would likely fire him with such a statement.
    *   P(E1 | ~H: No indictable offense): Low. It's rare for a board to use such strong language for a non-criminal matter.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence would have sharply increased the probability of indictment in late 2023.

*   **Evidence 2: The WilmerHale Investigation Conclusion (March 2024).** The investigation, commissioned by the new board, found the ouster was due to a "breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust" and expressed "full confidence" in Altman.
    *   P(E2 | H): Extremely low. It is almost inconceivable that a reputable law firm and the company's board would publicly clear a CEO if they had discovered evidence of criminal conduct, due to immense legal and reputational risk.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): High. This is the expected outcome if the dispute was a non-criminal power struggle.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very much less than 1 (e.g., << 0.1). This is a powerful piece of evidence *against* indictment, largely neutralizing the negative signal from the firing.

*   **Evidence 3: Passage of Time and Lack of News.** It is now late October 2025. Over 1.5 years have passed since the event, and there have been no public reports, leaks, or filings (like a Wells notice) to suggest the SEC investigation is progressing toward an indictment. The resolution deadline is only two months away.
    *   P(E3 | H): Very low. A complex white-collar case reaching the indictment stage is a lengthy process. For an indictment to occur in the next two months, the investigation would almost certainly be in an advanced stage, which is difficult to keep entirely secret in such a high-profile case.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): High. It is common for preliminary inquiries to be opened and later closed without action. Prolonged silence is a strong indicator that a case is not a priority or has been dropped.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Much less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Conceptual Update:** We start with a low prior (1-to-49 odds). The initial firing (Evidence 1) dramatically increased these odds. However, the subsequent clearing by the WilmerHale investigation (Evidence 2) and the long period of silence from regulators with a looming deadline (Evidence 3) are extremely strong counter-signals. The combined likelihood ratio of this exonerating evidence is very small.
*   **Calculation Sketch:**
    *   Prior Odds: 1-to-49.
    *   Let's say the firing increased the odds by a factor of 10 (to ~17% probability). Odds become 10-to-49.
    *   Let's say the WilmerHale report and passage of time together decrease the odds by a factor of 50 (a conservative estimate).
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (10-to-49) / 50 = 10-to-2450 = 1-to-245.
*   **Resulting Posterior:** A 1-to-245 odds ratio converts to a probability of 1 / (1 + 245) ≈ 0.4%. This analytical approach suggests a probability of less than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The WilmerHale report could have been a "whitewash" designed to stabilize the company, while the SEC quietly built a strong, airtight case based on information from former board members. An indictment could still be announced unexpectedly before the deadline.
*   **Counter-Argument:** This scenario is possible but unlikely. The complete lack of public signals (leaks, witness interviews, key people hiring defense counsel) over such a long period makes a surprise indictment improbable. The reputational risk to the new board and WilmerHale would also be substantial.
*   **Market Data:** The community forecast on Manifold is 7.6%. This is significantly higher than my analysis suggests. This might be due to the market placing a higher weight on the "whitewash" scenario, pricing in unknown tail risks (e.g., an indictment for an unrelated matter), or anchoring to the high perceived risk from late 2023. While my analysis points to a very low probability, I will adjust slightly upward from my calculated <1% to account for this "wisdom of the crowd" signal and the inherent uncertainty of any forecast.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate for a major tech CEO being indicted is already very low. While the circumstances of Sam Altman's firing briefly and dramatically increased the perceived risk, the subsequent evidence—his reinstatement, the public clearing by an internal investigation, and the long passage of time with no signs of a progressing federal case—overwhelmingly points against an indictment. The extremely short time remaining before the 2026 deadline makes it even more improbable. My analytical estimate is below 1%, but I will adjust to 2% to incorporate a small probability for tail risks and model uncertainty.

Final: 2%
