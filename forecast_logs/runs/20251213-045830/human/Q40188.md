### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Previous U.S.-Mexico NWS-related cattle import suspensions:** The most relevant reference class is the ban from late November 2024 to February 2025, mentioned in the provided sources. This suspension lasted approximately 3 months. If this were the only data point, the base rate for a resolution within a similar timeframe would be high. However, the current suspension has already lasted over 5 months (since the July re-imposition), suggesting it is a more severe or complex situation.
2.  **U.S. import suspensions for foreign animal diseases (FADs) of moderate severity:** This class includes outbreaks like Avian Influenza or certain swine diseases. These bans are often regionalized and typically last from 3 to 12 months, depending on the speed of containment and verification. The base rate for resolution within any given 1-month period during such a ban is low, perhaps 10-15%, as resolution requires sustained evidence of control.
3.  **U.S. import suspensions for high-consequence FADs:** This class includes diseases like Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). Such bans can last for years or even decades. This case is not in that class, as NWS is a pest, not a highly contagious virus, and has established eradication protocols. This class serves as an upper bound, suggesting the ban is unlikely to be indefinite.

**Reasoning:** The most pertinent reference class is the prior NWS ban, but its short duration appears anomalous compared to the current situation. A broader class of moderate-severity FADs provides a more conservative and likely more accurate baseline, suggesting resolutions are measured in months, not weeks.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary states "every day that goes by we get a little bit closer" but gives no timeline. — **↑ (small)** — Positive sentiment from leadership, but non-committal language signals a resolution is not imminent.
*   **2025-11-13** USDA opens a new sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico. — **↑ (small)** — A concrete, operational step to combat the pest. However, the epidemiological impact of such a facility is not immediate and requires weeks to affect the fly population.
*   **2025-07-09** U.S. re-imposes suspension shortly after a brief reopening. — **↓ (large, contextual)** — This past event is the most critical piece of recent history. It demonstrates that the situation was previously underestimated, creating a high bar for proof of control and making USDA decision-makers extremely risk-averse.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Epidemiological Status (NWS Case Detection):** The primary driver. Any new, confirmed NWS case detection in the export region of Mexico effectively resets the clock on any potential reopening. The absence of cases for a sustained period (multiple screwworm life cycles, ~21 days each) is a prerequisite for action. (Size: Large)
2.  **Bureaucratic Verification & Risk Assessment:** USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must formally assess that Mexico's surveillance and control measures are effective and sufficient to prevent exportation of the pest. This is a procedural, evidence-based process that takes time and is not easily rushed. (Size: Large)
3.  **Effectiveness of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT):** The new Tampico facility and other efforts must demonstrably reduce the wild screwworm population. This is the core countermeasure, but its effects are gradual over weeks and months, not days. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Economic & Political Pressure:** U.S. feedlots rely on feeder cattle from Mexico, and Mexican producers rely on the U.S. market. This creates significant pressure for a resolution. However, this pressure is counter-weighed by the massive economic and political risk of re-introducing an eradicated pest to the U.S. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Calendar:** The resolution window (Dec 13 - Dec 31) falls during a period of reduced government staffing and operational tempo. Major policy decisions and new rule-making are less likely to be finalized and announced during this time unless it is a national emergency. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The Failed Reopening:** Unlike the "clean" 2024-2025 ban, this instance includes a failed reopening attempt in July. This creates a "once bitten, twice shy" dynamic, significantly increasing the burden of proof on Mexico and the level of caution within the USDA.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in under three weeks. The base rate for a major international agricultural trade policy reversal within such a short, holiday-adjacent window is exceptionally low. Bureaucratic processes alone typically take longer.
*   **New Countermeasure Infrastructure:** The opening of the Tampico facility is a new variable not present in previous bans. While positive, its immediate impact on the Dec 31 deadline is likely minimal, as its effects are not instantaneous.
*   **Longer Duration:** This ban has already outlasted the most recent NWS-related precedent, signaling that the underlying pest problem is more widespread or persistent than the previous outbreak.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior based on the rarity of major agricultural policy reversals within any given 3-week period, especially over a major holiday season. A prior of ~10% (equivalent n=10) seems plausible, reflecting that it's possible but unlikely.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The failed July reopening creates a powerful institutional bias toward caution and delay.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The holiday calendar significantly slows bureaucratic processes required for a formal reopening.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Positive but non-committal statements from the USDA Secretary.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The new sterile fly facility is a positive operational step, but its effect on the pest population is not yet realized within the resolution window.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The large negative weight of the failed reopening and the moderate negative weight of the holiday calendar far outweigh the small positive signals of recent progress. The posterior should be revised significantly lower than the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An official APHIS technical briefing announcing a specific number of consecutive screwworm-free weeks in key Mexican states.
    *   A joint press conference between the U.S. and Mexican Secretaries of Agriculture specifically announcing a timeline.
    *   Leaked reports or industry chatter about a forthcoming announcement in the Federal Register.
    *   A sudden, unscheduled trip by APHIS officials to Mexico for a final verification mission.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official report (from USDA or Mexican authorities) of a new NWS case in northern Mexico.
    *   Official statements from USDA/APHIS emphasizing the need for "continued vigilance" or "more time."
    *   Silence. The lack of any official communication by ~December 23 would be a strong signal that no action will be taken before the new year.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Reopen":** The resolution requires imports to be "permitted to resume." This could mean a press release, a notice in the Federal Register, or an internal directive. A political announcement could precede the actual regulatory change by a few days.
*   **"Christmas Surprise":** There is a small chance of a political decision to reopen the border as a sign of goodwill before the holidays, even if technical staff are not fully comfortable. This is a low-probability, high-impact scenario.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Our view of the epidemiological situation in Mexico is filtered through official channels. The ground truth could be better or worse than what is publicly known.
*   **Bureaucratic Inertia:** The default state for a bureaucracy is inaction. Overcoming the inertia to lift a major animal health suspension requires a significant activation energy that seems absent just before a major holiday.

**Final Research Summary:** While recent actions show progress in combating the screwworm outbreak, the combination of a previous failed reopening, the resulting institutional caution at USDA, and the extremely short, holiday-constrained timeline makes a formal reopening of cattle imports before 2026 highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate comes from the class of U.S. import suspensions for foreign animal diseases (FADs) of moderate severity, which typically last from 3 to 12 months. Given the current suspension has already lasted over 5 months, a conservative base rate for resolution within any given 1-month period is low, around 10-15%. For this analysis, we will use a prior probability of 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to past FAD suspensions in that it involves a pest that requires containment and verification before trade can resume.
- **Difference:** The failed reopening in July 2025 adds complexity, indicating a more cautious approach by the USDA. The holiday season further complicates the timeline, making a quick resolution less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Positive Sentiment from USDA Secretary (2025-11-04):** While positive, the non-committal language suggests no immediate resolution. Likelihood ratio is slightly above 1, indicating a small increase in probability.
- **New Sterile Fly Facility (2025-11-13):** This operational step is positive but its impact is not immediate. Likelihood ratio is slightly above 1, indicating a small increase in probability.
- **Failed Reopening (2025-07-09):** This event significantly decreases the probability of a quick resolution due to increased caution. Likelihood ratio is well below 1, indicating a large decrease in probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - Positive sentiment: Slight increase, negligible impact.
  - New facility: Slight increase, negligible impact.
  - Failed reopening: Large decrease, dominant impact.

Given the dominant negative impact of the failed reopening and the holiday season, the posterior probability should be revised significantly lower than the initial prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The analysis might underestimate the potential for a political decision to reopen the border as a goodwill gesture. However, this remains a low-probability scenario.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more optimistic forecast might consider the new facility's impact as more immediate, but this is unlikely given the timeline.
- **Tail Risks:** The "Christmas Surprise" scenario is a low-probability, high-impact event that should be considered but does not significantly alter the forecast.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the evidence and the Bayesian update, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is low. The failed reopening and holiday constraints heavily weigh against a quick resolution.

Final: 5%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for how likely the US is to reopen cattle imports from Mexico within the next ~2.5 weeks (from Dec 13, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026).

The most relevant reference classes:
- Previous NWS-related cattle import suspensions (the Nov 2024-Feb 2025 ban lasted ~3 months)
- The current ban has already lasted ~5 months (since July 9, 2025)
- Typical timeframes for resolving moderate-severity foreign animal disease import suspensions (3-12 months)
- Probability of major agricultural policy changes occurring within a specific 2.5-week window, especially during holiday season

Given these considerations, I'll start with a low prior probability. The current ban has already lasted longer than the previous one, suggesting a more complex situation. Additionally, the extremely short timeframe (2.5 weeks) during the holiday season makes rapid policy changes unlikely.

**Prior probability: 15%** (odds of 3:17)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Same pest (New World screwworm) causing the import suspension
- Same countries involved (US and Mexico)
- Similar economic pressures to resolve the situation (US feedlots need Mexican cattle)

**Key differences:**
- Failed reopening attempt in July 2025 - this creates heightened caution at USDA
- Current ban has already lasted longer than previous NWS ban (5+ months vs. 3 months)
- Resolution window falls during holiday season (Dec 13-31) when government operations slow
- New sterile fly facility in Tampico represents progress but likely insufficient time for impact

The failed July reopening is particularly significant as it suggests the situation was more severe than initially assessed and likely created institutional reluctance to move quickly.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Failed July reopening attempt**
- P(E|H): If imports will reopen before 2026, how likely would we see a failed reopening in July? Moderately unlikely (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If imports will NOT reopen before 2026, how likely would we see a failed reopening? Quite likely (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 2: USDA Secretary's statement on Nov 4 - "every day we get a little bit closer" but no timeline**
- P(E|H): If reopening will happen soon, this cautious but positive statement makes sense (~70%)
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't happen soon, this vague statement is also quite likely (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.17 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 3: New sterile fly facility opened in Tampico on Nov 13**
- P(E|H): If reopening will happen soon, establishing this facility is quite likely (~80%)
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't happen soon, this facility would still be established (~70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Holiday season timing (Dec 13-31)**
- P(E|H): If reopening will happen before Jan 1, how likely would it fall during holiday season? Low (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't happen before Jan 1, how likely would the final weeks include holidays? High (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22 (significantly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3:17 (15% probability)

Update on Evidence 1 (failed July reopening):
- Posterior odds = 3:17 × 0.375 = 1.125:17 ≈ 1:15.1
- Posterior probability ≈ 6.2%

Update on Evidence 2 (Secretary's statement):
- Posterior odds = 1:15.1 × 1.17 = 1:12.9
- Posterior probability ≈ 7.2%

Update on Evidence 3 (sterile fly facility):
- Posterior odds = 1:12.9 × 1.14 = 1:11.3
- Posterior probability ≈ 8.1%

Update on Evidence 4 (holiday season timing):
- Posterior odds = 1:11.3 × 0.22 = 1:51.4
- Posterior probability ≈ 1.9%

However, this seems excessively low. Let me reconsider the strength of my evidence weights.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

I may be overweighting the negative factors:
- The holiday season doesn't completely halt government operations
- The USDA Secretary's positive comments could signal more progress than I'm accounting for
- The sterile fly facility could be having faster effects than I estimated
- There could be political pressure to resolve this before year-end for economic reasons

On the other hand, I may be underweighting:
- The bureaucratic processes required for reopening typically take weeks to months
- The failed July reopening created a very high bar for proof of control
- No specific timeline has been mentioned by officials as of November

Alternative scenario: The US could announce a conditional or partial reopening with enhanced inspection requirements as a compromise solution before year-end.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability upward from the mechanistic calculation, but still maintain a low overall probability given the short timeframe and holiday season.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential biases, I believe there is approximately a 10% chance that the US will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before January 1, 2026. The primary factors driving this low probability are the short timeframe, holiday season timing, and the cautious approach likely being taken following the failed July reopening attempt.

Final: 10%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the lifting of a major international agricultural trade ban within a very specific and short timeframe (December 13 to December 31, 2025, an 18-day window).

A suitable reference class is the frequency of major U.S. regulatory policy changes of this nature within a given three-week period. Such actions require significant data review, risk assessment, and formal publication, making them infrequent in any short timeframe. Furthermore, this specific window falls over the Christmas and New Year holidays, a period when government operations slow considerably. The base rate for a non-emergency, complex policy reversal during this holiday period is exceptionally low.

Let's estimate a base rate. If a moderate ban lasts an average of 6 months (~180 days), there are ten 18-day periods. The chance of resolution falling in any specific one is 10%. However, the holiday effect likely cuts this probability by at least half.

Therefore, I will set a conservative prior probability P(H) of **5%**. This acknowledges that resolution is possible but is an infrequent event in such a short, holiday-constrained window. In odds, this is 5:95, or 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from a standard "ban-to-resolution" base case in one critical way:

*   **The Failed Reopening:** In July 2025, the USDA lifted the ban only to reimpose it two days later. This "once bitten, twice shy" dynamic is the single most important factor. It dramatically increases the level of caution within the USDA and raises the burden of proof required from Mexico. Any decision to reopen now will be subject to intense scrutiny to avoid a second embarrassing and potentially dangerous failure. This makes the current situation much less likely to resolve quickly compared to a standard case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that the U.S. reopens cattle imports from Mexico before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: The failed reopening in July 2025.**
    *   P(E | H): The probability of a past failed reopening, given a successful one is imminent, is low. It suggests the new decision is being made in a high-stakes, risk-averse environment.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of a past failed reopening, given the ban continues, is high. It is the primary reason for the continued ban and the cautious approach.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The holiday calendar (Dec 13 - Dec 31).**
    *   P(E | H): A resolution occurring during the holidays is possible but less likely than during a normal operational period due to staff leave and reduced bureaucratic tempo.
    *   P(E | ~H): A ban continuing through the holidays is the default, high-probability outcome. Inaction is easy during this period.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Positive but non-committal statements from USDA Secretary (Nov 4) and opening of a new sterile fly facility (Nov 13).**
    *   P(E | H): These signs of progress are consistent with an eventual reopening.
    *   P(E | ~H): These actions are also consistent with a long-term strategy where the ban remains in place for several more months while these new measures take effect. The impact of the new facility is not immediate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Slightly greater than 1. This evidence provides a small **increase** in probability, but its effect is weak because it doesn't point to an *imminent* resolution within the specific 18-day window.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior odds and update with the most significant piece of evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:19 (5% probability).
*   **Update with Evidence 1 (Failed Reopening):** This is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting extreme caution. I'll estimate its likelihood ratio as 1/5, meaning a past failure makes an imminent reopening five times less likely.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1:19) × (1/5) = 1:95.
    *   This updates the probability to 1 / (1 + 95) ≈ 1%.

The other pieces of evidence (holiday slowdown vs. weak positive news) roughly cancel each other out, leaving the probability in this very low range. The core of the forecast rests on the institutional caution created by the July failure.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest counterargument is a politically motivated "Christmas surprise." The economic pressure from both U.S. cattle feeders and Mexican ranchers is substantial. The White House or USDA leadership might decide to push for a pre-holiday announcement as a sign of goodwill and economic relief, potentially overriding the more cautious timeline of technical experts at APHIS. The positive statements from the Secretary could be seen as preparing the ground for such an announcement.

However, the political risk of a *second* failure would be catastrophic for the administration and the USDA. The risk of reintroducing an eradicated pest into the multi-billion dollar U.S. cattle industry is a far more powerful political and economic driver than the temporary pain of an import ban. Therefore, the incentive structure still heavily favors caution over speed.

While a political surprise is a non-zero risk, it remains a tail risk. My posterior probability of ~1% might be slightly too low as it doesn't fully capture this possibility. I will adjust my final forecast upward slightly to account for this scenario.

### Final Forecast
The combination of an extremely short, holiday-constrained timeline and, most importantly, the immense institutional caution resulting from the failed reopening in July makes a resolution before 2026 highly improbable. The default bureaucratic path is to wait for overwhelming evidence of pest eradication, a process that takes months, not days. While a politically motivated surprise is possible, it is a significant outlier scenario.

Final: 3%
