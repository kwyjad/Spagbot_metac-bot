### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Appropriations in Divided Government.** In the last 20 years (approx. 10 Congresses), divided government has been the norm. In these years, completing all 12 appropriations bills on time (by Oct 1) is rare. It is common for bills to be passed in December, often bundled into an omnibus or "minibus" packages, driven by the deadline of an expiring Continuing Resolution (CR) or the end of the legislative session. The base rate for the number of bills passed by Jan 1 is highly variable, but often clusters near 0 or 12 (all-or-nothing omnibus).
-   **Reference Class 2: Appropriations Cycles with a CR Extending Past January 1.** A more specific reference class is fiscal years where a CR is passed before December that extends funding into the next calendar year. In these instances, the primary driver for legislative action in December—a funding cliff—is removed. The base rate of *additional* regular appropriations bills passed between the CR enactment and Dec 31 is extremely low, likely **0**. Congress typically uses the time to recess and regroup for negotiations in January.
-   **Reference Class 3: Post-Shutdown Legislative Sessions.** Following a significant government shutdown, legislative productivity on contentious issues often decreases in the immediate aftermath due to political exhaustion and hardened partisan positions. The focus shifts to funding the government via a CR and passing only the most essential or least controversial legislation to end the standoff. The base rate for passing complex, non-essential bills in the weeks following a shutdown is very low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-08] **Shutdown ends; CR enacted until Jan 30, 2026.** ↓↓↓ — This is the most significant development. It removes all deadline pressure to pass the remaining 9 bills before Dec 31, making further action in 2025 highly improbable.
-   [2025-11-08] **Three FY26 bills enacted (Ag, Leg Branch, MilCon-VA).** (sets floor at 3) — This action established the current baseline of 3 enacted bills. It also signals that the least controversial bills are now completed, leaving the most difficult ones for future negotiation.
-   [2025-10-01] **FY2026 begins; government shuts down.** (context) — The month-long shutdown indicates extreme partisan friction over spending levels and policy riders, suggesting the remaining 9 bills will be very difficult to negotiate.
-   [2025-08-01] **House passes H.R.3944, a "minibus" of 3 bills.** (context) — The early, bipartisan progress on the three now-enacted bills confirms their non-controversial nature compared to the remaining nine.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Deadline Pressure (Large):** The expiration of a CR is the single most powerful driver for appropriations action. The current CR expires on January 30, 2026, placing the deadline pressure well into the new year and removing any urgency for action in December.
-   **Congressional Calendar/Holiday Recess (Large):** It is a powerful institutional norm for Congress to be in recess during the last 1-2 weeks of December. Overcoming this inertia requires a crisis or an absolute deadline, neither of which is present.
-   **Partisan Polarization (Large):** The preceding month-long shutdown demonstrates a high degree of conflict over the remaining, more contentious bills (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security). This animosity makes a quick, good-faith negotiation on complex bills before year-end extremely unlikely.
-   **"Easy" Bills vs. "Hard" Bills (Moderate):** The three enacted bills are consistently among the least controversial and easiest to pass. Their completion means that only the bills with major partisan disagreements remain, requiring significant time and political capital to resolve.
-   **Leadership Priorities (Moderate):** With funding secured until late January, congressional leadership has no incentive to force members to stay in Washington to negotiate over the holidays. Their focus will be on messaging and preparing for the January negotiating battle.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **CR Extends Past New Year:** Unlike many historical instances where a December omnibus is forced by a pre-Christmas CR expiration, the current CR provides a 45-day cushion into 2026. This fundamentally alters the typical year-end dynamic.
-   **Three Bills Already Enacted:** The question is not starting from zero. The floor is set at 3. This is unusual, as typically bills are passed in larger, all-or-nothing packages at the deadline. This "peeling off" of the easy bills leaves a more difficult legislative task.
-   **Post-Shutdown Environment:** The immediate aftermath of a long, bitter shutdown is not conducive to productive compromise. Trust between parties is low, and political positions have hardened, making the remaining negotiations more difficult than in a typical appropriations cycle.
-   **Known State of Play:** We are not speculating about which bills are easy or hard. The deal to end the shutdown explicitly separated the three easiest bills, confirming the remaining nine are the locus of conflict.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior distribution sharply peaked at **3**, reflecting the known enacted bills. The "equivalent n" should be very high, as this is a factual baseline. The uncertainty is only on the upside (i.e., P(X>3)).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓↓↓) CR extends to Jan 30, 2026: Strong evidence against any additional bills passing in December.
    -   (↓↓) Impending holiday recess: Strong institutional evidence against legislative action.
    -   (↓) High partisan friction from recent shutdown: Moderate evidence that compromises on the remaining hard bills are not imminent.
    -   (↓) Least controversial bills already passed: Moderate evidence that the remaining legislative lift is heavy and time-consuming.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. The posterior distribution should be even more tightly concentrated at exactly 3. The probability of any additional bills being enacted before Jan 1, 2026, should be updated to be extremely low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (signals that more than 3 bills might pass):**
    -   House Speaker or Senate Majority Leader unexpectedly cancels or shortens the holiday recess.
    -   Sudden, public announcement of a bipartisan "breakthrough" on one of the more contentious bills (e.g., Defense or Financial Services).
    -   Leadership begins whipping votes for another "minibus" package for passage before Christmas.
    -   A major external crisis (e.g., national security event, economic shock) requires immediate supplemental funding that gets attached to a regular appropriations bill.

-   **DOWN indicators (signals confirming the number will be 3):**
    -   Congressional leaders formally announce the legislative calendar for the remainder of the year, showing a recess beginning mid-December.
    -   Official statements from leadership confirming that appropriations negotiations will resume "in the new year."
    -   Rank-and-file members begin leaving Washington D.C. for the holidays.
    -   No committee or floor activity is scheduled for the remaining 9 appropriations bills.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution criteria are tied to the CRS appropriations table. Ensure any bill passed is a "full-year regular appropriation" and not another CR or supplemental bill.
-   **Black Swan Event:** An unforeseen national or international crisis could force Congress back into session to pass emergency legislation, to which a regular appropriations bill could theoretically be attached. This is a very low-probability event.
-   **"Surprise" Bipartisan Deal:** There is a small, non-zero chance that one of the less-controversial remaining bills (e.g., Energy & Water) is closer to completion than publicly known and could be passed by unanimous consent, though this is highly unlikely given the context.
-   **Political Posturing vs. Reality:** Public statements from party leaders about "working around the clock" should be viewed with skepticism; the legislative calendar and member travel schedules are more reliable indicators of intent.

**Final Research Summary:** Three of the twelve bills are already law. With a continuing resolution funding the government until January 30, 2026, and Congress set to depart for the holidays, there is no deadline pressure or political incentive to negotiate and pass any of the nine remaining, more contentious bills before the new year.

To forecast the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Appropriations in Divided Government. Historically, the number of bills passed by Jan 1 is often 0 or 12, with a tendency towards 0 when a CR extends past the year-end.
   - **Reference Class 2:** Appropriations Cycles with a CR Extending Past January 1. The base rate for additional bills passed in December is extremely low, likely 0.
   - **Reference Class 3:** Post-Shutdown Legislative Sessions. The base rate for passing complex bills post-shutdown is very low.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the current CR extends to Jan 30, 2026, and the shutdown context, the base rate is sharply peaked at 3 (the already enacted bills).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with past instances where a CR extends past the year-end, reducing the likelihood of additional bills.
   - **Differences:** The shutdown and the passage of three bills set a floor at 3, which is unusual but aligns with the base rate of no further bills.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR Extends to Jan 30, 2026:** Strong evidence against additional bills passing in December.
   - **Holiday Recess:** Strong institutional evidence against legislative action.
   - **Partisan Friction:** Moderate evidence against imminent compromises.
   - **Least Controversial Bills Passed:** Moderate evidence that remaining bills are contentious.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Concentrated at 3.
   - **Likelihoods:** Reinforce the prior, with strong evidence against additional bills.
   - **Posterior:** Even more tightly concentrated at 3, with a very low probability of additional bills.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider tail risks like a national crisis forcing additional bills.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A surprise bipartisan deal could lead to one more bill, but this is highly unlikely.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the evidence, maintain a tight distribution around 3.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - The forecast reflects a high probability of no additional bills, with slight consideration for unforeseen events.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 3  
P80: 3  
P90: 4

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use a prior based on the known facts about FY 2026 appropriations:
- 3 bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA)
- 9 bills remain outstanding
- A continuing resolution is in place until January 30, 2026

This gives us a starting point of exactly 3 bills enacted, with uncertainty only about whether any additional bills will be enacted before January 1, 2026.

The mean of this prior is 3, and the variance is very small since we have certainty about the floor.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases:**
- We have divided government, which typically leads to appropriations difficulties
- A continuing resolution is in place that extends past January 1
- We're in a post-shutdown environment

**Key differences:**
- The CR extends well into 2026 (January 30), removing deadline pressure for December action
- Three "easy" bills have already been enacted, leaving only the more contentious ones
- The recent shutdown was exceptionally long, suggesting deeper partisan divisions
- We have very specific knowledge about the current state (3 bills enacted, 9 remaining)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for additional bills being enacted before 2026:**
- Congress sometimes passes bills before holiday recess to clear the decks (weak evidence, ~1.1x likelihood)
- Some of the remaining 9 bills may be closer to agreement than publicly known (speculative, ~1.05x likelihood)

**Evidence against additional bills being enacted before 2026:**
- CR extends to January 30, 2026, removing deadline pressure (strong evidence, ~0.1x likelihood)
- Holiday recess is a powerful institutional norm (strong evidence, ~0.2x likelihood)
- The most contentious bills remain, requiring difficult negotiations (moderate evidence, ~0.5x likelihood)
- Post-shutdown environment reduces appetite for immediate complex negotiations (moderate evidence, ~0.6x likelihood)
- Today is already December 13, 2025, leaving limited legislative days (strong evidence, ~0.3x likelihood)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered at 3 bills enacted, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update 1: CR extends to January 30, 2026**
- Prior: P(exactly 3) = ~0.85, P(>3) = ~0.15
- Likelihood ratio: P(CR to Jan 30 | >3 bills) / P(CR to Jan 30 | exactly 3 bills) ≈ 0.1
- Posterior: P(exactly 3) increases significantly, P(>3) decreases significantly

**Update 2: Limited legislative days remaining in 2025**
- Prior: Updated distribution from above
- Likelihood ratio: P(Dec 13 date | >3 bills) / P(Dec 13 date | exactly 3 bills) ≈ 0.3
- Posterior: P(exactly 3) increases further, P(>3) decreases further

After these updates, the posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at exactly 3 bills, with only a small probability of additional bills being enacted.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a surprise bipartisan agreement on one of the less contentious remaining bills
- An external crisis could force Congress back into session and lead to unexpected appropriations action
- Political incentives to show productivity before year-end might be stronger than I've estimated

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be to place more weight on 4-5 bills being enacted, arguing that Congress might want to show progress on appropriations before the new year. However, this seems unlikely given:
1. The lack of deadline pressure with the CR extending to January 30
2. The holiday recess tradition
3. The fact that the easiest bills have already been enacted
4. The current date (December 13) leaving little time for complex negotiations

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of FY2026 appropriations bills enacted by the end of the calendar year 2025. A floor of 3 bills has already been established. The question is about how many *additional* bills (out of the remaining 9) will be passed in the last few weeks of December.

The most appropriate reference class is **"Congressional appropriations activity in December when a continuing resolution (CR) is already in place that funds the government into the next calendar year."**

In this specific scenario, the primary driver for legislative action—an impending government funding deadline—is absent. Historically, when Congress has provided itself with a funding cushion that extends past the holidays, it almost invariably uses the time to recess and postpones further negotiations. Therefore, the base rate for *additional* regular appropriations bills passed under these conditions is extremely low, with a median and mode of **0**.

This implies a prior distribution for the total number of bills that is very strongly peaked at the current number of 3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns almost perfectly with the chosen reference class, but with additional factors that strengthen the base case conclusion.

*   **Similarities:** A CR is in place until January 30, 2026, removing all deadline pressure for action in December. The congressional holiday recess is imminent, a powerful institutional norm that discourages legislative work.
*   **Differences (that reinforce the base rate):**
    1.  **Post-Shutdown Environment:** The session follows a long and contentious government shutdown. This indicates that partisan friction is exceptionally high, and the political capital for complex compromises has been exhausted. This makes quick agreement on the remaining, more difficult bills even less likely than in a typical year.
    2.  **"Easy" Bills Already Passed:** The three enacted bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are consistently among the least controversial. Their passage as part of the shutdown-ending deal explicitly separated them from the nine more contentious bills. This means the remaining legislative lift is significantly heavier, requiring time and negotiation that are unavailable in December.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Each major piece of evidence points strongly toward zero additional bills being passed.

*   **Evidence: CR extends to Jan 30, 2026.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It removes the primary mechanism (a funding cliff) that forces Congress to act. This makes the outcome of "0 additional bills" (total of 3) vastly more likely than any other outcome. The likelihood of this evidence, given that Congress plans to pass more bills in December, is near zero.
*   **Evidence: Impending Holiday Recess.** It is December 13. The institutional inertia to adjourn for the holidays is immense. Forcing members to stay and negotiate complex spending bills without a deadline would be politically unpopular and practically difficult. This strongly favors an outcome of 3.
*   **Evidence: High Partisan Friction.** The recent month-long shutdown demonstrates deep disagreements over the remaining nine bills (which include contentious areas like Defense, Labor-HHS, and Homeland Security). This animosity makes a sudden, good-faith compromise in the next two weeks extremely improbable. This evidence pushes the forecast down, reinforcing the "3" outcome.

The combined effect of this evidence is multiplicative, making the probability of passing any additional bills vanishingly small.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution with almost all its mass on the value 3, based on the fact that 3 bills are already enacted and the base rate for *additional* bills in this situation is 0. Let's model this as P(X=3) ≈ 95%, P(X>3) ≈ 5%.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (CR to Jan 30, recess, post-shutdown friction) is highly consistent with X=3 and highly inconsistent with X>3. The likelihood ratio P(Evidence | X=3) / P(Evidence | X>3) is very large (e.g., >50:1).
*   **Update:**
    *   Posterior Odds(X>3 vs X=3) = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (0.05 / 0.95) × (1 / 50) ≈ 0.053 × 0.02 ≈ 0.001
    *   This corresponds to a posterior probability P(X>3) of approximately 0.1%.
*   **Posterior Distribution:** The posterior distribution is even more sharply concentrated at X=3 than the prior. The probability of the total being exactly 3 is now estimated at >99%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong. How could the number be greater than 3?

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: "Christmas Surprise" Minibus.** A bipartisan deal on one or two of the next-least-controversial bills (e.g., Energy & Water) is reached unexpectedly and passed quickly. *Rebuttal:* This is highly improbable. There is no political incentive for leadership to force this through before the holidays. The shutdown-ending deal was structured specifically to *postpone* these fights until January.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: External Crisis.** A major national security event could force Congress to pass an emergency supplemental bill, to which a regular appropriations bill is attached. *Rebuttal:* This is a low-probability "black swan" event. While possible, its probability of occurring and resulting in this specific legislative outcome in the next 18 days is extremely low.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Is a >99% confidence in "3" too high? The confluence of factors is exceptionally strong: no deadline, a major holiday, extreme partisan bitterness after a shutdown, and only the hardest work remaining. In the context of congressional procedure, this is as close to a certainty as one gets. The tiny probability assigned to X>3 accounts for the "black swan" risks. The forecast seems robust.

The percentiles should reflect this extreme certainty. Since the probability of the outcome being exactly 3 is well over 90%, all percentiles from P10 to P90 must be 3.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated at the value of 3. The probability of any additional bills being enacted before January 1, 2026, is exceedingly small, certainly less than 1%. Therefore, the 10th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th, and 90th percentiles of the distribution all fall on the value of 3.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3
