### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Iran-IAEA Access Disputes (2003-Present):** Iran has a long history of contentious interactions with the IAEA, characterized by periods of cooperation followed by obstruction. In these disputes, a complete reversal from a hardline, non-cooperation stance to a formal agreement on access within a one-month period is rare. Looking at ~10-12 major standoffs (e.g., Parchin, Fordow pre-JCPOA, undeclared sites), a rapid, positive resolution occurred perhaps 1-2 times, usually driven by a major diplomatic breakthrough (like the JCPOA negotiations). **This suggests a base rate for a "Yes" resolution in a short timeframe of 10-20%.**
2.  **Post-Attack Nuclear Inspections (Global):** Instances where a country's nuclear facilities are attacked by a foreign power are rare. Key examples include Israel's strike on Iraq's Osirak reactor (1981) and Syria's Al Kibar facility (2007). In both cases, the targeted nation did not subsequently grant immediate, voluntary access to the IAEA to inspect the damage and materials. Instead, they engaged in denial and obstruction. **This reference class suggests a base rate for "Yes" near 0%.**
3.  **Limitations:** The current situation is a hybrid and arguably unique. Unlike Osirak/Al Kibar, Iran's program was declared and under prior (though limited) safeguards. Unlike past diplomatic disputes, Iran's primary facilities have suffered a massive, overt military attack by the US and Israel, making national honor and strategic ambiguity paramount.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-09** Iran official accuses IAEA of a "biased and politicized approach." — ↓ — Hardens the public justification for non-cooperation, making a reversal before year-end less likely.
*   **2025-12-09** Report notes Iran-US deadlock, with Tehran demanding an end to "zero enrichment" policy. — ↓ — Links inspections to broader, intractable strategic issues that cannot be resolved in weeks.
*   **2025-12-02** Iranian spokesperson states parliamentary law will dictate IAEA relations. — ↓ — Cedes authority to a hardline body that voted to suspend cooperation, reducing the executive branch's flexibility for a quick deal.
*   **2025-10-20** Iran announces the September 9th deal with the IAEA is void, citing "snapback" sanctions. — ↓ — A major reversal. This demonstrates that even when a deal is possible, it is extremely fragile and contingent on external factors.
*   **2025-09-19** Iran withdraws its own resolution at the IAEA condemning the June attacks. — (neutral) — Initially seen as a de-escalatory step to facilitate diplomacy, but subsequent events proved it did not lead to lasting cooperation.
*   **2025-09-09** Iran and the IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections. — ↑ — The single most positive event, proving a path to "Yes" exists. However, its subsequent collapse is more significant.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Domestic Political Calculus (Regime Pride vs. Pragmatism):** After a direct US/Israeli military strike, the regime's primary concern is projecting strength and sovereignty. Allowing inspections could be framed internally as capitulation. This is the most significant driver, pushing strongly against an agreement. (Large)
2.  **International Pressure & Sanctions:** The activation of "snapback" sanctions creates a coercive environment. Historically, Iran sometimes responds to pressure with tactical concessions, but often with defiance. In this post-attack context, defiance is the more probable response. (Large)
3.  **Strategic Ambiguity:** The unknown status of the ~400kg of 60% enriched uranium is Iran's primary leverage. Is it destroyed, damaged, secure, or accessible? Allowing inspections would answer this question and surrender that leverage for little perceived gain. (Large)
4.  **Need for Technical Assessment:** The facilities are severely damaged. Iran may lack the specialized equipment to safely assess and secure the remaining nuclear material. A desire for IAEA technical assistance could be a motivator for a deal, but this would be a quiet, background factor unlikely to override political drivers. (Small)
5.  **Back-channel Diplomacy (e.g., via Oman):** The only plausible path to a "Yes" is a secret, high-level negotiation that provides Iran with a significant concession (e.g., a sanctions waiver, security guarantee) in exchange for inspections. The likelihood of such a deal being struck and announced in under three weeks is very low. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Post-Military Attack Context:** Unlike typical diplomatic standoffs, this is happening in the immediate aftermath of a devastating, public military attack on Iran's sovereign territory. National honor is a far more potent factor than in prior disputes.
*   **Physical State of Facilities:** The sites are not just operational facilities with access restrictions; they are damaged, potentially contaminated rubble piles. This introduces immense logistical and safety complexities to any potential inspection, complicating any agreement.
*   **Known High-Value Material:** The IAEA has a credible estimate of a large stockpile of 60% enriched uranium now being unaccounted for. The stakes are higher than in disputes over potential undeclared activities, increasing pressure on all sides.
*   **Hardline Parliamentary Control:** The explicit statement that the hardline-dominated parliament's law governs IAEA interaction is a significant constraint, formally limiting the flexibility of more pragmatic elements within the government who might have negotiated the now-defunct September deal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the base rate from Iran-IAEA disputes (15%), as it reflects the actor's behavioral patterns, but acknowledge the post-attack context pushes it lower. (e.g., Prior: 15% with an equivalent n=20).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The October scrapping of the September inspection deal is powerful evidence that the path to cooperation has been tried and failed recently.
    *   (↓ Large) The early December statements from Iranian officials reaffirming a hardline, defiant stance based on parliamentary law and IAEA "bias."
    *   (↓ Moderate) The context of "snapback" sanctions creates an environment of mutual hostility, making a cooperative agreement less likely.
    *   (↑ Small) The fact a deal was reached in September at all shows that a faction within Iran is capable of and willing to make a deal, even if they were ultimately overruled.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, high-impact evidence is overwhelmingly negative, strongly reinforcing the dynamics suggested by the "post-attack" reference class. The posterior should move down significantly from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Reports of secret talks between US/Iranian officials in Oman or Geneva.
    *   A significant, public softening of rhetoric from a senior Iranian official (e.g., Foreign Minister).
    *   An emergency or unscheduled IAEA Board of Governors meeting is called.
    *   Statements from Russia or China indicating they are brokering a compromise.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any new hostile rhetoric from the Supreme Leader's office regarding the West or the IAEA.
    *   The Iranian parliament passing a new, more restrictive law concerning nuclear activities.
    *   Reports of Iranian personnel attempting to clear the sites without IAEA presence.
    *   US or Israeli officials making new threats or announcing further sanctions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Ambiguity:** The question resolves on an "announcement of an agreement." This could be a flimsy, non-binding statement of intent designed for diplomatic effect, rather than a detailed technical plan. A "Yes" is easier to achieve than actual inspections.
*   **"Surprise" De-escalation:** Iran could make a snap decision to appear reasonable on the world stage for some tactical purpose, such as influencing a different upcoming UN vote or improving relations with non-Western powers.
*   **Information Opacity:** The internal power dynamics of the Iranian regime are notoriously difficult to read. A decision could be made by the Supreme Leader that contradicts all recent public signaling.
*   **Short Timeline:** With only ~18 days remaining, and including the Christmas holiday period in the West, the window for complex diplomacy to yield a public announcement is exceptionally small. Inertia is a powerful force.

**Final Research Summary:**
The probability is very low. Iran's defiant posture following a direct military attack, combined with the recent collapse of a previous inspection deal and hardening rhetoric from Tehran, creates an environment where a new agreement before 2026 is highly improbable.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for Iran allowing IAEA inspections after a military attack is very low, near 0%, based on historical precedents where countries did not grant immediate access post-attack (e.g., Iraq's Osirak, Syria's Al Kibar). However, considering Iran's history of contentious but sometimes cooperative interactions with the IAEA, a slightly higher base rate of 10-20% is reasonable. For this analysis, I will use a base rate of 15%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves Iran's nuclear program and IAEA inspections, consistent with past disputes. The recent military attack adds a layer of complexity, similar to the Osirak and Al Kibar cases.
   - Differences: The attack's scale and the subsequent political dynamics are unique. Iran's program was declared and under some safeguards, unlike the undeclared programs in Iraq and Syria. The recent collapse of a September deal also adds a new dimension.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **October 20 Deal Scrapping:** Strong evidence against cooperation, as it shows fragility in agreements. Likelihood ratio significantly below 1.
   - **December 9 Statements:** Reinforces a hardline stance, decreasing the probability of cooperation. Likelihood ratio below 1.
   - **Snapback Sanctions:** Creates a hostile environment, reducing the likelihood of a deal. Likelihood ratio below 1.
   - **September 9 Deal:** Shows potential for cooperation, but its collapse limits its positive impact. Likelihood ratio slightly above 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 15% / 85% = 0.176
   - Considering the negative evidence (October 20, December 9, snapback sanctions), the likelihood ratios are significantly below 1, pushing the posterior odds lower.
   - Posterior odds ≈ 0.05 (after accounting for the strong negative evidence)
   - Posterior probability = 0.05 / (1 + 0.05) ≈ 4.76%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis might underestimate the potential for a surprise diplomatic breakthrough.
   - Alternative scenario: A secret deal brokered by a third party could lead to a sudden announcement.
   - Adjustments: Given the short timeline and current evidence, the probability remains low, but a slight increase to account for unforeseen diplomatic moves is reasonable.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unexpected developments, the final probability is adjusted slightly upward from the calculated posterior.

Final: 6%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for Iran allowing IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile in the specific context of post-military attack.

Looking at relevant reference classes:
- Iran-IAEA disputes (2003-present): In major standoffs, rapid positive resolution occurred in approximately 10-20% of cases
- Post-attack nuclear inspections globally: Countries whose nuclear facilities were attacked (Iraq's Osirak, Syria's Al Kibar) typically did not grant immediate IAEA access (near 0%)
- Recent Iran-IAEA cooperation patterns: The September 2025 deal followed by October reversal shows instability in agreements

Given the unique circumstances (major military attack on declared facilities), I'll weight the post-attack reference class more heavily, with some influence from Iran's historical IAEA relations.

**Prior probability: 8%** (odds of 1:11.5)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran has a pattern of resistance to IAEA inspections during periods of heightened tension
- The regime prioritizes sovereignty and national pride in nuclear matters
- Parliamentary opposition to IAEA cooperation exists, as in previous disputes

**Key differences:**
- The severity of the attack (B-2 bombers with 30,000-pound bunker-busters) is unprecedented
- The timeline is extremely compressed (only ~18 days remain until 2026)
- A deal was reached and then explicitly voided in recent months, showing unusual volatility
- The parliamentary vote to suspend cooperation was overwhelming and recent (June 25, 2025)
- The facilities are severely damaged, creating unique technical and safety challenges

These differences generally make cooperation less likely than the base rate suggests.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran scrapped the September 9 inspection deal on October 20**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, the probability they would have recently scrapped a deal is very low (~10%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, the probability they would have scrapped the deal is high (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Iranian officials recently cited "parliamentary law" and "IAEA bias" (December)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, the probability of such hardline rhetoric is low (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, such rhetoric is highly expected (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Iran has 400kg of 60% enriched uranium at stake**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, having this much material at stake is moderately consistent (~40%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, having this much material creates strong incentive for secrecy (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: The extremely short timeframe (18 days including holidays)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, the probability of completing negotiations in this timeframe is very low (~15%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this timeframe is irrelevant (~100%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.15
- This strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:11.5 (8% probability)

Update on Evidence 1 (scrapped deal):
- Posterior odds = 1:11.5 × 0.11 = 1:104.5
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+104.5) ≈ 0.95%

Update on Evidence 2 (hardline rhetoric):
- Posterior odds = 1:104.5 × 0.21 = 1:497.6
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+497.6) ≈ 0.2%

Update on Evidence 3 (uranium stockpile):
- Posterior odds = 1:497.6 × 0.44 = 1:1130.9
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+1130.9) ≈ 0.09%

Update on Evidence 4 (timeframe):
- Posterior odds = 1:1130.9 × 0.15 = 1:7539.3
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+7539.3) ≈ 0.01%

This mechanical calculation produces an extremely low probability. However, I need to be cautious about overconfidence and consider alternative scenarios.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

The mechanical Bayesian update produced a probability near 0%, which seems too extreme. Let me consider alternative scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Secret deal already in progress**
There could be back-channel negotiations occurring that aren't public. Iran might announce a surprise agreement for strategic reasons (e.g., to reduce pressure or gain concessions elsewhere).

**Scenario 2: Technical necessity**
Iran might lack the specialized equipment to safely assess damaged nuclear material and could reluctantly accept IAEA assistance for safety reasons.

**Scenario 3: Limited inspection agreement**
Iran might agree to a very limited, face-saving inspection format that allows them to claim they haven't capitulated while technically meeting the resolution criteria.

**Scenario 4: External pressure from Russia/China**
Iran's allies might pressure them to allow inspections to reduce tensions and prevent further escalation.

These scenarios suggest the probability should be higher than the mechanical calculation. Given the extreme uncertainty in international relations and the opacity of Iranian decision-making, I should avoid excessive confidence in a near-zero probability.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering both the evidence and alternative scenarios, I believe the probability is very low but not near-zero. The mechanical Bayesian update was too extreme.

The most compelling factors are:
1. The recent explicit rejection of the September deal
2. The hardline statements from December 2025
3. The extremely short timeframe remaining
4. The post-attack context making cooperation politically difficult

However, I must account for the inherent unpredictability of international relations and the possibility of unknown diplomatic initiatives.

Final: 3%

Answering the question: **Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?**

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is how nations behave regarding nuclear inspections immediately following a military attack on their nuclear facilities. The key historical examples are Israel's strikes on Iraq's Osirak reactor (1981) and Syria's Al Kibar facility (2007). In both cases, the targeted nation engaged in denial and obstruction, not cooperation with the IAEA. This reference class suggests a base rate for "Yes" that is very close to 0%.

A secondary, less specific reference class is Iran's general history of disputes with the IAEA. This history is characterized by long periods of non-cooperation, punctuated by occasional agreements, usually after protracted negotiations. A rapid resolution within weeks is rare, suggesting a base rate of perhaps 10-20%.

Given the current situation is defined by the military attack, the first reference class is more appropriate. However, unlike Iraq and Syria's clandestine programs, Iran's program was declared and had a long-standing (though fraught) relationship with the IAEA. This provides established channels for communication that did not exist in the other cases. Therefore, I will set a prior slightly above the near-0% suggested by the primary reference class to account for this difference.

**Initial Prior: 5%** (or 1-in-20 odds). This reflects an event that is highly unlikely but not completely impossible.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The core dynamic is a nation responding to a perceived violation of sovereignty. The domestic political pressure on the Iranian regime to project strength and defiance is immense, mirroring the likely calculus in post-strike Iraq and Syria. Allowing inspections could easily be framed internally as capitulation.

**Differences:**
*   **Pre-existing Safeguards Relationship:** Iran has a long, complex history with the IAEA. This means diplomatic channels and frameworks for negotiation exist, which makes a deal more plausible than starting from scratch.
*   **Known Material at Risk:** The IAEA has a credible estimate of a large stockpile of 60% enriched uranium. This raises the stakes for the international community, increasing pressure, but it also gives Iran significant leverage through strategic ambiguity about the material's status.
*   **Technical Need:** The facilities are destroyed. Iran may lack the capability to safely assess and secure the remaining nuclear material, potentially creating a pragmatic (though likely secondary) motive for seeking IAEA technical assistance.

These differences slightly increase the chance of an agreement compared to the base case, justifying a prior above absolute zero.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key recent developments provided in the report.

*   **Evidence 1: Iran voids the September 9th inspection deal (October 20).** This is strong evidence against a new deal. The fact that a prior agreement, made in a less-pressurized environment, collapsed demonstrates the extreme fragility of any such arrangement. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is much less than 1. This evidence significantly decreases the probability.
*   **Evidence 2: Hardline rhetoric in early December.** Statements accusing the IAEA of bias (Dec 9) and deferring to the hardline parliament's law (Dec 2) are direct signals against cooperation. One does not typically insult and disempower negotiators right before signing a deal with them. This is very strong evidence against a "Yes" resolution. The likelihood ratio is much less than 1.
*   **Evidence 3: The short timeline.** There are only 18 days left until the deadline, a period that includes the Christmas holidays in the West, slowing down diplomacy. Reversing the current hostile trajectory and finalizing a complex technical agreement in this window is extremely unlikely. Inertia strongly favors the status quo (no deal). The likelihood ratio is much less than 1.
*   **Counter-Evidence: A deal was reached in September.** This is the only piece of evidence suggesting a "Yes" is possible. It proves that a faction within Iran is capable of and was recently willing to make a deal. However, the subsequent collapse of that deal is a more powerful and more recent piece of evidence, indicating that the anti-deal faction is dominant.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a **prior of 5% (1-in-20 odds)**, I will update based on the evidence.

The collapse of the September deal is a major blow. It suggests the initial conditions for cooperation are not being met. This might cut the odds by a factor of 4 or 5 (e.g., from 1:19 to 1:99), bringing the probability down to ~1%.

The subsequent hardening of rhetoric in December further confirms this negative trajectory. This new evidence reinforces the conclusion from the failed deal. This might halve the already low odds, bringing the probability to ~0.5%.

Finally, the severe time constraint acts as a strong practical barrier. Even if there were political will, the logistical and diplomatic hurdles to finalizing an agreement in 18 days are immense. This further reduces the probability.

The cumulative effect of the overwhelmingly negative evidence is a drastic reduction from the initial 5% prior. The posterior probability is now in the very low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I might be wrong if there is a secret back-channel negotiation that is about to bear fruit, with the public hardline rhetoric being a smokescreen for domestic audiences. Iran could also make a sudden "surprise" tactical concession to achieve an unrelated diplomatic goal. The resolution criteria only require an "announcement of an agreement," which could be a flimsy, non-binding statement of intent rather than a detailed plan, making it an easier step to take.

However, the political cost of any perceived capitulation after a direct military attack seems extremely high for the Iranian leadership. The hardline faction has been empowered, and the public statements have painted the regime into a corner. A reversal would require a major, unforeseen catalyst, such as a technical emergency at the damaged sites (e.g., risk of a radiological leak) that forces them to seek international help. While possible, this is a low-probability tail risk.

Considering these factors, a forecast of 1-3% seems appropriate. It correctly identifies the outcome as highly improbable but avoids the overconfidence of a sub-1% forecast by accounting for the opacity of the regime and the possibility of a sudden tactical shift. I will settle on 2%.

### Final Forecast
The final probability reflects a low prior based on historical precedents of post-attack inspections, which has been driven even lower by a consistent stream of recent and powerful negative evidence, including the collapse of a prior deal, hardening official rhetoric, and a very short timeline.

Final: 2%
