### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) under the Noboa Administration (Nov 2023 - present):** This is the most relevant reference class. In his first ~13 months, President Noboa has declared at least two major, multi-province SoEs: a nationwide (24 provinces) declaration in January 2024 for 60 days due to gang violence, and a targeted (16 provinces) declaration in October 2025 for 60 days due to protests. This suggests a high propensity for using this tool. A rough base rate is that on any given day, there is a ~25% chance of a significant, multi-province SoE being in effect ((60+60 days) / ~400 days in office). The probability of a *new* declaration within a specific 12-day window is lower, perhaps 5-10%.
2.  **SoEs in Ecuador (2021-present):** Broadening the class to include the presidency of Guillermo Lasso shows that SoEs are a common, though not constant, feature of Ecuadorian governance, frequently used to address prison violence and security crises. However, Noboa's declaration of an "internal armed conflict" and his explicit linking of social protest to organized crime represents a significant escalation in their justification and likely frequency. This class suggests a slightly lower base rate than Noboa's tenure alone.
3.  **SoEs related to Indigenous Protests (last 10 years):** Major protests led by indigenous groups, particularly CONAIE, have historically been a primary trigger for SoEs (e.g., 2019, 2022). These events are episodic, not constant. When they occur, they are highly likely to trigger SoEs in the central highland and Amazonian provinces. The base rate for such a protest-driven SoE being active on any given day is low (<10%), but conditional on a major protest mobilization, the probability approaches 1.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-05** The 60-day state of emergency, initiated in October over fuel subsidy protests, officially expires. The government confirms its conclusion but maintains a hardline security posture. → **(sets baseline to 0)** — Establishes the current number of provinces under SoE as zero.
*   **2025-12-09** CONAIE, the main indigenous federation, issues a statement demanding dialogue on fuel subsidies and threatens new "territorial mobilizations" if the government does not respond by year-end. ↑ **(moderate)** — Re-establishes the primary conflict driver and creates a soft deadline for government action, increasing tension.
*   **2025-12-11** Minor clashes are reported between student protesters and police in Quito (Pichincha province) following a march against economic policy. Several arrests are made. ↑ **(small)** — Demonstrates that underlying social tensions remain active and can spark unrest even without a major national mobilization.
*   **2025-10-07** The presidential convoy was attacked in Cañar province during the height of the October protests, an event Noboa framed as a violent attempt to destabilize his government. → **(context)** — Reinforces the president's mindset to view protests as direct, violent threats, lowering his threshold to declare an SoE in response to future unrest.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Escalation of Social Protest:** A decision by CONAIE or other major social movements to launch a national strike or large-scale mobilization over the fuel subsidy issue is the most direct path to a new, targeted SoE (10-16 provinces). **(large)**
2.  **Major Organized Crime Event:** A high-profile assassination, large-scale prison riot, or coordinated wave of violence by criminal gangs could trigger an immediate, and likely nationwide (24 provinces), SoE, similar to January 2024. **(large)**
3.  **Noboa's Security Doctrine:** The President's established strategy of using SoEs and the "internal armed conflict" framework as a primary tool of governance lowers the activation threshold for any security or social disturbance. **(moderate)**
4.  **Holiday Season Effect:** The period immediately preceding Christmas (Dec 13-25) typically sees a decrease in organized political activity. However, it could also make the government more sensitive to any disruption, potentially leading to a pre-emptive SoE to "guarantee peace" for the holidays. **(small, ambiguous direction)**
5.  **Constitutional Court Oversight:** The Constitutional Court must approve SoEs. While it has largely supported Noboa's security-based declarations, it could push back on repeated declarations for the same social protest issue, creating a minor check on the executive. **(small)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The 12-day forecast window is highly specific. The question is not about the general stability of Ecuador, but about the probability of a specific government action within this narrow timeframe.
*   **Post-SoE Cooldown Period:** We are in the immediate aftermath of a 60-day SoE for this exact issue. It is unusual to declare a new SoE for the same reason just days after the last one expired, without a significant new triggering event.
*   **Unresolved Core Grievance:** Unlike a security incident that can be "contained," the political dispute over fuel subsidies remains unresolved. The underlying cause of the October SoE persists, making a recurrence more likely than for a one-off event.
*   **Noboa's "War" Framing:** The administration's unique and persistent framing of social protests as being infiltrated or directed by transnational criminal organizations blurs the line between dissent and terrorism, justifying a military/emergency response to events that previous administrations might have treated as a purely political issue.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior should be heavily concentrated on 0 provinces, as the previous SoE just expired. A reasonable starting point could be a distribution reflecting an 80% belief in 0 provinces, with the remaining 20% spread across possibilities like 10, 16, or 24 provinces. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ large) The core fuel subsidy dispute remains unresolved, and protest leaders are actively threatening new mobilizations.
    *   (↑ moderate) President Noboa's established preference for using SoEs as a first resort for both crime and protest.
    *   (↓ moderate) The proximity to the Christmas holiday makes large-scale, coordinated protests less likely to be initiated *within this specific 12-day

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the Noboa administration's propensity to declare states of emergency (SoEs). In the past ~400 days, there have been two major SoEs: one nationwide and one covering 16 provinces. This suggests a high base rate for SoEs, but given the recent expiration of the October SoE, the immediate base rate for December 25 is lower.
   - Mean/median: 0 provinces (immediate post-SoE period), with a variance allowing for potential spikes due to unresolved issues.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The unresolved fuel subsidy issue and potential for renewed protests align with past triggers for SoEs.
   - Difference: The recent expiration of a SoE and the holiday season may reduce the likelihood of immediate re-declaration without a new trigger.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Unresolved fuel subsidy issue and threats of mobilization by CONAIE increase the likelihood of a new SoE (↑ large).
   - Noboa's tendency to use SoEs as a governance tool also increases likelihood (↑ moderate).
   - The holiday season may reduce the likelihood of large-scale protests (↓ moderate).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior heavily weighted towards 0 provinces, the evidence of unresolved issues and Noboa's governance style shifts the distribution slightly towards higher numbers.
   - Posterior mean shifts slightly upwards, but the variance remains high due to uncertainty about protest developments.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The forecast should account for the possibility of no new SoE due to the recent expiration and holiday season.
   - Alternative scenario: A major crime event could trigger a nationwide SoE, but this is less likely given the current focus on protests.
   - Adjustments: Ensure the forecast reflects the potential for both 0 and higher numbers, with a skew towards lower numbers due to the recent expiration.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes, with a higher probability of 0 provinces but accounting for potential increases due to unresolved issues.

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 1  
P60: 3  
P80: 8  
P90: 16

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Recent states of emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa (2023-2025)
- Noboa has declared at least two major SoEs in his first ~13 months:
  - January 2024: Nationwide (24 provinces) for 60 days due to gang violence
  - October 2025: 16 provinces for 60 days due to indigenous protests against fuel subsidy cuts

The most recent SoE expired around December 5, 2025, meaning we start from 0 provinces currently under SoE.

**Prior distribution**:
- Mean: ~4-5 provinces (weighted average considering ~25% of days under Noboa have had SoEs)
- Shape: Right-skewed with mass at 0, then smaller peaks at common declaration sizes (10, 16, or 24 provinces)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Same president (Noboa) with established pattern of using SoEs as a governance tool
- Same underlying political tension (fuel subsidies) that triggered the October 2025 SoE
- CONAIE (indigenous organization) remains the primary opposition force

**Key differences**:
- Very short time window (12 days from current date to Dec 25)
- We're in an immediate post-SoE period (expired ~Dec 5, 2025)
- Holiday season may reduce likelihood of major protests
- The recent SoE just expired, making an immediate renewal unusual without a major triggering event

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing toward higher values**:
- CONAIE has issued a statement threatening new "territorial mobilizations" if demands aren't met by year-end (+moderate)
- Minor clashes between students and police in Quito show tensions remain active (+small)
- The core fuel subsidy dispute remains unresolved (+moderate)
- Noboa's established pattern of framing protests as terrorism/organized crime lowers his threshold for declaring SoEs (+moderate)

**Evidence pushing toward lower values**:
- The proximity to Christmas makes large-scale coordinated protests less likely (-moderate)
- Constitutional Court oversight might limit repeated declarations for the same issue (-small)
- The recent expiration of a 60-day SoE makes an immediate renewal unusual without a major new trigger (-strong)
- No reports of major violence or organized crime incidents in the background materials (-moderate)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior heavily weighted toward 0 provinces (80% probability), with remaining 20% distributed across 10, 16, and 24 provinces.

**First update**: Considering the CONAIE threat and unresolved fuel subsidy dispute
- This increases probability of a new SoE, particularly in the 10-16 province range
- Shifts ~10% probability mass from 0 to positive values
- New distribution: ~70% at 0, ~30% across positive values

**Second update**: Considering the holiday season and recent SoE expiration
- These factors partially counteract the first update
- Shifts ~5% probability mass back to 0
- Posterior: ~75% at 0, ~25% across positive values (mostly at 10-16 provinces)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the likelihood of a major organized crime event that could trigger a nationwide SoE
- The background doesn't mention Noboa's current approval ratings or political pressures, which could affect his decision-making
- The holiday season could actually increase government sensitivity to disruption, potentially leading to a pre-emptive SoE

**Alternative scenario**: A major violent incident occurs in the next week, triggering a nationwide SoE (24 provinces). This has perhaps a 5-10% probability given Ecuador's security situation.

**Tail risk**: The assassination of the mayor of Arenillas mentioned in the sources could indicate escalating violence that might trigger security measures beyond what I've accounted for.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll provide my calibrated forecast:

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 16
P90: 24

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the state of affairs immediately following the expiration of a major State of Emergency (SoE) in Ecuador. The 60-day SoE related to fuel subsidy protests expired on December 5, 2025. In the absence of any new information, the default expectation is that the number of provinces under an SoE would remain at zero. Therefore, my prior distribution is very strongly peaked at 0. A reasonable starting point is to assign a high probability (e.g., 80-90%) to the outcome being 0, with the remaining probability distributed across potential new SoEs. This is not a "random day" base rate, but a specific "post-SoE cooldown period" base rate, where the status quo is heavily favored in the short term.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The situation is similar to a typical post-crisis period where a government allows emergency measures to lapse, signaling a return to normalcy. The upcoming Christmas holiday period also typically sees a reduction in major organized political action, reinforcing the likelihood of the status quo (0 provinces) holding.
*   **Differences:** The crucial difference is that the underlying cause of the previous SoE—the dispute over fuel subsidies—remains entirely unresolved. The indigenous federation CONAIE has explicitly threatened new mobilizations. Furthermore, President Noboa's administration has a documented low threshold for declaring SoEs, both for social protest and organized crime, and a tendency to frame protests as national security threats. These factors make a rapid return to an SoE more likely than in a typical "cooldown" period where the initial crisis has been resolved.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
1.  **CONAIE's Ultimatum (Dec 9):** CONAIE threatened new mobilizations if dialogue doesn't begin by "year-end." This is the strongest piece of evidence pushing the forecast *up* from 0. It establishes a clear and plausible trigger for a new SoE. However, the "year-end" timeline suggests action is more likely *after* December 25, which moderates the immediate impact. This evidence significantly increases the probability of a non-zero outcome, perhaps making it 2-3x more likely than the base case.
2.  **Holiday Season Timing:** The forecast date is Christmas Day. It is less likely for a major, nationwide protest movement to be initiated and gain momentum in the week leading up to Christmas. This evidence pushes the forecast *down* towards 0, as it makes the specific timing of a new crisis less likely within the short 12-day window. It acts as a counterweight to the CONAIE threat.
3.  **President Noboa's Doctrine:** The President's history of declaring a nationwide SoE for crime (Jan 2024) and his framing of the October 2025 protests as linked to cartels and terrorism shows a strong predisposition to use this tool. This lowers the threshold for a new declaration. A relatively small escalation, or even a pre-emptive move to "guarantee holiday security," is more plausible under this administration. This is a constant factor that keeps the probability of a non-zero outcome higher than it would be otherwise.
4.  **Background Risk of Crime:** Independent of protests, Ecuador faces an ongoing security crisis. A major gang-related event (e.g., a high-profile assassination, prison riot) could trigger a nationwide (24 province) SoE at any time. This creates a small but persistent probability for the maximum outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** My initial belief is heavily concentrated at 0 provinces, with P(0) ≈ 85% and P(>0) ≈ 15%.
*   **Update 1 (CONAIE threat):** This evidence is strong. It makes the >0 outcomes much more plausible. I will update my odds. Prior odds of P(>0)/P(0) are 15/85 ≈ 0.176. The threat makes a new SoE perhaps 2.5x as likely. New odds ≈ 0.176 * 2.5 = 0.44. This translates to a new P(>0) of 0.44 / 1.44 ≈ 30.5%. So, P(0) is now ~69.5%.
*   **Update 2 (Holiday Timing):** The short, pre-Christmas window makes it less likely that CONAIE's threat materializes *before* Dec 25. This reduces the likelihood of a protest-driven SoE *within this specific timeframe*. I'll apply a likelihood ratio of 0.7 to the odds of a protest-driven SoE. The overall odds of P(>0) are a mix of protest and crime risks. Let's adjust the overall odds down slightly. New odds ≈ 0.44 * 0.8 = 0.352. This translates to a final P(>0) of 0.352 / 1.352 ≈ 26%.
*   **Posterior Shape:** My final distribution has P(0) ≈ 74%. The remaining 26% is split between two main scenarios:
    *   A protest-driven SoE, similar to October's, covering 10-16 provinces. I assign this ~20% probability.
    *   A crime-driven nationwide SoE, similar to January's, covering 24 provinces. I assign this ~6% probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the assumption that the status quo will hold, with a 74% chance of 0 provinces. Could I be underestimating Noboa's willingness to act pre-emptively? He could use the CONAIE threat and the desire for a "peaceful Christmas" as justification for a new SoE declared around Dec 20. This would be a surprise, but it is within his established pattern of behavior. An alternative forecast might place the P(0) lower, perhaps at 60%, increasing the weight on a targeted SoE.

However, my current forecast already assigns a 1-in-4 chance of a new SoE being declared in just 12 days, which is quite high and accounts for this risk. The "year-end" language from CONAIE is a strong anchor suggesting any protest escalation is more likely in the final days of the year, after Christmas. Therefore, I will stick with my posterior distribution, which reflects a high chance of 0 but with a very significant tail risk.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is approximately 74% mass at 0, 20% mass distributed between 10 and 16, and 6% mass at 24. This leads to the following percentiles.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 10
P90: 16
