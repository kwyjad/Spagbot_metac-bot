### Reference class & base rates
1.  **MP Departures (Any Parliament):** In a typical 4-year Canadian parliament (338 MPs), there are roughly 15-25 mid-term departures (resignations, deaths, floor-crossings). This yields a base rate of approximately 0.3-0.5 departures per month across the entire House of Commons. For the ~0.5 month resolution window (Dec 13-31), this suggests a naive base rate of **15-25%** for at least one event. *Limitation: This class ignores the specific context of a new, unstable minority government.*
2.  **MP Departures (Minority Parliaments, first 6 months):** Minority governments are inherently less stable. Historically, the period immediately following a close election sees heightened political maneuvering. The rate of departures, particularly floor-crossings, is slightly elevated. A rough estimate might increase the monthly rate to 0.6-0.8 events, suggesting a base rate of **30-40%** for an event in our ~0.5 month window. *Limitation: Most minority governments are not one or two seats away from a majority, making this an imperfect comparison.*
3.  **Floor Crossings (Any Parliament):** Floor crossings are much rarer than resignations. Since 2000, there have been approximately 20 instances. This is a rate of about 0.8 per year, or ~0.07 per month. This reference class suggests a very low base rate of **~3-4%** for a floor-crossing in the given timeframe. *Limitation: This class is too narrow, as it excludes resignations, and it fails to capture the current "cascade" dynamic.*

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-11** Michael Ma crosses the floor from Conservative to Liberal. — ↑ — Demonstrates that the initial defections were not isolated incidents and that momentum for change exists. It brings the Liberals to just one seat shy of a majority, dramatically increasing the stakes.
*   **2025-11-07** Political analysis of the d'Entremont/Jeneroux departures is published. — ↑ — Media narrative solidifies around Conservative leadership turmoil and Liberal strategic opportunism, potentially encouraging other wavering MPs by signaling a credible path.
*   **2025-11-06** Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux resigns. — ↑ — Shows that floor-crossing is not the only exit path. The reported "consequences" from the party for considering a switch may push others to resign rather than defect.
*   **2025-11-05** Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont crosses the floor to the Liberals. — ↑ — This event broke the dam, establishing a precedent and making subsequent defections or resignations seem more plausible to other MPs.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Majority Incentive (Pull):** The Liberal Party is now just one MP away from a stable majority government. The incentive for them to offer significant inducements (e.g., cabinet post, parliamentary secretary role, future appointment) to a wavering MP is at its absolute peak. (Size: Large)
2.  **Conservative Leadership Discontent (Push):** The provided sources explicitly cite disagreement with Pierre Poilievre's leadership as the driver for defections. An upcoming leadership review creates a focal point for dissent; MPs who feel their political future is dim under the current leadership may choose to leave now. (Size: Large)
3.  **Momentum/Cascade Effect:** The three recent departures make a fourth psychologically easier. The "taboo" is broken, a path has been demonstrated, and a narrative of a party in crisis is established. This creates a self-reinforcing dynamic. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Party Discipline & Retaliation (Countervailing):** The Conservative Party leadership is now on high alert. They will be exerting immense pressure on their caucus to remain united, promising rewards for loyalty and threatening consequences for dissent (as seen with Jeneroux). This may dissuade some. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Holiday Recess Timing:** The House of Commons is scheduled to rise for the winter break around mid-December. This provides a window for an MP to make a move without facing their caucus colleagues immediately. Conversely, it could also be a time to de-escalate and delay decisions until the new year. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Majority:** Unlike typical minority parliaments, the government is on the precipice of a majority. The value of a single MP crossing the floor is extraordinarily high, fundamentally changing the cost-benefit analysis for both the Liberals (in making an offer) and a potential defector.
*   **Rapid Cascade of Departures:** The base rate assumes events are largely independent. Here, we have three departures from the same party in ~5 weeks. This suggests a correlated cause (leadership discontent) and a potential contagion effect, making the historical average a poor guide.
*   **New Leadership Dynamic:** The scenario involves a new Liberal Prime Minister (Mark Carney), who may not have established loyalties and can more freely offer roles. This contrasts with a Conservative leader (Poilievre) facing internal dissent ahead of a leadership review.
*   **Clear Ideological Schism:** The defections are framed around a specific ideological disagreement with the Conservative leader's direction, suggesting a cohort of "Red Tory" or moderate MPs may feel politically homeless and open to moving.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the minority government reference class (30-40%), but with low confidence (equivalent n≈4), as the situation's unique features limit the class's relevance.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The third departure (Ma) confirming a cascade, not a one-off.
    *   ↑ (Large): The government is now just one seat from a majority, maximizing incentives.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Explicit, public rationale for departures is leadership discontent, suggesting a systemic issue rather than idiosyncratic reasons.
    *   ↓ (Small): The very short remaining time window (~18 days) slightly reduces the opportunity for an event to occur.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests this situation is far outside the norm for the reference class. The posterior should be revised significantly upwards from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements of support for d'Entremont or Ma from other Conservative MPs.
    *   Unusually vague or non-committal statements from Conservative MPs when asked about their future.
    *   Rumors or media reports naming specific MPs as potential floor-crossers.
    *   A Conservative MP being stripped of critic duties or committee roles.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A well-attended, unified Conservative caucus meeting with a strong statement of loyalty to the leader.
    *   Key moderate Conservative MPs publicly and forcefully ruling out a departure.
    *   The Liberal Party signaling they are pausing efforts to court MPs to focus on the budget.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most important information—the private conversations and considerations of ~115 remaining Conservative MPs—is unknowable.
*   **Media Narrative vs. Reality:** The media may be overstating the extent of Conservative disunity to create a more compelling story. The "talks" with Jeneroux, for example, could be speculation.
*   **Resolution Window:** The deadline of Jan 1, 2026 is sharp. A deal could be struck in December but announced on January 2nd, which would resolve as "No" but reflect the same underlying dynamics.
*   **Broad Resolution Criteria:** A "Yes" could be triggered by a resignation for purely personal or health reasons, entirely unrelated to the political dynamics discussed. This adds a source of baseline noise to the forecast.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for an MP departure in any given month is low, but the current political context is exceptional. A cascade of recent departures, combined with the massive incentive of a one-seat-to-majority prize, creates a highly volatile environment where another event before year-end is very plausible.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for MP departures in minority parliaments within the first six months is estimated at 30-40%. This is chosen because minority governments are inherently less stable, and the current situation is a minority government just one seat away from a majority, which is a unique and high-stakes scenario.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically sees a higher rate of MP departures.
   - Differences: The proximity to a majority and recent defections create a heightened incentive for further departures, which is not typical in most minority governments.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Michael Ma's Defection**: This recent event suggests a cascade effect, increasing the likelihood of further defections. Likelihood ratio is high, as this is more likely if another defection is imminent.
   - **Conservative Leadership Discontent**: Public disagreements with leadership increase the probability of further departures. Likelihood ratio is moderate to high.
   - **Liberal Majority Incentive**: The incentive for the Liberals to secure a majority by enticing another MP is significant. Likelihood ratio is high.
   - **Party Discipline & Retaliation**: Conservative efforts to maintain unity may decrease the probability of further defections. Likelihood ratio is moderate but countervailing.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Start with a prior probability of 35% (midpoint of 30-40%).
   - The evidence of recent defections and leadership discontent significantly increases the probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (qualitatively high due to multiple reinforcing factors).
   - Posterior probability is adjusted upwards significantly from the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The cascade effect might be overstated, and media narratives could exaggerate disunity.
   - Alternative scenario: Conservative unity could hold, preventing further defections.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of no further defections due to strong party discipline and the short time window.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential countervailing factors, the probability of another MP defecting or resigning before 2026 is estimated at 65%.

Final: 65%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for an MP defection or resignation in the ~18-day window from December 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026.

The most appropriate reference class is MP departures (defections, resignations) in minority parliaments during periods of political instability. Looking at historical data:

- In typical 4-year parliaments, there are roughly 15-25 mid-term departures, yielding ~0.3-0.5 departures per month
- In minority parliaments, particularly after close elections, this rate increases to ~0.6-0.8 events per month
- For floor crossings specifically, the rate is much lower at ~0.07 per month

Given the ~0.5 month resolution window and the specific context of a minority government on the brink of majority status, I'll use the minority parliament reference class as my starting point.

**Prior probability: 35%** (representing a 0.7 monthly event rate × 0.5 months)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a minority parliament situation where political instability is common
- The government is actively seeking to secure additional support
- There are ideological divisions within opposition parties

**Key differences:**
- The Liberal government is just ONE seat away from a majority (171/338), creating unprecedented incentives
- There has already been a cascade of THREE departures from the Conservative Party in ~5 weeks
- The explicit reason for departures is ideological disagreement with Conservative leadership
- The timing coincides with holiday recess, which can be strategic for making political moves
- The stakes are extraordinarily high - one more defection fundamentally changes the power dynamics

These differences significantly increase the likelihood compared to the typical minority parliament situation.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Three recent Conservative departures in quick succession**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If another departure is imminent, we would expect to see exactly this pattern of cascading defections
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if no more departures occur, we could still see this initial pattern
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- Direction: Strongly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Liberals are one seat away from majority**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - The enormous incentive for Liberals to secure one more MP makes defection much more likely
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This situation could exist without causing another defection
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- Direction: Strongly increases probability

**Evidence 3: Explicit leadership discontent as stated reason**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If another departure is coming, it would likely be for the same systemic reason
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This could be true even if no more departures occur
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- Direction: Moderately increases probability

**Evidence 4: Short remaining time window (~18 days)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - A defection could still occur in this timeframe
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - The short window makes it easier for MPs to delay decisions until after New Year
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75
- Direction: Slightly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 35:65 (or 0.54:1)

First update (cascade of departures):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.54 × 3.0 = 1.62
- New probability: 1.62/(1+1.62) = 0.62 or 62%

Second update (one seat from majority):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1.62 × 2.4 = 3.89
- New probability: 3.89/(1+3.89) = 0.80 or 80%

Third update (leadership discontent):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 3.89 × 1.6 = 6.22
- New probability: 6.22/(1+6.22) = 0.86 or 86%

Fourth update (short time window):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 6.22 × 0.75 = 4.67
- New probability: 4.67/(1+4.67) = 0.82 or 82%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- I may be overweighting the "cascade effect" - just because three MPs left doesn't guarantee a fourth
- The Conservative Party is likely implementing extreme measures to prevent further defections
- The holiday period might make MPs reluctant to make major career decisions
- The most dissatisfied MPs may have already left, leaving a more loyal remainder
- Media reporting may exaggerate the extent of Conservative disunity

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Conservative leadership could offer significant concessions to wavering MPs
- MPs might delay decisions until after the holiday break
- The Liberal Party might focus on budget negotiations rather than courting MPs
- Personal/family considerations during holidays might outweigh political calculations

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should moderate my extremely high posterior probability. The cascade effect and proximity to majority are powerful factors, but the short timeframe and potential Conservative countermeasures are meaningful constraints.

I'll adjust my forecast downward from 82% to 70%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for MP departures in minority parliaments, the unique circumstances of this situation (cascade of defections, one-seat-from-majority incentive, explicit leadership discontent), and accounting for the short timeframe and potential overconfidence, I arrive at a final forecast of 70%.

Final: 70%

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is the rate of MP departures (resignations, deaths, floor-crossings) during Canadian minority parliaments, specifically in the turbulent period after an election. The research report provides a base rate for this: "In minority parliaments, the period immediately following a close election sees heightened political maneuvering... a rough estimate might increase the monthly rate to 0.6-0.8 events."

The resolution window is from December 13 to December 31, a period of 19 days, or approximately 0.62 months. Applying this to the monthly rate gives an expected number of events between 0.37 and 0.50. Using a Poisson approximation (P(k≥1) = 1 - e^-λ), this translates to a probability of 31-39%.

I will select the midpoint of this range, **35%**, as my initial prior probability P(H). This represents the chance of at least one MP departure in a ~19 day window during a typical, unstable minority government situation.

Prior Odds: 0.35 / (1 - 0.35) = 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.54 to 1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The current situation is a minority government, which is inherently less stable than a majority, aligning with the chosen reference class.

**Differences:** This situation is far from typical.
*   **Proximity to Majority:** The Liberal government is just **one seat** away from a majority. This is a critical difference. The value of a single MP crossing the floor is magnified immensely, creating an unprecedented incentive for the Liberals to make a very generous offer and for a wavering MP to accept.
*   **Cascade Effect:** The base rate assumes largely independent events. Here, we have a rapid cascade of three departures from the same party (Conservatives) in just over five weeks, all linked to a common cause (leadership discontent). This suggests a correlated, systemic issue, not random chance.

These differences suggest the base rate is a very conservative starting point and that a significant upward adjustment is required.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that another MP will defect or resign before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: The government is one seat shy of a majority following the December 11 defection of Michael Ma.**
    *   P(E1 | H): This is a very likely context for another departure. The massive incentive created by this situation is a primary causal driver for H to occur.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): It is possible for the government to be one seat away and for the opposition to successfully hold the line, but this is a state of acute instability. It is less likely for such a situation to remain static than for it to resolve.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence dramatically increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: A cascade of three MPs has already left the Conservative caucus, citing leadership discontent.**
    *   P(E2 | H): If a fourth MP is about to leave, it is very likely to be in the context of others having already done so for similar reasons. This evidence is highly consistent with H.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): It is less likely that a cascade driven by a systemic issue would abruptly stop, especially when the incentive for defection (Evidence 1) is at its peak.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This confirms a pattern and momentum, making another event more likely.

*   **Evidence 3: The short time window (19 days) includes the holiday recess.**
    *   This is a countervailing factor. While an MP could announce a departure to avoid facing caucus, the holidays may slow down negotiations and push a decision into the new year.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence slightly decreases the probability compared to a non-holiday period of the same length.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will perform a conceptual update.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** 35% (Odds: 0.54 to 1). This reflects a generally unstable minority government.
2.  **Incorporate the Acute Instability:** The combination of the cascade effect and the government being one seat from a majority makes this a crisis, not just a period of instability. This is the most important information. This evidence is strong enough to suggest the situation is several times more likely to produce a departure than the base case. A combined likelihood ratio of 3-4x for this evidence seems reasonable.
    *   *Updated Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio*
    *   *Updated Odds ≈ 0.54 × 3.5 = 1.89 to 1*
3.  **Convert to Probability:**
    *   *Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds)*
    *   *Probability ≈ 1.89 / 2.89 ≈ 65%*
4.  **Consider the Timing:** The short, holiday-interrupted window is a negative factor. I will make a small downward adjustment from this 65% estimate to account for it.
5.  **Consider the Broadness of Resolution:** The question resolves "Yes" for *any* MP resigning for *any* reason (e.g., health). This creates a "background noise" probability floor of around 20-25% for a departure of any kind in this timeframe. My forecast is driven by the specific political drama, but this floor provides additional confidence that the final number should not be low.

My updated posterior probability, after accounting for all factors, is significantly higher than the prior, reflecting a situation that is much more volatile than a typical minority government.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of a high probability could be wrong if I am overestimating the Conservative discontent and underestimating their party discipline. It's possible the three departures were the only truly disaffected MPs, and the party, now on high alert, has successfully "locked down" the remaining caucus. The threat of "consequences" could be a powerful deterrent. An alternative forecast of ~45% would reflect a belief that the countervailing forces (party discipline, short timeline) are strong enough to almost completely offset the powerful incentives for another departure.

However, I find this less plausible. The incentives for the Liberals are now at their absolute maximum. They only need to convince one more person, and they can likely offer a very significant reward. The momentum from three prior departures makes a fourth psychologically and politically easier. The fact that resignation is an option, not just defection, provides an "escape valve" for an MP under immense pressure, which still resolves the question as "Yes".

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate of ~35% is a weak anchor due to the exceptional circumstances. The evidence of a cascade of departures, combined with the government being only one seat from a majority, creates a powerful "push and pull" dynamic. This suggests a very high likelihood of another departure. While the short, holiday-filled time window is a constraint, the intense political pressure and momentum make another event more likely than not.

Final: 68%
