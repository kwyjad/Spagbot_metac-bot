### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Executive Actions Involving National Security/Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases where the President acts with arguable statutory authorization from Congress, the executive branch prevails in a majority of cases.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~65% probability the executive action is upheld in some form.
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from landmark cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (upholding executive action under IEEPA) and a general pattern of judicial restraint in foreign policy. This reflects the "Zone 1" of Justice Jackson's concurrence in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*.
    *   **Limitations:** This reference class may be too broad, as it includes traditional sanctions and military actions, which differ significantly from imposing broad, economy-wide tariffs.

2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on the "Major Questions Doctrine":** In recent years, the Court has increasingly invoked this doctrine to strike down executive actions that have vast economic and political significance, arguing that Congress must speak clearly to delegate such transformative power.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~70% probability the executive action is struck down.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on recent high-profile cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (climate regulations) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (vaccine mandate), where the Court's conservative majority has invalidated major agency actions not explicitly and clearly authorized by statute.
    *   **Limitations:** The doctrine is relatively new and its application to foreign affairs statutes like IEEPA is not well-established. The Court may be more hesitant to apply it where national security is invoked.

3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Expedited Review:** When the Court grants certiorari before judgment and sets an expedited schedule, it typically signals the issue's high importance and a desire for a swift, definitive resolution. A merits decision is highly likely.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~90% probability of a merits decision (i.e., not "Other ruling" or "No ruling").
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on the procedural history of major cases granted expedited review. The Court does not take these extraordinary steps lightly, and usually does so to resolve pressing national legal questions.
    *   **Limitations:** The resolution deadline of Dec 31, 2025, is extremely tight, even for an expedited case. A decision in January 2026 is common for cases argued in the fall term.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms lower court, ruling tariffs unlawful (7-4). ↓ — A major appellate court, en banc, found the tariffs illegal. The split vote shows dissent, but the majority is a strong signal against the government's position.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. ↑↓ — (↑ for a merits ruling vs. no ruling) Signals the Court sees the issue as urgent and worthy of a definitive answer. (↓ for "Tariffs lawful") Suggests the Court may want to quickly rein in a perceived executive overreach.
*   **2025-11-01** Brennan Center analysis published, arguing against the tariffs. ↓ — Highlights the core arguments against the tariffs (trade deficits are not an "emergency," IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs) that are likely to appeal to textualist and originalist justices.
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held at the Supreme Court. ↓↓ — Source material indicates arguments "suggested the court may rule against the president's authority." This is the most direct and recent evidence of the Justices' thinking and a very strong negative indicator for the "Tariffs lawful" outcome.
*   **2025-12-10** Goodwin Law analysis published, noting constitutional conflict. ↓ — Reinforces that the case pits broad statutory language (pro-executive) against core constitutional power allocation (Congress's power over tariffs), a conflict the current Court often resolves in favor of Congress.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming transformative power without explicit congressional delegation. Imposing tariffs on nearly all imports is a textbook "major question." (Large driver towards "Tariffs unlawful").
2.  **Textualism:** The text of IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate... importation" but does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties," which are forms of taxes. Textualist justices may find this omission dispositive, as the power to tax is Congress's core constitutional prerogative. (Large driver towards "Tariffs unlawful").
3.  **National Security Deference:** The government's primary argument rests on presidential authority in a declared national emergency. Some justices, particularly in matters of foreign policy, may be inclined to defer to the President's judgment regarding the nature of the threat and the necessary response. (Moderate driver towards "Tariffs lawful").
4.  **Statutory Interpretation of "Deal With":** The *V.O.S. Selections* court found the tariffs did not "deal with" the threat. The Supreme Court could adopt this narrower reasoning, potentially creating a split decision where some tariffs (e.g., trafficking) are deemed more directly related to the emergency than others (reciprocal/trade deficit). (Moderate driver towards "Mixed ruling").
5.  **Judicial Calendar & Complexity:** Writing a majority opinion, concurrences, and dissents on a case of this magnitude takes time. Despite the expedited schedule, the Court may not be able to issue a final ruling before the December 31 deadline. (Moderate driver towards "No 2025 ruling").
6.  **Severability/Distinction between Tariffs:** The Court is reviewing two distinct sets of tariffs: the "trafficking tariffs" (Mexico, Canada, China) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (global). The national emergency justification for the former is arguably stronger than for the latter (trade deficits). The Court could easily uphold one and strike down the other. (Moderate driver towards "Mixed ruling").

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** Unlike past IEEPA uses for targeted sanctions (e.g., on Iran, terrorist groups), this application imposes broad-based tariffs on the entire U.S. economy. This shifts the case from the "Foreign Affairs" reference class towards the "Major Questions" class.
*   **Dominance of Textualism and Originalism:** The current 6-3 conservative majority is more committed to textualist statutory interpretation and skepticism of executive power than past Courts. This weakens the historical "National Security Deference" base rate.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Declaring a trade deficit a "national emergency" under IEEPA is a novel and legally tenuous assertion. It stretches the statutory definition of an "unusual and extraordinary threat... from outside the United States" far beyond its traditional application.
*   **Consensus in Lower Courts:** Both the specialized Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit and a generalist D.C. District Court found the tariffs unlawful. While their reasoning differed, the uniform outcome against the government is a powerful signal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a blended prior from the reference classes, acknowledging the tension. A slight edge to the executive being overturned due to the nature of the action. E.g., Unlawful 40%, Lawful 30%, Mixed 15%, Other/No Ruling 15% (equivalent n=10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large) The current Court's established "major questions doctrine" jurisprudence is a poor fit for this expansive use of executive power.
    *   ↓ (Large) Reports from oral arguments strongly suggest skepticism from a majority of justices towards the government's position.
    *   ↓ (Moderate) Unanimous outcomes (though different reasoning) in the lower courts create a strong presumption against the government's case.
    *   ↑ (Moderate, for "Mixed ruling") The existence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provides a clear off-ramp for a split decision.
    *   ↑ (Moderate, for "No 2025 ruling") The extremely tight deadline makes a slip into January 2026 a non-trivial possibility, despite the expedited schedule.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the posterior away from "Tariffs lawful." The probability mass should shift primarily to "Tariffs unlawful," with significant increases also for "Mixed ruling" and "No 2025 ruling." "Tariffs lawful" should be viewed as a tail risk.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for "Tariffs lawful"):**
    *   Unusual public statements by administration officials expressing high confidence post-argument.
    *   Commentary from highly respected conservative legal scholars arguing the textualist/originalist case *for* the tariffs.
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting the liberal justices are writing the majority opinion (implying a conservative majority for the government, which is highly unlikely but would be a major signal).

*   **DOWN indicators (for "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   The Supreme Court releasing other major decisions first, suggesting the tariff case is complex and requires more time (increases chance of "No 2025 ruling").
    *   The Court issuing a final set of orders/opinions for the calendar year without this case included.
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting a conservative justice (e.g., the Chief Justice or Gorsuch) is authoring the majority opinion.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Deadline:** The Jan 1, 2026, cutoff is the biggest pitfall. A decision released in the first week of January, while substantively resolving the issue, would resolve this question as "No 2025 ruling." The probability of this outcome is significant.
*   **Oral Argument Signals:** While often predictive, reading the tea leaves from oral arguments can be misleading. Justices may play devil's advocate or test arguments they do not ultimately adopt.
*   **"Mixed" vs. "Unlawful":** The distinction is key. If the Court strikes down the broad reciprocal tariffs but upholds the more targeted trafficking tariffs, it resolves as "Mixed." This is a plausible outcome that could be overlooked in a simple lawful/unlawful binary.
*   **"Other ruling":** While a merits decision is likely, a procedural dismissal (e.g., as improvidently granted) or a narrow remand without a merits holding (GVR) is always possible, though unlikely given the expedited grant.

### Final Research Summary
The legal headwinds against the tariffs are exceptionally strong, stemming from the Supreme Court's skepticism of broad executive power under the major questions doctrine and negative signals from oral arguments. The most likely outcome is a ruling that the tariffs are at least partially unlawful, but a mixed ruling or

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful:** Base rate ~35%. This reflects the historical deference to executive actions in national security and foreign affairs, though tempered by the current Court's skepticism of broad executive power.
- **Tariffs unlawful:** Base rate ~40%. This is informed by the Court's recent trend of applying the major questions doctrine to strike down significant executive actions lacking explicit congressional authorization.
- **Mixed ruling:** Base rate ~15%. This accounts for the possibility of the Court distinguishing between different types of tariffs (e.g., trafficking vs. reciprocal).
- **Other ruling:** Base rate ~5%. This reflects the low likelihood of a procedural dismissal or other non-merits resolution given the expedited review.
- **No 2025 ruling:** Base rate ~5%. This considers the tight timeline and possibility of a decision slipping into January 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves executive action under IEEPA, a statute historically granting broad powers to the President in emergencies, aligning with the "Tariffs lawful" base rate.
- **Differences:** The tariffs' unprecedented scope and the novel use of IEEPA for economic measures shift the case towards the "Major Questions" doctrine, supporting "Tariffs unlawful."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Federal Circuit ruling (unlawful):** Strong evidence against "Tariffs lawful." Likelihood of this ruling if tariffs are unlawful is high; low if lawful.
- **Supreme Court expedited review:** Increases likelihood of a merits decision, reducing "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling."
- **Oral arguments suggesting skepticism:** Strong evidence against "Tariffs lawful." Likelihood of skepticism if tariffs are unlawful is high; low if lawful.
- **Existence of distinct tariff regimes:** Increases likelihood of "Mixed ruling" as the Court could differentiate between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs.
- **Tight deadline:** Increases likelihood of "No 2025 ruling" due to potential delays.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful:** Prior odds = 35/65. Evidence (e.g., oral arguments, lower court rulings) strongly suggests tariffs are unlawful, reducing posterior probability.
- **Tariffs unlawful:** Prior odds = 40/60. Strong evidence from lower courts and oral arguments increases posterior probability.
- **Mixed ruling:** Prior odds = 15/85. Evidence of distinct tariff regimes moderately increases posterior probability.
- **Other ruling:** Prior odds = 5/95. Expedited review and importance of the case reduce posterior probability.
- **No 2025 ruling:** Prior odds = 5/95. Tight deadline moderately increases posterior probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence check:** Consider the possibility of the Court deferring to the President due to national security concerns, though unlikely given current trends.
- **Tail risks:** A procedural dismissal or delay into January 2026, while unlikely, should not be ignored.
- **Alternative forecast:** A "Mixed ruling" is plausible if the Court distinguishes between different tariffs, but evidence strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful."

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to sum to approximately 100%, considering all evidence and potential biases.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
Mixed ruling: 20%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 10%  

These probabilities reflect the strong legal headwinds against the tariffs, the Court's recent jurisprudence, and the procedural context.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 20%)**
- Historical deference to executive authority in foreign affairs/national security
- IEEPA has been interpreted broadly in past cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan*
- Presidents have significant latitude when acting with statutory authorization

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 45%)**
- The current Court's skepticism of executive overreach via the Major Questions Doctrine
- Recent precedents like *West Virginia v. EPA* and *NFIB v. OSHA* limiting executive power
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against these tariffs (albeit with different reasoning)

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 20%)**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases
- The two types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provide a natural dividing line
- Different legal justifications exist for each type of tariff

**Other ruling (Prior: 5%)**
- Procedural dismissals are rare in high-profile cases granted expedited review
- The Court typically reaches the merits when it takes the extraordinary step of expedited review

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 10%)**
- The Court has until December 31, 2025 to issue a ruling (per resolution criteria)
- Cases argued in November typically receive decisions by June of the following year
- Even expedited cases can face delays, especially for complex issues

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This involves presidential action under statutory authority (IEEPA)
- National security justifications are invoked, an area where courts traditionally defer
- The case involves foreign affairs and international trade, areas of traditional executive strength

**Key differences:**
- The scope of these tariffs is unprecedented under IEEPA (economy-wide rather than targeted)
- Using IEEPA for tariffs rather than sanctions is novel and stretches the statutory text
- Declaring trade deficits a "national emergency" is particularly tenuous under IEEPA's language
- The current 6-3 conservative Court is more skeptical of executive power than historical Courts
- Both specialized (Court of International Trade) and generalist courts ruled against the tariffs

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Federal Circuit affirmed lower court ruling tariffs unlawful (7-4)**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%): If tariffs were clearly lawful, we'd expect more judges to rule in their favor
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%): A strong majority finding against legality is consistent with this outcome

**Evidence: Supreme Court granted expedited review and consolidated cases**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Low (~30%): Expedited review suggests urgency, but tight timeline remains challenging
- P(E|Other outcomes) = High (~80%): Expedited review signals the Court intends to resolve the merits

**Evidence: Oral arguments "suggested the court may rule against the president's authority"**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Very low (~10%): Negative signals at oral argument strongly contradict this outcome
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%): Skeptical questioning aligns perfectly with this outcome
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~50%): Skepticism could be directed at some tariffs but not others

**Evidence: Two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) with different justifications**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~70%): The distinction provides a natural path for a split decision
- P(E|Tariffs lawful/unlawful) = Moderate (~40%): The Court could still rule categorically on IEEPA's scope

**Evidence: Tight deadline (decision needed by December 31, 2025)**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Moderate (~50%): Even expedited cases can slip past deadlines
- P(E|Other outcomes) = Moderate (~50%): The Court is capable of meeting tight deadlines when motivated

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the strongest evidence: the oral argument signals.

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 20%
- Likelihood ratio: 10% / 80% = 0.125
- Posterior odds = 0.20 / 0.80 × 0.125 = 0.03125
- Posterior probability = 0.03125 / (1 + 0.03125) ≈ 3%

This is a dramatic reduction, reflecting how strongly the oral argument signals contradict this outcome.

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 45%
- Likelihood ratio: 80% / 20% = 4
- Posterior odds = 0.45 / 0.55 × 4 = 3.27
- Posterior probability = 3.27 / (1 + 3.27) ≈ 77%

This represents a substantial increase based on the strong oral argument signals.

For "Mixed ruling":
- The distinct tariff regimes increase this probability from the prior
- The oral argument signals are moderately consistent with this outcome
- The Court's tendency to seek compromise in politically charged cases supports this
- Adjusted probability: ~15%

For "No 2025 ruling":
- The expedited schedule decreases this probability
- However, the tight deadline (only about 6 weeks from oral arguments to year-end) increases it
- These factors roughly balance out
- Adjusted probability: ~5%

For "Other ruling":
- The high-profile nature and expedited review make a non-merits disposition unlikely
- Adjusted probability: ~0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting oral argument signals, which can sometimes be misleading
- The Court could surprise by finding a novel legal theory that upholds the tariffs
- I might be underestimating the Court's deference to the executive in foreign affairs
- The "No 2025 ruling" probability may be too low given the extremely tight timeline

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs while striking down the reciprocal tariffs, resulting in a "Mixed ruling"
- The Court might issue a narrow ruling that avoids the broader IEEPA question, focusing on specific aspects
- A decision could come in early January 2026, missing the resolution deadline

**Adjustments:**
- Increase "Mixed ruling" probability slightly to account for the Court's tendency to seek compromise
- Increase "No 2025 ruling" probability given the extremely tight timeline
- Slightly increase "Tariffs lawful" to avoid overconfidence based on oral argument signals

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations and adjustments:

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 65%
Mixed ruling: 20%
Other ruling: 0%
No 2025 ruling: 10%
(sum = 100%)

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 65%
Mixed ruling: 20%
Other ruling: 0%
No 2025 ruling: 10%

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider two competing reference classes:

1.  **Supreme Court Deference to the Executive on Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in matters of national security and foreign commerce, especially when acting with statutory authority like the IEEPA. This reference class suggests a higher probability for the executive action being upheld. A base rate here might be **~65% for "Tariffs lawful" or "Mixed ruling."**
2.  **Supreme Court's "Major Questions Doctrine":** In recent years, the Court's conservative majority has consistently used this doctrine to invalidate executive actions of vast economic and political significance that are not explicitly authorized by Congress. Imposing broad tariffs on the entire economy fits this description perfectly. This reference class suggests a high probability of the action being struck down. A base rate here might be **~70% for "Tariffs unlawful."**

These base rates are in direct conflict. Given the unprecedented economic scope of the tariffs and the current Court's clear jurisprudential trend, the "Major Questions Doctrine" reference class is more relevant. I will therefore construct a prior that leans towards the tariffs being found unlawful, while still acknowledging the foreign affairs context and the possibility of a split decision.

*   **Prior Distribution:**
    *   Tariffs unlawful: 40%
    *   Tariffs lawful: 25%
    *   Mixed ruling: 20%
    *   No 2025 ruling: 10% (Expedited review makes a ruling likely, but the timeline is tight)
    *   Other ruling: 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case differs significantly from historical precedents of presidential authority under IEEPA. Past uses involved targeted sanctions (e.g., freezing assets), not imposing broad-based taxes (tariffs) on major trading partners. Furthermore, declaring a "trade deficit" as a national emergency is a legally tenuous expansion of the statute's scope. These differences push the case away from the "foreign affairs deference" model and squarely into the "major questions" framework, where the current Court is highly skeptical of executive power. The uniform, albeit differently reasoned, conclusions of the lower courts also distinguish this case from one with a clear circuit split.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the background and research report:

*   **Evidence 1: Unanimous Lower Court Outcomes.** Both the Court of International Trade/Federal Circuit and the D.C. District Court ruled the tariffs unlawful.
    *   **Assessment:** This is strong evidence against the government. P(unanimous lower court losses | Tariffs ultimately ruled unlawful) is much higher than P(unanimous lower court losses | Tariffs ultimately ruled lawful). This evidence strongly increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

*   **Evidence 2: Oral Arguments.** The research summary notes that oral arguments "suggested the court may rule against the president's authority."
    *   **Assessment:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence regarding the justices' current thinking. While not definitive, such reports are often highly predictive. The likelihood of this report being made if the Court were planning to uphold the tariffs is extremely low.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(Negative Oral Argument Report | Tariffs Unlawful or Mixed) / P(Negative Oral Argument Report | Tariffs Lawful) is very high (e.g., >10).

*   **Evidence 3: Two Distinct Tariff Regimes.** The case involves both "trafficking tariffs" (stronger national security claim) and "reciprocal tariffs" (weaker "trade deficit" claim).
    *   **Assessment:** This structure provides a clear path for a compromise decision. The Court can strike down the more aggressive use of IEEPA while upholding the more traditional application. This significantly increases the likelihood of a "Mixed ruling" compared to a simple binary case.

*   **Evidence 4: Expedited Schedule and Tight Deadline.** Argument is in early November, with a resolution deadline of December 31, 2025.
    *   **Assessment:** This is conflicting evidence. The expedited grant signals intent to rule quickly. However, the timeline is extremely compressed for a major, contentious case that will likely feature multiple opinions (majority, concurrences, dissents). This makes a slip into January 2026 a non-trivial possibility. This evidence increases the probability of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the prior probabilities based on the evidence.

*   **Prior for "Tariffs lawful":** 25%
*   **Update:** The negative lower court rulings, the extremely negative signal from oral arguments, and the alignment of the case with the Major Questions Doctrine all push this probability down dramatically. It should be reduced to a small tail risk.
*   **Posterior for "Tariffs lawful":** ~4%

*   **Prior for "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling":** 40% and 20% respectively.
*   **Update:** The evidence strongly supports one of these two outcomes. The oral argument signal points to a loss for the government. The existence of two tariff types makes a "Mixed ruling" a very judicially attractive option, allowing the court to curb the executive without a complete rebuke. I will increase both probabilities substantially, making them the most likely outcomes. Given the appeal of a compromise, I will treat them as roughly equally likely.
*   **Posterior for "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling":** ~35% each.

*   **Prior for "No 2025 ruling":** 10%
*   **Update:** The extreme time pressure between a November argument and a December 31 deadline for a landmark case makes a delay into January 2026 a very real possibility. This risk is significant enough to warrant a substantial portion of the probability mass.
*   **Posterior for "No 2025 ruling":** ~25%

*   **Prior for "Other ruling":** 5%
*   **Update:** Given the Court granted certiorari and expedited the case, a procedural dismissal is now highly improbable. This should be reduced to a minimal probability.
*   **Posterior for "Other ruling":** ~1%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast places a 70% chance on the tariffs being struck down in whole or in part. Could I be wrong? The primary counterargument is that the Court's conservatives, despite their views on domestic agencies, might revert to a highly deferential stance on presidential power in foreign affairs, viewing the IEEPA's broad language as a clear delegation from Congress. They could see this as a "political question" and refuse to intervene. While possible, this runs contrary to the specific signals from oral arguments and the Court's recent trajectory.

Another risk is underestimating the chance of "No 2025 ruling." Writing opinions for a case this complex takes time, and a slip past the deadline is easy to imagine. My 25% estimate acknowledges this, but it could arguably be higher. However, the Court's decision to expedite the case signals a commitment to a swift resolution.

Finally, the split between "Unlawful" and "Mixed" is the area of greatest uncertainty. A "Mixed" ruling is a classic compromise, but the Court could also opt for a cleaner, broader ruling that IEEPA simply does not authorize tariffs at all, which would resolve as "Unlawful." Assigning them equal probability reflects this uncertainty.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are adjusted to sum to 100%.

*   Tariffs lawful: 4%
*   Tariffs unlawful: 35%
*   Mixed ruling: 35%
*   Other ruling: 1%
*   No 2025 ruling: 25%
    (Sum: 100%)

This distribution reflects a high likelihood (70%) that the tariffs will be found at least partially unlawful, an even split on whether the loss will be total or partial, and a significant (25%) chance that the decision's release will be delayed past the 2025 deadline.
