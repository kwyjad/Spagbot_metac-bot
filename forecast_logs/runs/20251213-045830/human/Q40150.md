### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US initiation of new, significant military action in a foreign country:** Since the end of the Cold War (1991), the US has initiated major military actions in a new country (i.e., not an expansion of an existing conflict) roughly 6-8 times (e.g., Somalia 1992, Haiti 1994, Bosnia 1995, Kosovo 1999, Afghanistan 2001, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011, Syria 2014). This suggests a base rate of approximately one new intervention every 4-5 years. The annual probability of the US attacking any *specific* country, especially one that is not an overt adversary, is extremely low, likely **<0.5% per year**.
2.  **US unilateral military action for primarily humanitarian/religious reasons:** This class is much narrower. The interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Libya had strong humanitarian components but were also conducted with NATO allies and/or some form of international legal justification. Purely unilateral strikes for such reasons against a sovereign nation that is not in a state of total collapse are exceptionally rare. The base rate for this specific type of action is likely **<0.1% per year**.
3.  **US military strikes in the Sahel/West Africa:** The US has a consistent but low-profile military presence in the region, primarily focused on counter-terrorism (CT) support, training, and drone surveillance (e.g., from a base in Niger, prior to recent political changes). Direct kinetic action has been very limited, often confined to self-defense or strikes against designated terrorist groups (e.g., in Somalia). A deliberate, announced strike within Nigeria, a major regional power and partner, would be unprecedented. The base rate is near **0%**.

*Limitations:* These base rates are derived from a period of different geopolitical priorities and presidential temperaments. The unique characteristics of the current hypothetical administration may render historical precedent less predictive.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Ideology & Personality (Large ↑):** The primary driver is President Trump's personal commitment to this issue, likely driven by a desire to appeal to his evangelical Christian base. His demonstrated willingness to bypass traditional foreign policy norms and act decisively (or impulsively) makes his public threats more credible than those of a typical president.
2.  **Bureaucratic & Institutional Friction (Large ↓):** The Department of Defense (DoD) and State Department would likely resist a hasty, unilateral strike on Nigeria. They would raise concerns about destabilizing a key regional partner, the lack of clear military objectives, risk of mission creep, potential for high civilian casualties, and the damage to US-Africa relations.
3.  **Triggering Events (Moderate ↑):** A new, highly publicized massacre of Christians in Nigeria before the deadline could force the President's hand, making it politically untenable for him not to act on his public threats. The media ecosystem (e.g., Fox News, Newsmax) would amplify such an event.
4.  **Nigerian Government De-escalation (Moderate ↓):** The Nigerian government could take visible steps to appease Washington, such as announcing a new task force to protect religious communities, arresting perpetrators of violence, or engaging in high-level diplomacy. This would provide the White House with an "off-ramp."
5.  **Definition of "Military Attack" (Moderate ↑):** The threshold for resolution is broad. A limited, "symbolic" action like a single drone strike against a known ISWAP or Boko Haram training camp (plausibly justified as CT) is far more likely than a major air campaign. The availability of low-cost, low-risk options increases the overall probability of some action occurring.
6.  **International Condemnation (Small ↓):** While allies in Europe and partners in the African Union would strongly condemn a unilateral strike, this administration has shown a high tolerance for international criticism. This is unlikely to be a decisive constraint.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Presidential Focus:** Unlike past interventions driven by broad national security consensus (e.g., post-9/11) or alliance politics (e.g., Libya), this potential action is driven by the specific, personal, and publicly-stated agenda of the President, focused on religious persecution.
*   **Target Status:** Nigeria is not a pariah state like Syria or a failed state like Somalia in the 1990s. It is a major oil producer, a regional hegemon, and a nominal partner in counter-terrorism. Attacking it is a far more geopolitically complex and disruptive act than typical US interventions.
*   **Lack of Traditional Casus Belli:** The justification is not a direct attack on the US or its citizens, nor an imminent genocide in the vein of Rwanda or Kosovo. It is a response to ongoing, chronic sub-state violence, which the US has historically addressed through aid and security assistance, not direct intervention.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The public threat was made in November, with a resolution deadline of Jan 1, 2026. This compresses the diplomatic, intelligence, and military planning cycles to a degree that is highly unusual for initiating a *new* conflict, suggesting any action would have to be either pre-planned or very limited in scope.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the reference class of the US initiating a new military conflict in a specific partner country for non-traditional reasons. The prior is strong (high "equivalent n") due to decades of consistent historical precedent.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Direct, public presidential threat and order to DoD to "prepare." This is the most significant piece of evidence, overriding historical norms.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Formal designation of Nigeria as a CPC and steady drumbeat of reports on Christian persecution create a powerful political and moral justification.
    *   (↓ Large) Strong, predictable institutional resistance from the Pentagon and State Department, who manage the operational realities and diplomatic fallout.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The status of Nigeria as a major regional power, making an attack far more costly and complex than striking a weaker state.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The availability of low-cost, plausibly deniable, or symbolic military options (e.g., a single drone strike on a terrorist camp) that meet the resolution criteria.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence represents a massive, sharp shock to the very low prior. The presidential impetus is a powerful force, but it is running into immense, short-term structural constraints. The posterior should move up dramatically from the prior, but likely remain well below 50%, reflecting the profound friction against such an action on this timeline.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Movement of US naval or air assets towards the Gulf of Guinea.
    *   State Department issuing travel warnings or ordering the evacuation of non-essential personnel from the US embassy in Abuja.
    *   Leaks from the Pentagon detailing specific target sets (e.g., ISWAP/Boko Haram camps).
    *   A new, major, and widely-publicized attack on a Christian community in Nigeria.
    *   President Trump making further, more specific threats or giving a speech on the topic.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of high-level diplomatic talks between the US Secretary of State and the Nigerian President.
    *   The Nigerian government publicizing arrests of militants or the deployment of military units to protect vulnerable communities.
    *   Public statements of "concern" or "caution" from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or senior Congressional leaders.
    *   Focus of the President and US media shifting to a different domestic or international crisis.
    *   Statements from key evangelical leaders praising the President's tough stance but not demanding immediate military action.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The term "military attack" is broad. A covert special forces raid or a drone strike against a non-state actor (ISWAP) with tacit, non-public Nigerian consent might not be publicly framed as an "attack on Nigeria" but would resolve the question as Yes.
*   **Posturing vs. Intent:** The President's threats could be a negotiating tactic to force the Nigerian government to act, or for domestic political consumption, with no genuine intent to launch a strike.
*   **Intelligence Gaps:** Our visibility into the internal deliberations of the White House, the NSC, and the Pentagon is near zero. The outcome hinges almost entirely on the closed-door struggle between the President and his national security apparatus.
*   **"Wag the Dog" Scenario:** A sudden, unrelated domestic crisis could either shelve this issue entirely or, conversely, incentivize a foreign policy distraction, making an attack more likely.
*   **Nigerian Response:** Nigeria's reaction is a key variable. A defiant stance could provoke an attack, while a conciliatory one could defuse the crisis. This is difficult to predict.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a US military attack on Nigeria before 2026 has risen dramatically from a near-zero baseline due to direct and repeated threats from a President known for norm-breaking behavior. However, the action faces immense institutional, diplomatic, and logistical hurdles on an extremely short timeline, making a limited, symbolic strike the most plausible, though still unlikely, path to a "Yes" resolution.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the US initiating a new military action in a specific country for non-traditional reasons is extremely low, likely <0.5% per year. Given the specific context of a unilateral action for humanitarian/religious reasons, the base rate is even lower, <0.1% per year. For this analysis, we will start with a prior probability of 0.1%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves potential US military action in a foreign country, which aligns with the reference class of US interventions.
   - Differences: The action is driven by a specific presidential agenda focused on religious persecution, targeting a major regional power and partner, which is atypical compared to historical US interventions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Presidential Threats and Orders: The direct threats and orders to prepare for action significantly increase the likelihood of an attack (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - Institutional Resistance: Strong resistance from the DoD and State Department decreases the likelihood (Likelihood ratio < 1).
   - Nigeria's Status: As a major regional power, an attack would be complex and costly, decreasing the likelihood (Likelihood ratio < 1).
   - Availability of Low-Cost Options: The possibility of a limited, symbolic strike increases the likelihood (Likelihood ratio > 1).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.001 (0.1% prior probability)
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is mixed, with significant presidential impetus but strong institutional resistance. Assuming a moderate net likelihood ratio of 2 (reflecting the increased probability due to presidential focus and low-cost options), the posterior odds = 0.001 × 2 = 0.002.
   - Posterior probability = 0.002 / (1 + 0.002) ≈ 0.2%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast might underestimate the impact of presidential determination and the availability of low-cost military options.
   - Alternative Scenarios: A sudden, high-profile attack on Christians in Nigeria could force action. Conversely, diplomatic de-escalation could prevent it.
   - Adjustments: Considering these factors, a slight upward adjustment to account for potential triggering events is warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering all factors, the final forecast probability is adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood due to presidential focus and potential low-cost actions, balanced by institutional resistance and geopolitical complexity.

Final: 1%

# Will the US conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before January 1, 2026 (about 2.5 weeks from now).

The most appropriate reference class is: **US initiation of unilateral military action against a sovereign nation that is not an overt adversary, particularly for humanitarian/religious reasons**.

Looking at historical precedents:
- The US rarely conducts military strikes against countries that are not direct adversaries
- Nigeria is a regional partner in Africa, not a traditional US enemy
- Unilateral military action for primarily humanitarian/religious reasons is extremely rare
- The timeframe is extremely short (only 2.5 weeks remaining)

Based on these considerations, I'll set a very low prior probability of **0.5%** (or 1:199 odds).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Nigeria is experiencing ongoing violence and instability, similar to other regions where the US has considered intervention
- There are terrorist groups operating in Nigeria (Boko Haram, ISWAP) that the US opposes
- The US has strategic interests in West Africa and the Sahel region

**Key differences that matter:**
- President Trump has explicitly threatened military action against Nigeria, which is highly unusual
- The stated motivation (protection of Christians) is different from typical US military interventions
- The timeline is extremely compressed (only 2.5 weeks until the resolution date)
- Nigeria is a major regional power and partner, not a failed state or adversary
- The President has ordered the DoD to "prepare for possible action"

These differences significantly increase the probability above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit threat of military action on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): If the US plans to attack, such a public threat would be very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If the US does not plan to attack, such a threat is unusual but possible as negotiating leverage (~10%)
- Likelihood ratio: 9:1 in favor of an attack
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump ordering DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): If an attack is planned, such preparation orders are necessary (~95%)
- P(E|~H): If no attack is planned, such orders might be issued as a show of force (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75:1 in favor of an attack
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Redesignation of Nigeria as a "Country of Particular Concern"**
- P(E|H): If planning an attack, establishing formal justification is likely (~80%)
- P(E|~H): This designation can occur without military action plans (~40%)
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 in favor of an attack
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeline (only 2.5 weeks left)**
- P(E|H): If an attack will occur, planning would likely be further along by now (~30%)
- P(E|~H): The short timeline makes military action logistically difficult (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1:3 against an attack
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Nigeria's status as a regional partner, not an adversary**
- P(E|H): If an attack will occur, it would likely target a clearer adversary (~20%)
- P(E|~H): The US rarely attacks partners/allies (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:4.75 against an attack
- This significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with my prior odds of 1:199 (0.5%), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on Trump's explicit threat:**
- Prior odds: 1:199
- Likelihood ratio: 9:1
- Posterior odds: 9:199 ≈ 1:22.1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+22.1) ≈ 4.3%

**Update on DoD preparation orders:**
- Prior odds: 1:22.1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.75:1
- Posterior odds: 4.75:22.1 ≈ 1:4.65
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+4.65) ≈ 17.7%

**Update on short timeline constraint:**
- Prior odds: 1:4.65
- Likelihood ratio: 1:3
- Posterior odds: 1:13.95
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+13.95) ≈ 6.7%

**Update on Nigeria's partner status:**
- Prior odds: 1:13.95
- Likelihood ratio: 1:4.75
- Posterior odds: 1:66.26
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+66.26) ≈ 1.5%

After considering additional factors and evidence holistically, I need to make a final adjustment:

- The definition of "military attack" is broad and could include limited drone strikes against terrorist targets
- Trump has shown willingness to order unexpected military actions (e.g., the strike on Iranian General Soleimani)
- A new triggering event (major attack on Christians) could precipitate action
- Institutional resistance from DoD and State Department is likely substantial

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's willingness to follow through on threats regardless of institutional resistance
- I might be overestimating the logistical constraints given that limited drone strikes require minimal preparation
- I could be undervaluing the political incentives for Trump to demonstrate action to his evangelical base

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A limited, symbolic drone strike against a Boko Haram target could occur with minimal preparation
- The US could conduct a covert special forces operation that becomes public only after the fact
- A major attack on Christians in Nigeria could trigger an immediate response

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for a higher probability (10-15%) would emphasize Trump's unpredictability, the availability of limited strike options, and the political benefits of following through on threats to protect Christians.

**Rebuttal:**
However, the extremely short timeline, the diplomatic complexity of attacking a partner nation, and the lack of clear military objectives make even limited action difficult to execute before January 1, 2026.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, constraints, and potential scenarios, I believe there is a small but non-negligible chance of a US military attack within Nigeria before 2026. The most likely scenario would be a limited drone strike against terrorist targets if a triggering event occurs.

Final: 4%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate for this event is extremely low. I will select the reference class of "the US unilaterally initiating a new military action for primarily humanitarian/religious reasons against a sovereign nation that is a regional power and a nominal partner." Historically, this has essentially never happened. The research report suggests a base rate of <0.1% per year for a slightly broader category. Given the specific target (Nigeria) and the short timeframe (less than one month), the prior probability, P(H), is exceptionally low, likely below 0.01%. For the purpose of updating, I will start with a prior of **0.1% (1:999 odds)**, acknowledging this is likely generous. This reflects the strong historical precedent against such an action.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The US has a history of using military force for humanitarian reasons (e.g., Kosovo, Libya) and conducts counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel region.
*   **Differences:** This situation is highly anomalous.
    *   **Presidential Factor:** The primary driver is the specific personality and political motivations of the hypothetical President Trump. His demonstrated willingness to disregard foreign policy norms and his direct, public commitment to the issue make his threats far more credible than those of a typical president.
    *   **Target Status:** Nigeria is not a pariah state like Syria or a failed state like 1990s Somalia. It is a major oil producer, the most populous country in Africa, and a key regional partner. A military attack would have severe and far-reaching diplomatic and economic consequences, making the threshold for action incredibly high.
    *   **Timeline:** The deadline of January 1, 2026, leaves less than three weeks from the current date (Dec 13, 2025). This compressed timeline, spanning the Christmas holiday period, creates immense logistical and bureaucratic hurdles for initiating military action.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence clusters and their impact on the odds.

*   **Evidence 1: Direct Presidential Threats and Preparatory Orders.** (e.g., Truth Social post, order to DoD to "prepare for possible action," CPC designation).
    *   This is the single most important piece of evidence. A president intending to attack would almost certainly issue such threats and orders (P(E|H) is high). However, this specific president also uses such rhetoric for domestic posturing and as a negotiating tactic, meaning he could do this even if he doesn't intend to attack (P(E|~H) is non-trivial).
    *   Nonetheless, the combination of public threats and concrete preparatory orders is a powerful signal. P(E|H) >> P(E|~H).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Substantially greater than 1. This evidence dramatically increases the probability from the near-zero prior.

*   **Evidence 2: Institutional and Diplomatic Friction.** (e.g., predictable resistance from DoD/State, international condemnation, Nigeria's status as a regional power).
    *   This is the primary evidence against an attack. These structural barriers are immense and are the default reason why such an attack would not happen. The probability of observing this friction is very high if no attack happens (P(E|~H) is high) and still quite high even if an attack does happen (as the friction would be something the President has to overcome) (P(E|H) is high). The key is that this friction is the *mechanism* for the "No" outcome.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence strongly pulls the probability down, reinforcing the prior.

*   **Evidence 3: The Short Timeline and Definition of "Attack".**
    *   The <3 week timeline makes a major operation nearly impossible, strongly favoring "No". However, the resolution criteria are broad. A limited, symbolic action, such as a single drone strike on a known Boko Haram/ISWAP camp, is logistically feasible on a short timeline, especially if contingency plans were ordered in November.
    *   The availability of this "easy" option makes a "Yes" resolution more plausible than it would otherwise be. It lowers the barrier to action.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The timeline itself is evidence against (LR < 1), but the existence of a feasible limited option mitigates this negative update significantly.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Instead of a strict mathematical update, which is difficult with qualitative likelihoods, I will reason through the update holistically.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** The base rate is near zero (<0.1%).
2.  **Apply the Strongest Evidence:** The direct, public threats from this specific president are an exceptional event. This evidence is strong enough to overcome the powerful prior and move the probability from "near impossible" to "unlikely but plausible." This is a massive update, perhaps moving the odds from 1:1000 to something like 50:1000 (or ~5%).
3.  **Incorporate Countervailing Evidence:** Now, we must account for the immense friction. The institutional resistance, the severe diplomatic fallout, and the extremely short timeline are powerful forces for inaction. These factors suggest that even with the President's commitment, the path of least resistance is for the clock to run out, for a diplomatic off-ramp to be found, or for the President's attention to be diverted. This evidence pushes the probability back down significantly.
4.  **Synthesize:** The final probability hinges on the contest between a president's personal will and the government's structural inertia. The existence of a low-cost, symbolic option (a drone strike on non-state actors) provides a potential path for the president's will to be enacted despite the friction. A plausible outcome is that the President, having made a public threat, feels compelled to act, and a limited drone strike offers a way to claim victory without starting a major war.

My final estimate balances these competing forces. The probability is low, but it is orders of magnitude higher than the base rate alone would suggest. I estimate that the combination of presidential commitment and the availability of a limited military option creates a roughly 1-in-8 chance of an attack occurring before the deadline.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~12% could be too high. The default state of the world is "no new wars." The US national security apparatus is designed to be deliberative and risk-averse, and it would almost certainly advise unanimously against this action. The threats could be pure bluster for a domestic audience, with no real intent to act. A diplomatic off-ramp where the Nigerian government makes a token gesture that allows the President to declare victory is a very likely scenario.

Conversely, my forecast could be too low. I might be underestimating the President's commitment to his evangelical base and his willingness to act impulsively to demonstrate strength. A new, highly publicized massacre of Christians in Nigeria could occur in the next two weeks, making it politically untenable for him *not* to act on his prior threats. The "easy" option of a drone strike might be so tempting as a political tool that the institutional friction becomes a secondary concern.

Considering these factors, I believe my forecast remains reasonable. It correctly identifies the event as unlikely but acknowledges that the unique circumstances—primarily the President's personality and public statements—make a normally unthinkable event plausible.

### Final Forecast
I will provide a final forecast that balances the extremely low base rate against the very strong, but contested, evidence in favor of an attack. The President's direct threats make the situation highly abnormal, but the institutional and diplomatic barriers to action, especially on such a short timeline, remain immense.

Final: 12%
