### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Normal Period):** In a typical year without a major political or constitutional crisis, resignations from the superior courts are extremely rare. Judges are appointed for life until a mandatory retirement age (65 for Supreme Court, 62 for High Courts). The base rate for resignations due to political protest in a given two-month period is effectively **zero**. Most departures are due to retirement, health, or, very rarely, removal for misconduct.
2.  **Judicial Crisis (2007 PCO):** The most relevant reference class is the 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) imposed by General Pervez Musharraf. This event suspended the constitution and required judges to take a new oath. Approximately 60 judges of the superior courts, including the Chief Justice, either refused to take the oath or were removed, which is functionally equivalent to a mass protest resignation. This event suggests a plausible upper-bound range of **40-60 judges** departing during an existential crisis for the judiciary.
3.  **Constitutional Amendments Affecting the Judiciary:** Pakistan has a history of constitutional amendments impacting the judiciary (e.g., 8th, 17th). These have historically generated legal challenges and political controversy but have not led to mass resignations. This suggests a base rate of **0-2 resignations** in response to a constitutional change that, while controversial, is passed through a formal legislative process.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed, fundamentally altering judicial and military structures. — **↑ (Large)** — The inciting incident, creating a powerful motive for principled resignations.
*   **2025-11-14** Opposition alliance TTAP calls for nationwide protests against the amendment. — **↑ (Small)** — Increases political pressure and may embolden judges, but the opposition's ability to mobilize is uncertain.
*   **2025-11-15** SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resign in protest. — **↑ (Moderate)** — Establishes a precedent by senior, respected judges. Creates pressure for others to follow suit to show solidarity.
*   **2025-11-17** Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns. — **↑ (Small)** — Shows the protest extends beyond the Supreme Court, but he is a less senior figure. The total now stands at 3.
*   **~2025-11-18 to 2025-12-12** Apparent lull in resignations. — **↓ (Large)** — The nearly four-week period since the initial wave without further resignations suggests the momentum has stalled and a mass cascade is not occurring.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand on Judicial Independence:** The amendment is a direct assault on the judiciary's autonomy. Judges with a strong commitment to constitutionalism and the separation of powers may feel they have no choice but to resign. (Large)
2.  **Solidarity and Peer Pressure:** The initial resignations by respected SC justices create pressure on others. Remaining on the bench could be perceived as acquiescence or opportunism. This effect diminishes over time if a critical mass isn't reached quickly. (Moderate)
3.  **Establishment Coercion & Inducements:** The government and military establishment have significant leverage. They can offer promotions or favorable post-retirement appointments to compliant judges, while using threats (including the new power to transfer HC judges) to intimidate potential dissenters. (Moderate)
4.  **Personal Calculation (Career & Security):** Judges must weigh principle against practicalities: loss of salary, pension, security, and status. Many may believe they can better protect the rule of law by remaining and resisting from within. (Large, pushes number down)
5.  **Bar Association & Civil Society Mobilization:** Strong, sustained protests by lawyers' associations (e.g., the Supreme Court Bar Association) could create an environment where it becomes untenable for judges to continue. This was a key factor in the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Legitimacy via Legislation:** Unlike the 2007 PCO which was an extra-constitutional military decree, this is a constitutional amendment passed by Parliament. This provides a veneer of legality, making it a more complex decision for judges to resign in protest against a "law of the land."
*   **No Single Litmus Test:** The 2007 crisis forced a binary choice on judges: take the new oath or be removed. The 27th Amendment imposes structural changes without a single, immediate act of compliance, allowing judges to adopt a "wait and see" approach.
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Power:** The amendment grants the Judicial Commission new powers to *transfer* judges. This is a coercive tool to neutralize dissent without forcing resignations, a lever Musharraf did not have in the same way.
*   **Initial Resignations as a Ceiling?:** The first three resignations were by judges known for their independent and liberal jurisprudence. They may represent the core group of principled dissenters, rather than the start of a broad wave. The subsequent quiet period supports this view.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered between the "normal" (0-2) and "crisis" (40-60) reference classes. A prior centered around **10-15 resignations** with a low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=2) seems plausible, acknowledging the severity but also the legislative nature of the change.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The amendment's content is a severe blow to judicial independence.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The initial three resignations confirm the event is a "red line" for at least some senior judges.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The ~4-week lull since the first resignations is strong evidence that momentum has stalled and a mass cascade is unlikely.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The legislative nature of the change (vs. a military PCO) provides cover for judges to remain in their posts.
*   **Net effect:** The initial evidence pointed towards a potentially high number, but the recency-weighted evidence (the recent lull) is a powerful signal in the opposite direction. The posterior should be revised **sharply downwards**, with its mass concentrated much closer to the already-observed number of 3.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Resignation of a Chief Justice (Supreme Court or a High Court).
    *   Coordinated statements from provincial bar councils or the SCBA calling for resignations.
    *   Sustained, large-scale street protests by the legal community.
    *   Reports of deep divisions or acrimonious meetings within the judiciary.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Chief Justice of Pakistan makes a public statement accommodating the new system.
    *   The Judicial Commission begins using its new powers (e.g., transferring a judge) without triggering further resignations.
    *   Bar associations issue divided or weak statements, focusing on legal challenges rather than resignations.
    *   The new Federal Constitutional Court is successfully seated and begins hearing cases.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Gaps:** The internal deliberations of the judiciary are opaque. We lack insight into the CJP's strategy or the mood among the majority of judges.
*   **Definition of "Resignation":** The resolution criteria are clear, but the government could use its new powers to sideline judges (e.g., force them on leave, transfer them to an undesirable post) to induce a de facto removal that isn't a formal resignation.
*   **Back-channel Pressure:** The true extent of establishment pressure on judges to remain in their posts is unknowable and will not be publicly reported.
*   **Delayed Reactions:** While unlikely, a new trigger event (e.g., a particularly egregious ruling by the new Constitutional Court) could spark a second wave of resignations before Dec 31.

**Final Research Summary:** The 27th Amendment created a crisis of principle for Pakistan's judiciary, leading to three initial resignations. However, the momentum appears to have dissipated, and the legislative nature of the change provides judges with reasons to stay, suggesting the final number of resignations will be low and likely not much higher than the three already recorded.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for judicial resignations in Pakistan during normal periods is effectively zero, given the lifetime appointments and rarity of resignations for political reasons. However, during a judicial crisis, such as the 2007 PCO, up to 60 judges departed. For constitutional amendments affecting the judiciary, historical data suggests 0-2 resignations. Given the current context, a prior centered around 10-15 resignations with a low equivalent sample size (n=2) seems appropriate, acknowledging the severity of the situation but also the legislative nature of the change.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the 2007 PCO in terms of being a crisis for judicial independence, but it differs because the amendment was passed through a formal legislative process, providing a veneer of legality. Unlike the PCO, there is no immediate binary choice for judges, allowing them to adopt a "wait and see" approach.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The passage of the amendment and the initial resignations by senior judges increase the likelihood of further resignations. However, the four-week lull in resignations and the legislative nature of the amendment decrease the likelihood of a mass resignation event. The likelihood of additional resignations is thus reduced.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 10-15 resignations, the evidence of the initial resignations increases the likelihood of further resignations, but the subsequent lull and legislative context sharply decrease this likelihood. The posterior distribution is thus revised downwards, concentrating closer to the observed number of 3 resignations.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a new trigger event causing a second wave of resignations, suggests some tail risk. However, the legislative nature of the amendment and the lack of momentum for further resignations support a conservative forecast. The best alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher number if new protests or judicial actions occur, but current evidence supports a low number.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted number of resignations is likely to remain low, close to the observed number of 3. The percentiles reflect this conservative estimate, accounting for some uncertainty and potential tail risks.

# Forecast: How many judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts will resign during late 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll consider several reference classes:

1. **Normal judicial resignations in Pakistan**: In typical periods, resignations from superior courts are extremely rare. Judges serve until retirement age (65 for Supreme Court, 62 for High Courts) unless removed for misconduct. The base rate is effectively 0-1 resignations in a two-month period.

2. **2007 Provisional Constitutional Order crisis**: When General Musharraf suspended the constitution, approximately 60 judges either refused to take a new oath or were removed. This represents an upper bound for judicial departures during an existential crisis.

3. **Previous constitutional amendments affecting judiciary**: Past amendments (like the 8th and 17th) generated controversy but typically led to 0-2 resignations.

Given the severity of the 27th Amendment but its passage through formal legislative channels, I'll use a prior centered around 8-12 resignations with a wide variance to reflect uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The amendment was passed through constitutional procedures, unlike the 2007 PCO
- There's significant political opposition and civil society outrage
- The changes fundamentally alter judicial structures and independence

**Key differences**:
- Unlike the 2007 PCO, there's no immediate "oath test" forcing judges to make a binary choice
- The amendment provides a veneer of legality through parliamentary approval
- The Judicial Commission now has transfer powers, giving the government a tool to neutralize dissent without forcing resignations
- We already have 3 resignations, suggesting this is more serious than typical amendments

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast higher**:
- The amendment severely undermines judicial independence by creating a new Constitutional Court and allowing forced transfers (Strong evidence, +4-6 resignations)
- Three respected judges (two SC, one HC) have already resigned in protest (Moderate evidence, +2-3 resignations)
- Opposition parties are organizing nationwide protests (Weak evidence, +1-2 resignations)

**Evidence pushing forecast lower**:
- There's been a ~4-week lull since the initial resignations (Strong evidence, -5-7 resignations)
- The amendment passed through formal legislative channels, giving it legitimacy (Moderate evidence, -3-4 resignations)
- Judges face significant personal costs to resigning (career, pension, security) (Moderate evidence, -2-3 resignations)
- The government can use transfer powers instead of forcing resignations (Moderate evidence, -2-3 resignations)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 8-12 resignations, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update** - The amendment's severity and initial three resignations:
- Prior: 8-12 resignations
- Likelihood ratio: Evidence suggests higher numbers are 1.5x more likely
- Posterior: Shifts to 10-14 resignations

**Second update** - The 4-week lull and legislative legitimacy:
- Prior: 10-14 resignations
- Likelihood ratio: Evidence suggests lower numbers are 3x more likely
- Posterior: Shifts significantly downward to 5-8 resignations

The most powerful evidence is the extended lull after the initial resignations. If this were the start of a mass protest movement, we would expect to see a cascade effect with more resignations following quickly. The absence of this pattern strongly suggests the three initial resignations represent most or all of the judges willing to take this principled stand.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting the recent lull. There could be behind-the-scenes coordination for a larger wave of resignations.
- The situation could change dramatically if a triggering event occurs (e.g., the first controversial ruling by the new Constitutional Court).
- I might underestimate the power of solidarity if a highly respected figure (like a Chief Justice) resigns.

**Alternative forecast**:
A reasonable alternative would be to forecast 10-15 resignations, arguing that:
1. The initial resignations are just the beginning
2. Bar associations might mobilize more effectively in coming weeks
3. The amendment is truly unprecedented in its assault on judicial independence

However, the strongest counterargument remains the extended lull. The most principled judges likely resigned immediately, and others have now had time to calculate their personal interests and decide to stay.

Given these considerations, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for tail risks but maintain the central tendency around 5-7 resignations.

## 6. Final Percentiles

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior, I will consider three reference classes for judicial resignations in Pakistan:
1.  **Normal Period:** In a typical year, resignations from the superior courts (Supreme Court and High Courts) for political reasons are virtually nonexistent. The base rate is effectively 0 for any given two-month period.
2.  **Controversial Legislation:** Pakistan has previously passed constitutional amendments affecting the judiciary. These have generated political and legal challenges but have not historically led to mass resignations. This suggests a base rate of 0-2 resignations.
3.  **Existential Crisis (2007 PCO):** The 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) under General Musharraf, which suspended the constitution, is the most extreme historical analogue. This event led to the removal or refusal to take a new oath of approximately 60 judges. This serves as a plausible upper bound for a full-scale judicial revolt.

The current situation is far more severe than a normal period or a standard controversial amendment, but it is not a direct military-led suspension of the constitution like the 2007 PCO. Therefore, my prior distribution will be a wide one, centered somewhere between the "Controversial Legislation" and "Existential Crisis" scenarios. I'll set a prior median around **10 resignations**, with a very wide spread (e.g., P10 of 2, P90 of 35) to reflect the high uncertainty at the outset of the crisis.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the 2007 PCO in that it represents a fundamental challenge to judicial independence by the executive and military establishment. However, there are crucial differences that suggest a lower number of resignations:
*   **Veneer of Legality:** The 27th Amendment was passed by Parliament, giving it a constitutional and legal basis that the 2007 PCO lacked. This makes it a more complex decision for a judge to resign in protest against the "law of the land."
*   **Lack of a Single Litmus Test:** The 2007 crisis forced an immediate, binary choice on all judges: take a new oath or be removed. The current amendment imposes structural changes without such a clear, universal decision point, allowing judges to adopt a "wait and see" approach.
*   **New Coercive Tools:** The amendment grants the government the power to transfer High Court judges, providing a mechanism to sideline dissenters without forcing a resignation that would add to a protest movement's numbers.

These differences all point towards the final number of resignations being significantly lower than the 2007 benchmark.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the forecast:
*   **The 27th Amendment's Content:** The amendment is a severe blow to judicial autonomy. This is strong evidence that a non-zero number of principled resignations was likely. This pushes the forecast **up** from the "normal" base rate of zero.
*   **Initial Resignations (Nov 15-17):** The resignation of two respected Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice confirmed that the amendment was a "red line" for some. This established a floor of 3 for the final count and provided initial momentum, making a larger wave seem more plausible at the time. This was a moderate signal pushing the forecast **up**.
*   **The Lull (Nov 18 - Dec 12):** This is the most critical piece of evidence. Following the initial three resignations, there has been a period of nearly four weeks with no further resignations. This is very strong evidence that the initial momentum has stalled and a mass cascade or "judicial revolt" is not materializing. This evidence has a high likelihood ratio in favor of a low final count and pushes the forecast **sharply down**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered around a median of 10.
*   **Evidence:** We have an established fact that 3 judges have resigned. The question is how many *more* will resign before December 31. The most powerful evidence is the nearly month-long lull since the last resignation.
*   **Update:** My prior belief in a large wave of resignations (e.g., >10) is now drastically reduced. The lack of further resignations is highly consistent with a scenario where the final number is very close to the current number (3), and highly inconsistent with a scenario where a large, coordinated wave was planned. The posterior distribution must therefore be heavily concentrated on low numbers, with a mode at 3. The median of my posterior will be very close to 3, with a small right tail to account for the possibility of one or two more "stragglers" or a new triggering event in the remaining 18 days of the year.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider how this forecast could be wrong.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** A coordinated, delayed wave of resignations could be planned for maximum political effect later in December. This would mean the lull is strategic, not a sign of failure. I find this unlikely; protest movements thrive on momentum, which has been lost. Allowing the government nearly a month to manage the situation and appoint new judges weakens the impact of any future resignations.
*   **Tail Risk:** A new, unforeseen event could trigger more resignations. For example, if the government uses its new power to transfer a widely respected judge, it could provoke a backlash. This is a plausible risk that justifies keeping a small tail on the distribution.
*   **Overconfidence in the Lull:** Am I putting too much weight on the lack of recent news? It's possible, but for an event like a judicial resignation, the absence of evidence (no reports of resignations) is strong evidence of absence.

My conclusion is that the central forecast should remain low, but the percentiles must account for the small possibility of a few more resignations. The distribution should be heavily skewed, with most of the probability mass between 3 and 5. A final count above 10 now seems extremely unlikely.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is heavily anchored on the three resignations that have already occurred. The long lull since then strongly suggests that a mass resignation movement has failed to materialize. The percentiles reflect a high probability that the final number will be exactly 3, with a decaying probability of a few more individuals resigning before the end of the year.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 4
P80: 5
P90: 6
