### Reference class & base rates
- **Reference Class 1: Trump's first-term actions on major international agreements (2017-2021).** During his four-year term, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from several high-profile agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Open Skies Treaty. Out of a pool of roughly 8-10 similarly prominent and controversial agreements, this represents a withdrawal rate of approximately 40-50%. This class suggests a high propensity for withdrawal from agreements perceived as constraining U.S. sovereignty or providing insufficient benefit.
- **Reference Class 2: U.S. presidential administrations' actions on ratified arms control treaties since the Cold War.** Historically, formal U.S. withdrawal from major, ratified arms control treaties is extremely rare. The ABM Treaty withdrawal (2002) is a notable exception. Most treaties are either extended, superseded, or allowed to expire. The base rate for an administration actively withdrawing from a cornerstone treaty like the NPT, CWC, or BWC is very low, likely <5%.
- **Reasoning:** Class 1 is more pertinent due to the specific actor (Trump), whose foreign policy approach represents a significant departure from his predecessors. However, Class 2 highlights the institutional inertia and strong bipartisan/allied support that protects certain foundational treaties. The forecast should anchor on Class 1's higher base rate but be tempered by the specific nature of the treaties in question.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-10-06** Trump suggests willingness to extend New START with Russia. **(↓)** — This is a significant de-escalatory signal regarding the most at-risk treaty on the list. It indicates a preference for negotiation and extension over immediate withdrawal, directly countering the primary path to a "Yes" resolution.
- **2025-09-23** Trump pledges to lead an AI-based enforcement effort for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) at the UN. **(↓)** — This action frames the administration as a champion and modernizer of a key treaty, not its antagonist. It makes a withdrawal attempt from the BWC before year-end extremely unlikely.
- **2020-11-22** U.S. formally withdraws from the Open Skies Treaty. **(↑)** — This event, from the first term, reinforces the base rate established in Reference Class 1, demonstrating a willingness to exit treaties due to perceived non-compliance by adversaries.
- **2020-04-07** Trump signs executive order encouraging moon mining, supporting the Outer Space Treaty (OST). **(↓)** — This historical data point shows that even during the first term, the administration differentiated between treaties, actively supporting the OST. This lowers the probability of an OST withdrawal attempt.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **"America First" Ideology (Large ↑):** A core driver is the belief that international agreements subordinate U.S. interests to globalist agendas. Treaties seen as restricting U.S. military or economic freedom are natural targets.
- **Perceived Adversary Non-Compliance (Large ↑):** Citing Russian or Chinese cheating (as with the INF and Open Skies treaties) provides a powerful public and international justification for withdrawal, framing the U.S. as the party upholding integrity.
- **Leverage in Negotiations (Moderate ↑):** The threat of withdrawal can be used as a bargaining chip to force concessions from adversaries (e.g., demanding China's inclusion in arms control) or to renegotiate terms more favorable to the U.S. An "attempt" could be part of this strategy.
- **Pressure from Allies and Congress (Moderate ↓):** Key allies in NATO and Asia strongly support the existing arms control architecture for strategic stability. Bipartisan support exists for foundational treaties like the CWC and NPT, creating domestic political friction against withdrawal.
- **Institutional Inertia (Moderate ↓):** The Department of Defense and State Department often value treaties for the predictability, stability, and intelligence-sharing they provide. This can create internal resistance to radical changes.
- **Focus on a Single Adversary (China) (Small ↓):** The administration may prioritize stabilizing the nuclear relationship with Russia via a short-term New START extension to focus diplomatic and military resources on the challenge from China.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Shift from Withdrawal to Negotiation:** Unlike the first-term pattern of outright withdrawal, the most recent 2025 evidence (re: New START) points towards a strategy of negotiation and extension, even if short-term. This is a significant tactical shift.
- **Imminent Treaty Expiration:** New START, the most likely target, expires in February 2026. With only months remaining, a formal withdrawal provides less strategic benefit than using the expiration deadline as leverage for a new deal or a conditional extension.
- **Active Support for Some Treaties:** The administration's recent championing of the BWC demonstrates a nuanced approach, differentiating between treaties it sees as flawed versus those it can use to project strength and leadership. This contrasts with a more monolithic anti-agreement stance from the first term.
- **Extremely Short Timeframe:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026, leaving less than three months from the current date (Oct 7, 2025). This is a very narrow window for the complex political and bureaucratic process of initiating a formal treaty withdrawal, especially with holiday recesses approaching.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Based on the first-term record (Reference Class 1), a prior of **~40%** seems appropriate, reflecting a strong predisposition to exit international agreements (equivalent n ≈ 5).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **(↓ Large):** Recent (Oct 2025) statements of willingness to *extend* New START, the most plausible candidate for withdrawal.
    - **(↓ Large):** Recent (Sep 2025) public championing of the BWC, removing another treaty from the likely target list.
    - **(↓ Moderate):** The very short timeframe (~12 weeks) for action makes a complex withdrawal process less likely to be initiated.
    - **(↑ Small):** The underlying "America First" ideology and key personnel known for treaty skepticism remain, preserving a non-zero chance of an abrupt, symbolic action.
- **Net effect:** The recent, specific, and powerful evidence pointing toward negotiation and selective enforcement should drive the posterior **down significantly** from the 40% prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - Appointment of known arms control skeptics (e.g., a John Bolton-like figure) to key national security roles.
    - Public, high-level U.S. accusations of Russian or Chinese non-compliance with any of the seven treaties.
    - A sudden breakdown in New START extension talks, accompanied by hostile rhetoric.
    - Leaks about internal administration debates considering withdrawal as a "Plan B."
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Formal scheduling of U.S.-Russia talks on New START extension.
    - Positive statements from NATO allies about U.S. commitment to strategic stability.
    - Administration officials publicly emphasizing the verification and stability benefits of existing treaties.
    - Continued focus on leveraging, rather than leaving, treaties (e.g., proposing new enforcement mechanisms).

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Presidential Volatility:** Policy can change rapidly based on the President's personal decisions, overriding staff recommendations. A single event or perceived slight could trigger an abrupt reversal.
- **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria include "suspension of compliance" and "substantive defunding," which could be subject to interpretation and might occur with less warning than a formal withdrawal notification.
- **"Madman Theory" Risk:** The administration could attempt a withdrawal purely for disruptive effect or as a negotiation tactic, even if it seems strategically illogical.
- **Information Asymmetry:** The public has limited insight into internal White House deliberations. A decision could be made and executed with little advance public warning.
- **Geopolitical Shocks:** A major global crisis (e.g., a regional war, a nuclear test by a new state) before the end of the year could dramatically alter the administration's strategic calculus.

**Final Research Summary:**
The administration's first-term record creates a strong prior for withdrawal. However, recent evidence from late 2025 indicates a significant tactical shift towards negotiation on New START and active support for the BWC, making a withdrawal attempt from any of the seven listed treaties before 2026 unlikely.

To forecast the probability of the Trump administration attempting to withdraw from key international arms control agreements in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1**: Trump's first-term actions on major international agreements (2017-2021) show a withdrawal rate of approximately 40-50% from prominent agreements. This suggests a high propensity for withdrawal.
- **Reference Class 2**: Historically, U.S. withdrawal from major, ratified arms control treaties is rare, with a base rate likely <5%.
- **Chosen Base Rate**: Given Trump's specific history and the nature of the question, we start with a prior probability of **40%**, reflecting the higher propensity for withdrawal during his first term.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The administration's "America First" ideology and skepticism towards international constraints remain consistent with the first term.
- **Differences**: Recent actions suggest a shift towards negotiation (e.g., willingness to extend New START) and support for some treaties (e.g., BWC), which were not as evident in the first term.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **New START Extension Willingness (↓ Large)**: Trump's suggestion to extend New START significantly decreases the likelihood of withdrawal from this treaty.
- **BWC Support (↓ Large)**: Public support for the BWC further reduces the probability of withdrawal attempts.
- **Short Timeframe (↓ Moderate)**: The limited time before the question resolves makes a complex withdrawal process less likely.
- **America First Ideology (↑ Small)**: The underlying ideology still supports the possibility of withdrawal, albeit less strongly given recent actions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds**: 40% probability translates to odds of 0.4 / 0.6 = 0.67.
- **Likelihood Ratios**:
  - New START Extension: Strong evidence against withdrawal, likelihood ratio < 1.
  - BWC Support: Strong evidence against withdrawal, likelihood ratio < 1.
  - Short Timeframe: Moderate evidence against withdrawal, likelihood ratio < 1.
  - America First Ideology: Weak evidence for withdrawal, likelihood ratio > 1.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation**: The combined effect of the evidence significantly reduces the odds from the prior.
- **Posterior Probability**: After updating, the probability is reduced from the prior of 40% to a lower value, reflecting the strong evidence against withdrawal.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of rapid policy shifts or unforeseen geopolitical events that could increase withdrawal likelihood.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A sudden breakdown in negotiations or a geopolitical crisis could alter the administration's calculus.
- **Adjustment**: Given these considerations, the probability should be slightly adjusted upwards to account for tail risks.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability**: Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the final forecast is a calibrated probability reflecting both the prior and the impact of the evidence.

Final: 15%

# Forecasting Trump Administration's Withdrawal from Key Arms Control Agreements in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use two reference classes to establish a prior:

**Reference Class 1: Trump's first-term withdrawal rate from major international agreements (2017-2021)**
During his first term, Trump withdrew from several significant international agreements:
- Paris Climate Agreement
- Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA)
- INF Treaty
- Open Skies Treaty
- UNESCO
- UN Human Rights Council

Out of approximately 10-12 major international agreements the US was party to, Trump withdrew from about 6, giving a base rate of ~50%.

**Reference Class 2: US withdrawal from ratified arms control treaties historically**
Formal US withdrawal from established arms control treaties is rare. Notable examples include:
- ABM Treaty (2002, under Bush)
- INF Treaty (2019, under Trump)
- Open Skies (2020, under Trump)

The historical base rate across all administrations is much lower, around 10-15%.

Given that this question specifically concerns the Trump administration, Reference Class 1 is more directly applicable. However, arms control treaties specifically (Reference Class 2) have stronger institutional protection than other types of agreements.

**Initial Prior: 40%**
This reflects Trump's demonstrated willingness to withdraw from international agreements, slightly tempered by the specific nature of arms control treaties.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Same decision-maker (Trump) with consistent "America First" ideology
- Similar skepticism toward international constraints on US sovereignty
- Consistent pattern of using withdrawal as negotiation leverage
- Similar personnel likely to be involved in decision-making

**Key differences:**
- Very limited timeframe (less than 3 months remaining in 2025)
- Recent evidence (Oct 2025) suggests willingness to extend New START
- Recent evidence (Sep 2025) shows active support for the BWC
- New START expiration in Feb 2026 creates different incentives than in first term
- More experience with consequences of first-term withdrawals

These differences, particularly the recent signals about New START extension and BWC support, suggest a lower probability than the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's willingness to extend New START (Oct 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Trump plans to withdraw, expressing willingness to extend is unlikely (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If Trump doesn't plan to withdraw, expressing willingness to extend is highly likely (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 2: Trump's pledge to lead BWC enforcement (Sep 2025)**
- P(E|H): If planning withdrawal, actively championing a treaty is unlikely (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If not planning withdrawal, championing a treaty is moderately likely (~70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.43
- This evidence moderately decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Limited timeframe (less than 3 months)**
- P(E|H): The probability of initiating withdrawal in such a short timeframe is low (~40%)
- P(E|~H): The probability of not initiating withdrawal in this timeframe is high (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44
- This evidence moderately decreases probability

**Evidence 4: First-term pattern of treaty withdrawals**
- P(E|H): If planning withdrawal, past pattern is very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If not planning withdrawal, past pattern is somewhat likely (~50%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- This evidence moderately increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability of 40% (odds of 0.67:1)

**Update on Evidence 1 (New START extension willingness):**
- Prior odds: 0.67:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 0.25 = 0.17:1
- Posterior probability: 0.17/(1+0.17) = 14.5%

**Update on Evidence 2 (BWC enforcement pledge):**
- Prior odds: 0.17:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.17 × 0.43 = 0.07:1
- Posterior probability: 0.07/(1+0.07) = 6.5%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Limited timeframe):**
- Prior odds: 0.07:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44
- Posterior odds: 0.07 × 0.44 = 0.03:1
- Posterior probability: 0.03/(1+0.03) = 2.9%

**Update on Evidence 4 (First-term pattern):**
- Prior odds: 0.03:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 0.03 × 1.8 = 0.054:1
- Posterior probability: 0.054/(1+0.054) = 5.1%

This sequential updating yields a posterior probability of approximately 5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent statements about New START and BWC, which could be strategic positioning rather than true intent
- The short timeframe might actually incentivize quick, symbolic actions before year-end
- I might underestimate Trump's unpredictability and willingness to make sudden policy shifts
- The resolution criteria include "suspension of compliance" and "substantive defunding," which could happen more easily than formal withdrawal

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major geopolitical crisis could trigger rapid policy change
- Internal advisors might push for withdrawal as a negotiating tactic
- Trump might use treaty withdrawal as a distraction from domestic issues
- A perceived slight from Russia or China could trigger retaliatory withdrawal

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would be 15-20%, giving more weight to Trump's unpredictability and the pattern from his first term. This forecast would emphasize that even with recent positive signals, Trump has historically reversed course suddenly on international agreements.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While Trump's unpredictability is a factor, the concrete recent evidence (Oct 2025) specifically about New START extension is highly relevant. Additionally, the extremely short timeframe makes the bureaucratic process of withdrawal challenging to complete before 2026.

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward from 5% to 8% to account for unpredictability and the possibility of sudden policy shifts.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate of Trump's first-term withdrawal pattern, updating on recent evidence about New START extension and BWC support, accounting for the limited timeframe, and red-teaming my analysis, I forecast an 8% probability that the Trump administration will attempt to withdraw from key international arms control agreements in 2025.

Final: 8%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the foreign policy actions of the Trump administration during its first term (2017-2021). During this four-year period, the administration withdrew from several major international agreements, including three key security/arms control-related ones: the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA), the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, and the Open Skies Treaty. This establishes a pattern of willingness to exit agreements perceived as constraining U.S. sovereignty or unfair.

Out of a pool of prominent international agreements, the first Trump term saw withdrawals from roughly 40-50% of those it targeted for criticism. This suggests a high propensity for such actions. Therefore, I will set the prior probability P(H) of a Trump administration attempting to withdraw from at least one of the seven listed arms control treaties in 2025 at **40%**.

In odds form, this is P(H) / P(~H) = 0.40 / 0.60 ≈ 0.67.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The actor (Donald Trump) and the underlying "America First" ideology are the same as in the first term, suggesting similar decision-making patterns.
*   The types of agreements at risk (those limiting U.S. military capabilities) are consistent with past targets like the INF and Open Skies treaties.

**Differences:**
*   **Imminent Expiration:** New START, the most likely target, is set to expire in February 2026. This creates a natural deadline, making an active withdrawal in late 2025 less necessary than simply letting it expire or using the deadline as negotiating leverage.
*   **Extremely Short Timeframe:** The question resolves on January 1, 2026. With the current date being October 7, 2025, there are fewer than 12 weeks remaining. This is a very narrow window to initiate and formalize such a significant policy decision, especially considering the upcoming holiday season.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the Trump administration attempts to withdraw from a key agreement in 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Trump suggests willingness to extend New START with Russia (October 6, 2025).**
    *   P(E1 | H): The likelihood of this statement, if the administration secretly intended to withdraw from a treaty before year-end, is very low. New START is the most plausible target, and this statement signals the opposite intent.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The likelihood of this statement, if the administration's plan is to negotiate, delay, or let the treaty expire naturally in 2026, is very high. It aligns perfectly with a non-withdrawal strategy for 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Very low (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability of H.

*   **Evidence 2: Trump pledges to lead an AI-based enforcement effort for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) (September 23, 2025).**
    *   P(E2 | H): This is moderately unlikely. While the administration could withdraw from one treaty while championing another, this action sets a tone of international engagement and leadership, which is at odds with a concurrent push to abandon a different treaty.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): This is very likely. It fits a narrative of "reforming" or "leading" on international security, which is a plausible alternative to simple withdrawalism.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Low (< 1). This evidence decreases the probability of H by removing the BWC as a likely target and suggesting a more nuanced policy.

*   **Evidence 3: The short timeframe remaining in 2025.**
    *   This is structural evidence. The fact that no attempt has been made in the first nine months of the year makes an attempt in the final, holiday-shortened three months less likely. The bureaucratic and political process for such a move takes time.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Low (< 1). This evidence decreases the probability of H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 40% (odds of 0.67), we must update based on the powerful new evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 0.67
*   **Evidence:** The combined effect of the recent statements on New START and the BWC, plus the short timeframe, points strongly toward a "No" resolution. The statement on New START is particularly impactful, as it addresses the most probable path to a "Yes." A combined likelihood ratio for this new information would be very small. Let's estimate a conservative combined LR of 0.2, reflecting a five-fold decrease in the odds.
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.67 × 0.2 = 0.134
*   **Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)**
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.134 / (1 + 0.134) ≈ 11.8%

The new evidence has drastically reduced the probability from the initial 40% prior to around 12%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if I am over-weighting recent, potentially tactical statements and under-weighting the president's known volatility.

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The statement on extending New START could be a negotiation tactic. The administration could make an "offer" it knows Russia will reject (e.g., demanding Chinese inclusion on short notice) and then use that rejection as a pretext to suspend compliance before the end of the year. This could happen very quickly.
*   **Broad Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves "Yes" on an "attempt," which includes "suspension of compliance" or "substantive defunding." These actions are potentially faster and require less process than a formal treaty withdrawal, making them more plausible within the short timeframe.
*   **"Madman Theory":** The president could make an impulsive decision to withdraw from a treaty to project strength or disrupt the international order, overriding any internal processes or recent stated intentions.

These risks are real and prevent the probability from being near zero. The most plausible path to "Yes" is a rapid breakdown of New START talks leading to a suspension of compliance. While the recent evidence makes this path less likely, it has not been eliminated. My posterior of ~12% seems to appropriately balance the strong negative evidence with this significant tail risk.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate, derived from President Trump's first term, is high, suggesting a 40% chance of a withdrawal attempt in 2025. However, very strong and recent evidence from September and October 2025 points in the opposite direction. Statements indicating a willingness to extend New START and to champion the BWC signal a strategy of negotiation and selective engagement, not imminent withdrawal. Combined with the very short timeframe remaining in the year, this evidence warrants a significant downward update. While the risk of an abrupt policy reversal remains, the probability of a withdrawal attempt before January 1, 2026, is now low.

Final: 12%
