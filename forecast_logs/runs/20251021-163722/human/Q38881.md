### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: Historical Precedent & Base Rates:** What is the historical frequency of terrorist attacks causing casualties in the U.S.? Specifically, what is the rate of attacks using novel or improvised technologies? Have there been any prior drone-related terrorist plots or attempts in the U.S.?
*   **Q2: Actor Capability & Intent:** What is the technical threshold for weaponizing a commercial drone to cause injury or death? How has this been affected by recent conflicts (e.g., Ukraine)? Is there evidence of U.S.-based extremist groups expressing intent or developing the capability to use drones for attacks?
*   **Q3: Defensive Landscape & Countermeasures:** What is the current state of U.S. counter-drone (C-UAS) technology and deployment? How effective are these systems at detecting and mitigating threats from small, commercial-style drones, particularly outside of hardened military or government sites?
*   **Q4: Regulatory & Supply Chain Environment:** How do current and proposed regulations (e.g., the DJI ban, Remote ID) affect the availability and anonymous use of drones suitable for an attack? Will these measures meaningfully impede a determined actor?

**2. Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1:**
    *   `"Global Terrorism Database United States casualties by year"`
    *   `"successful vs foiled terrorist plots US 2015-2025"`
    *   `"history of novel weapon use terrorism US"`
    *   `"US foiled drone terrorist plot" OR "arrest drone attack plan"`
    *   `"2022 Pennsylvania power substation drone plot"`
*   **Q2:**
    *   `"weaponizing commercial FPV drone guide"`
    *   `"3D printed drone bomb release mechanism"`
    *   `"terrorist drone tactics lessons from Ukraine ISIS"`
    *   `"FBI report domestic violent extremist drone use"`
    *   `"online extremist forums drone attack discussion"`
*   **Q3:**
    *   `"DHS C-UAS strategy 2025"`
    *   `"US law enforcement counter-drone capabilities"`
    *   `"commercial C-UAS systems for stadiums airports"`
    *   `"effectiveness of drone detection systems urban environment"`
*   **Q4:**
    *   `"impact of Countering CCP Drones Act on drone market"`
    *   `"alternatives to DJI drones for commercial use"`
    *   `"bypassing FAA Remote ID drone"`
    *   `"availability of non-DJI drones with payload capacity"`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The research indicates a significant divergence between technological possibility and demonstrated reality. The technical barrier to weaponizing a drone is now extremely low, with knowledge widely disseminated from the war in Ukraine. However, the historical base rate of any terrorist attack causing casualties in the U.S. is very low, and the rate for attacks using novel technologies is even lower. There have been documented plots (e.g., against a power grid), demonstrating intent, but these have been unsophisticated and were thwarted. The defensive landscape is rapidly evolving, but C-UAS coverage is concentrated on high-value targets, leaving many soft targets vulnerable. The potential DJI ban is a major factor, but its primary effect may be to increase friction and cost for attackers rather than creating an insurmountable barrier, as numerous alternative drones exist. The core tension is whether the radical accessibility of this new weapon vector will finally break the historical trend of low-capability domestic terror plots.

**4. Drafting the Comprehensive Answer:**

The following brief is structured to present these synthesized findings in the required format for the Bayesian forecasting panel.

***

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Terrorist Attacks with Casualties in the U.S. (Post-9/11):** From 2002-2023, the Global Terrorism Database shows a fluctuating but low number of attacks causing at least one fatality in the U.S., averaging approximately 5-6 events per year. Most are carried out by lone actors using conventional firearms. This suggests a base rate of ~6-8 such events occurring over the ~14-month forecast horizon.
2.  **Attacks Using Novel/Improvised Technology:** Successful U.S. terrorist attacks employing a fundamentally new vector of attack are exceptionally rare, occurring perhaps once per decade (e.g., 9/11 using planes as missiles, 1993 WTC bombing with a large vehicle-borne IED). This reference class suggests a very low base rate, perhaps 10-15% over a 14-month period.
3.  **Known U.S. Drone Plots:** There have been a handful of documented plots involving drones, but none have resulted in injury or death. Examples include a 2022 plot to attack a Pennsylvania power substation and a 2018 plan to disrupt the Super Bowl. This reference class has a historical base rate of zero successful attacks.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-15** DJI appeals Pentagon's "Chinese Military Company" designation. (→) — This legal battle prolongs uncertainty but doesn't immediately change drone availability for non-federal users, maintaining the status quo for potential malicious actors.
*   **2025-07-24** FY2025 NDAA sets a Dec 23, 2025 deadline for a DJI security audit. (↓) — The approaching deadline for a potential ban on new DJI sales could slightly reduce the pool of the most popular, user-friendly drones available to unsophisticated actors.
*   **2025-07-15** DoD accelerates procurement of low-cost drones for all squads by FY2026. (↑) — This normalizes drone technology and accelerates U.S. military expertise, which could indirectly improve C-UAS capabilities, but also signals the tech's broad utility.
*   **2024-10-02** GAO report details negative impact of existing foreign drone bans on government services. (→) — Highlights the difficulty and cost of replacing DJI, suggesting that a full commercial ban would be disruptive and potentially push users (including malicious ones) to less-trackable alternatives.
*   **2024-09-11** House passes the Countering CCP Drones Act to place DJI on the FCC's Covered List. (↓) — The most significant legislative step towards a ban. If passed by the Senate and signed, it would curb the supply of new, easy-to-use DJI drones.
*   **2024-05-00** (Approx.) Widespread dissemination of FPV drone weaponization techniques from the Ukraine conflict becomes mainstream in online communities. (↑) — Drastically lowers the technical barrier for building a lethal drone, moving it from a niche skill to something achievable with online guides.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Technology Accessibility & Skill Diffusion (Large ↑):** The war in Ukraine has served as a global, open-source R&D lab for weaponizing commercial drones. Tutorials and tactics are widely available, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry for motivated actors.
*   **Counter-UAS (C-UAS) Proliferation (Moderate ↓):** Federal, state, and local agencies, as well as private venues, are increasingly deploying C-UAS systems. Their effectiveness is unproven against a clever attacker, but their presence at high-profile targets acts as a significant deterrent.
*   **Actor Anonymity & Low Risk (Moderate ↑):** Unlike suicide attacks or active shootings, a drone attack allows the operator to be kilometers away, drastically reducing personal risk and increasing the appeal for less-committed or more cautious actors.
*   **Regulatory Friction (Small ↓):** The potential DJI ban and existing FAA rules like Remote ID add complexity and potential traceability. However, determined actors can use non-DJI drones, build their own, or disable tracking hardware.
*   **Domestic Extremist Capability (Large, uncertain):** The primary bottleneck remains the gap between intent and technical/operational capability of U.S.-based violent extremists, who have historically favored simpler methods like firearms. A shift in capability is the key uncertainty.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Rate of Technological Diffusion:** Unlike prior novel threats (e.g., chemical, biological), the core technology is a cheap, mass-market consumer good, and weaponization knowledge is being refined and shared globally in near real-time.
*   **Dual-Use Nature:** The purchase of a high-end consumer drone and 3D printer is not an inherent red flag in the way that acquiring precursor chemicals or illegal firearms might be. This complicates detection at the procurement stage.
*   **Asymmetric Defensive Challenge:** Defenders must protect a vast number of potential soft targets (public gatherings, infrastructure, VIPs), while an attacker only needs to find one vulnerability. C-UAS deployment will inevitably be patchy.
*   **Lack of a "Command and Control" Precedent:** Unlike IEDs, which have a long history of use by organized groups (IRA, ISIS), FPV drone attacks are a newer phenomenon largely pioneered in a state-on-state conflict. The TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) have not yet been fully adopted and productized by traditional terrorist organizations for use in the West.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior based on the reference class of novel-tech attacks causing casualties (e.g., ~10-15% for the 14-month period). This reflects an equivalent of observing roughly 1-2 such events over a 10-year period.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Massive diffusion of weaponization know-how from Ukraine significantly increases the *potential* for an attack.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The continued absence of any such attack in the U.S. to date, despite years of drone availability, is strong evidence against existing actors having the will or capability.
    *   (↓ Small) Increasing regulatory pressure (DJI ban) and C-UAS deployment at hard targets slightly raises the cost and complexity for attackers.
    *   (↑ Small) Documented-but-foiled plots confirm that intent exists at a low level.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence pushes in both directions. The dramatic increase in *capability* (knowledge diffusion) argues for a significant upward update from the historical base rate. However, the continued *lack of events* provides strong countervailing evidence. The posterior should be higher than the historical base rate but remain low in absolute

To forecast the probability of an aerial drone terrorist attack resulting in injury or death in the United States before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate for Terrorist Attacks with Casualties in the U.S.:** Historically, there are approximately 5-6 terrorist attacks causing casualties in the U.S. per year. Over a 14-month period, this suggests a base rate of about 6-8 events.
   - **Base Rate for Attacks Using Novel/Improvised Technology:** Such attacks are rare, occurring perhaps once per decade. This suggests a base rate of 10-15% over a 14-month period.
   - **Base Rate for Drone-Related Attacks:** There have been no successful drone-related terrorist attacks in the U.S. to date, suggesting a base rate of near zero.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The potential for drone attacks is similar to other novel technologies in that they are rare and have not been successfully executed in the U.S.
   - **Differences:** The widespread availability and ease of weaponizing drones, as demonstrated in the Ukraine conflict, significantly increase the potential for such an attack compared to historical novel technologies.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Increased Capability (↑):** The diffusion of drone weaponization knowledge from Ukraine increases the likelihood of an attack.
   - **Regulatory and Defensive Measures (↓):** Increasing regulatory pressure and C-UAS deployment decrease the likelihood of a successful attack.
   - **Historical Absence of Drone Attacks (↓):** The lack of past drone attacks in the U.S. suggests a lower likelihood of future attacks.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Probability:** Start with a low prior based on the base rate for novel-tech attacks (10-15%).
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** The increase in capability suggests an upward adjustment, but the absence of past attacks and defensive measures suggest a downward adjustment.
   - **Posterior Probability:** The evidence suggests a modest increase from the base rate, but the probability remains low in absolute terms.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of underestimating the impact of technological diffusion and overestimating the effectiveness of defensive measures.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden increase in domestic extremist capability or a failure in C-UAS systems could increase the probability.
   - **Adjustments:** Given these considerations, a slight upward adjustment from the initial posterior probability is warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the final forecast probability is adjusted to reflect the increased potential due to technological diffusion, balanced by the historical absence of such attacks and defensive measures.

Final: 20%

# Probability of a Drone Terrorist Attack Causing Injury/Death in the US before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for terrorist attacks using novel technologies that cause casualties in the US.

Looking at the reference classes provided in the research:
- Terrorist attacks with casualties in the US post-9/11: ~5-6 events per year
- Attacks using novel/improvised technology: ~1 per decade (10-15% over 14 months)
- Known US drone plots: 0 successful attacks to date

The most relevant reference class is "attacks using novel/improvised technology" since we're specifically looking at aerial drones as a novel attack vector. The base rate for this is approximately 10-15% over a 14-month period.

Given that we have approximately 14 months left in the forecast window (from October 2025 to January 2026), I'll use a prior of 12% - the midpoint of the 10-15% range.

**Prior probability: 12%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The general security environment in the US remains robust with multiple layers of intelligence and law enforcement
- Terrorist attacks in the US remain relatively rare events
- Most potential attackers still face significant operational security challenges

**Differences from base case:**
- Unprecedented diffusion of drone weaponization knowledge from Ukraine war
- Drones offer a unique standoff capability (operator can be kilometers away)
- Dual-use nature of drones makes procurement less suspicious than other weapons
- The technical barrier to weaponizing commercial drones has dramatically decreased
- Defensive coverage against drones is uneven, with many soft targets remaining vulnerable

These differences suggest the need for an upward adjustment from the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Widespread dissemination of FPV drone weaponization techniques from Ukraine**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If a drone attack occurs, it's highly likely that knowledge from Ukraine would be utilized
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This knowledge would still spread even without an attack occurring
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Continued absence of successful drone attacks in the US despite years of availability**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If an attack is imminent, we would expect to have seen at least attempts
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If no attack will occur, this absence is expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375 (decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Regulatory pressure (potential DJI ban) and C-UAS deployment**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - These measures would exist regardless of whether an attack occurs
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - These measures would still be implemented for security reasons
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.86 (slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Documented-but-foiled plots confirming intent exists**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If an attack will occur, we'd expect to see prior plots
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Some plots might exist even if no successful attack occurs
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 12%/(100%-12%) = 0.136

First update (Evidence 1):
- Posterior odds = 0.136 × 1.8 = 0.245
- Posterior probability = 0.245/(1+0.245) ≈ 19.7%

Second update (Evidence 2):
- Posterior odds = 0.245 × 0.375 = 0.092
- Posterior probability = 0.092/(1+0.092) ≈ 8.4%

Third update (Evidence 3):
- Posterior odds = 0.092 × 0.86 = 0.079
- Posterior probability = 0.079/(1+0.079) ≈ 7.3%

Fourth update (Evidence 4):
- Posterior odds = 0.079 × 1.6 = 0.126
- Posterior probability = 0.126/(1+0.126) ≈ 11.2%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 11.2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of knowledge diffusion from Ukraine. The technical barrier has fallen dramatically, which could lead to a step-change in capability.
- I might be overweighting the historical absence of attacks. Novel attack vectors often appear suddenly after a long period of absence.
- The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 15.4%, suggesting I might be underestimating the risk.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sophisticated lone actor with technical skills could bypass C-UAS systems at soft targets.
- A foreign terrorist organization could deploy this tactic in the US after testing it elsewhere.
- The potential DJI ban might actually accelerate attacks by creating a "use it or lose it" mentality among potential attackers.

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast slightly upward. The community forecast of 15.4% suggests I may be underestimating the risk, but I believe my systematic approach has captured the key factors. I'll adjust my final forecast to 13%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 13%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of "successful terrorist attacks in the U.S. using a novel or highly improvised technology to cause casualties."

*   **Historical Frequency:** Successful attacks of this nature are exceptionally rare. Major examples include the 1993 World Trade Center bombing (large, sophisticated vehicle-borne IED) and the 9/11 attacks (using airplanes as missiles). These events occur on a timescale of perhaps once per decade.
*   **Calculation:** A rate of one such event every 10 years is 0.1 events/year. The question's time frame is approximately 1.78 years (March 22, 2024, to Dec 31, 2025).
*   **Prior Probability:** Using a Poisson distribution, the expected number of events (μ) in the period is 0.1 events/year * 1.78 years = 0.178. The probability of at least one event is P(H) = 1 - e^(-μ) = 1 - e^(-0.178) ≈ 1 - 0.837 = 0.163.

Therefore, I will set the initial prior probability P(H) at **16%** for the entire ~21-month period. This reflects the inherent difficulty and rarity of successfully executing a new type of mass-casualty attack.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like past novel attacks, a drone attack requires planning, technical skill, and avoiding detection by law enforcement. The actors are likely to be from the same pool of domestic extremists or lone actors who have historically struggled with operational complexity.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Accessibility (Increases Probability):** The primary difference is the radical accessibility of the technology. The core components are cheap consumer goods, and the weaponization knowledge has been democratized and battle-tested in the Ukraine conflict. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry compared to building a large bomb or hijacking an airplane.
    *   **Operator Risk (Increases Probability):** The attack can be launched from a distance, removing the need for the attacker to be a martyr or risk being caught at the scene. This may broaden its appeal.
    *   **Detection (Increases Probability):** Procuring a commercial drone and 3D-printing materials is far less suspicious than acquiring large quantities of precursor chemicals, making plots harder for law enforcement to detect pre-emptively.

These differences suggest the historical base rate is likely too low for this specific technology.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the prior based on key evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Widespread diffusion of drone weaponization techniques from Ukraine.**
    *   P(E | H): If a drone attack were to occur, it is almost certain that the attacker would leverage this newly available, widespread knowledge. So, P(E | H) is very high.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no attack occurs, it would be in spite of this knowledge being available. The absence of an attack given this "enabling" evidence suggests other factors (intent, final-mile capability, etc.) are the true bottlenecks.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence strongly increases the probability. The base rate for "novel attacks" doesn't account for a technology where the "how-to" guide is being refined daily and shared globally. This evidence is strong enough to at least double the initial odds.
    *   **Update:** Prior odds = 0.16 / 0.84 ≈ 1:5.25. New odds ≈ 1:5.25 * 2.5 = 1:2.1. New probability ≈ 1 / 3.1 ≈ 32%.

*   **Evidence 2: Passage of time without an event.**
    *   **The Situation:** As of October 21, 2025, approximately 19 months of the 21.3-month resolution period have passed with no event. This is the single most powerful piece of evidence.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This is extremely strong evidence against the hypothesis. If the probability of an attack were truly high (e.g., 32% over 21.3 months), the fact that we have gone 90% of the way through the period without an incident makes it much less likely to occur in the small remaining window.
    *   **Update:** Using the 32% probability for the full period, we can calculate a constant monthly hazard rate. The probability of an event in the remaining 2.3 months, conditional on no event so far, drops significantly.
        *   P(event in 2.3 months | no event in 19 months) ≈ 4%. (Calculation: P_full = 0.32. P_monthly = 1 - (1-0.32)^(1/21.3) ≈ 1.8%. P_remaining = 1 - (1-0.018)^2.3 ≈ 4.1%).
        *   This evidence dramatically reduces the probability from 32% to ~4%.

*   **Evidence 3: Countermeasures and Regulation (DJI Ban, C-UAS).**
    *   P(E | H): An attack would likely happen at a soft target where C-UAS is absent, and a determined actor could bypass a DJI ban by using other models or older hardware.
    *   P(E | ~H): The presence of these countermeasures, even if imperfect, adds friction and complexity, potentially deterring less-capable actors.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence slightly decreases the probability. It raises the bar for a successful attack, but only marginally, as determined actors can circumvent these measures. This nudges the probability down from 4% to perhaps 3%.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Prior:** Started at 16% for the full period based on the rarity of novel-tech attacks.
2.  **Update (Capability):** The massive increase in accessible knowledge from Ukraine is a game-changer, raising the estimated probability for the full period to ~32%.
3.  **Update (Time):** The fact that ~90% of the time has elapsed without an incident is overwhelming evidence. This conditions the forecast on the remaining time, reducing the probability to ~4%.
4.  **Update (Barriers):** Countermeasures and regulations provide a small, final downward nudge to ~3%.

The resulting posterior probability is low, dominated by the fact that the event has not yet happened despite the theoretical potential being high for over a year.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis leads to a very low number, much lower than the community forecast of 15.4%. Why could I be wrong?

*   **Flawed Assumption:** I assumed a constant hazard rate. It's plausible the hazard rate is *increasing* as skills and technology proliferate. The past 19 months could have been a "learning and preparation" phase for a potential attacker, with the highest risk period being now.
*   **Black Swan Actor:** My forecast is based on the demonstrated (low) capabilities of typical U.S. domestic extremists. It does not sufficiently account for a highly competent lone actor or a foreign-directed operative who has the skills to succeed where others have failed.
*   **Low Bar for "Injury":** The resolution criteria include "injury," which could be minor. A small drone with a crude payload (e.g., dropping nails or a small explosive) into a crowd could easily cause a minor injury, even if it's not a mass-casualty event. My base rate is anchored on fatal attacks.

Considering these points, my calculated 3% seems too precise and potentially overconfident in the "nothing has happened yet" evidence. The community forecast seems too high as it likely hasn't fully accounted for the elapsed time. I will adjust my forecast upward from the calculated value to incorporate the "increasing risk" and "competent actor" scenarios, but still keep it in the low single digits. A 1-in-20 chance over the next ~70 days feels like a more robust estimate.

### 6. Final Forecast

My final probability is anchored to a low base rate for novel attacks but is significantly adjusted by two powerful, opposing factors. The unprecedented diffusion of drone weaponization technology dramatically increases the potential for an attack. However, the fact that nearly all of the resolution period has passed without an incident is extremely strong evidence that the necessary combination of intent and capability is not yet present or has been successfully thwarted. My final forecast of 5% reflects the small remaining time window while acknowledging the non-zero tail risk of a competent actor succeeding before the deadline.

Final: 5%
