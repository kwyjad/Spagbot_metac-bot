### Reference class & base rates
1.  **UNFCCC COP Host Selection by Designated Regional Group:** The process is designed for the designated regional group to select a host. This is the standard outcome. In over 30 COPs, the vast majority have been hosted by a country from the designated group. **Base Rate: >90%** that one of the bidding countries (Australia or Turkey) is selected.
2.  **Contested Bids within a Regional Group:** It is not uncommon for multiple countries to express interest, but it is less common for a public, prolonged deadlock between two official bids to persist. The recent COP29 selection for the Eastern European Group was deadlocked for over a year due to geopolitical conflict before a compromise (Azerbaijan) was found. In such cases, the initial front-runner with broader support often prevails, but the probability of a surprise or compromise outcome increases. **Base Rate:** In a contested bid, the front-runner (Australia) likely still wins **60-70%** of the time, with the challenger (Turkey) or a compromise/default (Germany) accounting for the rest.
3.  **Default to Bonn, Germany:** The UNFCCC rules allow for the conference to be held in Bonn if no consensus is reached. This is the "failure state" of the selection process and is politically undesirable for all parties as it signals a breakdown in regional diplomacy. This has not happened for a full COP in the modern era. **Base Rate: <5%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-18** Australia submits an ambitious 2035 climate target (62-70% reduction) to the UNFCCC. — **↑ Australia** — This move is a significant "good faith" signal, strengthening its diplomatic position and climate credentials to lead the talks.
*   **2025-09-03** Australian government website re-confirms its active bid to co-host with the Pacific ahead of COP30. — **↔ No change** — Confirms continued commitment but does not change the state of the deadlock.
*   **2025-06-16** The Bonn Climate Conference passes, which was the expected venue for a WEOG decision on the host. — **↓ Australia, ↑ Germany** — The lack of a decision by this key date confirms the deadlock is serious and protracted, increasing the probability of a failure to reach consensus.
*   **2024-11-21** The Guardian reports that Turkey is the primary nation stalling Australia's bid, which had hoped for a decision at COP29. — **↓ Australia, ↑ Turkey/Germany** — This established the core dynamic of the contest: a widely supported bid being blocked by a single member's veto.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** The requirement for unanimous agreement among all WEOG members is the primary mechanism. It grants Turkey effective veto power, regardless of the breadth of Australia's support. This is the most powerful driver. **Effect size: Large**.
2.  **Diplomatic Pressure & Alliances:** Australia's bid is supported by its traditional allies (UK, US, Canada, New Zealand) and likely many EU nations. This coalition can exert significant diplomatic pressure on Turkey to concede. **Effect size: Moderate to Large**.
3.  **Bid Narrative and Climate Credibility:** Australia's "co-host with the Pacific" narrative is powerful, addressing the front-line impacts of climate change. Its new, ambitious 2035 NDC lends credibility to this narrative. This helps build and sustain its coalition of support. **Effect size: Moderate**.
4.  **Geopolitical Leverage (Turkey's Motivation):** Turkey's objection may be a genuine desire to host, or it could be a bargaining chip to extract concessions on unrelated geopolitical or financial matters (e.g., climate finance, EU relations). The ambiguity of this motive is a key uncertainty. **Effect size: Moderate to Large**.
5.  **Avoidance of "Spoiler" Status:** Neither country wants to be blamed for forcing the COP to default to Bonn. This creates pressure to find a resolution before the final deadline (likely around COP30), potentially through one side withdrawing in exchange for a future consideration. **Effect size: Moderate**.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Protracted Public Deadlock:** Unlike most host selections which are resolved quietly, this contest has been a known, public deadlock for nearly a year. This is unusual and elevates the risk of the default outcome.
*   **Co-Hosting with a Region (Pacific Islands):** Australia's bid is not just for itself but explicitly framed as a partnership with vulnerable island nations. This is a unique and politically potent angle compared to a standard single-country bid.
*   **Bidder's Recent Policy Reversal:** Australia's bid comes shortly after a major federal-level shift away from its prior reputation as a climate laggard. The bid is a key part of its international climate diplomacy rebranding, raising the stakes for the Australian government.
*   **Geopolitical Context of the Blocker:** Turkey is a major, geopolitically strategic nation (NATO member, EU candidate) with its own complex foreign policy objectives. Its willingness to stand against a broad consensus of Western allies is more significant than if the objection came from a smaller state.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start from the "Contested Bid" reference class. A plausible prior would be Australia ~70%, Turkey ~20%, Germany ~10%, with a moderate "n" (strength) as these situations are politically fluid.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The persistence of the deadlock well past the informal June 2025 deadline is strong evidence against a simple resolution in Australia's favor. It confirms Turkey's objection is not trivial.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Australia's submission of a significantly more ambitious 2035 NDC strengthens its diplomatic case and undercuts potential criticism, making it a more credible host.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The lack of any public reporting on a diplomatic breakthrough suggests the stalemate continues, slightly increasing the odds of a default to Bonn over time.
    *   **↔ (Ambiguous):** The COP29 precedent shows that such deadlocks can be broken, but often with a last-minute compromise that is hard to predict. This increases overall uncertainty.
*   **Net effect:** The prior for Australia should be revised downwards significantly due to the confirmed, persistent deadlock. The probability for Germany (the default outcome) should be revised upwards substantially. Turkey's probability may increase slightly, as their sustained objection proves their leverage. The posterior should show a much closer race between Australia and the combined chances of Turkey/Germany.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support for Australia's bid from major WEOG powers (e.g., Germany, France, US).
    *   Reports of high-level diplomatic meetings between Australian and Turkish officials.
    *   Turkish state media focusing on other diplomatic priorities, suggesting a de-escalation.
    *   Announcements of a WEOG meeting specifically to resolve the COP31 hosting.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Turkish officials publicly reiterating their commitment to their own bid ahead of COP30.
    *   Frustrated statements from other WEOG members about the "stalemate" or "deadlock."
    *   UNFCCC officials beginning to speak publicly about contingency planning for a Bonn COP31.
    *   Any linkage in reporting between the COP31 bid and other geopolitical demands from Turkey.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Negotiations:** The entire decision-making process is behind closed doors. The public will likely not know a deal has been reached until it is announced.
*   **Unknown Motives:** Turkey's true reason for blocking the bid is the largest source of uncertainty. If it is a non-negotiable demand to host, the deadlock is firm. If it is for leverage, a deal could be struck at any time.
*   **Resolution Timing:** The decision is expected "before COP30" (Nov 2025), but could happen at any point, potentially as a last-minute deal in the corridors of the COP30 venue itself.
*   **"Another Pacific Island Nation" is a Distractor:** This option is highly improbable. The bid is an Australian-led partnership; Pacific nations are not bidding independently within WEOG. The plausible outcomes are Australia, Turkey, or Germany.
*   **Potential for a Compromise:** While not an official option, the COP29 precedent raises a tiny possibility of a third WEOG country being asked to

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to the given options: Australia, Turkey, Germany, Another Pacific Island Nation, and Other.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the historical precedence of the designated regional group hosting the COP, and Australia's strong bid with Pacific Island nations, the base rate for Australia is high. The base rate for a front-runner in a contested bid is around 60-70%. We'll start with 65%.
  
- **Turkey**: As the only other official bid from the WEOG group, Turkey has a chance, but historically, the front-runner tends to win. We'll start with a base rate of 20%.
  
- **Germany**: As the default host city if no consensus is reached, Germany's base rate is low, but the protracted deadlock increases its chances. We'll start with 10%.
  
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is highly improbable as the bid is led by Australia. We'll assign a base rate of 1%.
  
- **Other**: This is unlikely given the current bids. We'll assign a base rate of 4%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: Similar to the base case of a front-runner, but the deadlock is unusual. The co-hosting with Pacific nations is a unique angle.
  
- **Turkey**: Similar to a challenger in a contested bid, but Turkey's geopolitical leverage is significant.
  
- **Germany**: The deadlock increases the probability of defaulting to Germany, which is different from the typical resolution.
  
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Not applicable as the bid is Australian-led.
  
- **Other**: Unlikely given the current context.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: The ambitious 2035 climate target and continued commitment are strong positive signals. The deadlock is a negative signal. Likelihood ratio slightly favors Australia.
  
- **Turkey**: Turkey's sustained objection and geopolitical leverage are positive signals for its bid. The lack of a breakthrough is a negative signal. Likelihood ratio slightly favors Turkey.
  
- **Germany**: The prolonged deadlock and lack of resolution increase the likelihood of defaulting to Germany.
  
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: No evidence supports this option.
  
- **Other**: No evidence supports this option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 65/35. Evidence slightly favors Australia, but the deadlock is a significant negative. Adjusted posterior probability: ~50%.
  
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 20/80. Evidence slightly favors Turkey due to sustained objection. Adjusted posterior probability: ~25%.
  
- **Germany**: Prior odds = 10/90. Evidence of deadlock increases the probability. Adjusted posterior probability: ~20%.
  
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Remains at 1%.
  
- **Other**: Remains at 4%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough or compromise. Adjust probabilities slightly to account for this uncertainty.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

- Australia: 50%
- Turkey: 25%
- Germany: 20%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
- Other: 4%

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 50%  
Turkey: 25%  
Germany: 20%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%  
Other: 4%

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on the UNFCCC COP hosting patterns:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia is one of two official bidders from the designated WEOG regional group, has significant support, and has strengthened its climate credentials with a new ambitious 2035 target.

**Turkey**: 30%
- Rationale: Turkey is the second official bidder from WEOG and has been actively blocking Australia's bid, demonstrating serious intent.

**Germany**: 20%
- Rationale: As the default host (Bonn) if consensus fails, Germany has a significant baseline probability given the protracted deadlock.

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 1%
- Rationale: While Australia proposes co-hosting with Pacific nations, these nations are not independently bidding within WEOG and cannot be selected as the primary host.

**Other**: 4%
- Rationale: This accounts for the small possibility of a compromise candidate emerging from WEOG (similar to the COP29 precedent) or procedural changes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical COP host selection:**
- The rotation system is functioning as designed (WEOG's turn)
- Official bids have been submitted through proper channels
- The decision requires consensus within the regional group

**Key differences:**
- Unusually protracted and public deadlock (ongoing for nearly a year)
- Australia's unique co-hosting approach with Pacific Island nations
- Australia's recent climate policy reversal and new ambitious NDC
- Turkey's persistent blocking despite apparent broad support for Australia
- The June 2025 Bonn meeting passed without resolution, a concerning signal

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Persistent deadlock past the June 2025 Bonn meeting**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.4 - This persistence significantly reduces Australia's chances
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.7 - Consistent with Turkey maintaining leverage
- P(E|Germany hosts): 0.8 - Strong evidence for the default option becoming necessary

**Evidence 2: Australia's new ambitious 2035 NDC (62-70% reduction)**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.8 - Strengthens Australia's position significantly
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.5 - Neutral; doesn't directly affect Turkey's position
- P(E|Germany hosts): 0.3 - Makes the default option less likely as it removes a potential objection

**Evidence 3: Turkey being identified as the primary blocker**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.6 - Suggests broad support for Australia but with a significant obstacle
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.7 - Demonstrates Turkey's serious intent and leverage
- P(E|Germany hosts): 0.5 - Neutral; could lead to either compromise or continued deadlock

**Evidence 4: Australia's continued commitment to co-hosting with Pacific nations**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.7 - Maintains the narrative strength of their bid
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.4 - Makes Turkey appear less cooperative on climate justice issues
- P(E|Germany hosts): 0.4 - Slightly reduces likelihood of default as the bid has moral weight

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let me perform an explicit update using the persistent deadlock evidence:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.6 = 0.67
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 0.67 = 0.55
- Posterior probability: 0.55/(1+0.55) = 35.5%

For Turkey:
- Prior probability: 30%
- Prior odds: 30/70 = 0.43
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 0.43 × 2.33 = 1.00
- Posterior probability: 1.00/(1+1.00) = 50%

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4.0
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 4.0 = 1.0
- Posterior probability: 1.0/(1+1.0) = 50%

These individual updates would sum to >100%, so I need to normalize. But first, let me qualitatively incorporate the other evidence:

- Australia's ambitious NDC submission significantly boosts their chances (+10%)
- Turkey being identified as the primary blocker slightly increases their chances (+5%)
- Australia's continued commitment to Pacific co-hosting slightly increases their chances (+3%)

Combining all evidence and normalizing:

**Australia**: ~38%
**Turkey**: ~32%
**Germany**: ~25%
**Another Pacific Island Nation**: ~1%
**Other**: ~4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Underestimating diplomatic pressure**: Major powers like the US, UK, and EU could exert significant pressure on Turkey to withdraw its objection.

2. **Overestimating the deadlock**: The public reporting may overstate the actual diplomatic impasse; negotiations could be progressing behind closed doors.

3. **Underestimating Turkey's resolve**: Turkey may have deeper geopolitical reasons for blocking Australia that make them unlikely to concede.

4. **Neglecting timing dynamics**: As the deadline approaches, the pressure to avoid defaulting to Bonn increases, which may favor a compromise.

5. **Overlooking compromise scenarios**: A joint hosting arrangement between Australia and Turkey could emerge as a solution.

Adjusting for these considerations:
- Increase Australia slightly due to potential diplomatic pressure
- Decrease Germany slightly as default becomes less likely closer to deadline
- Maintain Turkey's probability as these factors roughly balance

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations and ensuring probabilities sum to 100%:

## 7. Output Format

Australia: 40%  
Turkey: 32%  
Germany: 23%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%  
Other: 4%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **P(Bidding Country from Designated Group Wins):** The standard UNFCCC process is for the designated regional group (in this case, WEOG) to select a host from among its members. This is the outcome in the vast majority of cases. My prior is that one of the official bidders (Australia or Turkey) will be chosen. **P(Australia or Turkey) ≈ 90%**.
*   **P(Contested Bid Outcome):** When there are two competing bids, the one with broader support is more likely to win, but the contest itself increases uncertainty. A plausible prior for a two-bid race where one (Australia) has significantly more public support than the other (Turkey) would be **P(Australia) ≈ 70%, P(Turkey) ≈ 20%**.
*   **P(Default Host - Germany):** The conference defaults to Bonn, Germany, only if the regional group fails to reach a consensus. This is a politically undesirable "failure state" and has not happened for a full COP in the modern era. The base rate for this is very low. **P(Germany) ≈ 10%** (this is higher than the historical frequency to account for the known existence of a contest).
*   **P(Other/Compromise):** The recent COP29 selection for the Eastern European Group was deadlocked until a compromise candidate (Azerbaijan) emerged. This suggests a small but non-zero chance that a third WEOG country could be chosen to break the deadlock. **P(Other) ≈ small, included in the 10% for Germany/Other**.
*   **P(Another Pacific Island Nation):** This is effectively 0%. The bid is an Australian-led partnership. Pacific Island Nations are not members of the WEOG group and cannot host on its behalf independently.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process follows the standard UN regional group rotation and requires consensus, which is the core mechanism of the base case.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the highly public and protracted nature of the deadlock. Most host selections are resolved quietly. The fact that this has persisted for nearly a year and has passed an informal deadline (the June 2025 Bonn conference) is highly unusual. This significantly increases the probability of the "failure state" (Germany) compared to the base rate. Turkey's status as a major geopolitical actor with a history of using its veto power in other forums (like NATO) also makes this deadlock more serious than a typical disagreement.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Protracted deadlock, passing the June 2025 deadline.**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if Germany is the eventual host (P(E|Germany)) than if Australia is the host (P(E|Australia)). A deadlock is the necessary precondition for a default to Bonn.
    *   This evidence strongly disfavors the prior that Australia would win easily. It confirms Turkey's opposition is serious and not easily overcome.
*   **Evidence 2: Australia's ambitious 2035 climate target submission.**
    *   This evidence is more likely if Australia is still actively and confidently pursuing its bid (P(E|Australia)). It's a strong diplomatic signal designed to bolster its credentials and increase pressure on the holdout.
    *   This provides a moderate update in favor of Australia, as it strengthens their political and moral case to host.
*   **Evidence 3: Turkey is the primary (and possibly sole) nation stalling the bid.**
    *   This confirms the dynamic is not a widespread disagreement but a specific veto. This increases the likelihood that the outcome depends entirely on a bilateral negotiation between Australia and Turkey, or on the collective WEOG's ability to pressure Turkey. It makes Turkey's individual leverage very high.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Priors:** P(Australia) = 70%, P(Turkey) = 20%, P(Germany) = 10%.
2.  **Update on Evidence 1 (Protracted Deadlock):** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The prior odds of Australia vs. Not-Australia are 70:30 (or 2.33:1). The deadlock is strong evidence against a smooth Australian victory. The likelihood ratio P(Deadlock | Not-Australia) / P(Deadlock | Australia) is high. This significantly reduces Australia's probability and substantially increases Germany's.
    *   *Conceptual Update:* The 70% for Australia is revised downwards sharply. The 10% for Germany is revised upwards sharply. Let's adjust to roughly P(Australia) = 45%, P(Turkey) = 20%, P(Germany) = 35%.
3.  **Update on Evidence 2 (Australia's New Target):** This strengthens Australia's diplomatic hand. It provides them with a new tool to build pressure and demonstrate their fitness to host. This nudges the probability back towards Australia.
    *   *Conceptual Update:* Let's shift some probability mass from Germany and Turkey back to Australia. This might move Australia from 45% to 50%. Let's take it primarily from Germany, as a successful Australian diplomatic push makes the "failure" state less likely. This results in P(Australia) = 50%, P(Turkey) = 18%, P(Germany) = 32%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My current estimate is P(Australia) at 50%. Is this overconfident? The consensus rule is absolute. Turkey's "no" is just as powerful as a "no" from the US, UK, and all of the EU combined. The path to a German host is simply the continuation of the status quo (inertia). The path to an Australian host requires an actor (Turkey) to change its stated position. This suggests the risk of failure (i.e., the Germany outcome) might be higher than my estimate.

What if Turkey's goal is not to host, but to extract an unrelated concession? A deal could be struck at any time. But what if their goal *is* to host, and they are willing to be the spoiler to deny Australia? In that case, the deadlock is firm.

The COP29 precedent (Azerbaijan as a compromise) suggests that a third "Other" WEOG country could emerge. This is a non-zero tail risk.

Given the power of a single-nation veto and the persistence of the deadlock, I will reduce Australia's probability and increase Germany's to better reflect the power of inertia. I will also slightly reduce Turkey's chance of *winning* the bid (which requires convincing everyone else) while acknowledging their high chance of *blocking* the bid. I will assign a small probability to a compromise "Other" candidate.

*   **Final Adjustment:** Lower Australia to 45%. Increase Germany to 35%. Lower Turkey to 15%. Assign 5% to "Other".

### 6. Final Normalization

*   Australia: 45%
*   Turkey: 15%
*   Germany: 35%
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 0% (Not a WEOG member, cannot bid in this cycle)
*   Other: 5% (Represents a compromise WEOG candidate like Switzerland, Norway, etc.)
*   **Total: 45 + 15 + 35 + 0 + 5 = 100%**

The probabilities are normalized and reflect the core tension: Australia is the strong favorite on merit and support, but the consensus process gives Turkey a powerful veto, making the default outcome (Germany) a very real possibility.

Australia: 45%
Turkey: 15%
Germany: 35%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0%
Other: 5%
