### Reference class & base rates
*   **Supreme Court Review of Major Executive Actions on Statutory Grounds:** In cases where the Supreme Court reviews a significant executive branch action based on the interpretation of a statute, the government historically has a strong but not guaranteed chance of prevailing. A rough base rate, derived from landmark cases over the past 50 years (e.g., Chevron, Dames & Moore, FDA v. Brown & Williamson, West Virginia v. EPA), suggests the executive branch wins, in whole or in part, approximately 60-70% of the time. This reflects historical deference to executive agencies and presidential authority.
*   **Cases Involving the "Major Questions Doctrine" (MQD):** A more specific and recent reference class involves cases where the Court has invoked the MQD, which requires a clear statement from Congress for executive actions of vast economic and political significance. In recent major cases where this doctrine was central (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*), the executive action was struck down. The base rate for the government losing in such cases is very high, perhaps 80-90%.
*   **Limitations:** The first base rate is broad and may not capture the current Court's specific jurisprudential trends. The second is narrow, based on only a few recent cases, but may be more representative of the current 6-3 conservative majority's approach to administrative power. The specific facts and statutory text of IEEPA are unique.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms lower court, ruling 7-4 that IEEPA does not authorize the tariffs. — ↓ (Unlawful) — A powerful appellate court, sitting en banc, found the tariffs unlawful, creating a strong presumption against the government's position.
*   **2025-09-03** The government petitions the Supreme Court for review of the *V.O.S. Selections* decision. — ↑ (Any 2025 ruling) — Signals the government's intent to get a final, definitive ruling quickly, reducing the chance of the issue languishing.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. — ↓ (No 2025 ruling) — The Court's decision to hear the case quickly and schedule arguments for November makes a ruling before year-end highly likely.
*   **2025-10-22** News reports confirm oral arguments are set for November 5, focusing on presidential authority under IEEPA. — neutral — Reinforces the expedited timeline and frames the central legal question for the Court.
*   **2025-10-26** Legal commentary highlights the case as a major test of presidential emergency powers. — ↓ (Lawful) — Framing the case this way invokes the Major Questions Doctrine, which the current Court has used to curb executive power.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The Court's conservative majority has increasingly used this doctrine to invalidate executive actions with vast economic and political significance that are not explicitly authorized by Congress. Imposing tariffs on nearly all U.S. trade is a textbook example of such an action. (Driver size: Large, favors "Unlawful" or "Mixed")
*   **Textualism:** The IEEPA allows the President to "regulate," "prevent or prohibit" transactions and "nullify" interests in property. The core legal question is whether "imposing a tariff" (a tax) falls within this language. A textualist reading may find it does not, as the power to tax is traditionally Congress's domain. (Driver size: Large, favors "Unlawful")
*   **National Security Deference:** The Court has a long history of deferring to the President on matters of national security and foreign policy. The government will argue the tariffs are a necessary response to declared national emergencies. This is the government's strongest argument. (Driver size: Moderate, favors "Lawful" or "Mixed")
*   **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court could sever its analysis. The "trafficking tariffs" (on Mexico, Canada, China) have a more plausible, traditional national security nexus (drug cartels) than the "reciprocal tariffs," which are based on an economic "emergency" (trade deficits). This provides a clear off-ramp for a compromise. (Driver size: Moderate, favors "Mixed")
*   **Precedent (*Dames & Moore v. Regan*):** This 1981 case gave a broad interpretation of presidential power under IEEPA. However, it involved a specific, acute foreign policy crisis (Iran hostages) and a history of congressional acquiescence, factors that are arguably absent here, making it distinguishable. (Driver size: Small, favors "Lawful" but is easily countered)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scale:** Unlike prior IEEPA sanctions targeting specific countries or entities, these tariffs are a wholesale restructuring of U.S. trade policy, affecting trillions of dollars in commerce. This scale makes an MQD analysis almost unavoidable.
*   **Economic Justification for Emergency:** The declaration of a national emergency based on "trade deficits" is a novel and legally tenuous expansion of IEEPA, which is traditionally aimed at foreign policy or security threats. This weakens the government's deference argument for the reciprocal tariffs.
*   **Current Court's Jurisprudence:** Compared to the courts that decided earlier deference cases, the current 6-3 conservative majority is uniquely skeptical of broad delegations of authority to the executive branch and the administrative state.
*   **Lower Court Consensus:** Both the D.C. District Court and the Federal Circuit ruled against the tariffs. While their reasoning differed slightly, the uniform *outcome* against the government sends a strong signal to the Supreme Court.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the general reference class of major executive action cases, giving the government a slight edge: P(Lawful or Mixed) ≈ 60%, P(Unlawful) ≈ 30%, P(Other/No Ruling) ≈ 10%. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The facts squarely implicate the Major Questions Doctrine, a powerful tool the current Court uses to strike down executive overreach.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The textual argument that IEEPA does not authorize "tariffs" (taxes) is strong and appeals to the Court's textualist wing.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The unanimity of lower court outcomes against the government, especially the en banc Federal Circuit, is a significant negative signal.
    *   ↑ (Mixed): The plausible distinction between the trafficking and reciprocal tariffs provides a clear path for a split decision, pulling probability away from the clean "Lawful" and "Unlawful" outcomes.
    *   ↓ (No 2025 ruling): The expedited grant of certiorari makes a 2025 ruling extremely likely.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the posterior away from "Tariffs lawful." The probability mass should shift heavily towards "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling," which now appear to be the most likely outcomes. The probability of "No 2025 ruling" should be near zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   During oral arguments (Nov 5), questions from Justices Roberts or Kavanaugh focusing on the President's unique foreign policy role and the need for flexibility in a crisis.
    *   Questions from any conservative justice suggesting the *Dames & Moore* precedent is controlling.
    *   Amicus briefs filed by a significant number of former high-ranking national security officials in support of the government.
    *   Any reporting suggesting the liberal justices are concerned about creating a precedent that overly constrains a future Democratic president's emergency powers.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful):**
    *   During oral arguments, extensive questioning from Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, or Alito about the nondelegation doctrine or whether IEEPA's text permits imposing a tax.
    *   Questions from Chief Justice Roberts about the unprecedented economic scope of the tariffs, signaling a "major questions" concern.
    *   Questions from multiple justices about the legitimacy of declaring a "trade deficit" a national emergency under the statute.
    *   A lack of tough questions for the challengers' counsel from the conservative wing of the Court.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Judicial Idiosyncrasy:** Individual justices may have unique, unpredictable views on the interplay between executive power, statutory text, and national security.
*   **"Other ruling" Risk:** While unlikely given the expedited review, the Court could still find a procedural off-ramp (e.g., standing, mootness if the policy changes) to avoid a merits decision, triggering the "Other ruling" outcome.
*   **Definition of "Mixed":** The resolution criteria are precise. A ruling that strikes down 99% of the tariffs but upholds a tiny, severable portion would resolve as "Mixed." The analysis must consider any plausible path to upholding *any* part of the tariffs.
*   **Oral Argument Misinterpretation:** Pundits and reporters often misread the tea leaves from oral arguments; a justice's tough question may be a genuine query rather than a sign of their vote.
*   **Compromise Opinions:** The final opinion, especially if written by a centrist justice like Roberts, could be narrow and fact-specific, making broad conclusions difficult and potentially creating unexpected outcomes.

**Final Research Summary:** The legal headwinds against President Trump's IEEPA tariffs are formidable, primarily due to the current Supreme Court's skepticism of broad executive power as expressed through the Major Questions Doctrine. A complete victory for the administration ("Tariffs lawful") is highly improbable, while a procedural dismissal or delay past 2025 is also unlikely given the expedited schedule. The central uncertainty lies between a complete invalidation ("Tariffs unlawful") and a split decision ("Mixed ruling") that might uphold the more narrowly targeted trafficking tariffs while striking down the sweeping reciprocal tariffs.

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs Lawful:** Historically, the executive branch wins approximately 60-70% of cases involving major executive actions on statutory grounds. However, given the current Court's skepticism of broad executive power, a lower base rate of 40% is more appropriate.
- **Tariffs Unlawful:** The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) has been a significant factor in recent cases, with the executive losing 80-90% of the time. Given the Court's conservative majority, a base rate of 40% is reasonable.
- **Mixed Ruling:** Considering the potential for a split decision, a base rate of 15% is plausible.
- **Other Ruling:** Historically rare, but possible procedural outcomes warrant a 3% base rate.
- **No 2025 Ruling:** Given the expedited schedule, this is unlikely, so a base rate of 2% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves significant executive action and statutory interpretation, fitting the historical pattern of Supreme Court cases.
- **Differences:** The scale of the tariffs and the invocation of MQD make this case unique, with a conservative Court likely to scrutinize executive overreach.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Federal Circuit Ruling:** Strong signal against the tariffs, suggesting a high likelihood of "Unlawful" (P(E | Unlawful) = 0.9) and low likelihood of "Lawful" (P(E | Lawful) = 0.1).
- **Supreme Court's Expedited Review:** Increases the likelihood of a 2025 ruling (P(E | No 2025 ruling) = 0.1).
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** Strongly suggests "Unlawful" (P(E | Unlawful) = 0.8) and reduces "Lawful" (P(E | Lawful) = 0.2).
- **Textualism and National Security Arguments:** Textualism favors "Unlawful" (P(E | Unlawful) = 0.7), while national security arguments slightly favor "Lawful" (P(E | Lawful) = 0.4).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs Lawful:** Prior odds = 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.67. Likelihood ratio (based on evidence) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25. Posterior odds = 0.67 × 0.25 = 0.167. Posterior probability = 0.167 / (1 + 0.167) ≈ 14%.
- **Tariffs Unlawful:** Prior odds = 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.67. Likelihood ratio = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4. Posterior odds = 0.67 × 4 = 2.68. Posterior probability = 2.68 / (1 + 2.68) ≈ 73%.
- **Mixed Ruling:** Adjusted for potential split decision, posterior probability ≈ 10%.
- **Other Ruling:** Adjusted for procedural outcomes, posterior probability ≈ 2%.
- **No 2025 Ruling:** Given the expedited schedule, posterior probability ≈ 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a compromise or unexpected procedural outcome.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A "Mixed ruling" could be more plausible if the Court finds a middle ground.
- **Rebuttals:** The strong MQD and textualist arguments make a complete "Lawful" ruling unlikely.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

- Tariffs Lawful: 14%
- Tariffs Unlawful: 73%
- Mixed Ruling: 10%
- Other Ruling: 2%
- No 2025 Ruling: 1%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 14%  
Tariffs unlawful: 73%  
Mixed ruling: 10%  
Other ruling: 2%  
No 2025 ruling: 1%

```

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs lawful:**
- In cases where the Supreme Court reviews executive actions based on statutory authority, the executive branch historically wins about 60-70% of the time.
- However, the current 6-3 conservative Court has been skeptical of broad executive power, especially under the Major Questions Doctrine.
- Prior: 20%

**Tariffs unlawful:**
- In recent cases involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD), the Court has struck down executive actions in about 80-90% of cases.
- Lower courts unanimously ruled against these tariffs.
- Prior: 45%

**Mixed ruling:**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions, especially in politically charged cases.
- The distinct nature of the two types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provides a natural splitting point.
- Prior: 25%

**Other ruling:**
- The Court occasionally avoids merits decisions through procedural off-ramps.
- Prior: 5%

**No 2025 ruling:**
- Given the expedited schedule with November arguments, a 2025 ruling is highly likely.
- Prior: 5%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major executive power cases, this involves interpreting statutory language to determine the scope of presidential authority.
- The case presents national security justifications, which traditionally receive judicial deference.

**Key differences:**
- The unprecedented scale of these tariffs affects trillions in commerce, making this a stronger MQD case than typical.
- The novel use of "trade deficits" as a national emergency stretches IEEPA beyond its traditional security focus.
- The current Court has shown particular skepticism toward broad delegations of authority to the executive branch.
- The lower courts have unanimously ruled against the government, though with different reasoning.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Major Questions Doctrine applicability**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%): If tariffs are lawful, we wouldn't expect the case to fit the MQD pattern so clearly.
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%): If tariffs are unlawful, we'd expect precisely this kind of case to trigger MQD concerns.

**Evidence: Textualist reading of IEEPA**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Moderate (~40%): If tariffs are lawful, the text would need to reasonably include tariff authority.
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%): If tariffs are unlawful, we'd expect the text to lack clear authorization for tariffs.

**Evidence: Distinction between tariff types**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Very high (~90%): If a mixed ruling is coming, we'd expect exactly this kind of clear dividing line.
- P(E|Tariffs lawful/unlawful) = Moderate (~50%): Even with a clean ruling, this distinction would be acknowledged.

**Evidence: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~10%): An expedited schedule with November arguments makes a 2025 ruling highly likely.
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = Very high (~95%): This schedule is designed specifically to produce a 2025 ruling.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the Major Questions Doctrine evidence:

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 20/80 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0625
- Posterior probability: 0.0625/(1+0.0625) ≈ 5.9%

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 80/20 = 4
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 4 = 3.28
- Posterior probability: 3.28/(1+3.28) ≈ 76.6%

Updating further on the distinction between tariff types:
- This evidence strongly supports a "Mixed ruling" outcome
- It pulls probability mass from both "Tariffs lawful" and "Tariffs unlawful" toward "Mixed ruling"
- The posterior for "Mixed ruling" increases substantially from 25% to approximately 40%
- This reduces "Tariffs unlawful" from ~77% to approximately 50%

Updating on the expedited review schedule:
- This dramatically reduces the probability of "No 2025 ruling" from 5% to approximately 1%
- The remaining probability mass is distributed proportionally among the other options

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the Court's commitment to the Major Questions Doctrine when national security is invoked.
- The Court's conservatives might be more sympathetic to a Republican president's use of executive power than recent cases suggest.
- I might be underestimating the possibility of an unexpected procedural ruling that avoids the merits.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would give more weight to "Tariffs lawful" based on national security deference. The Court has historically been reluctant to second-guess the President on foreign affairs and security matters. The drug trafficking justification for the Mexico/Canada/China tariffs could be compelling to some justices.

**Rebuttal:**
While national security deference is real, the economic nature of tariffs and the unprecedented scope make this case different from traditional security cases. The "trade deficit emergency" in particular stretches credulity as a national security matter.

**Adjustment:**
I'll slightly increase the probability of "Mixed ruling" to account for the possibility that national security arguments might save the trafficking tariffs while the reciprocal tariffs fall.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:

- "Tariffs lawful" = 7%
- "Tariffs unlawful" = 48%
- "Mixed ruling" = 42%
- "Other ruling" = 2%
- "No 2025 ruling" = 1%

Total: 100%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 7%
Tariffs unlawful: 48%
Mixed ruling: 42%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I will use two reference classes to establish a prior probability.

*   **Reference Class 1: Major Executive Actions on Statutory Grounds.** Historically, the Supreme Court has often deferred to the executive branch in these cases. The research report suggests a ~60-70% win rate for the government (in whole or in part). This would suggest a prior of P(Lawful or Mixed) ≈ 65%.
*   **Reference Class 2: Cases Involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD).** This is a more recent and specific reference class reflecting the current Court's jurisprudence. In these cases, the government has a very high loss rate, perhaps 80-90%. This suggests a prior of P(Unlawful) ≈ 85%.

Given that the current case has unprecedented economic scale and involves the current 6-3 conservative majority, the MQD reference class is more relevant. However, the national security justification for some of the tariffs pulls it back toward the first class. I will blend these, starting with a prior that heavily favors a loss for the government but doesn't rule out a win:
*   P(Unlawful): 50%
*   P(Mixed): 20% (A partial win/loss)
*   P(Lawful): 15%
*   P(Other/No Ruling): 15%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The case involves a significant executive action based on a broad interpretation of a statute, which fits both reference classes.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Unprecedented Scale:** The tariffs, particularly the "reciprocal tariffs," represent a wholesale restructuring of U.S. trade policy, making this a textbook case for the Major Questions Doctrine. This makes it *more likely* the government will lose than in a typical executive action case.
    2.  **Novel Justification:** Declaring "trade deficits" a national emergency under IEEPA is a legally tenuous expansion of the statute's traditional scope, weakening the government's case for deference.
    3.  **Current Court:** The current Court is demonstrably more skeptical of broad executive authority than the courts that decided key precedents like *Dames & Moore*.
    4.  **Lower Court Consensus:** The fact that two different lower courts, including the en banc Federal Circuit, ruled against the government (albeit with slightly different reasoning) creates a strong headwind.

These differences strongly suggest the MQD reference class is the more appropriate one, and the initial priors should be shifted heavily away from "Lawful."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate several key pieces of evidence:

*   **Evidence 1: The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD).** The imposition of tariffs on nearly all U.S. trade partners is an action of "vast economic and political significance." The likelihood of the current Court applying the MQD is very high. P(MQD applied | Unlawful or Mixed) is high; P(MQD applied | Lawful) is very low. This is strong evidence against the "Lawful" option.
*   **Evidence 2: Textualism.** The government argues that the power to "regulate" transactions under IEEPA includes the power to impose tariffs (a tax). Challengers argue it does not, as the power to tax is constitutionally granted to Congress. For the Court's textualist wing, this is a powerful argument. P(Textualist argument prevails | Unlawful) is high; P(Textualist argument prevails | Lawful) is low. This also pushes probability toward "Unlawful."
*   **Evidence 3: Severability of Tariffs.** There is a clear distinction between the "trafficking tariffs" (Mexico, Canada, China) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (most other countries). The former have a more plausible national security justification (drug trade) than the latter (trade deficits). This provides a clear path for a compromise ruling. The likelihood of a "Mixed ruling" is therefore significantly increased because the Court can strike down the broader, weaker tariffs while upholding the narrower, more defensible ones. This pulls probability away from both the clean "Lawful" and clean "Unlawful" outcomes.
*   **Evidence 4: Expedited Supreme Court Schedule.** The Court granted certiorari on an expedited basis, with arguments in November 2025. This makes a ruling before the end of 2025 highly probable. The likelihood of this evidence is extremely low if "No 2025 ruling" were true. P(Expedited Schedule | No 2025 ruling) ≈ 0.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update, starting from our prior: P(Unlawful)=50%, P(Mixed)=20%, P(Lawful)=15%.

*   **Initial Odds:**
    *   Odds(Unlawful vs. Lawful) = 50/15 ≈ 3.3 to 1.
    *   Odds(Mixed vs. Lawful) = 20/15 ≈ 1.3 to 1.

*   **Updating with Evidence (MQD & Textualism):** This evidence strongly disfavors a "Lawful" outcome. Let's estimate a combined likelihood ratio of 4:1 in favor of "Unlawful" over "Lawful."
    *   Posterior Odds(Unlawful vs. Lawful) = 3.3 × 4 = 13.2 to 1. This implies P(Lawful) is now much smaller relative to P(Unlawful).

*   **Updating with Evidence (Severability):** The clear path to a compromise significantly boosts the "Mixed" option. It makes a clean sweep for either side less likely. This pulls probability mass from both "Unlawful" and "Lawful" towards "Mixed." I will treat this as increasing the odds of "Mixed" relative to both other outcomes.

*   **Updating with Evidence (Expedited Schedule):** This collapses the probability of "No 2025 ruling" to near zero. I will reallocate that 15% from the prior to the other options, primarily to "Unlawful" and "Mixed."

After considering all evidence, the probability has shifted dramatically. A government win ("Lawful") is now highly unlikely. The main contest is between a complete loss ("Unlawful") and a partial loss/win ("Mixed"). The "Mixed" outcome appears slightly more probable as it represents a classic Roberts Court compromise: reining in extreme executive overreach while preserving some presidential authority.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is that the government is very likely to lose, at least in part. The best argument for the alternative ("Tariffs lawful") is a maximalist view of presidential power in foreign affairs and national security, relying on precedents like *Dames & Moore*. A Court majority could decide that the President's emergency declaration is not for them to question and that IEEPA provides the necessary authority. However, this would require ignoring the Court's own recent trend in MQD cases, the powerful textualist arguments, and the unprecedented scope of the tariffs. This seems unlikely.

The primary uncertainty is between "Unlawful" and "Mixed." I have favored "Mixed," but a clean "Unlawful" ruling is also very plausible. If the Court's textualists (e.g., Gorsuch, Thomas) persuade their colleagues that IEEPA's text simply does not authorize tariffs of *any* kind, then all the tariffs would fall together. This is a significant possibility.

The "Other ruling" option remains a small tail risk; the Court could find an unexpected procedural reason to dismiss the case, though this is improbable given they fast-tracked it.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updating process, I will finalize my probabilities:

*   **Tariffs lawful:** Low probability. The MQD and textual arguments are very strong against the government.
*   **Tariffs unlawful:** High probability. A complete rejection of the President's authority to impose any tariffs under IEEPA is a very possible outcome.
*   **Mixed ruling:** Highest probability. This outcome allows the Court to strike down the most legally dubious "reciprocal tariffs" while potentially upholding the "trafficking tariffs," which have a stronger national security nexus. This compromise seems well-suited to the current Court.
*   **Other ruling:** Very low probability. A procedural dismissal is unlikely given the expedited review.
*   **No 2025 ruling:** Extremely low probability. The expedited schedule makes a decision in 2025 almost certain.

My final distribution reflects this reasoning.

---
Tariffs lawful: 10%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
