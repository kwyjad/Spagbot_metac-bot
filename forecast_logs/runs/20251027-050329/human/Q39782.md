### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**
*   **Q1: What is the historical distribution of the longest field goal made in an NFL regular season?** This will establish the primary reference class and base rates.
*   **Q2: Is there a discernible trend in this data over time?** This helps contextualize if we are in a stable or changing environment.
*   **Q3: What are the primary causal mechanisms driving the recent increase in maximum field goal distances?** This involves understanding the interplay of player skill, rule changes, and environmental factors.
*   **Q4: Who are the key actors (kickers) with the demonstrated leg strength and opportunity to set the season's maximum?** Identifying the specific individuals most likely to produce the outcome is crucial.
*   **Q5: What is the specific, quantifiable impact of the 2025 "K-ball" rule change?** This is the most significant new variable and needs careful assessment.
*   **Q6: What events in the 2025 season to date provide the most salient evidence for updating our prior?** This focuses on recency-weighted evidence.

**2. Search Queries:**
*   **Q1 & Q2:** `list of longest NFL field goals by season`, `NFL record field goal distance history`, `average longest field goal per NFL season last 20 years`.
*   **Q3:** `why are NFL kickers getting better`, `impact of specialization on NFL kicking`, `effect of altitude on field goal distance NFL`, `NFL game situations for long field goal attempts`.
*   **Q4:** `NFL kickers with strongest legs 2025`, `longest career field goals current NFL kickers`, `Brandon Aubrey max field goal range`, `Cam Little college kicking stats`, `Justin Tucker longest field goals`.
*   **Q5:** `NFL K-ball rule change 2025 explained`, `physics of a broken-in football`, `NFL competition committee on kicking balls 2025`, `kicker opinions on 2025 K-ball rule`.
*   **Q6:** `longest field goals NFL 2025 season so far`, `Cam Little 70 yard preseason field goal details`, `NFL week 1-8 2025 longest kicks`.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**
*   The historical data shows a clear, accelerating upward trend in the longest field goal of the season. The 60-yard barrier, once mythical, is now routinely surpassed. The last five seasons (2020-2024) saw longest FGs of 61, 66, 62, 61, and 62 yards.
*   The primary mechanisms are a combination of long-term and short-term factors. The long-term driver is the professionalization and specialization of kickers. The short-term drivers are situational (altitude, weather, end-of-half/game scenarios) and, crucially for 2025, a new rule allowing kickers to "break in" the K-balls.
*   The K-ball rule is the single most important new factor. While its effect on overall accuracy for 50+ yarders is not yet apparent in the data, the physics suggest a more pliable, broken-in ball will have a higher coefficient of restitution, enabling greater maximum distance on a perfect strike. The 70-yard preseason kick and two 64+ yard kicks in the first four weeks are strong circumstantial evidence of this effect.
*   Key actors include established long-range kickers like Justin Tucker, specialists who thrive in altitude like Matt Prater (historically) and potentially Brandon Aubrey now, and new talents with demonstrated raw power like Cam Little.
*   The 2025 season has already produced outlier results (64 and 65 yards by Week 4), strongly suggesting this season's distribution will be shifted higher than the historical base rate. Cam Little's inconsistency in the regular season is a counterpoint, but it doesn't negate his demonstrated maximum potential, which is what this question is about.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**
The synthesized findings will now be structured into the required format, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and direct utility for a statistician.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Recent NFL Seasons (2018-2024):** The longest field goal in a regular season has ranged from 59 to 66 yards. The median over this period is 62 yards. This class reflects the modern era of specialized, strong-legged kickers but predates the 2025 rule change. The probability of a 66+ yard kick in any given season in this reference class is low (~1/7).
*   **Post-Tucker Record Seasons (2021-2024):** Since Justin Tucker set the 66-yard record, the subsequent three seasons saw maximums of 62, 61, and 62 yards. This suggests a reversion toward a mean in the low 60s, but establishes 66 yards as a known, albeit extreme, possibility.
*   **Limitations:** Both reference classes are potentially obsolete due to the 2025 rule change regarding kicking balls. They establish a historical baseline but may underestimate the current potential.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-24** Brandon Aubrey slated to kick in Denver's high altitude — ↑ — Provides a near-ideal environmental condition for a kicker with demonstrated power, increasing the probability of a record-long attempt.
*   **2025-10-19** Reports of Cam Little's inconsistency in the regular season — ↓ — While his maximum potential is known, inconsistent performance may reduce his opportunities or coach's trust for a long-range, game-critical attempt.
*   **2025-09 (Weeks 1-4)** Two field goals of 64 and 65 yards are made — ↑ — This provides hard evidence that the potential for extreme-distance kicks is being realized this season, raising the floor for the season's eventual maximum.
*   **2025-08-09** Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game — ↑ — Establishes a new, albeit unofficial, benchmark for plausible maximum distance under the new K-ball rule. It expands the "art of the possible."
*   **2025-03-25** NFL approves rule allowing teams to practice with K-balls all week — ↑ — A structural change that is hypothesized to increase maximum kicking distance by allowing balls to be "broken in."

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **K-Ball Rule Change (Large):** The new ability for teams to prepare kicking balls all week is the primary new mechanism. A broken-in ball is believed to be more pliable and travel farther. This is the most significant driver pushing the maximum distance up this season.
*   **Kicker Talent & Specialization (Large):** A long-term trend. Athletes are bigger, stronger, and receive more specialized coaching from a younger age, creating a pool of kickers with unprecedented leg strength (e.g., Aubrey, Little, Tucker).
*   **Altitude (Moderate-to-Large):** Games played at high altitude (primarily Denver) significantly reduce air density, allowing a well-struck ball to travel farther. A strong-legged kicker playing in Denver is a key combination to watch.
*   **Game Situation (Moderate):** The vast majority of 60+ yard attempts occur at the end of a half or game, where a low-probability attempt is preferable to a Hail Mary or no attempt at all. The right game script is a necessary condition.
*   **Weather Conditions (Small-to-Moderate):** Warm, dry air and a tailwind can add several yards to a kick's distance. These are opportunistic factors that can turn a 63-yard attempt into a 66-yard make.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Structural Rule Change:** The 2025 season is the first to be played under the new K-ball rule. This is a fundamental difference from every season in the reference class, making historical data less reliable.
*   **Early Season Evidence:** The 2025 season has already seen two kicks (64, 65 yards) that would have been the longest of the year in many prior seasons. This early clustering of extreme events suggests a regime change.
*   **Demonstrated Potential:** A 70-yard field goal, even in preseason, is a powerful demonstration of the new upper limit of what is physically possible. This "existence proof" was not present in prior seasons.
*   **Depth of Talent:** Unlike some past eras dominated by one or two long-range specialists, there are currently several kickers (Aubrey, Little, Tucker, Moody, McPherson) considered to have the leg strength for a 65+ yard attempt, increasing the number of potential opportunities.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2018-2024 reference class would be a distribution centered around 62.5 yards, with a sharp decline in probability above 64 yards and a very thin tail out to the record of 66. (Equivalent n ~ 7 seasons).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **K-ball rule change (↑ Large):** This is a structural shock. It widens the entire distribution and significantly fattens the right tail (65+ yards).
    *   **Cam Little's 70-yard preseason FG (↑ Moderate):** This acts as an anchor for the new plausible maximum, pulling the upper bound of the distribution higher.
    *   **64 & 65-yard FGs in Weeks 1-4 (↑ Large):** Strong evidence that the effect of the rule change is real and observable. This shifts the central tendency of the posterior distribution upwards by at least 1-2 yards.
    *   **Inconsistent 50+ yard accuracy league-wide (↓ Small):** A slight counter-signal suggesting the rule change may not improve *consistency*, but this is a weak mitigator for the question of *maximum* distance on a single kick.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a significant upward revision. The posterior distribution should be centered higher (perhaps 64-65 yards) and have a much fatter right tail, making a new NFL record (67+ yards) a plausible outcome rather than a

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical distribution of the longest field goal in recent NFL seasons (2018-2024) serves as the base rate. The longest field goals in these seasons ranged from 59 to 66 yards, with a median of 62 yards. This reflects the modern era of specialized kickers but does not account for the 2025 rule change.
   - Mean/Median: 62 yards; Variance: Moderate, with a thin tail beyond 66 yards.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The base rate captures the general capability of NFL kickers in recent years.
   - Difference: The 2025 season introduces a significant rule change allowing kickers to practice with game balls all week, potentially increasing maximum distances. Early-season evidence (64 and 65-yard kicks) suggests a shift towards longer distances.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - K-ball rule change: Increases likelihood of longer kicks due to better ball conditions (↑ Large).
   - Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick: Demonstrates potential for extreme distances (↑ Moderate).
   - Early-season 64 and 65-yard kicks: Strong evidence of increased maximum potential (↑ Large).
   - Inconsistent 50+ yard accuracy: Slightly mitigates expectations but focuses on consistency, not maximum potential (↓ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered around 62 yards.
   - Evidence from the K-ball rule change and early-season long kicks shifts the distribution upwards, increasing the mean to around 64-65 yards and expanding the right tail.
   - Posterior mean: ~64-65 yards; Variance: Increased, with a fatter right tail.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: Ensure tail risks are considered, such as extreme weather or game situations.
   - Alternative scenario: A reversion to historical norms if the rule change impact is overestimated.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a new record (67+ yards) as plausible, but not guaranteed.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the percentiles are as follows:

P10: 62  
P20: 63  
P40: 64  
P60: 65  
P80: 66  
P90: 67

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the longest field goal in each NFL regular season from 2018-2024:
- 2018: 63 yards (Graham Gano)
- 2019: 59 yards (Brett Maher)
- 2020: 61 yards (multiple kickers)
- 2021: 66 yards (Justin Tucker) - NFL record
- 2022: 62 yards (multiple kickers)
- 2023: 61 yards (multiple kickers)
- 2024: 62 yards (based on background information)

This gives a mean of 62 yards and a standard deviation of about 2.2 yards. The distribution is slightly right-skewed with the 66-yard outlier from Tucker's record kick.

I chose this reference class because it represents the modern era of specialized kicking but predates the 2025 rule change. This provides a stable baseline that captures recent kicking capabilities before the current season's rule changes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The physical fundamentals of kicking remain unchanged
- The same stadiums/venues are in use (including Denver's Mile High Stadium which enables longer kicks)
- Many of the same kickers are still active (Tucker, Aubrey, etc.)
- Game situations that prompt very long attempts (end of half/game) remain similar

**Key differences:**
- The 2025 rule change allowing teams to practice with kicking balls all week is a significant structural change
- We already have evidence of longer kicks in 2025 (64 and 65 yards in the first four weeks)
- Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick demonstrates a new upper bound of what's physically possible
- There appears to be a deeper talent pool of kickers with exceptional leg strength (Aubrey, Little, Tucker, etc.)

These differences suggest a rightward shift in the distribution and a fatter right tail compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for longer kicks:**
1. **K-ball rule change (↑ Large)**: The ability to break in kicking balls makes them more pliable and likely to travel farther. This is a fundamental change that affects all kickers. Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring a longer season maximum than the historical average.

2. **Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick (↑ Moderate)**: While preseason, this demonstrates the physical possibility of a 70-yard kick under the new rules. Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring a longer maximum.

3. **64 and 65-yard kicks in first four weeks (↑ Large)**: Two kicks that would have been among the longest in many prior seasons occurring so early suggests a significant shift. Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring a longer maximum.

4. **Brandon Aubrey scheduled to kick in Denver (↑ Moderate)**: The combination of a strong-legged kicker and high altitude creates ideal conditions for an extreme attempt. Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring a longer maximum.

**Evidence against longer kicks:**
1. **Inconsistent 50+ yard accuracy league-wide (↓ Small)**: The background notes that through week 4, kickers aren't making a higher percentage of 50+ yard field goals compared to 2024. This suggests the rule change may not be as impactful as hypothesized. Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring the historical distribution.

2. **Cam Little's inconsistency in regular season (↓ Small)**: While he has demonstrated maximum potential, inconsistent performance may reduce opportunities for extreme attempts. Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring the historical distribution.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 62 yards with a standard deviation of 2.2 yards, I'll update based on the evidence.

The combined likelihood ratio from the positive evidence is approximately (3 × 2 × 4 × 2) = 48:1 favoring a shift toward longer kicks.

The combined likelihood ratio from the negative evidence is approximately (1.5 × 1.2) = 1.8:1 favoring the historical distribution.

The net likelihood ratio is therefore approximately 48 ÷ 1.8 = 26.7:1 favoring a significant shift toward longer kicks.

This strong update shifts my posterior distribution:
- The mean moves from 62 yards to approximately 65 yards
- The standard deviation increases from 2.2 to about 3 yards (reflecting greater uncertainty)
- The right tail becomes fatter, with meaningful probability extending to 70+ yards

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting early-season evidence. Four weeks is a small sample, and the rest of the season could revert to historical patterns.
- The preseason 70-yard kick occurred under controlled conditions that may not be replicated in a regular-season game.
- I might be underestimating the role of luck in Tucker's 66-yard record; such outliers are rare for a reason.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Weather conditions could be unfavorable for long kicks in key games (Denver, etc.)
- Coaches might become more conservative after seeing some high-profile misses
- The 64 and 65-yard kicks might represent the ceiling of what's possible under the new rules

**Adjustments:**
- I should widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty
- I should be careful not to place too much weight on the preseason 70-yard kick
- I should consider that the early-season evidence might be partly due to random variation

After this critical evaluation, I'll slightly moderate my update but still maintain a significant shift from the prior distribution.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My prior distribution is based on the longest field goal made in each NFL regular season from 2013 to 2024. This 12-season period represents the modern era of strong-legged, specialized kickers, beginning with Matt Prater's then-record 64-yarder and including Justin Tucker's current record of 66 yards.

*   **Reference Class Data (2013-2024):** The values range from 57 to 66 yards.
*   **Mean/Median:** The median is 61 yards, and the mean is 61.1 yards.
*   **Spread:** The distribution is tight, with a standard deviation of approximately 2.7 yards. There is a sharp drop-off in probability for kicks longer than 64 yards, with only two instances (64 and 66 yards) in 12 seasons. The base rate probability of a new record (>66 yards) in any given season was very low.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base rate period due to a significant structural change.

*   **Similarities:** The game context remains similar. Long attempts are typically made at the end of a half or game, and environmental factors like altitude (Denver) and weather continue to play a crucial role. The league still features a pool of kickers with elite leg strength.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the new 2025 rule allowing teams to practice with and "break in" the official kicking balls ("K-balls") all week. This is hypothesized to make the balls more pliable and increase the maximum distance a perfectly struck ball can travel. This is a systemic change affecting all teams, rendering the historical base rate less reliable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several pieces of new evidence from the 2025 season strongly suggest the distribution for the longest field goal has shifted significantly upwards.

*   **K-Ball Rule Change (Strong Upward Pressure):** This is the primary causal mechanism. The physics of a broken-in ball suggest a higher maximum travel distance. This evidence significantly increases the likelihood of outcomes in the upper tail of the distribution (66+ yards).
*   **Early Season Results (Very Strong Upward Pressure):** Two field goals of 64 and 65 yards were made within the first four weeks of the season. This is powerful evidence that the effect of the rule change is real and substantial. The season's longest kick is *already* 65 yards, which would have been the longest kick of the year in 9 of the 12 seasons in my reference period. This truncates the potential distribution, setting a hard floor at 65 yards.
*   **Preseason 70-Yard Kick (Moderate Upward Pressure):** Cam Little's 70-yard preseason field goal, while unofficial, serves as an "existence proof." It demonstrates that the new physical limit under current conditions is substantially higher than the old record. This evidence makes previously unthinkable outcomes (68-70 yards) plausible, fattening the extreme right tail of the distribution.
*   **Overall 50+ Yard Accuracy (Weak Downward Pressure):** The report notes that overall accuracy on 50+ yard kicks has not increased compared to 2024. This is a mild counterpoint, suggesting the rule change may not improve consistency. However, this forecast is about the single longest kick (an outlier), not the average, so the impact of this evidence is minimal.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My reasoning follows a conceptual Bayesian update: `Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood`.

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 61-62 yards, with a very thin tail beyond 66 yards.
*   **Likelihood Adjustment:** The evidence from 2025 (K-ball rule, early season makes, preseason potential) overwhelmingly supports higher values. The fact that a 65-yard field goal has already been made provides a definitive update: the probability of the final value being less than 65 is now zero.
*   **Posterior:** My posterior distribution is now conditional on the fact that the maximum is at least 65 yards. With over 75% of the season remaining, including games in high altitude, there is a high probability that this 65-yard mark will be surpassed. The central tendency of my posterior shifts from ~61.5 yards to ~66-67 yards. The distribution is now skewed to the right, with a plausible tail extending to 69-70 yards. The probability of a new NFL record (67+ yards) has moved from a remote possibility to a likely outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider if I am overreacting to early-season data. It's possible the 64 and 65-yard kicks were flukes aided by ideal conditions, and the rest of the season will see a regression. Coaches might become more risk-averse, and key long-range kickers could suffer injuries, limiting further opportunities. In this scenario, the final maximum could remain at 65 yards.

However, the alternative forecast—that I am *underestimating* the effect—is also plausible. The combination of the new K-ball rule, a powerful kicker like Brandon Aubrey, and the thin air of Denver creates a "perfect storm" scenario where a 68-70 yard kick is a distinct possibility. The 70-yard preseason kick is a strong signal of this new potential. My final distribution accounts for the chance that 65 holds, but gives more weight to a new record being set, reflecting the strength of the new evidence.
