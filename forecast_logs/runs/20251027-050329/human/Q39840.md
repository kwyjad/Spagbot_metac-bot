### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent La Niña Years (2020-2022):** This is the most direct reference class. During the "triple-dip" La Niña, global temperatures were suppressed relative to the long-term trend. The peak daily anomalies in November/December of these years provide a strong baseline.
    *   **Base Rate:** Peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec during 2020-2022 likely fell in the **0.4°C to 0.7°C** range above the 1991-2020 baseline.
    *   **Reasoning:** This period represents the most recent instance of the same climate state (La Niña) at the same time of year. Visual inspection of historical charts (like the one provided, which shows pre-2023 years in grey) confirms that non-El Niño years cluster in this lower range.
    *   **Limitations:** The background warming trend means the baseline temperature for 2025 is ~0.06°C warmer than for the 2020-2022 period. Additionally, residual heat from the powerful 2023-24 El Niño and other factors may differentiate this event.

2.  **All Non-El Niño Years (2015-2025):** This class includes both La Niña and ENSO-neutral years, providing a broader perspective on "normal" conditions in the current climate epoch.
    *   **Base Rate:** Peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec for these years likely fell in the **0.5°C to 0.8°C** range.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class accounts for the possibility that the current La Niña is weak and its effects are closer to an ENSO-neutral state. It captures more of the recent background warming.
    *   **Limitations:** Lumps together different ENSO states (weak/strong La Niña, neutral), potentially obscuring the specific cooling signal expected from the current event.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-26** NOAA models support La Niña continuing through Jan/Feb 2026. — (↓) — Reinforces that the primary global cooling mechanism will be active throughout the resolution period.
*   **2025-10-20** CPC maintains La Niña advisory, favoring persistence through Dec-Feb. — (↓) — High confidence from a key agency that La Niña conditions will define the forecast period.
*   **2025-10-10** NOAA announces La Niña emerged in September, noting it is 'weak'. — (↓, but ↑ relative to a stronger La Niña) — Confirms the cooling regime is in place, but its weakness suggests a more moderate cooling effect than a stronger event.
*   **2025-09-11** US CPC forecasts a 71% probability of La Niña for Oct-Dec 2025. — (↓) — Early, high-confidence signal that a cooling event was imminent for the resolution period.
*   **2025-H2** Global surface air temperature anomaly stagnates, falling from 2nd to 3rd warmest year-to-date. — (↓) — Observational data confirms the cooling trend relative to the extreme heat of late 2023/early 2024, consistent with the end of El Niño and onset of La Niña.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ENSO State (La Niña):** The presence of La Niña is the primary driver. It involves cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, reducing heat transfer to the atmosphere and exerting a net cooling effect on global average temperatures. **Size: Large (downward pressure).**
2.  **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The underlying baseline is relentlessly warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. Any La Niña event in 2025 will occur in a significantly warmer world than one a decade ago, setting a higher "floor" for temperatures. **Size: Large (upward pressure).**
3.  **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The world's oceans are at record-high temperatures. While La Niña cools the surface of the equatorial Pacific, the enormous heat reservoir in the broader ocean can moderate this cooling and contribute to overall atmospheric warmth. **Size: Moderate (upward pressure).**
4.  **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) Eruption Aftermath:** The January 2022 eruption injected a massive amount of water vapor (a potent greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. This is estimated to have a small but persistent global warming effect (~0.05-0.1°C) that is still active. **Size: Small (upward pressure).**
5.  **Stochastic Weather Variability:** The final number is the *highest single day*, not a monthly average. A specific large-scale weather pattern (e.g., a "warm blob" or particular phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation) could cause a short-term spike, introducing significant random variance. **Size: Small-to-Moderate (volatility in both directions).**
6.  **Aerosols:** The absence of a recent major stratospheric-injecting volcanic eruption (like Pinatubo) means there is no unusual aerosol-driven cooling. This represents a neutral-to-warm factor compared to historical periods with more volcanic activity. **Size: Small (upward pressure, by its absence).**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Record-High Ocean Heat Content:** The background OHC is substantially higher than during the 2020-2022 La Niña period, providing a stronger thermal buffer that may dampen La Niña's cooling impact.
*   **Post-"Super El Niño" Inertia:** The system is transitioning from one of the strongest El Niño events on record (2023-24). There is significant residual heat in the climate system that may take longer to dissipate than usual, making the start of this La Niña warmer than its predecessors.
*   **Stratospheric Water Vapor Anomaly:** The warming effect from the HTHH eruption was not present during most historical La Niña events, adding a novel warming component to the current climate state.
*   **Forecasted "Weak" La Niña:** Forecasts consistently call for a weak event. The 2020-2022 period included moderate-strength La Niña phases, suggesting the cooling pressure this time may be less intense than in the primary reference class.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the 2020-2022 La Niña reference class, a prior centered around **0.65°C** seems reasonable, reflecting the base rate plus a small adjustment for the background warming trend. Equivalent n: ~10 observations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) **La Niña is active:** Confirmed cooling mechanism is in place. (Large)
    *   (↑) **Event is "weak":** The primary cooling mechanism is less potent than in many reference cases. (Moderate, partially offsetting the above)
    *   (↑) **Record Ocean Heat & Post-El Niño Inertia:** The background thermal state is exceptionally warm, providing a high floor and resisting cooling. (Moderate)
    *   (↑) **HTHH Water Vapor:** A small, persistent warming forcing is active that was not present in older reference cases. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests the strong cooling signal from La Niña is being significantly counteracted by a very warm background state and the event's own weakness. The posterior should move **moderately upwards** from a simple La Niña base rate, landing somewhere between a classic La Niña and an ENSO-neutral year.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) values trending back towards -0.5°C, suggesting the La Niña is weakening or failing to fully couple with the atmosphere.
    *   Development of a strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which can contribute to global warmth.
    *   Persistent positive sea surface temperature anomalies outside the equatorial Pacific, particularly in the Atlantic.
    *   Copernicus daily anomaly data for late October/early November consistently exceeding 0.8°C.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   ONI values dropping below -1.0°C, indicating a strengthening to a moderate La Niña.
    *   Strong negative sea surface temperature anomalies propagating westward across the Pacific.
    *   A major, sulfur-rich volcanic eruption in the tropics (a low-probability, high-impact event).
    *   Copernicus daily anomaly data for late October/early November consistently staying below 0.6°C.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The question resolves on the highest *daily* anomaly, which is subject to much higher variance from short-term weather patterns than a monthly or seasonal average. The final number could easily be 0.1-0.2°C higher than the monthly mean.
*   **La Niña Strength Uncertainty:** While "weak" is the consensus, ENSO forecasts have uncertainty. A slight strengthening or weakening of the event could have

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the peak daily anomalies during La Niña years, specifically 2020-2022, which ranged from 0.4°C to 0.7°C above the 1991-2020 baseline.
- **Reasoning:** This period is the most recent instance of La Niña conditions similar to those expected in late 2025. The historical data from these years provides a strong baseline for comparison.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** A reasonable prior mean is 0.65°C with a variance reflecting the range of 0.4°C to 0.7°C.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The presence of La Niña conditions aligns with the reference period, suggesting a cooling effect.
- **Differences:** The current La Niña is weaker, and the background warming trend is stronger due to record-high ocean heat content and residual heat from a recent strong El Niño.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **La Niña Conditions:** Suggests a cooling effect, making lower anomalies more likely.
- **Weak La Niña:** Reduces the cooling effect, making higher anomalies more likely than during stronger La Niña events.
- **Record Ocean Heat Content:** Increases the likelihood of higher anomalies.
- **Post-El Niño Inertia:** Increases the likelihood of higher anomalies due to residual heat.
- **HTHH Eruption Aftermath:** Adds a small warming effect, increasing the likelihood of higher anomalies.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 0.65°C.
- **Likelihood Adjustments:**
  - La Niña (↓): Strong cooling, but weak event (moderate adjustment).
  - Ocean Heat Content & El Niño Inertia (↑): Moderate upward adjustment.
  - HTHH Water Vapor (↑): Small upward adjustment.
- **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The posterior mean shifts upward from the prior, reflecting the net effect of these factors. The variance may increase slightly due to the added uncertainty from stochastic weather variability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the potential for unexpected weather patterns or a sudden strengthening of La Niña.
- **Tail Risks:** A strong weather pattern could cause a spike in anomalies.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where La Niña strengthens unexpectedly, leading to lower anomalies.
- **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for these risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025 are:

P10: 0.55  
P20: 0.60  
P40: 0.65  
P60: 0.70  
P80: 0.75  
P90: 0.80

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two reference distributions:

**Primary Base Rate**: November-December peak daily temperature anomalies during recent La Niña years (2020-2022)
- Median: ~0.65°C above the 1991-2020 baseline
- Range: Approximately 0.4°C to 0.8°C
- Reasoning: This represents the most recent comparable climate state (La Niña conditions during the same seasonal period)

**Secondary Base Rate**: November-December peak daily temperature anomalies for all years 2020-2024
- Median: ~0.8°C
- Range: Approximately 0.5°C to 1.2°C
- Reasoning: Captures the broader recent climate context, including the background warming trend

I'm weighting the La Niña-specific base rate more heavily since NOAA has confirmed La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through the forecast period.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- Similar seasonal timing (November-December)
- La Niña conditions present, which typically suppress global temperatures
- Same measurement methodology (Copernicus Climate data)
- Similar background greenhouse gas concentrations

**Key differences**:
- The current La Niña is described as "weak" compared to some stronger events in the reference period
- 2025 follows an exceptionally strong 2023-2024 El Niño, with residual heat still in the climate system
- Global ocean heat content is at record levels, providing a higher thermal baseline
- Background warming trend continues (~0.02-0.03°C/year), making 2025 slightly warmer than 2020-2022
- The Hunga Tonga eruption (2022) injected water vapor into the stratosphere, adding a small warming effect

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting lower anomalies**:
- La Niña conditions confirmed by NOAA on October 9, 2025 (strong evidence, likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower values)
- Global temperature has already stagnated in late 2025, dropping from 2nd to 3rd warmest (moderate evidence, LR ~2:1)
- NOAA's Climate Prediction Center expects La Niña to persist through end of 2025 (strong evidence, LR ~3:1)

**Evidence supporting higher anomalies**:
- La Niña is characterized as "weak" (moderate evidence, LR ~2:1 favoring higher values than typical La Niña)
- System is transitioning from one of the strongest El Niños on record (moderate evidence, LR ~2:1)
- Record ocean heat content provides thermal inertia (moderate evidence, LR ~2:1)
- Background warming trend continues (weak evidence for this short timeframe, LR ~1.2:1)
- Stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga (weak evidence, LR ~1.1:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my La Niña-specific prior centered at 0.65°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

1. **Update for "weak" La Niña**: This suggests less cooling than a typical La Niña
   - Prior: centered at 0.65°C
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher values
   - Posterior shift: +0.05-0.10°C, new center ~0.72°C

2. **Update for post-El Niño thermal inertia and record ocean heat**:
   - Prior: centered at 0.72°C
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher values
   - Posterior shift: +0.05-0.08°C, new center ~0.78°C

3. **Update for background warming trend and Hunga Tonga effects**:
   - Prior: centered at 0.78°C
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 favoring higher values
   - Posterior shift: +0.02°C, new center ~0.80°C

My posterior distribution is now centered around 0.80°C, with a wider spread than the original prior to account for increased uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating La Niña's cooling effect, even if "weak"
- The question asks for the highest daily anomaly, which could be significantly higher than the average due to short-term weather patterns
- I might be overestimating the residual warmth from the 2023-2024 El Niño
- Unexpected volcanic eruptions could rapidly cool the climate

**Alternative forecasts**:
- A more pessimistic view might center around 0.70°C, arguing that La Niña's cooling effect will dominate despite being weak
- A more optimistic view might center around 0.90°C, arguing that the background warming and thermal inertia will largely negate La Niña's cooling

**Tail risks**:
- Low end: A strengthening La Niña or unexpected volcanic eruption could push anomalies down to 0.4-0.5°C
- High end: A particularly warm weather pattern during a weak La Niña could spike temperatures to 1.0-1.1°C

After this consideration, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties, particularly the fact that we're looking for the highest daily value, not an average.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0.60
P20: 0.67
P40: 0.77
P60: 0.84
P80: 0.92
P90: 0.98

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the highest daily global surface air temperature anomaly in November/December 2025, relative to a 1991-2020 baseline. The most appropriate reference class is the set of recent La Niña years, as La Niña conditions are confirmed for the forecast period.

*   **Reference Class:** Peak daily anomalies in November/December during the 2020-2022 "triple-dip" La Niña.
*   **Reasoning:** This period represents the most recent instance of the same controlling climate state (La Niña) at the same time of year, in a climate with a similar (though slightly cooler) baseline temperature.
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** Visual inspection of historical data and the research report's analysis suggest peak daily anomalies in these years were in the 0.5°C to 0.7°C range. The underlying warming trend between 2021 (the midpoint of the reference period) and 2025 is approximately +0.08°C (4 years at ~0.02°C/year). Adjusting the historical range for this trend gives a prior centered around **0.68°C**, with a plausible range from 0.58°C to 0.78°C.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The primary similarity is the presence of La Niña, which exerts a global cooling pressure relative to the long-term trend.
*   **Differences:** Several key factors make 2025 different from the 2020-2022 period, and nearly all of them point towards a warmer outcome.
    1.  **Weak La Niña:** Forecasts consistently describe the current event as "weak," whereas the 2020-2022 period included moderate phases. A weaker event implies less cooling power.
    2.  **Record Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The climate system is emerging from a powerful 2023-24 El Niño, leaving global oceans with record-breaking heat content. This immense thermal reservoir resists cooling and provides a higher temperature floor.
    3.  **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) Eruption:** The 2022 eruption's stratospheric water vapor injection is still exerting a small but significant warming effect (~0.05°C), a factor not fully present during the reference period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Each piece of evidence updates the prior distribution.

*   **La Niña is "Weak" (Likelihood):** This evidence makes outcomes similar to stronger La Niña years (e.g., 0.6°C) less likely, and outcomes closer to ENSO-neutral years (e.g., 0.8-0.9°C) more likely. This pushes the entire distribution upwards. I estimate this shifts the median by approximately **+0.10°C**.
*   **Record OHC & Post-El Niño Inertia (Likelihood):** The exceptionally warm background state makes very cool outcomes highly improbable and provides fuel for warmer-than-expected daily spikes. This is a strong upward pressure, shifting the median by another **+0.07°C** and slightly skewing the distribution to the right (higher upside risk).
*   **HTHH Water Vapor (Likelihood):** This is a well-understood, persistent warming factor. It adds a near-certain positive offset to the final temperature. This shifts the median up by **+0.05°C**.
*   **Daily Peak Measurement (Likelihood):** The question asks for the highest single day, not a monthly average. This introduces significant variance from stochastic weather patterns. It doesn't shift the median but substantially widens the forecast distribution, especially at the upper end.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
I will update the prior median by incorporating the new evidence.

*   **Prior Median (trend-adjusted):** 0.68°C
*   **Update for Weak La Niña:** 0.68°C + 0.10°C = 0.78°C
*   **Update for OHC/Inertia:** 0.78°C + 0.07°C = 0.85°C
*   **Update for HTHH:** 0.85°C + 0.05°C = 0.90°C

This calculation suggests a posterior median around 0.90°C. However, the September 2025 anomaly is already down to ~0.8°C, and La Niña's cooling effect should persist. A simple additive model might overestimate the final value. I will temper this calculation and place my final median slightly lower, at **0.85°C**, acknowledging that some cooling from the current level is still plausible, but the warming factors will prevent a return to the levels of 2020-2022. The distribution will be wider than the prior to reflect the competing forces and daily volatility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if:
1.  **La Niña strengthens unexpectedly:** If the event intensifies to a moderate or strong level, the cooling effect could overwhelm the background warming factors, pushing the peak anomaly down towards my lower percentiles, perhaps as low as 0.70°C. My P10 is set to account for this possibility.
2.  **La Niña fizzles and OHC dominates:** If the atmospheric response to the cool Pacific waters is minimal, the event would be functionally ENSO-neutral. In this scenario, the record ocean heat could easily drive a daily spike above 1.0°C. This is a significant upside risk. My P90 must be high enough to capture this.
3.  **Overconfidence:** The combination of a known cooling signal (La Niña) with multiple warming signals (trend, OHC, HTHH) creates high uncertainty. My P10-P90 range of 0.35°C (0.70 to 1.05) is intended to be wide to reflect this. The right-skew in my final percentiles reflects that a "warm surprise" seems more likely than a "cold surprise" given the background energy in the climate system.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is centered at 0.85°C. The lower tail accounts for a stronger-than-expected La Niña, while the upper tail accounts for the significant upside risk from record ocean heat content and a potentially weak La Niña.

P10: 0.70
P20: 0.76
P40: 0.82
P60: 0.89
P80: 0.98
P90: 1.05
