### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine Era Ebola Outbreaks (Zaire ebolavirus), 2019-Present:** This is the most relevant class due to the game-changing nature of the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine. Outbreaks of the Zaire strain in this period have been small and quickly contained.
    *   **Base Rate:** Median deaths are in the single digits (e.g., DRC 2021: 6 deaths; DRC 2022: 5 deaths). The 75th percentile is likely below 20 deaths.
    *   **Reasoning:** The "ring vaccination" strategy, where contacts of known cases and their contacts are vaccinated, has proven highly effective at halting transmission chains.
    *   **Limitation:** This class has few data points. The current outbreak, with 45 deaths already, is a significant outlier, suggesting this base rate may be too optimistic if initial containment fails.

2.  **All Ebola Outbreaks in the DRC (1976-Present):** This class provides a broader historical context for Ebola in the country. There have been 15 prior outbreaks.
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is highly skewed. The median number of deaths is low (~30-40), but the mean is pulled up significantly by the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic (2,280 deaths). A reasonable range for a "typical" pre-vaccine outbreak might be 30-300 deaths.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the endemic nature of the virus in the DRC and the varying capacity of the health system over time, but it predates the most effective countermeasures.
    *   **Limitation:** It conflates pre- and post-vaccine eras and includes the Kivu outbreak, which occurred under unique conditions of intense armed conflict.

3.  **Moderate, Non-Megacity Ebola Outbreaks (Global, Pre-2014):** This class excludes the two extreme outliers (West Africa 2014-16, Kivu 2018-20) and focuses on outbreaks that were serious but ultimately contained without becoming regional catastrophes.
    *   **Base Rate:** The central tendency is likely in the 100-400 death range (e.g., Zaire 1976: 280 deaths; Uganda 2000: 224 deaths).
    *   **Reasoning:** This class may represent a scenario where initial containment (as seen in the post-vaccine era) fails, but the response is still effective enough to prevent a worst-case scenario.
    *   **Limitation:** These outbreaks occurred before modern tools (vaccines, monoclonal antibodies) were available, making them potentially too pessimistic.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province, DRC, with 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths reported. — **(↑)** — Establishes the starting point and initial severity.
*   **2025-09-07** Reported figures rise to 32 cases and 15 deaths. — **(↑)** — Shows early transmission, though data is preliminary and subject to revision.
*   **2025-09-30** WHO and partners launch a Regional Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. — **(↓)** — Indicates a coordinated and rapid international response is mobilizing, a key factor for containment.
*   **2025-10-17** CDC reports updated figures of 64 confirmed/probable cases and 45 deaths as of Oct 15. — **(↑↑ Large)** — This is the most crucial update. It confirms sustained transmission over a month and pushes the death toll well beyond recent post-vaccine outbreaks.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Vaccine Deployment Speed & Efficacy (Large):** The Ervebo vaccine is highly effective. The speed and coverage of the ring vaccination campaign is the single most important driver for containment. Delays or community refusal can allow the virus to escape the initial cluster.
*   **Conflict & Security (Large):** The 2018-20 Kivu outbreak demonstrated that armed conflict is a massive amplifier, as it prevents access for health workers, fosters mistrust, and disrupts contact tracing. The security situation in Kasaï is a critical variable.
*   **Geographic Spread (Moderate-to-Large):** Transmission in a dense urban center or along a major transport route is far more dangerous than in an isolated rural village. Spread to a major city like Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi would dramatically increase the potential scale.
*   **Community Trust & Engagement (Moderate):** Public cooperation is essential for contact tracing, safe burials, and vaccine acceptance. Mistrust and misinformation, as seen in past outbreaks, can severely hamper response efforts.
*   **Health System Capacity (Moderate):** The availability of Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs), trained personnel, and diagnostic labs determines the case fatality rate and the ability to isolate patients quickly. DRC has experience but resources can be strained.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Breached the Post-Vaccine Base Rate:** The current toll of 45 deaths has already far exceeded the totals of other Zaire-strain outbreaks in the post-vaccine era (which were <10 deaths). This implies a failure in the initial rapid containment that characterized those successes.
*   **Security Context is Intermediate:** Unlike the Kivu epidemic (Reference Class 2), Kasaï Province is not currently an active, high-intensity war zone. However, it has a history of conflict (2016-17) and is likely less stable and has weaker infrastructure than Équateur Province, the site of recent well-contained outbreaks.
*   **Systemic Experience is High:** The DRC and international partners (WHO, CDC) have now managed over a dozen outbreaks, including the second-largest in history. The institutional muscle memory, response plans, and stockpiles of tools (vaccines, therapeutics) are far more developed than for most historical outbreaks.
*   **Initial Growth Rate is Concerning:** Doubling the case count in approximately five weeks (from 32 to 64) is a worrisome signal. While not explosive, it is a significant velocity that points to ongoing, uncontained transmission chains.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior anchored on the **Post-Vaccine Era (Reference Class 1)**, heavily skewed towards a low outcome (<25 deaths). The strength of this prior should be moderate (equivalent n ≈ 5-10), acknowledging the vaccine's power but the small sample size of this class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↑↑ Large)** The current death toll of 45 definitively breaks the post-vaccine prior. This is a powerful piece of evidence that the outcome will be in a different regime than recent successes.
    *   **(↑ Moderate)** The sustained growth in cases through mid-October indicates that containment efforts are, at best, catching up and have not yet bent the curve.
    *   **(↓ Moderate)** The mobilization of a formal international response plan is a strong counter-signal, suggesting powerful resources are being deployed that should eventually constrain the outbreak.
    *   **(↓ Small)** The lack of a Kivu-level active war zone makes the worst-case scenarios (thousands of deaths) much less likely.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly pushes the posterior estimate upwards, away from the initial post-vaccine prior. The update should be significant, moving the median expectation from <25 into the 75-150 deaths range. The tail risk for a larger outbreak (>250) has also increased substantially.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in a provincial capital (Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi).
    *   Any confirmed cross-border spread into neighboring countries (e.g., Angola).
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or treatment centers.
    *   Reports of significant vaccine hesitancy or refusal in affected communities.
    *   The weekly rate of new cases continues to accelerate or holds steady.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A consistent decline in weekly new case numbers for two or more consecutive weeks.
    *   Official reports stating that all new cases are arising from known, monitored contact lists.
    *   High reported coverage rates (>90%) for ring vaccination in affected health zones.
    *   No new health zones reporting cases for over a week.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag & Reclassification:** Official numbers from the DRC Ministry of Health can be delayed and revised. Initial "suspected" cases may be ruled out, and deaths may be reclassified, creating noise in the data.
*   **Resolution Deadline:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026, which is only two months away. The outbreak will likely still be active. The final number is a snapshot at that

To forecast the number of deaths from the new Ebola outbreak in the DRC before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is the Post-Vaccine Era Ebola Outbreaks (Zaire ebolavirus), 2019-Present. This class has a median death toll in the single digits, with a 75th percentile likely below 20 deaths. However, the current outbreak's death toll of 45 already exceeds this, indicating a need to adjust the prior.
   - **Reasoning:** The introduction of the Ervebo vaccine has significantly reduced the scale of outbreaks, making this the most relevant prior. However, the current situation suggests a breach of this base rate.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, where previous post-vaccine outbreaks have occurred, and the vaccine is available.
   - **Differences:** The current outbreak has already exceeded the typical post-vaccine death toll, indicating a failure in initial containment. The security situation in Kasaï is less stable than in recent well-contained outbreaks, but not as severe as during the Kivu epidemic.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Current Death Toll (↑↑ Large):** The death toll of 45 suggests a significant breach of the post-vaccine base rate.
   - **Sustained Growth (↑ Moderate):** The increase in cases indicates ongoing transmission.
   - **International Response (↓ Moderate):** The mobilization of a response plan is a positive factor for containment.
   - **Security Context (↓ Small):** The lack of intense conflict reduces the likelihood of a large-scale outbreak.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Start with a prior skewed towards low outcomes (<25 deaths) based on the post-vaccine era.
   - **Update:** The evidence of 45 deaths and ongoing transmission shifts the distribution upwards. The international response and lack of severe conflict provide some downward pressure but are outweighed by the current death toll and case growth.
   - **Posterior:** The median expectation shifts to the 75-150 deaths range, with increased tail risk for larger outbreaks.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of underestimating the outbreak's potential due to data lag or reclassification.
   - **Tail Risks:** The potential for spread to urban centers or cross-border transmission increases the upper tail risk.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where the outbreak is contained quickly due to effective vaccination and response efforts could result in fewer deaths, but current evidence suggests this is less likely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the Bayesian update and red team thinking, the forecast percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased risk of a larger outbreak while considering the containment efforts.

P10: 50  
P20: 70  
P40: 100  
P60: 130  
P80: 180  
P90: 250

# Forecast: How many people will die from the new Ebola outbreak before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a hybrid approach drawing from multiple reference classes:

**Primary Base Rate: Post-2019 Vaccine Era Outbreaks (Zaire ebolavirus)**
- Most relevant due to vaccine availability and improved response protocols
- Typical deaths: 5-15 per outbreak (e.g., DRC 2021: 6 deaths; DRC 2022: 5 deaths)
- Mean: ~10 deaths; Median: ~6 deaths; 90th percentile: ~25 deaths

**Secondary Base Rate: Moderate DRC Outbreaks (excluding mega-outbreaks)**
- Captures the endemic nature of Ebola in DRC and varying response capacity
- Typical deaths: 30-300 per outbreak
- Mean: ~150 deaths; Median: ~50 deaths; 90th percentile: ~300 deaths

I'm selecting a weighted combination of these base rates, with more weight on the post-vaccine era but acknowledging that the current outbreak has already exceeded typical post-vaccine numbers.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same virus (Zaire ebolavirus) with similar transmission dynamics
- Same country (DRC) with institutional experience handling outbreaks
- Vaccine and treatment protocols exist and are being deployed
- International response mechanisms are established

**Key differences:**
- Current outbreak has already reached 45 deaths, far exceeding recent post-vaccine outbreaks
- Sustained transmission over 5+ weeks indicates containment challenges
- Kasaï Province has different infrastructure and security context than recent well-contained outbreaks
- Only ~2 months remain until the resolution date (Jan 1, 2026)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- **Current death toll (45)**: Very strong evidence (LR ≈ 10:1) that this outbreak will exceed typical post-vaccine numbers
- **Sustained growth** (32 to 64 cases over ~5 weeks): Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 3:1) for continued spread
- **Kasaï Province context**: Weak evidence (LR ≈ 1.5:1) that response may be more challenging than in other regions

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- **Vaccine availability**: Strong evidence (LR ≈ 5:1) against reaching pre-vaccine era death tolls
- **Coordinated international response**: Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 2:1) for eventual containment
- **No reported spread to major cities yet**: Weak evidence (LR ≈ 1.5:1) against explosive growth
- **Limited time until resolution** (2 months): Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 3:1) capping the potential death toll

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 10-50 deaths (weighted combination of reference classes), I need to update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - Current death toll (45):**
- This immediately shifts my distribution upward
- The likelihood of seeing 45 deaths already is much higher under a "moderate outbreak" hypothesis than a "small contained outbreak" hypothesis
- Posterior median shifts to ~80-100 deaths

**Second update - Sustained transmission:**
- The continued growth in cases suggests the outbreak is not yet contained
- This further shifts my distribution upward and widens it
- Posterior median shifts to ~100-120 deaths with wider tails

**Third update - Time constraint:**
- Only 2 months remain until resolution
- This caps the upper tail of my distribution
- Final posterior median: ~110 deaths, with wider uncertainty than my initial prior

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for rapid containment now that international resources are mobilized
- I might be anchoring too much on the current death toll and not accounting for potential acceleration
- The data quality from the region may be poor, leading to undercounting or overcounting

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Rapid containment scenario**: The outbreak could be contained within weeks, with final deaths <70
- **Urban spread scenario**: If cases reach major cities, deaths could exceed 200-300 before January
- **Cross-border scenario**: Spread to neighboring countries could complicate containment and increase deaths

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my uncertainty bands to account for these scenarios
- I need to ensure my lower bound acknowledges the possibility of rapid containment
- I should raise my upper percentiles to account for potential acceleration

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 60
P20: 75
P40: 95
P60: 120
P80: 160
P90: 200

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the set of Ebola outbreaks of the Zaire ebolavirus strain in the post-vaccine era (2019-present). The introduction of the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine fundamentally changed outbreak dynamics. This reference class consists of a few small outbreaks in the DRC, with a median of 5-6 deaths and a maximum of 6 deaths. This suggests that with modern tools, outbreaks are typically contained very quickly.

However, this base rate must be blended with a "containment failure" scenario, as the vaccine is not a silver bullet and its effectiveness depends on rapid deployment. For this, a secondary reference class of "moderate, pre-vaccine outbreaks" (e.g., Zaire 1976: 280 deaths; Uganda 2000: 224 deaths) is useful. This class represents outcomes where an outbreak is not immediately contained but also does not become a regional catastrophe.

My prior is therefore a mixture model: a high probability on a very low death toll (<25) consistent with the post-vaccine era, and a lower but significant probability on a moderate toll (100-400 deaths) if initial containment fails.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, a country with deep experience in Ebola response. The international community (WHO, CDC) has mobilized quickly, and effective tools (vaccines, therapeutics) are available. These factors are consistent with recent, successfully contained outbreaks.
*   **Differences:** The crucial difference is that this outbreak has already broken out of the post-vaccine pattern. With 45 deaths reported by mid-October, it is an order of magnitude larger than other post-vaccine Zaire strain outbreaks. This signals a failure of the initial, rapid containment that defined those prior successes. The location, Kasaï Province, has a history of instability and may have weaker infrastructure than the sites of recent successes (like Équateur Province), potentially hampering response efforts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence strongly refutes the optimistic "post-vaccine era" base rate as the sole model for this outbreak.

*   **Evidence 1: 45 deaths as of Oct 15.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It is highly inconsistent with a distribution where the median is 6. The likelihood of this observation is far greater under a "containment failure" model. This evidence forces a massive upward revision of the forecast. (Likelihood: strongly favors higher outcomes).
*   **Evidence 2: Case growth from 32 (Sep 7) to 64 (Oct 15).** This doubling of cases over ~5.5 weeks indicates sustained, ongoing transmission. While not explosive, it confirms that the outbreak was not under control as of mid-October and the final toll will be significantly higher. (Likelihood: favors higher outcomes).
*   **Evidence 3: Mobilization of international response.** The formal launch of a WHO strategic response plan is a strong counter-signal. It means significant resources and expertise are being deployed to contain the spread. This evidence caps the extreme tail risk and makes a multi-thousand death scenario (like the 2018-20 Kivu outbreak) much less likely. (Likelihood: favors lower outcomes, especially trimming the extreme right tail).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior was a bimodal distribution with a large peak at a low death toll (<25) and a small peak at a moderate toll (100-400). The evidence of 45 deaths essentially eliminates the "low toll" peak.

*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   The likelihood of observing 45 deaths given the "low toll" model is near zero.
*   The likelihood of observing 45 deaths given the "moderate toll" model is substantial (as an early-stage figure).

Therefore, the posterior distribution is now a unimodal distribution centered on the "moderate toll" scenario. My median shifts dramatically upward from the initial prior, from perhaps 20-30 to over 100. The new distribution is anchored by the current reality (45+ deaths) and shaped by the competing forces of continued transmission versus a powerful, mobilized response. My central projection is that the response will slowly gain the upper hand over the next ~2.5 months until the resolution date, leading to a final toll in the low hundreds.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider alternative scenarios.
*   **Alternative 1: Rapid Success.** The response could be more effective than I estimate. The 45 deaths could be a lagging indicator, with transmission already being choked off by ring vaccination. If so, the final toll might not rise much further, perhaps plateauing around 70-80. This suggests my lower percentiles should be anchored not too far above the current death toll plus those already sick.
*   **Alternative 2: Significant Escalation.** Conversely, the sustained growth could be a sign of deeper problems, such as undetected urban spread or community resistance. A doubling time of 5.5 weeks is not fast; if conditions worsen, the growth could accelerate. This implies a non-trivial risk of the death toll reaching the mid-to-high hundreds by the end of the year. My upper percentiles must reflect this tail risk.

I have adjusted my percentiles to account for these possibilities. My P10 is set at 75 to reflect the "rapid success" scenario, while my P90 is at 280 to capture the "significant escalation" risk. The distribution remains right-skewed, which is appropriate for outbreak forecasting.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 75
P20: 85
P40: 100
P60: 125
P80: 180
P90: 280
