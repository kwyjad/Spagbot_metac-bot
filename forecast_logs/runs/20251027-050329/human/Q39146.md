### Reference class & base rates
-   **League of Legends World Champions by Region (2011-2024):** In the 14 tournaments held to date, 8 winners have been from South Korea's LCK and 4 have been from China's LPL. Only two winners have come from outside these regions (FNC from Europe in Season 1, and Taipei Assassins from Taiwan's LMS in Season 2). This establishes a strong base rate of ~86% (12/14) for an LCK or LPL team winning. The base rate for an LCK winner specifically is ~57% (8/14).
-   **Major International Tournaments (Worlds & MSI) since 2021:** Over the last four years (8 major tournaments: 4x Worlds, 4x MSI), 7 of the 8 winners have been from the LCK or LPL. The LCK has won 3 (Worlds '22, '24; MSI '24) and the LPL has won 4 (MSI '21, '22, '23; Worlds '21). This recent history suggests a roughly 50/50 split in championships between the two dominant regions.
-   **Defending Champions' Performance:** While winning back-to-back is rare (only SKT T1 in 2015-2016), the defending champion's organization often remains a top contender. T1's 2024 victory makes them a significant factor, though their path through the 2025 Play-In stage suggests a less dominant domestic season.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2024-11-02] T1 wins the 2024 World Championship — (↑ T1) — Confirmed T1's roster as world-class and capable of winning under the highest pressure, establishing them as the team to beat entering 2025.
-   [2025-05-19] Gen.G wins the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) — (↑ Gen.G, ↓ Other Teams) — Established Gen.G as the best team in the world mid-season, marking the first LCK MSI win since 2017 and signaling a potential power shift towards them.
-   [2025-09-26] LCK teams for Worlds 2025 finalized — (↑ LCK Region) — Gen.G, HLE, and KT qualified for the main event, with defending champion T1 in play-ins, indicating deep regional strength.
-   [2025-10-25] All four LCK teams advance to Worlds 2025 playoffs — (↑↑ LCK Region, especially Gen.G) — An unprecedented show of regional dominance. This dramatically increases the probability of an LCK winner and positions Gen.G, the LCK champion, as the tournament favorite.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Regional Dominance (Large):** The LCK and LPL have superior infrastructure, talent pools, and practice environments. The fact that all four LCK teams made the playoffs in 2025 is a massive signal of the region's current strength over all others.
-   **Team Form & Momentum (Large):** A team's performance throughout the current tournament is a primary driver. Gen.G's status as favorites and the LCK teams' clean sweep into the playoffs indicates peak form.
-   **Player Experience & "Clutch Factor" (Moderate):** Veteran players, particularly on teams like T1 (with Faker), have a history of performing better under the extreme pressure of knockout stages. This can defy regular-season form.
-   **Bracket Draw (Moderate):** The single-elimination playoff bracket is a key factor. The source notes a Gen.G vs. HLE rematch, meaning two top LCK teams will eliminate each other before the final, guaranteeing one LCK semi-finalist but also opening the path for teams on the other side of the bracket.
-   **Game Meta Adaptability (Small):** The specific champions and strategies that are powerful on the Worlds patch can favor certain teams' playstyles. However, top teams are typically adaptable, making this a smaller driver than raw skill and form.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Single-Region Playoff Representation:** It is highly unusual for all four teams from a single region to advance to the knockout stage. This suggests the gap between the LCK and other regions, including the LPL, may be wider in 2025 than in typical years.
-   **Defending Champion's Path:** T1, the 2024 champions, had to qualify through the Play-In stage. This is a weaker entry position than usual for a defending champion and indicates domestic struggles, contrasting with their historical dominance.
-   **Home-Region Underperformance (Potential):** The tournament is in China, which typically provides a minor advantage to LPL teams. The LCK's dominance in the early stages suggests this home-field advantage has not materialized as a significant factor this year.
-   **Clear Tournament Favorite:** While there are often favorites, the combination of Gen.G's MSI 2024 title, their implied LCK 2025 title, and the overall LCK dominance positions them as a stronger pre-playoff favorite than is typical.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the historical reference class, giving an LCK team a ~55-60% chance of winning, with the remaining probability concentrated on an LPL team. Equivalent n of ~15-20 tournaments.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) Gen.G winning the most recent international event (MSI 2024) elevates them personally.
    -   (↑↑ Very Large) All four LCK teams reaching the playoffs is an overwhelming signal of the region's current strength, pushing the probability of an LCK winner significantly higher.
    -   (↓ Small for T1, ↑ Small for Gen.G/HLE) T1's path through play-ins suggests they are not the strongest LCK team, shifting probability from them to the higher-seeded LCK teams.
    -   (↑ Moderate) Gen.G being labeled the "favorites" and facing their domestic rival HLE confirms their status as the team to beat within the dominant region.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior probability should shift heavily towards an LCK team winning (likely >80%). Within the LCK teams, Gen.G should be the clear favorite, with HLE and T1 as the next most likely contenders.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (for an LCK win, especially Gen.G):**
    -   Gen.G decisively wins their playoff match against Hanwha Life Esports.
    -   T1 and KT Rolster also win their initial playoff matches against non-LCK opponents.
    -   Commentary and analysis continue to highlight the LCK's superior macro play and team fighting in the playoffs.
    -   The top LPL contender (e.g., Bilibili Gaming) shows weakness or is eliminated early in the playoffs.
-   **DOWN indicators (for an LCK win):**
    -   Hanwha Life Esports upsets Gen.G in the playoffs.
    -   T1 or KT Rolster are upset by a non-LCK team.
    -   An LPL team demonstrates a new, dominant strategy that LCK teams appear unable to counter.
    -   Key players on LCK teams show a sudden drop in individual performance.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Incomplete Bracket Information:** The full playoff bracket and matchups (beyond Gen.G vs. HLE) are unknown. An unfavorable draw could see LCK teams eliminating each other, increasing the chances for another region.
-   **Knockout Stage Volatility:** Best-of-five series can be unpredictable. A single bad day, a surprise strategy, or a mental lapse can lead to major upsets, which historical data cannot fully account for.
-   **Information Gaps on Other Regions:** The provided sources are heavily focused on the LCK, leaving the true strength and current form of top LPL, EMEA, and Americas teams under-specified. A team like Bilibili Gaming could be just as strong as the LCK teams.
-   **"Winner's Fatigue":** Gen.G has been a top performer all year (MSI win, LCK win). There is a risk of burnout or being "figured out" by opponents by the end of a long season.
-   **Scenario-Based Data:** This analysis is based on a simulated 2025 scenario. Real-world dynamics, player transfers, or patch changes not mentioned in the sources are not factored in.

**Final Research Summary:** The evidence strongly points to a South Korean (LCK) team winning the 2025 World Championship, with their unprecedented success in having all four representatives reach the playoffs signaling immense regional strength. Gen.G are the clear favorites due to their recent domestic and international titles, but defending champions T1 remain a dangerous dark horse with a history of peaking during this tournament.

To forecast the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **LCK Teams (T1, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster, Gen.G):** Historically, LCK teams have won 8 out of 14 championships, giving them a base rate of ~57%. Given the recent dominance of LCK teams in the playoffs, we can start with a slightly higher base rate for LCK teams overall, around 60%.
- **LPL Teams (Bilibili Gaming, Anyone's Legend, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming):** LPL teams have won 4 out of 14 championships, giving them a base rate of ~29%. Considering the tournament is held in China, we can start with a base rate of around 30% for LPL teams.
- **Other Regions (An Asia-Pacific team, An EMEA team, An Americas team):** Historically, non-LCK/LPL teams have won only 2 out of 14 championships, giving them a base rate of ~14%. Given the current dominance of LCK and LPL, we can start with a base rate of around 10% for these regions combined.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **LCK Teams:** The unprecedented advancement of all four LCK teams to the playoffs suggests a stronger-than-usual performance, which supports increasing their probability above the base rate.
- **LPL Teams:** The tournament being held in China provides a potential home advantage, but the lack of LPL teams in the playoffs suggests a weaker performance than usual.
- **Other Regions:** Given the historical dominance of LCK and LPL, and the lack of strong evidence for other regions, their probability remains low.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Gen.G's MSI 2024 Win:** Strong evidence for Gen.G, increasing their likelihood of winning.
- **All LCK Teams in Playoffs:** Very strong evidence for LCK dominance, increasing the likelihood for all LCK teams.
- **T1's Play-In Path:** Suggests a weaker performance, decreasing their likelihood slightly compared to other LCK teams.
- **LPL Teams' Underperformance:** Decreases their likelihood compared to the base rate.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Gen.G:** Start with a prior of 15% (as one of four LCK teams), increase significantly due to MSI win and playoff performance.
- **Other LCK Teams (T1, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster):** Start with a prior of 15% each, adjust slightly based on evidence (e.g., T1's play-in path).
- **LPL Teams:** Start with a prior of 7.5% each, decrease due to underperformance.
- **Other Regions:** Start with a combined prior of 10%, decrease due to lack of evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence in LCK:** Consider the possibility of an LPL team or another region pulling an upset, though evidence is weak.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** An LPL team could benefit from home advantage or a new strategy, but this is speculative.
- **Adjustments:** Slightly increase probabilities for LPL teams to account for potential home advantage.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Gen.G: 35%  
T1: 15%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 10%  
KT Rolster: 10%  
Bilibili Gaming: 10%  
Anyone's Legend: 5%  
Top Esports: 5%  
Invictus Gaming: 5%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 2%  
An EMEA team: 2%  
An Americas team: 1%  

These probabilities reflect the strong evidence for LCK dominance, particularly Gen.G, while accounting for potential variability and uncertainties.

# Analysis of 2025 League of Legends World Championship Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option based on historical World Championship results and recent trends:

**South Korean (LCK) Teams:**
- T1: 4 championships (2013, 2015, 2016, 2024) - ~29% of all championships
- Gen.G: 1 championship (2017, as Samsung Galaxy) - ~7% 
- Hanwha Life Esports: 0 championships - 0%
- KT Rolster: 0 championships - 0%

**Chinese (LPL) Teams:**
- Bilibili Gaming: 0 championships - 0%
- Anyone's Legend: 0 championships - 0%
- Top Esports: 0 championships - 0%
- Invictus Gaming: 1 championship (2018) - ~7%

**Regional Base Rates:**
- LCK (South Korea): 8/14 championships (~57%)
- LPL (China): 4/14 championships (~29%)
- EMEA: 1/14 championships (~7%)
- Asia-Pacific (excluding LCK/LPL): 1/14 championships (~7%)
- Americas: 0/14 championships (0%)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The tournament structure remains similar to previous years
- The dominance of LCK and LPL regions continues (12/14 previous championships)
- T1 remains a powerhouse with Faker still active

**Key differences from base rate:**
- All four LCK teams have reached playoffs in 2025 - an unprecedented regional dominance
- Gen.G won MSI 2025 and appears to be the LCK champion, establishing them as the clear favorite
- T1 had to qualify through play-ins, suggesting domestic struggles despite being 2024 champions
- The tournament is being held in China, which could provide a home advantage for LPL teams

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for LCK dominance:**
- All four LCK teams reaching playoffs is extremely unlikely if LCK wasn't significantly stronger than other regions
  - P(All 4 LCK teams in playoffs | LCK will win) = Very high (~0.8)
  - P(All 4 LCK teams in playoffs | LCK won't win) = Very low (~0.1)

**Evidence for Gen.G specifically:**
- Gen.G won MSI 2025 and appears to be the LCK champion
  - P(MSI win + LCK title | Gen.G will win Worlds) = High (~0.7)
  - P(MSI win + LCK title | Gen.G won't win Worlds) = Moderate (~0.3)

**Evidence for T1:**
- T1 is the defending champion but had to qualify through play-ins
  - P(Play-in qualification | T1 will win) = Low (~0.2)
  - P(Play-in qualification | T1 won't win) = High (~0.8)

**Evidence for LPL teams:**
- Home region advantage in China
  - P(China hosting | LPL team will win) = Slightly elevated (~0.3)
  - P(China hosting | LPL team won't win) = Normal (~0.25)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update for Gen.G specifically:
- Prior probability: ~7% (historical championship rate)
- Likelihood ratio for MSI win + LCK title: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Likelihood ratio for all 4 LCK teams in playoffs: 0.8/0.1 = 8
- Combined likelihood ratio: 2.33 × 8 = 18.64
- Prior odds: 0.07/(1-0.07) = 0.075
- Posterior odds: 0.075 × 18.64 = 1.398
- Posterior probability: 1.398/(1+1.398) = 0.583 or ~58%

This seems high, so let's adjust for other factors:
- Bracket uncertainty (Gen.G faces HLE early, eliminating one LCK team)
- Knockout stage volatility
- The possibility of T1 peaking at the right time

After these considerations, I'll adjust Gen.G down to ~35-40%.

For T1:
- Prior probability: ~29% (historical championship rate)
- Negative update for play-in qualification
- Positive update for being defending champions and LCK's overall strength
- Posterior probability: ~15-20%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent performance (recency bias)
- The information is heavily LCK-focused, potentially underestimating LPL teams
- Single elimination format creates high variance outcomes
- I lack specific information about team rosters and current meta

**Alternative scenarios:**
- An LPL team (particularly Bilibili Gaming) could have developed counter-strategies to LCK teams
- The bracket draw could force LCK teams to eliminate each other
- A dark horse from EMEA could surprise (though historically unlikely)

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce LCK probabilities to account for knockout stage variance
- Increase LPL probabilities slightly due to home region advantage
- Maintain very low probabilities for non-LCK/LPL teams based on historical performance

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations, I'll distribute probabilities across all options:

## 7. Output Format

T1: 18%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 15%  
KT Rolster: 12%  
Gen.G: 35%  
Bilibili Gaming: 10%  
Anyone's Legend: 3%  
Top Esports: 3%  
Invictus Gaming: 2%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 1%  
An EMEA team: 1%  
An Americas team: 0%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate comes from the history of the League of Legends World Championship, particularly in its modern era. Since 2013 (12 tournaments), every single winner has come from either South Korea's LCK or China's LPL.

*   **LCK (South Korea):** 8 wins out of 12 (66.7%)
*   **LPL (China):** 4 wins out of 12 (33.3%)
*   **Other Regions (EMEA, Americas, APAC):** 0 wins out of 12 (0%)

To avoid assigning zero probability to rare events, I will start with a slightly adjusted prior:
*   **P(LCK team wins):** 65%
*   **P(LPL team wins):** 30%
*   **P(EMEA team wins):** 2%
*   **P(APAC team wins):** 2%
*   **P(Americas team wins):** 1%

This prior reflects the strong historical dominance of the two major Eastern regions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The tournament structure (group stage followed by single-elimination playoffs) and the presence of top teams from major regions are consistent with previous years. The LCK and LPL are again considered the strongest regions.

**Differences:** The key difference in 2025 is the *unprecedented* level of dominance shown by a single region in the early stages. The fact that all four LCK teams advanced to the eight-team playoff stage is a historic achievement. This suggests the performance gap between the LCK and all other regions, including the LPL, may be significantly wider this year than the historical base rate indicates.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report:

*   **Evidence A: All four LCK teams advanced to the Worlds 2025 playoffs.**
    *   This is an extremely strong signal of regional strength. The likelihood of this happening given an LCK team is the eventual champion (P(E | H_LCK)) is very high, as it indicates the region's teams are outclassing the field.
    *   The likelihood of this happening given a non-LCK team wins (P(E | ~H_LCK)) is very low. For an LPL or Western team to win, they would have to overcome a field where half the remaining contenders are top-form LCK teams.
    *   This evidence will cause a large upward update for the total probability of an LCK team winning.

*   **Evidence B: Gen.G won the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) and is considered the tournament favorite.**
    *   MSI is the second most important international tournament. Winning it establishes a team as the best in the world at that time. This strongly increases Gen.G's individual probability.

*   **Evidence C: T1 are the defending 2024 World Champions but qualified through the Play-In stage.**
    *   The defending champion status and their historical "clutch factor" means they cannot be underestimated. This keeps their probability high.
    *   However, their path through Play-Ins indicates a weaker domestic season compared to other LCK teams, which slightly lowers their probability relative to Gen.G, the implied LCK champion.

*   **Evidence D: Gen.G and Hanwha Life Esports (HLE) will face each other in the playoffs.**
    *   This guarantees that one of these top LCK teams will be eliminated. This caps their combined probability and opens up the bracket for teams on the other side, such as T1 and KT Rolster, increasing their relative chances.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Initial Prior:** P(LCK win) ≈ 65%, P(LPL win) ≈ 30%, P(Other) ≈ 5%.
2.  **Update on Evidence A (4 LCK teams in playoffs):** The prior odds of an LCK win vs. an LPL win are roughly 2:1. The likelihood ratio for this evidence is very high in favor of the LCK. A conservative estimate might be a 5x multiplier.
    *   *Posterior Odds (LCK vs LPL) ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio ≈ 2 × 5 = 10:1.*
    *   This implies the new probability for an LCK win should be around 10 / (10+1) ≈ 91% of the combined LCK/LPL probability mass. This pushes the total chance for an LCK team to win into the 80-90% range. I will adjust the total probability for an LCK win to 82%, acknowledging the volatility of knockout stages.
3.  **Distribute Probability within Regions:**
    *   **LCK (82%):** I will distribute this based on current form, historical performance, and bracket structure.
        *   **Gen.G** is the favorite due to recent MSI and domestic success.
        *   **T1** has a slightly easier initial path (not facing an LCK team) and is the defending champion.
        *   **KT Rolster** is the third seed with a solid chance.
        *   **Hanwha Life Esports** is a strong team but has the immediate, difficult task of facing Gen.G.
        *   This leads to a distribution where Gen.G and T1 are the top contenders, followed by KT and HLE.
    *   **LPL (16%):** The remaining probability is concentrated here. Bilibili Gaming and Top Esports are historically the stronger contenders among the listed LPL teams.
    *   **Other Regions (2%):** The chance for any other region is now minimal, as they would have to defeat multiple elite LCK/LPL teams.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary concern is overconfidence in the "4 LCK teams in playoffs" signal. While historic, a single best-of-five series is volatile. A top LPL team like Bilibili Gaming could have had an unfavorable group stage and might still be at the same level as Gen.G. The LCK teams could eliminate each other, creating a clear path for a strong LPL team to reach the finals. To account for this, I have capped the total LCK probability at 82% instead of a higher value, allocating a respectable 16% to the LPL teams as the most likely source of an upset.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed as follows, summing to 100%:

*   **LCK Teams (82% total):** Gen.G (28%), T1 (26%), KT Rolster (17%), Hanwha Life Esports (11%).
*   **LPL Teams (16% total):** Bilibili Gaming (7%), Top Esports (5%), Invictus Gaming (2%), Anyone's Legend (2%).
*   **Other Regions (2% total):** EMEA (1%), APAC (0.5%), Americas (0.5%).

This distribution reflects that while an LCK victory is highly probable, there is a clear hierarchy of contenders within that region, and the top LPL teams remain the most significant external threats.

---
T1: 26%
Hanwha Life Esports: 11%
KT Rolster: 17%
Gen.G: 28%
Bilibili Gaming: 7%
Anyone's Legend: 2%
Top Esports: 5%
Invictus Gaming: 2%
An Asia-Pacific team: 0.5%
An EMEA team: 1%
An Americas team: 0.5%
