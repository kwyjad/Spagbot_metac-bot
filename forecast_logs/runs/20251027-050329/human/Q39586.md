### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia: Presidential Party Opposition.** In the 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections since 1977, the party holding the White House has won the governorship only once (Terry McAuliffe, D, in 2013). This establishes a strong reference class with a base rate of **~92% for the non-presidential party (Republicans in 2025) to win**. This pattern reflects a tendency for the Virginia electorate to register dissatisfaction with the incumbent federal administration.
*   **New Jersey: Modern Gubernatorial Elections.** In the last six gubernatorial elections (since 2001), Democrats have won four times, suggesting a **~67% base rate for a Democratic victory**. New Jersey has a Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of D+6, reinforcing its blue lean. However, the state has elected Republican governors (Christie, Whitman) and the 2021 election was unexpectedly close (D+3.2), indicating significant volatility.
*   **Combined Off-Year Gubernatorial Races.** Looking at both states together since 2001 (6 cycles), the outcome has been a split ticket (one D, one R) four times, a Democratic sweep once (2005), and a Republican sweep once (2009). This suggests a **~67% base rate for a split result**, with "Only New Jersey" being the historically favored outcome given the other base rates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-26** WaPo article highlights the NJ race as a "test for Democrats" and notes Sherrill's single-digit lead. **(↓ for Both)** — Reinforces the competitiveness of the NJ race, slightly reducing confidence in a certain Democratic win.
*   **2025-10-24** WaPo article profiles VA candidates, establishing them as high-caliber opponents. **(Neutral)** — Sets the stage but does not shift probabilities.
*   **2025-10-22** Rutgers-Eagleton poll shows Sherrill leading Ciattarelli 50% to 45% in NJ. **(↑ for Both/Only NJ)** — Provides concrete evidence of a Democratic lead, though it is within the poll's margin of error and recalls the polling miss of 2021.
*   **2025-06-10** Primary elections finalize the matchups. **(Neutral)** — An expected procedural step. The candidates have been the presumptive nominees for months.
*   **General Polling (from background)** Spanberger is described as "up in the polls" in Virginia. **(↑ for Both/Only VA)** — This is the most significant recent development, as any Democratic lead runs directly contrary to the strong historical base rate in Virginia.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Presidential Approval (Large):** The approval rating of the sitting Democratic president will be a primary driver. Low approval will create strong headwinds for both Democrats, strongly activating the "Virginia curse" and making the NJ race a toss-up. High approval could negate the VA pattern.
*   **Candidate Quality and Moderation (Moderate):** Both Democratic candidates (Spanberger, Sherrill) have national security backgrounds and represent moderate wings of the party, which may appeal to suburban swing voters. This contrasts with the base rate, which is not candidate-specific. Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 shows he is a strong campaigner in NJ.
*   **Off-Year Turnout Dynamics (Large):** Gubernatorial elections in off-years have lower and more unpredictable turnout. The party with the more energized base (driven by national or state issues) has a significant advantage. This was a key factor in the close 2021 NJ race.
*   **State-Specific Issues (Moderate):** Issues like education policy (a major factor for Youngkin's 2021 VA win), taxes, and crime can create divergence from national trends and influence independent voters.
*   **Incumbency Fatigue (NJ) (Small):** After eight years of a Democratic governor in New Jersey (Murphy), there may be a soft desire for change, which could benefit Ciattarelli.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Strong Democratic Candidate in Virginia:** Abigail Spanberger is a three-term congresswoman from a competitive district with a CIA background. She is arguably a stronger, more moderate candidate than many past Democratic nominees, potentially giving her the profile needed to defy the historical anti-president trend.
*   **Polling Contradicts VA History:** Current (albeit limited) polling shows Spanberger with a lead. The base rate is built on final outcomes, not polling a few weeks out, but a durable lead for the presidential party's candidate would be a significant deviation from the historical pattern.
*   **Known Challenger in New Jersey:** Jack Ciattarelli is not a generic Republican; he is the same candidate who came within 3.2 points of winning in 2021. This provides a very recent, specific data point suggesting the generic "D+6 state" base rate may understate Republican chances.
*   **National Political Environment Post-2024:** The 2025 elections will be the first major test after the 2024 presidential election. The specific dynamics of that outcome (e.g., a narrow win, a contested result) will shape the political environment in ways not captured by a simple historical average.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The reference classes suggest a strong prior on "Only New Jersey" winning. The Virginia "curse" is a powerful historical pattern (equivalent n ≈ 12), while the New Jersey base rate is less certain but favors Democrats (equivalent n ≈ 6).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** Polling showing Spanberger ahead in Virginia directly challenges the strongest component of the prior. This is a significant piece of new evidence.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Polling showing Sherrill ahead in New Jersey confirms the base rate but the narrowness of the lead and memory of 2021 polling errors temper its strength.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The perceived high quality and moderate profiles of both Democratic candidates (Spanberger and Sherrill) make them better suited to their respective states than a generic candidate.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Ciattarelli's proven performance in 2021 is a strong signal that the NJ race is more competitive than its baseline partisanship suggests.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the Virginia polling, requires a substantial update away from the prior. The probability of a Democratic win in Virginia should increase dramatically. The probability of a Democratic win in New Jersey should remain above 50% but be tempered by recent history. The posterior should shift from "Only New Jersey" being the clear favorite to "Both elections" becoming the modal outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Democratic wins):**
    *   Final polling averages show Spanberger's lead in VA holding or growing.
    *   Sherrill's polling lead in NJ widens to double digits.
    *   National presidential approval rating is stable or improving.
    *   Democratic fundraising and early voting turnout numbers significantly outpace Republicans.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Republican wins):**
    *   Virginia polls tighten to a toss-up or show Earle-Sears leading.
    *   New Jersey polls show a dead heat, mirroring the 2021 trajectory.
    *   A national event sours the mood against the incumbent Democratic administration.
    *   Key endorsements in either state go to the Republican (e.g., a major newspaper or moderate figure).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Polling Error:** Off-year election polls are notoriously difficult due to turnout modeling. The 2021 NJ polls significantly underestimated the Republican vote share; a similar error in 2025 is a major risk.
*   **The "Curse" is Correlation, Not Causation:** The Virginia trend is a strong historical pattern, but not a deterministic law. Over-reliance on it as an unbreakable rule is a pitfall, especially when faced with contradictory evidence like polling.
*   **National Environment Volatility:** The election is a week away. A last-minute political, economic, or international crisis could dramatically alter the landscape and invalidate current polling.
*   **Candidate Gaffes:** With the election so close, a major mistake by any of the four candidates on the debate stage or campaign trail could have an outsized impact.

Final Research Summary: The historical base rates strongly favor a Republican win in Virginia and a Democratic win in New Jersey. However, current polling runs directly contrary to the Virginia trend, suggesting the Democratic candidate is well-positioned to break the "curse," making a Democratic sweep of both states the most likely outcome.

To forecast the outcomes of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections**: Historically, a Democratic sweep in both states is rare. Since 2001, this has happened only once (2005). Therefore, the base rate for both elections being won by Democrats is approximately 17%.
  
- **Only Virginia**: The historical trend in Virginia strongly favors the party opposite the sitting U.S. President. The base rate for a Democratic win in Virginia is about 8% given the "Virginia curse."

- **Only New Jersey**: Democrats have a stronger historical base rate in New Jersey, winning four out of the last six elections (~67%). Given the state's D+6 PVI, this is the most likely single-state win for Democrats.

- **Neither election**: A Republican sweep has occurred once since 2001 (2009), suggesting a base rate of about 17%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia**: The current situation deviates from the base case due to Spanberger's polling lead, which challenges the historical trend. Her moderate profile and strong candidacy could counteract the "Virginia curse."

- **New Jersey**: The base case of a Democratic win is supported by current polling, but the narrow margin and Ciattarelli's strong past performance introduce uncertainty.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia Polling**: Spanberger's lead in the polls is a significant piece of evidence against the historical trend. If Democrats were to win, this polling is likely (P(E | H) is high), whereas it is unlikely if they were to lose (P(E | ~H) is low).

- **New Jersey Polling**: Sherrill's lead supports the base rate, but the narrow margin and past polling errors reduce confidence. The likelihood of this polling if Democrats win is moderate, but not as strong as in Virginia.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia**: Given the strong polling evidence, we update the prior significantly. The prior odds of a Democratic win (0.08) are multiplied by a high likelihood ratio due to polling, increasing the posterior probability.

- **New Jersey**: The prior is moderately updated due to polling, but tempered by past errors and Ciattarelli's competitiveness.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The Virginia polling may overestimate Democratic chances due to potential turnout errors. Similarly, New Jersey's polling could underestimate Republican strength.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: A last-minute national event could shift dynamics, particularly affecting Virginia's historical trend.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to 100% and reflect evidence and base rates.

### 7. Output Format

Based on the analysis, here are the final probabilities:

Both elections: 40%  
Only Virginia: 5%  
Only New Jersey: 35%  
Neither election: 20%  

These probabilities reflect a significant shift towards a Democratic sweep due to current polling, while still accounting for historical trends and uncertainties.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical base rate: In 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections since 1977, the party opposite the White House has won 11 times (92%).
- With a Democratic president in 2025, this suggests a Republican win probability of ~92%.
- Prior for Democratic win in Virginia: 8%

**New Jersey:**
- Historical base rate: Democrats have won 4 of the last 6 gubernatorial elections (~67%).
- New Jersey has a D+6 partisan lean, suggesting Democratic advantage.
- However, the 2021 race was very close (D+3.2%), with Ciattarelli nearly winning.
- Prior for Democratic win in New Jersey: 67%

**Combined outcomes prior:**
- Both Democratic wins: 8% × 67% = 5.4%
- Only Virginia Democratic: 8% × 33% = 2.6%
- Only New Jersey Democratic: 92% × 67% = 61.6%
- Neither Democratic: 92% × 33% = 30.4%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Both are off-year elections with typically lower turnout
- Both states have term-limited incumbents, creating open races
- New Jersey maintains its Democratic lean in voter registration

**Differences from base rate:**
- Virginia: Spanberger is polling ahead despite the historical pattern
- Virginia: Spanberger is a particularly strong Democratic candidate with moderate credentials
- New Jersey: Ciattarelli is the same candidate who nearly won in 2021, not a generic Republican
- New Jersey: The race appears closer than typical for a D+6 state

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia evidence:**
- Current polling shows Spanberger leading
  - P(Polls show Dem lead | Dem wins) = ~90%
  - P(Polls show Dem lead | Dem loses) = ~10%
  - Likelihood ratio = 9:1 favoring Democratic win
- Spanberger's moderate profile and CIA background
  - P(Strong moderate candidate | Dem wins) = ~80%
  - P(Strong moderate candidate | Dem loses) = ~40%
  - Likelihood ratio = 2:1 favoring Democratic win

**New Jersey evidence:**
- Recent polling shows Sherrill leading 50% to 45%
  - P(5-point poll lead | Dem wins) = ~80%
  - P(5-point poll lead | Dem loses) = ~20%
  - Likelihood ratio = 4:1 favoring Democratic win
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance
  - P(GOP nearly won last time | Dem wins) = ~50%
  - P(GOP nearly won last time | Dem loses) = ~90%
  - Likelihood ratio = 1:1.8 favoring Republican win

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia update:**
- Prior odds: 8:92 = 1:11.5 (for Democratic win)
- Likelihood ratio from polling: 9:1
- Likelihood ratio from candidate quality: 2:1
- Posterior odds: 1:11.5 × 9:1 × 2:1 = 18:11.5 ≈ 1.57:1
- Posterior probability: 1.57/(1+1.57) ≈ 61% for Democratic win

**New Jersey update:**
- Prior odds: 67:33 = 2.03:1 (for Democratic win)
- Likelihood ratio from polling: 4:1
- Likelihood ratio from Ciattarelli's history: 1:1.8
- Posterior odds: 2.03:1 × 4:1 × 1:1.8 = 8.12:1.8 ≈ 4.51:1
- Posterior probability: 4.51/(1+4.51) ≈ 82% for Democratic win

**Combined posterior probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 61% × 82% = 50.0%
- Only Virginia Democratic: 61% × 18% = 11.0%
- Only New Jersey Democratic: 39% × 82% = 32.0%
- Neither Democratic: 39% × 18% = 7.0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polling errors: Off-year elections are notoriously difficult to poll accurately. The 2021 NJ race had significant polling errors underestimating Republican support.
- Late developments: With the election a week away, last-minute events could dramatically shift the landscape.
- Overconfidence in breaking the Virginia pattern: The "presidential party loses" pattern is remarkably consistent and may reassert itself.
- Turnout uncertainty: Off-year elections have unpredictable turnout patterns that polls may not capture.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Virginia pattern holds: Despite polling, historical patterns reassert themselves and Earle-Sears wins narrowly.
- New Jersey repeat of 2021: Polls underestimate Republican support again, and Ciattarelli wins a close race.

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce confidence in Virginia Democratic win from 61% to 55% to account for the strong historical pattern
- Reduce confidence in New Jersey Democratic win from 82% to 75% to account for potential polling errors similar to 2021

## 6. Final Normalization

**Recalculated combined probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 55% × 75% = 41.3%
- Only Virginia Democratic: 55% × 25% = 13.8%
- Only New Jersey Democratic: 45% × 75% = 33.8%
- Neither Democratic: 45% × 25% = 11.3%

Sum check: 41.3% + 13.8% + 33.8% + 11.3% = 100.2% (rounding error)

## 7. Output Format

Both elections: 41%  
Only Virginia: 14%  
Only New Jersey: 34%  
Neither election: 11%  
(sum ~100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

First, I will establish a prior probability for a Democratic win in each state based on historical data and state partisanship, before considering the specific candidates or current polling.

*   **Virginia:** The state has a powerful historical trend. In 11 of the last 12 gubernatorial elections (since 1977), the party not holding the White House has won. With a Democrat currently in the White House, this creates a strong base rate for a Republican victory.
    *   Prior P(Democrat wins VA) = 1/12 ≈ 8%
    *   Prior P(Republican wins VA) = 11/12 ≈ 92%

*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey is a blue-leaning state with a Cook PVI of D+6. In the last six gubernatorial elections, Democrats have won four times. This suggests a Democratic advantage.
    *   Prior P(Democrat wins NJ) = 4/6 ≈ 67%
    *   Prior P(Republican wins NJ) = 2/6 ≈ 33%

Combining these priors (assuming independence for now) gives a baseline for the four options:
*   P(Both): 8% * 67% ≈ 5%
*   P(Only VA): 8% * 33% ≈ 3%
*   P(Only NJ): 92% * 67% ≈ 62%
*   P(Neither): 92% * 33% ≈ 30%
The initial base rate strongly favors the "Only New Jersey" outcome.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Both elections are off-year gubernatorial races occurring under a Democratic president, making the national political environment a key shared factor. This environment tends to favor the out-of-power party (Republicans).
*   **Differences:** The specific candidates and current polling represent significant deviations from the generic base case. In Virginia, the Democratic candidate, Abigail Spanberger, is reportedly polling ahead, which directly contradicts the strong historical trend. In New Jersey, the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, is the same one who significantly over-performed in 2021, suggesting the generic "blue state" base rate may understate his chances.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will now evaluate the new evidence, primarily the polling and candidate quality mentioned in the background.

*   **Evidence for Virginia:** Polling shows Democrat Abigail Spanberger with a lead.
    *   Let H = Democrat wins VA. Let E = Polling shows D lead.
    *   P(E | H) is high. If the Democrat is going to win, we would expect her to be leading in the polls.
    *   P(E | ~H) is low. If the Republican is going to win (as the historical trend suggests), we would not expect the Democrat to have a durable lead in the polls. A lead would imply a significant polling error or a late break against the Democrat.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence has a high likelihood ratio (>>1), strongly favoring a Democratic win and pushing against the historical prior.

*   **Evidence for New Jersey:** Polling shows Democrat Mikie Sherrill with a single-digit lead, but Republican Jack Ciattarelli proved to be a very strong candidate in 2021.
    *   The polling evidence (Sherrill lead) moderately favors a Democratic win, confirming the base rate.
    *   The candidate evidence (Ciattarelli's 2021 performance) moderately favors a Republican win, as it suggests he is a stronger-than-average challenger for the state.
    *   **Net Effect:** These two pieces of evidence pull in opposite directions. The polling confirms the Democratic advantage, but Ciattarelli's known strength tempers that confidence, suggesting the race is more competitive than the state's PVI alone would indicate.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will now update the individual state probabilities based on the evidence.

*   **Virginia Update:** The prior was very low (8% for a D win). However, the evidence from polling is strong and directly relevant to this specific election. It is powerful enough to overcome the historical trend and make the race a toss-up. I will update the probability of a Democratic win in Virginia from 8% to **55%**, reflecting that the current evidence slightly favors the Democrat but the strong historical headwind makes it a very close contest.

*   **New Jersey Update:** The prior was 67% for a D win. The polling confirms a Democratic lead, but the memory of the 2021 polling miss and Ciattarelli's proven strength warrant a slight downward adjustment. I will update the probability of a Democratic win in New Jersey from 67% to **60%**.

Now, I will combine these updated probabilities to find the posteriors for the four options. I must also account for the positive correlation between the two races; a strong national environment for one party will help both its candidates. This means the "sweep" outcomes (Both, Neither) are more likely than a simple independent calculation would suggest.

*   Updated P(D win VA) = 55%
*   Updated P(D win NJ) = 60%

Calculating with a correlation adjustment (boosting sweep outcomes and reducing split outcomes):
*   **P(Both elections):** (0.55 * 0.60) + correlation boost ≈ 33% + 10% = 43%
*   **P(Neither election):** (0.45 * 0.40) + correlation boost ≈ 18% + 10% = 28%
*   **P(Only New Jersey):** (0.45 * 0.60) - correlation reduction ≈ 27% - 10% = 17%
*   **P(Only Virginia):** (0.55 * 0.40) - correlation reduction ≈ 22% - 10% = 12%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast makes "Both elections" the modal outcome. The biggest risk is over-weighting current polling and under-weighting the powerful Virginia historical trend. If the polls are wrong and the "Virginia curse" holds, the most likely outcome would shift to "Only New Jersey" or "Neither election". My forecast accounts for this by assigning significant probability (a combined 45%) to those two outcomes. The "Only Virginia" option is the least likely, as it would require the Democrat to win in the historically difficult state while the Democrat loses in the more favorable blue state, an unlikely combination given the shared national environment. The distribution seems reasonable and accounts for the main uncertainties.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities have been calculated and adjusted to sum to 100%.

*   Both elections: 43%
*   Only Virginia: 12%
*   Only New Jersey: 17%
*   Neither election: 28%
*   **Total: 100%**

The final forecast reflects that current polling makes a Democratic sweep the most likely single outcome, but the strong historical headwinds in Virginia and the competitive nature of the New Jersey race create a substantial chance that Republicans win one or both governorships.

Both elections: 43%
Only Virginia: 12%
Only New Jersey: 17%
Neither election: 28%
