### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Second Attempt at Orbital Booster Landing (after initial failure):** This is the most specific and relevant class. The primary analogue is SpaceX's Falcon 9. Its first sea-based landing attempt failed (Jan 2015), as did its second (Apr 2015). Success came on the fifth sea-based attempt (Apr 2016). This suggests a low base rate for success on the *second* attempt.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0-20%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on the only available data point (SpaceX), success was not achieved on the second attempt. This is a very small sample size, but it reflects the extreme technical difficulty of the task.
2.  **Maiden Flight of a Reusable Orbital Rocket System:** This class includes the first flight of any new orbital rocket designed for booster recovery. The Falcon 9's first flight did not attempt a landing. New Glenn's first flight attempted and failed. The Space Shuttle was partially reusable but a very different architecture.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~50% for achieving primary mission (orbit), <10% for successfully landing the booster on the first attempt where one is made.
    *   **Reasoning:** Reaching orbit is a known challenge; propulsive vertical landing of an orbital-class booster is an order of magnitude harder and was unproven until SpaceX. The base rate for the landing portion is extremely low.
3.  **Blue Origin Propulsive Landing Attempts:** This class includes all of Blue Origin's own attempts. The New Shepard suborbital booster has a perfect landing record over more than 20 flights. The New Glenn orbital booster is 0-for-1.
    *   **Base Rate:** >95% (suborbital), 0% (orbital).
    *   **Reasoning:** This highlights a key uncertainty. While the physics of suborbital landing are far less demanding (lower speeds, altitudes, and thermal loads), the company has deep institutional experience with the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) software and engine throttling required for vertical landings.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-22** Mated stages for the second New Glenn shown by CEO. — ↑ — A key physical integration milestone, indicating the vehicle is being assembled and the launch campaign is progressing tangibly, not just on paper.
*   **2025-10-08** Launch schedule confirmed for NET (No Earlier Than) Fall 2025. — ↑ — Reinforces that the company is still publicly targeting a 2025 launch, keeping the resolution in play.
*   **2025-01-17** Cause of first landing failure reported as a "guidance system failure". — ↔︎ — Narrows the problem space. A software/sensor issue may be more tractable than a fundamental hardware or aerodynamic flaw, but its complexity is unknown.
*   **2025-01-16** New Glenn maiden flight reaches orbit but fails to land booster. — ↑/↓ — Mixed signal. Proved the rocket's core ability to reach orbit, de-risking the ascent phase. However, it provided a real-world data point of landing failure.
*   **2024-08-21** Reports of testing failures (crumpled test article, upper stage explosion). — ↓ — Indicates ongoing developmental hurdles and potential quality control or design issues, even if Blue Origin frames it as learning from testing.
*   **2024-06-04** Blue Origin ramps up BE-4 engine deliveries. — ↑ — Shows maturation of the manufacturing process for the critical engine component, which is used on both New Glenn and ULA's Vulcan (which has flown successfully).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Root Cause Analysis & Fix:** The single most important driver. If the "guidance system failure" from the first flight was a simple, well-understood issue (e.g., a software bug, faulty sensor) that has been robustly fixed and tested, the probability of success increases dramatically. (Large)
2.  **New Shepard Heritage:** Blue Origin has over a decade of experience and data from successfully landing its suborbital New Shepard booster. While the scale is different, the core competencies in GNC, engine restart/throttling, and landing leg deployment are directly transferable. (Large)
3.  **Learning from SpaceX:** Unlike SpaceX, which had to invent the process, Blue Origin has had years to observe SpaceX's successes and failures. They can incorporate lessons learned about grid fin control, entry burns, and landing terminal guidance into their design from the outset. (Moderate)
4.  **Launch Window Pressure:** The ESCAPADE mission is a NASA planetary science mission heading to Mars. Mars launch windows are non-negotiable and occur roughly every 26 months. Missing the late 2025 window would be a major programmatic failure. This pressure could force a launch attempt even if readiness is marginal. (Moderate)
5.  **Cautious Corporate Culture:** Blue Origin's motto is "Gradatim Ferociter" (Step by Step, Ferociously). Their slow, deliberate pace suggests they will not attempt a landing unless ground analysis and simulation show a very high probability of success. This culture reduces the chance of a repeat failure from the same cause. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Vastly More Data Available:** The reference class (SpaceX's early attempts) was operating in a vacuum. Blue Origin operates in a world where orbital booster recovery is a solved problem, with extensive public video, academic papers, and industry knowledge available.
*   **Extensive Suborbital Experience:** Unlike SpaceX, Blue Origin entered its orbital landing program with a highly successful, operational suborbital reusable rocket program (New Shepard), providing a deep well of real-world GNC and landing experience.
*   **Engine Maturity:** The BE-4 engines have already flown successfully on both ULA's Vulcan and New Glenn's first flight. Early Falcon 9 landing attempts were concurrent with efforts to mature the Merlin engine.
*   **Lower Financial Pressure:** Blue Origin is funded by Jeff Bezos's personal fortune, insulating it from the near-term commercial or existential pressures SpaceX faced in its early days. This allows for a more methodical, less rushed approach to fixing problems.
*   **Mission Criticality:** This is not a test flight with a dummy payload. It carries an important NASA science mission, increasing the institutional imperative for overall mission success, which may or may not prioritize the secondary objective of landing the booster.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered around **30%**, anchored to the reference class of second attempts at a novel, extremely difficult aerospace maneuver (n≈3-5). The first attempt failed, and history shows these things are hard to get right on the second try.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Blue Origin is not starting from scratch; they benefit from a decade of SpaceX's public data and their own extensive, successful suborbital landing program (New Shepard). This is the strongest piece of evidence against the low base rate.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The first launch successfully reached orbit, proving the vehicle's fundamental design and the BE-4 engines work as intended for ascent. This isolates the landing as the primary remaining problem.
    *   ↑ (Small): Recent physical progress (mating stages) confirms the launch campaign is on track for a 2025 attempt, reducing the risk of a schedule slip into 2026.
    *   ↓ (Small): The cautious corporate culture, while good for eventual success, has led to immense delays. A ~10-month turnaround from the first flight is slow and suggests the fix was non-trivial.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests this case is different from the reference class. The prior experience from New Shepard and the ability to learn from SpaceX are powerful advantages. The posterior should move **significantly upward** from the low prior, likely landing above 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Successful completion of a full-duration static fire test on the launch pad.
    *   Announcement of a firm, specific launch date (e.g., "November 9th" vs. "NET Fall").
    *   NASA confirmation of readiness for the ESCAPADE mission.
    *   Detailed technical statements from Blue Origin explaining the nature of the first landing failure and the implemented fix.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any slip of the NET launch date into December 2025 or later.
    *   An abort or anomaly during the static fire test.
    *   Scrubbed launch attempts due to technical issues with the rocket (not weather).
    *   Vague or evasive statements from the company regarding pre-flight testing.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously secretive. Public information is highly curated. The true nature of the "guidance system failure" and the robustness of the fix are unknown outside the company.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires a "successful landing." This is generally understood as the booster landing intact on the droneship in a recoverable state, but edge cases (e.g., a hard landing that causes damage but doesn't destroy the booster) could create ambiguity.
*   **Schedule vs. Readiness:** The hard deadline of the Mars launch window for ESCAPADE could force Blue Origin's hand, leading them to attempt the launch even if they are not fully confident in the landing systems.
*   **Conflating Suborbital and Orbital:** Over-weighting the success of New Shepard is a risk. The thermal, aerodynamic, and energy management challenges of an orbital-class booster reentry are orders of magnitude greater than for a suborbital flight.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a second orbital landing attempt is low, but Blue Origin possesses unique advantages—notably their extensive suborbital landing experience and the ability to learn from SpaceX's pioneering efforts—that differentiate this attempt. The key uncertainty is the undisclosed nature of the initial failure and its fix, but recent progress suggests a launch attempt in 2025 is likely, with a probability of success significantly higher than the historical precedent.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the success rate of second attempts at sea-based booster landings, specifically referencing SpaceX's early Falcon 9 attempts. SpaceX succeeded on its fifth attempt, suggesting a low base rate for success on the second attempt. Given this, a base rate of 10% is reasonable, reflecting the extreme technical difficulty and historical precedent.
   - Initial prior: 10%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both involve second attempts at landing a large orbital-class booster on a sea-based platform, a technically challenging task.
   - Differences: Blue Origin benefits from extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard and can learn from SpaceX's public data. Additionally, Blue Origin's cautious approach may reduce the likelihood of repeated failures from the same cause.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Blue Origin's Suborbital Experience**: The success of New Shepard landings suggests a strong capability in GNC and landing systems. This evidence increases the probability of success.
     - Likelihood ratio: High (increases probability).
   - **First Launch Reached Orbit**: Demonstrates the rocket's ascent capabilities, isolating the landing as the primary challenge. This is a positive indicator but not directly related to landing success.
     - Likelihood ratio: Moderate (slightly increases probability).
   - **Guidance System Failure Identified**: The identification of a specific failure mode (guidance system) suggests a tractable problem, assuming it has been addressed.
     - Likelihood ratio: Moderate (increases probability).
   - **Cautious Corporate Culture**: While this reduces the chance of repeated failures, it also suggests a slow pace, which could mean unresolved issues.
     - Likelihood ratio: Low (slightly decreases probability).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 10% = 0.1 odds.
   - Evidence suggests a significant increase in probability due to Blue Origin's experience and learning from SpaceX.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (considering all evidence).
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds).
   - After considering the evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted upward significantly, likely above 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The reliance on suborbital experience may overestimate the ease of transitioning to orbital landings.
   - Alternative Scenario: The guidance system fix may not be robust, leading to another failure.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unforeseen technical challenges and the pressure of the Mars launch window.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, a probability of 60% reflects the improved likelihood due to Blue Origin's advantages and recent progress.

Final: 60%

# Probability Assessment: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a second-attempt orbital booster landing succeeding before 2026.

The most relevant reference class is "second attempts at orbital booster landings after an initial failure." This is a very small sample, with SpaceX being the primary data point:
- SpaceX's first sea-based landing attempt failed (January 2015)
- Their second attempt also failed (April 2015)
- Success came only on their fifth sea-based attempt (April 2016)

Given this limited historical data, I'll set a conservative prior of **30%** for success on a second attempt. This reflects both the extreme technical difficulty and the fact that the only comparable company failed on their second try.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Both involve recovering an orbital-class first stage booster
- Both companies are private, well-funded aerospace innovators
- Both are attempting recovery after learning from a first failure

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard (20+ successful landings)
- Blue Origin can learn from SpaceX's decade of public successes and failures
- Blue Origin has a more cautious, methodical engineering culture
- The BE-4 engines have already proven successful on both ULA's Vulcan and New Glenn's first flight
- Blue Origin has less financial pressure due to Jeff Bezos's funding

These differences significantly favor Blue Origin compared to SpaceX's early attempts, suggesting our prior should be adjusted upward.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Blue Origin's suborbital landing experience**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If they succeed, their New Shepard experience would be a major contributor
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if they fail, they still have this experience
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8
- This substantially increases the probability of success

**Evidence 2: First New Glenn flight reached orbit successfully**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful landing almost certainly requires a successful ascent
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Even with a failed landing, the rocket could still reach orbit
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.36
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Recent physical progress (stages mated, on track for 2025 launch)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Success requires the launch to happen on schedule
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Even with a failed landing, the launch is likely to proceed
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Reported "guidance system failure" as cause of first landing failure**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - If they succeed, it's likely because this was a fixable software/sensor issue
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if they fail, this could still have been the diagnosis
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 5: Blue Origin's cautious approach and 10-month turnaround**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Success could come from careful preparation
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Their cautious approach might indicate complex problems
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.71
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 30% (odds of 3:7):

First update (New Shepard experience):
- Prior odds: 3:7 = 0.429
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 0.429 × 1.8 = 0.772
- Posterior probability: 0.772/(1+0.772) = 43.6%

Second update (Successful orbit on first flight):
- Prior odds: 0.772
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36
- Posterior odds: 0.772 × 1.36 = 1.05
- Posterior probability: 1.05/(1+1.05) = 51.2%

Third update (On track for 2025 launch):
- Prior odds: 1.05
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14
- Posterior odds: 1.05 × 1.14 = 1.197
- Posterior probability: 1.197/(1+1.197) = 54.5%

Fourth update (Guidance system failure diagnosis):
- Prior odds: 1.197
- Likelihood ratio: 1.2
- Posterior odds: 1.197 × 1.2 = 1.436
- Posterior probability: 1.436/(1+1.436) = 59.0%

Fifth update (Cautious approach/long turnaround):
- Prior odds: 1.436
- Likelihood ratio: 0.71
- Posterior odds: 1.436 × 0.71 = 1.02
- Posterior probability: 1.02/(1+1.02) = 50.5%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 51%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the transferability of suborbital landing experience to orbital conditions
- The "guidance system failure" could be a euphemism for more complex, fundamental issues
- Blue Origin's secretive nature means we have limited visibility into their true progress
- The Mars launch window pressure could force them to attempt the launch before they're fully ready

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would emphasize that:
1. SpaceX needed 5 attempts to succeed at sea landings
2. Blue Origin's cautious approach suggests they found significant issues
3. The 10-month turnaround is quite long for a "simple" guidance fix

This view might put the probability closer to 30-35%.

**Rebuttal:**
Blue Origin has advantages SpaceX didn't have:
1. They can learn from SpaceX's decade of public successes and failures
2. They have extensive landing experience with New Shepard
3. Their first flight succeeded in reaching orbit, validating much of the system

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll slightly reduce my forecast to 48% to account for the complexity of the task and Blue Origin's limited orbital experience.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 48%

```md

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event requires two conditions to be met: a launch before 2026 and a successful landing. I will first establish a base rate for the more difficult and uncertain part: the successful landing of an orbital-class booster on only its second attempt, following a failure on the first.

*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is SpaceX's early attempts to land its Falcon 9 booster on a sea-based platform.
*   **Data:** SpaceX's first attempt at a sea landing failed (January 2015), as did its second (April 2015). Success on a droneship was not achieved until the fifth attempt (April 2016).
*   **Base Rate (Prior):** Based on this n=1 reference class, the success rate for a second attempt is 0%. However, using 0% from a single data point is too extreme. A more reasonable interpretation is that success on the second attempt is highly challenging and unlikely. I will therefore set a conservative prior probability for a successful landing on the second attempt at **20%**.
*   **Prior Odds:** A 20% probability corresponds to prior odds of 0.20 / (1 - 0.20) = 0.25, or 1-to-4 against success.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation with Blue Origin's New Glenn differs significantly from the base case of SpaceX in 2015.

*   **Similarities:** Both involve the propulsive landing of a large, liquid-fueled orbital booster on a moving sea platform, a maneuver of immense technical difficulty. Both failed on their first attempt.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Knowledge Inheritance:** Blue Origin is not a pioneer. They have had nearly a decade to observe and learn from SpaceX's many successes and failures. The fundamental principles are now proven, and a vast amount of public data exists. This dramatically de-risks the attempt compared to SpaceX's initial efforts.
    2.  **Suborbital Experience:** Blue Origin has successfully launched and landed its suborbital New Shepard booster over 20 times. While the physics of an orbital return are far more demanding (higher speeds, thermal loads, and energy), this provides Blue Origin with deep, flight-proven institutional experience in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), as well as engine throttling for vertical landings. SpaceX had no such program.
    3.  **Engine Maturity:** The BE-4 engines have already flown successfully on ULA's Vulcan and New Glenn's first flight, de-risking the ascent phase and allowing more focus on the landing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the 20% prior for a successful landing based on the key differences.

*   **Evidence 1: Extensive New Shepard landing success.** This provides direct, real-world experience with the core software and hardware for propulsive landing.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of having this experience, given they will succeed with New Glenn, is high.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of having this experience but still failing is also significant due to the increased difficulty, but the experience still makes success much more likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence significantly increases the probability of success compared to the base rate.
*   **Evidence 2: Learning from SpaceX's precedent.** Blue Origin is a "fast follower," not an inventor, in this specific domain.
    *   P(E | H): If they succeed, it is almost certain they will have leveraged lessons from SpaceX.
    *   P(E | ~H): Failing despite having this knowledge would be a significant indictment of their process.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This is another powerful piece of evidence suggesting their probability is much higher than the base rate.
*   **Evidence 3: Successful ascent on the first flight.** This proved the rocket's fundamental design and allowed data collection throughout the entire flight profile up to the landing attempt. The reported "guidance system failure" suggests a potentially solvable software or avionics issue rather than a catastrophic hardware or aerodynamic flaw.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately greater than 1. It isolates the problem and provides valuable data for the fix.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will first calculate the conditional probability of a successful landing, assuming a launch occurs in 2025, P(Success | Launch).

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:4 against success (20% probability).
*   **Update:** The combined evidence (New Shepard heritage, learning from SpaceX, successful first ascent) makes Blue Origin's situation fundamentally different from SpaceX's in 2015. The likelihood ratio is very strong. A qualitative update suggests moving the probability well above 50%. I will update the probability of a successful landing, given the attempt is made, to **60%**. This reflects a belief that success is more likely than not, but acknowledges the immense difficulty and the fact that it is still only their second attempt.

Next, I must estimate the probability of the launch happening before 2026, P(Launch).

*   **Positive Factors:** The payload is a time-sensitive NASA Mars mission (ESCAPADE), creating immense pressure to launch in the late 2025 window. Key hardware milestones, like mating the stages (October 2025), are being met.
*   **Negative Factors:** Blue Origin has a long history of significant schedule slips. Final pre-launch testing (e.g., static fire) can often reveal issues that cause delays. "Fall 2025" leaves little room for error.
*   **Probability Estimate:** Balancing the hard deadline against the potential for delays, I estimate the probability of a launch in 2025 at **70%**.

Finally, I combine these probabilities:
P(Event) = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Success | Launch in 2025)
P(Event) = 0.70 × 0.60 = 0.42

The resulting posterior probability is 42%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Weakness:** My forecast hinges on the assumption that the "guidance system failure" was a tractable problem and that New Shepard's experience is highly relevant. Blue Origin's secrecy creates a major blind spot; the problem could be more fundamental than reported. The leap from suborbital to orbital reentry is enormous, and I might be overweighting the New Shepard data.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A more pessimistic forecaster could argue that the base rate is more powerful. SpaceX, the world leader, took five sea-landing attempts. A forecast of <30% would be plausible if one believes the difficulty of the problem outweighs Blue Origin's specific advantages. This would imply that P(Success|Launch) is closer to 40% (0.70 * 0.40 = 28%).
*   **Rebuttal:** The pessimistic view underweights the power of being a follower. Replicating a known-possible feat with a decade of public data to draw upon is a fundamentally easier problem than inventing the process. The combination of this knowledge with Blue Origin's own extensive, hands-on landing experience makes a much higher probability of success justifiable. My 60% estimate for conditional success already incorporates significant uncertainty. The 42% final forecast remains a reasonable synthesis.

### Final Forecast

The forecast is a conjunction of two main factors: the probability of launching in 2025 and the conditional probability of the landing succeeding. The base rate for success on a second attempt is very low, but Blue Origin has unique and powerful advantages—namely, their extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard and the ability to learn from SpaceX's pioneering work. These factors substantially increase the conditional probability of success. However, the company's history of delays makes a slip into 2026 a significant risk. Combining a 70% chance of a 2025 launch with a 60% chance of that launch including a successful landing yields the final forecast.

Final: 42%
