### Reference class & base rates
1.  **State-level cannabis legalization (medical):** This is a strong reference class for a controversial, federally-prohibited substance gaining state-level acceptance. From 1996 (CA) to 2016, 24 states legalized medical cannabis, an average of ~1.2 states/year. The pace has since quickened. This class suggests a slow, incremental state-by-state process.
2.  **FDA approval of novel psychiatric drugs:** This class is relevant for the alternative, federal pathway. The FDA approves 40-55 Novel Molecular Entities (NMEs) annually across all categories. A small fraction of these are for psychiatric conditions. The success rate for a drug moving from Phase 3 trials to approval is high (historically 60-85%), but the timeline is rigid. This class suggests a binary, nationwide outcome is possible.
3.  **State adoption of other harm-reduction policies (e.g., needle exchanges):** This class models the diffusion of a public health innovation with moral/political opposition. Adoption is often clustered and follows a slow S-curve, taking over a decade to reach a majority of states. This suggests that even with a catalyst, nationwide adoption is not instantaneous.

*Reasoning:* The question can resolve via two distinct paths: state-by-state legislative action (like cannabis) or a federal FDA approval that unlocks legality nationwide (like a typical drug). The base rate is therefore a blend. The current count is 2 (Oregon, Colorado), consistent with the slow pace of the state-level reference class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-10-28]** Compass Pathways confirms PDUFA date of December 15, 2025 for COMP360 psilocybin therapy. **↑** — This sets a hard, near-term deadline for the FDA's approval decision, making a 2025 resolution via the federal path highly plausible.
*   **[2025-09-20]** FDA Advisory Committee (AdCom) votes 12-3 in favor of COMP360's efficacy, but raises concerns about safety monitoring and recommends a strong Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). **↑** — A positive AdCom vote is a strong leading indicator of approval, though the REMS recommendation could complicate or slightly delay implementation.
*   **[2025-08-05]** A bill to create a psilocybin therapy program in Massachusetts fails to pass before the legislature adjourns for the year. **↓** — Reinforces that the state-by-state legislative path is slow and unlikely to yield further results in 2025, locking the state-led count at 2.
*   **[2025-07-15]** The DEA issues a statement clarifying it will "act expeditiously" to reschedule any psychedelic compound that receives FDA approval. **↑** — Mitigates the risk of a long bureaucratic lag between FDA approval and DEA rescheduling, which is a necessary step for legal prescription.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **FDA Approval of a Psilocybin Product:** This is the single most important driver. An approval of a product like Compass Pathways' COMP360 before the deadline would be the catalyst for a massive increase. *Effect size: Large.*
2.  **DEA Rescheduling:** Contingent on FDA approval, the DEA must move psilocybin from Schedule I to a lower schedule (e.g., II or IV) to allow for prescription. A delay here could push legal use past the deadline. *Effect size: Large (but conditional).*
3.  **State-level Preemption or "Trigger" Laws:** Some states may have laws that would still prohibit psilocybin even if it were federally rescheduled. The number of such states is uncertain and could cap the total even after FDA approval. *Effect size: Moderate (downward).*
4.  **Administrative/Political Delays:** Events like a government shutdown (as hinted at in a provided source) or other political interventions could delay the FDA's decision past its PDUFA date. *Effect size: Small to Moderate.*
5.  **Implementation of Existing Programs:** Oregon and Colorado are the two states with existing programs. Their continued operation forms the floor for the forecast. No plausible mechanism exists to shut them down before the deadline. *Effect size: N/A (establishes floor).*

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dual-Track Approach:** Unlike cannabis, which was driven almost exclusively by state-level defiance of federal law, psilocybin legalization is proceeding on parallel state and federal (FDA) tracks. This makes a sudden, nationwide change far more plausible than it ever was for cannabis.
*   **Medical Framing:** The push for psilocybin is heavily framed around specific, severe medical conditions (e.g., Treatment-Resistant Depression), backed by formal clinical trials. This medical rigor distinguishes it from the broader wellness/recreational arguments often used for cannabis, potentially accelerating regulatory acceptance.
*   **Corporate vs. Activist Driven:** The FDA path is led by well-funded corporations (Compass Pathways, Usona Institute), which have the resources to navigate the complex and expensive drug approval process. This is a significant departure from the grassroots, activist-led cannabis movement.
*   **Therapeutic Requirement:** Legality is tied to therapy, requiring a complex infrastructure of trained facilitators and certified centers. This is a higher barrier to widespread access than simply allowing dispensaries, which could slow adoption even post-approval.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The distribution should be anchored at 2 (the current number of states: OR, CO). A reasonable prior might be a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution with a mean around 3, reflecting a low probability of 1-2 more states passing laws in the near term, with an "equivalent n" of ~10 (moderate confidence in the low baseline).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The confirmed PDUFA date of Dec 15 and positive AdCom vote are powerful evidence. This dramatically increases the probability of the "FDA approval" event occurring before the deadline, which would shift the outcome from the state-by-state regime to a federal regime.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The DEA's statement on expediting rescheduling reduces the uncertainty of the step following a potential FDA approval.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The failure of state-level bills confirms the legislative path is closed for 2025, removing any upside from that mechanism and solidifying the floor at 2 if the FDA path fails.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The (fictional) source mentioning a potential government shutdown introduces a concrete, exogenous risk of timeline slippage for the FDA decision.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests the forecast should be a bimodal distribution. The posterior should have a significant probability mass at exactly 2 (if FDA approval is denied or delayed into 2026) and another, likely larger, mass at a high number (e.g., 40-48) if approval and rescheduling occur. The mean should shift significantly upward, but the key is to represent this bimodal, almost binary, uncertainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   FDA approval announcement for COMP360 prior to the Dec 15 PDUFA date.
    *   Publication of the FDA's positive briefing documents in advance of the decision.
    *   DEA issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking for rescheduling in anticipation of approval.
    *   Key medical associations (e.g., American Psychiatric Association) issuing positive guidance.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   News of a federal government shutdown lasting more than a few days.
    *   Compass Pathways or the FDA announcing a delay in the PDUFA date.
    *   Leaks from within the FDA suggesting a negative decision or significant new safety concerns.
    *   Lawsuits filed by anti-legalization groups aiming to delay the process.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha ("Legal for therapy"):** If the FDA approves and the DEA reschedules, does this automatically make it "legal" in all 50 states? Some states have their own controlled substance acts that might not automatically conform to federal changes. The final number could be less than 50.
*   **Timeline Slippage:** The PDUFA date is a goal, not a guarantee. A delay of just 17 days would push the decision into 2026, causing the question

To forecast the number of U.S. states where psilocybin will be legal for therapy by December 31, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is informed by the state-level legalization of medical cannabis, which averaged about 1.2 states per year initially but has since accelerated. Currently, 2 states (Oregon and Colorado) have legalized psilocybin for therapy. The base rate is a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3, reflecting the slow pace of state-by-state legalization.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Like cannabis, psilocybin faces federal prohibition and moral/political opposition, suggesting a slow, incremental process.
   - Differences: Unlike cannabis, psilocybin has a dual-track approach with potential FDA approval, which could lead to rapid nationwide adoption if successful.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Positive AdCom vote and PDUFA date for COMP360 suggest a high likelihood of FDA approval, increasing the probability of a federal path to legalization.
   - DEA's statement on rescheduling supports the likelihood of rapid implementation post-FDA approval.
   - Failure of state-level bills indicates the state-by-state path is unlikely to yield more states in 2025.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Poisson distribution with mean 3.
   - Evidence: Strong positive indicators for FDA approval and DEA rescheduling shift the distribution significantly upward.
   - Posterior: Bimodal distribution with significant probability mass at 2 (if FDA approval is delayed or denied) and a larger mass at a higher number (e.g., 40-48) if approval and rescheduling occur.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of state-level laws that might not conform to federal changes could cap the number below 50.
   - Potential government shutdowns or delays in the FDA decision could push the timeline into 2026.
   - Adjustments: Account for these risks by spreading the distribution to reflect uncertainty and potential delays.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the bimodal distribution and accounting for uncertainties, the percentiles are as follows:

P10: 2  
P20: 2  
P40: 10  
P60: 40  
P80: 45  
P90: 48

# Forecast: Number of US States with Legal Psilocybin Therapy by Dec 31, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a bimodal prior distribution to reflect the two distinct pathways to legalization:

**State-by-State Legislative Path:**
- Currently 2 states (Oregon and Colorado) have legalized psilocybin therapy
- Based on medical cannabis legalization history (~1.2 states/year), we'd expect 1-2 additional states by end of 2025
- This suggests a component centered around 2-4 states

**Federal FDA Approval Path:**
- If FDA approves COMP360 (with PDUFA date of Dec 15, 2025) and DEA reschedules, this could enable nationwide therapeutic use
- However, some states may have laws preventing automatic adoption
- This suggests a second component centered around 40-48 states

The prior is therefore bimodal with:
- ~60% probability mass around 2-4 states (state-by-state path)
- ~40% probability mass around 40-48 states (FDA approval path)
- Mean: ~21 states, but this average is misleading due to bimodality

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes:**
- Like medical cannabis, psilocybin faces cultural/political resistance but has medical evidence
- Like FDA drug approvals, COMP360 is following standard regulatory pathways
- Like other harm-reduction policies, adoption follows political/regional patterns

**Key differences:**
- Dual-track approach (state + federal) creates bimodal possibilities unlike cannabis
- Medical framing with formal clinical trials provides stronger scientific legitimacy
- Corporate backing (Compass Pathways) provides resources for regulatory navigation
- Therapeutic requirement creates implementation complexity beyond simple prescribing

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher values:**
- PDUFA date of December 15, 2025 creates a concrete timeline for FDA decision (strong ↑)
- 12-3 positive AdCom vote strongly suggests FDA approval (very strong ↑, ~3:1 likelihood ratio)
- DEA statement on expediting rescheduling reduces post-approval delays (moderate ↑)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Massachusetts legislative failure confirms state-level path is slow (weak ↓)
- AdCom's REMS recommendation adds implementation complexity (weak ↓)
- Potential government shutdown could delay FDA decision past deadline (moderate ↓)
- State preemption laws could limit total even after FDA approval (moderate ↓)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our bimodal prior, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on AdCom vote (12-3 positive):**
- Historical data shows ~90% of drugs with positive AdCom votes receive approval
- This increases probability of the "FDA approval" scenario from 40% to ~60%
- The posterior distribution shifts weight toward the high-value mode (40-48 states)

**Update on timeline constraints:**
- PDUFA date of Dec 15 leaves only 16 days before resolution date
- Risk of government shutdown or administrative delays
- This reduces the probability of completing both FDA approval and DEA rescheduling in time
- Adjusting the "FDA approval" scenario probability down to ~50%

The posterior distribution remains bimodal but with:
- ~50% probability mass around 2 states (if FDA path fails to complete in 2025)
- ~50% probability mass around 40-48 states (if FDA approval and DEA rescheduling complete)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating how many states would automatically allow psilocybin therapy after FDA approval
- The DEA rescheduling process could take longer than anticipated despite their statement
- I might be underestimating the possibility of last-minute state legislation in progressive states

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would place more weight on the lower mode (2 states), arguing that:
1. FDA approval is likely but will slip into early 2026
2. DEA rescheduling will take months even after approval
3. The Dec 31, 2025 cutoff is too soon for the federal pathway to complete

This would shift the distribution to ~70% probability on 2 states and ~30% on higher values.

**Rebuttal:**
The FDA typically meets PDUFA dates, especially for breakthrough therapies with positive AdCom votes. The DEA's statement suggests coordination to expedite the process. However, the tight timeline does warrant caution.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 2
P20: 2
P40: 2
P60: 42
P80: 45
P90: 47

This forecast is for a numeric quantity, and I will use Bayesian reasoning to produce a full probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The number of states where psilocybin therapy is legal can increase via two distinct mechanisms, suggesting a bimodal prior distribution.

1.  **State-by-State Legalization:** This reference class includes the diffusion of policies like medical cannabis or harm reduction programs. This process is slow and incremental. Historically, medical cannabis legalization occurred at a pace of ~1.2 states per year. Given the current count is 2 (Oregon, Colorado), this path suggests the number at the end of 2025 would likely be 2 or 3. This forms the "low outcome" mode of our prior.
2.  **Federal FDA Approval:** This reference class involves the approval of a novel psychiatric drug. This is a single, nationwide event. If a psilocybin-based therapy is approved by the FDA and subsequently rescheduled by the DEA, it would become legally available for prescription in most states simultaneously. This forms the "high outcome" mode of our prior.

My prior is therefore a mixture model: a small probability of a few additional states legalizing on their own, and a larger, uncertain probability of a nationwide event. Let's assign a prior probability of ~60% to the FDA approval path succeeding before the deadline, creating a bimodal distribution with a small peak at 2-3 states and a large peak at a high number of states (e.g., 40-50).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is unique compared to the medical cannabis base rate because of the parallel, well-funded corporate effort to achieve FDA approval. Unlike the grassroots, state-focused cannabis movement, the psilocybin effort has a clear, powerful, and fast-acting federal path. This makes a sudden, nationwide change far more plausible. The heavy medical framing, backed by clinical trials, also distinguishes it from cannabis, potentially accelerating regulatory acceptance. This means the FDA approval path is the dominant mechanism to consider, and the state-by-state path primarily serves to establish the floor if the federal path fails.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several crucial pieces of evidence, all pointing to the federal path being the decisive factor.

*   **PDUFA Date of Dec 15, 2025:** This is extremely strong evidence. It confirms the FDA is scheduled to make a decision just 16 days before the question's resolution date. This focuses the uncertainty almost entirely on the outcome of that decision, not its timing. This dramatically increases the likelihood that the question will be resolved by the federal mechanism.
*   **Positive AdCom Vote (12-3):** This is a powerful leading indicator for FDA approval. The FDA follows positive AdCom recommendations in the vast majority of cases (~90%). While the committee raised safety concerns, these are typically addressed through risk management plans (REMS), not outright rejection after a positive efficacy vote. This evidence provides a strong likelihood ratio in favor of approval, pushing the probability of the "high outcome" scenario upwards significantly.
*   **DEA Statement on "Expeditious" Rescheduling:** This mitigates a key risk of delay. After FDA approval, the DEA must reschedule the substance. This statement reduces the uncertainty that this bureaucratic step would push legal access past the Dec 31 deadline.
*   **Massachusetts Bill Failure:** This confirms the state-by-state path is slow and has stalled for 2025. This solidifies the "low outcome" mode of the distribution at exactly 2 states.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Bimodal distribution with P(High Outcome) ≈ 60% and P(Low Outcome) ≈ 40%. The low outcome is 2 states. The high outcome is a distribution around 45 states.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The positive AdCom vote is very strong evidence for approval. If my prior odds of approval were 60/40 = 1.5, a likelihood ratio of ~8 for this evidence (a conservative estimate) would shift my posterior odds to 1.5 * 8 = 12, which corresponds to a new probability of 12/13 ≈ 92%. The PDUFA date and DEA statement further increase confidence in this outcome happening *within the required timeframe*.
*   **Posterior:** The evidence shifts the vast majority of the probability mass to the "high outcome" mode. My posterior is a bimodal distribution with a small peak at 2 and a large peak over a range of high numbers. The "high outcome" is not 50, as some states may have their own laws that are not automatically superseded or may be slow to adapt. I model this high outcome as a distribution centered around 47, with a plausible range of 43-49.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk is overconfidence in the FDA approval and subsequent implementation. I have updated my probability of the high outcome to ~92-95%. What could go wrong?
1.  **FDA Rejection:** Despite the AdCom vote, the FDA could issue a Complete Response Letter due to the safety concerns. This is a low-probability but non-zero event.
2.  **Timeline Slippage:** The Dec 15 PDUFA date is very close to the Dec 31 deadline. A short government shutdown, a last-minute request for data from the FDA, or other administrative hurdles could delay the decision into 2026.
3.  **DEA Delay:** "Expeditious" is not a binding timeline. Political or bureaucratic issues could still delay rescheduling.

Considering these risks, a 5-8% chance of rejection and a 5-8% chance of a critical delay seem plausible. I will combine these and estimate the total probability of the low outcome (failure of the federal path in time) at 15%. This makes my posterior:
*   **15% probability of exactly 2 states.**
*   **85% probability of a high number of states (a distribution from ~43 to 49).**

This bimodal structure must be reflected in the percentiles. The P10 will be 2, while the P20 and above will reflect the range of the high-outcome scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The final distribution is strongly bimodal. There is a 15% chance the outcome is 2. If that scenario does not occur, the outcome will be high, likely between 44 and 49. The percentiles reflect this structure, with a large jump between P10 and P20.

P10: 2
P20: 44
P40: 46
P60: 47
P80: 48
P90: 49
