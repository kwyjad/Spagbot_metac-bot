### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Falcon 9 Block 5 Launches:** This is the most specific and relevant class. The Block 5 variant, introduced in May 2018, was designed for high reusability and reliability. As of late 2023, it has flown over 250 times with zero launch failures.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0 failures / >250 launches ≈ **0%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the current, mature technology and operational process. Its limitation is that a perfect record cannot predict the probability of the first failure (the "black swan" problem).
2.  **All Falcon 9 / Falcon Heavy Launches:** This class includes all launches since the rocket's debut in 2010, including earlier, less mature variants. There have been two total failures (CRS-7 in-flight, AMOS-6 on-pad) and one partial failure (Orbcomm OG2 M1) in over 300 total launches.
    *   **Base Rate:** 3 failures / >300 launches ≈ **<1%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides a longer-term view of the entire program but is heavily skewed by early-program issues that have since been engineered out. It serves as a conservative upper bound on the per-launch failure rate.
3.  **Mature Orbital Launch Vehicles (e.g., Soyuz, Atlas V):** This class compares the Falcon 9 to other rockets with long, successful track records. These vehicles typically achieve reliability rates of 98-99% after working through early design flaws.
    *   **Base Rate:** **1-2% failure rate per launch.**
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides a general industry benchmark for what constitutes "high reliability" in rocketry. Falcon 9's current performance significantly exceeds this benchmark, suggesting it may be in a class of its own.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The forecast horizon is extremely short (from 2025-11-26 to 2025-12-31). The recency window emphasizes the last 6 months. The dominant recent development is the continued, flawless, high-tempo launch cadence.

*   **[2025-11-20]** SpaceX successfully completes its ~145th launch of 2025. **(↓)** Matters because it reinforces the "factory-like" production and launch model, suggesting process stability and high reliability.
*   **[2025-10-05]** A Falcon 9 booster completes its 20th flight, a new record for reusability. **(↓)** Matters because it demonstrates the robustness and deep understanding of the hardware's lifecycle, reducing the risk of wear-out related failures.
*   **[2025-08-15]** SpaceX announces plans to increase launch cadence further in 2026. **(↓)** Matters because this forward-looking confidence signals that internal metrics and component health show no signs of degradation despite the high tempo.
*   **[2025-06-01]** The entire Falcon 9/Heavy fleet surpasses 300 consecutive successful launches since the last failure in 2016. **(↓)** Matters because this historic milestone underscores the vehicle's extreme reliability, far surpassing any other launch vehicle's record.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Mature Design (Block 5 Variant):** The current fleet is a single, highly-iterated, and standardized design. The "bugs" have been worked out over hundreds of flights, creating an extremely reliable system. **(Large, decreases failure probability)**
2.  **Reusability & Data Feedback Loop:** Unlike expendable rockets, SpaceX recovers and inspects boosters and fairings after flight. This provides an unparalleled amount of data on component performance and wear, allowing for proactive maintenance and upgrades. **(Large, decreases failure probability)**
3.  **High Launch Cadence:** The "practice makes perfect" effect. A high tempo (~1 launch every 2-3 days) keeps launch crews proficient, standardizes procedures, and smooths out supply chain and manufacturing processes, reducing the chance for one-off errors. **(Moderate, decreases failure probability)**
4.  **Vertical Integration:** SpaceX's control over design, manufacturing, and testing of most components (engines, structures, software) reduces reliance on external suppliers and allows for rapid, tightly-controlled quality assurance. **(Moderate, decreases failure probability)**
5.  **Inherent System Complexity:** Rocketry is fundamentally difficult. A single failure in thousands of critical components (valves, turbopumps, electronics) can lead to mission loss. This risk can never be fully eliminated. **(Small, increases failure probability)**
6.  **Operational Tempo Stress:** While currently a strength, an extremely high launch cadence could potentially strain personnel and quality control, increasing the risk of human error or a missed inspection. **(Small, increases failure probability)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
This case is compared to the reference class of "Mature Orbital Launch Vehicles."

*   **Unprecedented Success Streak:** The Falcon 9's current streak of over 300 successful launches is a massive statistical outlier in the history of orbital rocketry. No other vehicle comes close.
*   **Data-Richness from Reusability:** The feedback loop from recovering and analyzing flight-proven hardware is unique at this scale. Other mature rockets are primarily expendable, limiting post-flight data to telemetry.
*   **Extreme Launch Cadence:** Falcon 9's launch rate (over 100 per year) is an order of magnitude higher than that of other mature vehicles like Atlas V or Ariane 5 during their operational peaks. This accelerates learning and process refinement.
*   **Single Standardized Fleet:** Unlike programs that operate multiple variants or are in transition, the Falcon 9 fleet is remarkably uniform, simplifying operations and reducing the risk of configuration-specific errors.
*   **Zero Failures in Period:** The most critical fact is that from Jan 1, 2022, to today (Nov 26, 2025), there have been **zero** failures over approximately 400 launches. The question is about adding to a current count of zero.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable starting point is a skeptical prior based on the best-in-class historical launch vehicles, assuming a per-launch failure probability of ~1% (or 1 failure per 100 launches, n=100).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The perfect, zero-failure record of the Falcon 9 Block 5 variant over its entire >250 flight history.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The fact that ~400 launches have already occurred within the 2022-2025 resolution period with zero failures. We are only forecasting for the final ~10-15 launches of this period.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The demonstrated success of the high-cadence, data-rich operational model, which appears to suppress rather than introduce errors.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The residual, non-zero probability of a "black swan" event, inherent to any complex engineering system.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides an overwhelming update downwards. The posterior probability of a failure *per launch* should be orders of magnitude lower than the initial 1% prior. Given that the number of remaining launches is very small (~10-15), the probability of observing one or more failures in the remainder of 2025 is extremely low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (failure more likely):**
    *   Any launch stand-down or multi-week delay for fleet-wide technical inspection.
    *   An increase in last-minute launch scrubs attributed to novel technical sensor readings.
    *   Public reports of significant supply chain disruptions for critical components.
    *   Any anomaly during a launch, even if the primary mission succeeds (e.g., booster fails to land, fairing recovery issue).
*   **DOWN indicators (failure less likely):**
    *   Continued nominal launches at the expected high cadence through the end of the year.
    *   Achievement of a new booster reusability milestone without issue.
    *   Successful introduction of minor upgrades that are explicitly for enhancing reliability.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Event:** The primary risk is a sudden, unexpected failure mode not predicted by past performance. A long success streak does not guarantee future success.
*   **Resolution Criteria Dependency:** The resolution hinges entirely on the "Launch outcome" column of a specific Wikipedia page. A delay in updating this page, or a dispute over the classification of an anomaly, could affect the outcome.
*   **Normalization of Deviance:** The high-tempo environment could, in theory, lead to the acceptance of small, unaddressed issues that could cascade into a larger failure. There is no public evidence of this, but it remains a known risk in complex operations.
*   **Forecast Horizon:** The question covers a four-year period (2

To forecast the number of Falcon 9 failures before 2026, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the Falcon 9 Block 5 variant, which has flown over 250 times with zero failures. This suggests a base rate of 0% failure per launch.
   - For a conservative upper bound, we consider all Falcon 9/Heavy launches, with 3 failures in over 300 launches, giving a failure rate of less than 1%.
   - The industry benchmark for mature orbital launch vehicles is a 1-2% failure rate per launch.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution of Falcon 9 Block 5 launches, with continued high reliability and no failures.
   - Differences include the unprecedented success streak and high launch cadence, which further reduce the likelihood of failure.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent developments, such as the completion of 145 successful launches in 2025 and a booster completing its 20th flight, decrease the likelihood of failure.
   - The high launch cadence and data feedback loop from reusability also decrease failure probability.
   - The inherent complexity of rocketry and operational tempo stress slightly increase failure probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior failure probability of ~1% per launch, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests a downward adjustment.
   - Given the zero failures over ~400 launches from 2022 to 2025, the posterior failure probability per launch is significantly lower than the prior.
   - With only ~10-15 launches remaining in 2025, the probability of any failures occurring is extremely low.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as a black swan event, is important but unlikely given the data.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a higher failure probability due to unforeseen issues, but the evidence strongly supports a low probability.
   - Adjustments for overconfidence are minimal due to the strong evidence base.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the forecast for the number of Falcon 9 failures before 2026 is extremely low, with the following percentiles:

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 0  
P60: 0  
P80: 0  
P90: 0

# Forecasting Falcon 9 Failures Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Falcon 9 Block 5 (Current Version)**:
- 0 failures in approximately 250+ launches since May 2018
- This suggests an extremely low failure rate, potentially below 0.4% per launch

**All Falcon 9 History**:
- 2 complete failures (CRS-7 in 2015, AMOS-6 in 2016) and 1 partial failure (Orbcomm OG2 in 2012)
- In approximately 300+ total launches since 2010
- Historical failure rate: ~1% per launch

**Mature Orbital Launch Vehicles Industry Standard**:
- Vehicles like Atlas V, Ariane 5, Soyuz in their mature phases
- Typically achieve 98-99% reliability (1-2% failure rate)

For my prior, I'll use a conservative estimate based on the full Falcon 9 history: approximately 1% failure rate per launch.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- Same fundamental rocket architecture and company
- Operating in the same physical environment with the same physics constraints
- Subject to the same inherent complexity of orbital rocketry

**Key differences from base rate**:
- The current Block 5 variant has demonstrated unprecedented reliability (zero failures)
- SpaceX now has vastly more operational experience than in early Falcon 9 days
- Launch cadence is significantly higher, providing more operational practice
- Reusability provides post-flight inspection data unavailable to expendable rockets
- The question covers only the remaining ~1 month of 2025, with likely 10-15 launches at most

These differences strongly suggest the current failure rate is significantly lower than the historical 1% rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for lower failure count**:
- Zero failures in Block 5 variant across 250+ launches (very strong evidence, likelihood ratio ~100:1 favoring lower failure rates)
- Zero failures in the 2022-2025 period so far, across approximately 400 launches (extremely strong evidence, likelihood ratio ~1000:1)
- Demonstrated booster reuse up to 20 times, validating design robustness (moderate evidence, likelihood ratio ~5:1)
- Standardized, mature design with minimal variations (moderate evidence, likelihood ratio ~3:1)
- Vertical integration allowing tight quality control (weak evidence, likelihood ratio ~2:1)

**Evidence for higher failure count**:
- Inherent complexity of rocketry means non-zero failure risk (weak evidence, likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)
- High operational tempo could potentially stress systems (very weak evidence, likelihood ratio ~1.2:1)

The combined evidence overwhelmingly supports a much lower failure rate than the 1% historical base rate.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior of 1% failure rate per launch:

**First update - Block 5 perfect record**:
- Prior: 1% failure rate per launch
- Evidence: 250+ launches with zero failures
- Likelihood ratio: ~100:1 favoring lower failure rates
- Posterior: Failure rate reduced to approximately 0.01% per launch

**Second update - 2022-2025 perfect record**:
- Prior: 0.01% failure rate per launch
- Evidence: ~400 launches in 2022-2025 with zero failures
- Likelihood ratio: ~1000:1 favoring lower failure rates
- Posterior: Failure rate reduced to approximately 0.00001% per launch

With approximately 10-15 launches remaining in 2025, the expected number of failures is:
15 launches × 0.00001% = 0.0000015 expected failures

This suggests an extremely high probability of zero failures for the remainder of 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- "Black swan" events: Unprecedented failure modes could emerge
- The perfect record might lead to overconfidence in my assessment
- Rare external factors (extreme weather, sabotage) aren't captured in the historical data
- The law of large numbers: With enough launches, eventually a failure will occur

**Alternative perspective**:
A more conservative forecaster might argue that complex systems always retain some irreducible failure risk. Even with a 99.99% success rate per launch, across hundreds of launches, the probability of at least one failure isn't negligible. They might place more weight on the industry standard of 1-2% failure rates for mature vehicles.

**Adjustment for uncertainty**:
While the evidence strongly suggests zero failures, I should account for unknown unknowns and the inherent uncertainty in complex systems. I'll slightly increase my probability estimates for 1 or more failures to avoid overconfidence.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the extremely short time horizon (just over a month), the flawless record of the current Falcon 9 variant, and the overwhelming evidence of reliability, my distribution is heavily concentrated at zero failures, with small probabilities assigned to 1 or more failures to account for black swan possibilities:

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 0
P90: 1

Answering the question "How many Falcon 9 failures will there be before 2026?" requires forecasting the number of failures in the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2025. The provided context sets the current date as November 26, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The key variable to estimate is the per-launch failure probability (p) for the Falcon 9.

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is the Falcon 9 Block 5 variant, which has been the operational standard for years. A broader class would be "all mature orbital launch vehicles," which historically have a failure rate of 1-2% (e.g., Soyuz, Atlas V).
*   **Prior Selection:** The Falcon 9 Block 5's performance has far exceeded the general industry base rate. A more specific prior can be formed using its own history. Before the resolution period started (i.e., pre-2022), the Block 5 had already flown over 100 times without failure. A conservative Bayesian prior for its per-launch failure rate *p*, using this early data, would be a Beta distribution with a mean around 0.3-0.5% (roughly 1 failure in 200-300 launches). This acknowledges the non-zero risk while respecting its excellent early track record.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is fundamentally different from the base case of a typical rocket program due to two factors:

*   **Unprecedented Data:** The combination of an extremely high launch cadence and booster reusability provides SpaceX with a data feedback loop on hardware performance that is unparalleled in the industry. This accelerates learning and reliability improvements.
*   **Forecast Horizon:** The most critical factor is that we are forecasting with only ~35 days left in the four-year period. The research report states there have been **zero** failures from Jan 1, 2022, to Nov 26, 2025. The question is therefore reduced to: how many failures will occur in the *rest of 2025*?

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence overwhelmingly points towards a very low probability of failure.

*   **Primary Evidence (Very Strong, ↓):** The perfect success record from Jan 1, 2022, to Nov 26, 2025. This period has seen an estimated 430 launches (61 in '22, 96 in '23, 128 in '24, ~145 in '25 so far). Observing zero failures over 430 trials is extremely strong evidence that the true failure rate *p* is very low. It makes priors of 1% or even 0.5% much less likely.
*   **Supporting Evidence (Moderate, ↓):** The continued high launch tempo (~145 launches in ~11 months of 2025) and increasing booster reuse records (20+ flights) demonstrate a mature, stable, and well-understood operational process. This suggests process-related errors are being suppressed, not amplified, by the high cadence.
*   **Countervailing Evidence (Weak, ↑):** The only factor pushing the forecast up is the inherent, irreducible complexity of rocketry. There is always a non-zero risk of a "black swan" event—an unforeseen failure mode—that past performance cannot predict.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
We can update our prior belief about the per-launch failure rate *p* using the massive amount of evidence from the 2022-2025 period.

*   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior(p) ∝ Prior(p) × Likelihood(430 successes | p).
*   **Quantitative Sketch:** Starting with a prior mean for *p* of ~0.33% (from a Beta(1, 301) distribution), and observing 430 more successes, our posterior belief for *p* shifts to a Beta(1, 731) distribution. The mean of this posterior is now approximately 1/732, or **p ≈ 0.14%**.
*   **Forecast:** We now use this updated failure probability to forecast the remaining ~15 launches of 2025. Let X be the number of failures in these 15 launches.
    *   The probability of zero failures is P(X=0) = (1 - 0.0014)^15 ≈ 97.9%.
    *   The probability of one failure is P(X=1) ≈ 15 * 0.0014 * (0.9986)^14 ≈ 2.1%.
    *   The probability of two or more failures is negligible.
*   **Final Distribution:** Since there have been 0 failures so far, the distribution for the total number of failures is the same as for X.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis relies heavily on the statistical continuation of a perfect record. The primary risk is a sudden break from this trend (a "black swan"). The high operational tempo, while a strength, could also mask "normalization of deviance." To account for these unquantifiable risks, I will be slightly more conservative than the strict calculation. I will adjust the probability of one failure upward from ~2% to a round 4%. This widens the tail of my distribution to account for model uncertainty.

My final posterior distribution for the total number of failures is:
*   **P(Total = 0) = 96%**
*   **P(Total = 1) = 4%**
*   **P(Total ≥ 2) < 0.1%**

### 6. Final Percentiles
This probability distribution is highly skewed, with almost all the probability mass on a single outcome. I will now derive the percentiles from this distribution.

*   The cumulative probability of the outcome being 0 or less is 96%.
*   The P10, P20, P40, P60, P80, and P90 are all the values below which 10%, 20%, ..., 90% of the probability lies.
*   Since 96% of the probability is at the value 0, all of these percentiles fall at 0.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 0
P90: 0
