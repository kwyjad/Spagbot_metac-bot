### Reference class & base rates
1.  **DPRK Nuclear Tests (2006-2017):** North Korea conducted 6 tests between October 2006 and September 2017, a period of 131 months. This yields a base rate of one test every ~22 months, or a **4.6% monthly probability** during its active testing phase. The background's calculation (2.7%/month) uses a longer denominator (225 months) that includes the current moratorium, diluting the rate from the period when testing was an active policy tool.
2.  **Provocative Strategic Weapons Tests during Final Year of Major Plans:** North Korea often punctuates its multi-year strategic plans with major demonstrations of power, particularly near the end of a cycle to claim "victory." The current five-year plan for defense development ends in 2025, ahead of the January 2026 Party Congress. In this reference class, the probability of a capstone event (like a nuclear test or novel ICBM launch) is significantly higher than a random month. A ballpark estimate might be a **20-30% chance** of such an event occurring in the final 6 months of the plan.
3.  **Nuclear Tests by New Nuclear Powers (Post-NPT):** States that have developed nuclear weapons outside the NPT framework (e.g., India, Pakistan) conducted a series of tests to establish a credible deterrent and then largely stopped. Pakistan tested 6 devices in 3 days in 1998; India tested 5 over 3 days in 1998. Both have since observed moratoria. This reference class suggests tests come in concentrated bursts for technical validation, followed by long pauses. North Korea's pattern of single tests every few years is anomalous, but the current 8-year pause aligns with the "test-then-stop" model. This suggests a **low base rate (<5% annually)** unless a new strategic driver emerges.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** S. Korean intelligence assesses DPRK is technically prepared for a 7th test pending Kim's order. (↑) — Confirms capability is not a constraint; the decision is purely political/strategic.
*   **2025-05-28** CRS report highlights Kim's 2021 five-year plan to develop tactical nukes and other systems by 2026. (↑) — A test would be a logical step to validate these new, smaller warhead designs before the deadline.
*   **2025-04-24** CSIS analysis notes that deepening Russia-DPRK cooperation may embolden Kim to take more significant actions. (↑) — Russian diplomatic cover at the UN and potential technical aid dramatically lower the political and economic cost of a test.
*   **2025-02-26** Report notes 2025 is the final year of the five-year plan and marks major anniversaries, with the 9th Party Congress in Jan 2026. (↑) — Creates strong domestic political pressure for a major strategic achievement to showcase as a "victory."
*   **2025-01-14** Diplomat analysis suggests DPRK's 2025 focus is on economic development and military exports to Russia. (↓) — A nuclear test could trigger new sanctions, jeopardizing economic goals and straining ties with China.
*   **2025-01-03** Korea Herald reports a 2024 shift to "gray zone" tactics, with the Punggye-ri test site maintained but no immediate signs of a test. (↓) — Suggests a preference for lower-risk, lower-cost provocations over a highly escalatory nuclear test.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Technical Validation (Large ↑):** The five-year plan explicitly calls for developing new types of warheads (tactical, multiple-warhead). Unlike ballistic missiles, new nuclear device designs cannot be validated without a physical test. This is the strongest driver for a test.
2.  **Political Deadlines (Large ↑):** The confluence of the 80th Party/Liberation anniversaries in 2025 and the 9th Party Congress in January 2026 creates immense pressure for the regime to deliver a major accomplishment. A successful 7th nuclear test would be a powerful symbol of national strength.
3.  **Russia-DPRK Strategic Alignment (Large ↑):** Russia's willingness to provide diplomatic cover (e.g., a UNSC veto), economic support, and potential technology transfer fundamentally alters Kim's risk calculus. It mitigates the threat of international sanctions, making a test less costly than at any point since 2017.
4.  **Deterrence Signaling (Moderate ↑):** As South Korea and the US enhance their joint military posture, North Korea may feel compelled to conduct a test to re-establish the credibility of its nuclear deterrent, particularly for new tactical systems intended for battlefield use.
5.  **Economic Priorities (Moderate ↓):** The "Regional Development 20x10 Policy" and the need for stable foreign currency earnings (e.g., from arms sales to Russia) could be undermined by the inevitable international condemnation and new sanctions following a nuclear test.
6.  **Chinese Influence (Small ↓):** While China traditionally opposes North Korean nuclear tests due to regional stability concerns, its leverage appears diminished by the strong Russia-DPRK axis. Beijing is unlikely to support harsh sanctions that could destabilize the Kim regime.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Hiatus:** The current 8+ year pause is by far the longest since testing began in 2006, making a simple extrapolation of the 2006-2017 base rate unreliable. The regime has demonstrated it can achieve other strategic goals (ICBMs, satellites) without nuclear tests.
*   **The "Russia Factor":** Unlike any previous test period, North Korea now has a major global power and UNSC permanent member as an active partner. This fundamentally changes the international response, reducing the punitive consequences of a test.
*   **Shift in Technical Goals:** Previous tests focused on progressively larger strategic warheads. The current goal of miniaturized, tactical nuclear weapons creates a new and compelling technical imperative for testing that did not exist in the same way from 2018-2024.
*   **Fractured Global Order:** The focus of the US and its allies on the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East means a North Korean test may not receive the same level of unified, sustained international condemnation as it did in 2017.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Acknowledging the long moratorium, a reasonable prior for a test in the 5-month window might be ~10%, derived from a low annual base rate (~20%) rather than the outdated 2006-2017 monthly rate. Equivalent n: ~10.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The political imperative to show success before the Jan 2026 Party Congress and the technical need to validate new tactical warheads are powerful, time-bound drivers.
    *   (↑ Large) The strategic alignment with Russia provides a "sanctions shield," dramatically lowering the expected negative consequences of a test.
    *   (↑ Small) Confirmed technical readiness at Punggye-ri means there are no capability barriers.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The competing domestic focus on economic development and the demonstrated preference for lower-risk "gray zone" provocations in 2024 suggest a test is not the only option.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points upward. The combination of a clear motive (technical validation), a hard deadline (political calendar), and a reduced cost (Russian support) is a potent mix. The posterior should move significantly higher, perhaps doubling or tripling the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Sustained, new activity at Tunnel 3 or 4 of the Punggye-ri test site, beyond simple maintenance.
    *   Official state media rhetoric emphasizing the need to "bolster the nuclear war deterrent" or announcing completion of a new warhead type.
    *   A major US-South Korea joint military exercise, which could be used as a pretext.
    *   Evacuation of personnel or unusual vehicle movement near Punggye-ri.
    *   A high-level summit between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continuation

To forecast the probability of North Korea conducting a nuclear test before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for North Korean nuclear tests can be derived from historical data. Between 2006 and 2017, North Korea conducted 6 nuclear tests over 131 months, resulting in a base rate of approximately 4.6% per month during active testing periods. However, considering the 8-year hiatus since 2017, a more conservative annual base rate of around 5% is reasonable, reflecting the "test-then-pause" pattern observed in other nuclear states like India and Pakistan. This translates to a monthly base rate of approximately 0.42%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- North Korea has historically used nuclear tests as a strategic tool to demonstrate military capability and political resolve.
- The current geopolitical climate, with North Korea's alignment with Russia, mirrors past periods where external support emboldened its actions.

**Differences:**
- The current 8-year pause is unprecedented, suggesting a shift in strategy or external pressures.
- The strategic alignment with Russia provides a unique diplomatic shield, reducing the potential costs of a test.
- The technical goals have shifted towards miniaturized, tactical nuclear weapons, creating a new imperative for testing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Technical Readiness (↑):** South Korean intelligence confirms North Korea is technically prepared for a test. This increases the likelihood of a test occurring.
- **Political Deadlines (↑):** The end of the five-year plan and upcoming Party Congress create a strong incentive for a demonstration of power.
- **Russia-DPRK Alignment (↑):** Russia's support reduces the international consequences of a test, making it more likely.
- **Economic Focus (↓):** A nuclear test could jeopardize economic goals and relations with China, decreasing the likelihood.
- **Gray Zone Tactics (↓):** Recent preference for less provocative actions suggests a lower probability of a nuclear test.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 5% annually (0.42% monthly), we adjust based on the evidence:
- **Technical Readiness and Political Deadlines:** Strong drivers, suggesting a likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
- **Russia-DPRK Alignment:** Further increases the likelihood.
- **Economic Focus and Gray Zone Tactics:** Moderately decrease the likelihood.

Given the strong upward evidence, we might consider doubling or tripling the prior probability. If we assume a likelihood ratio of 3, the posterior probability becomes approximately 1.26% per month. Over the remaining 1.5 months until 2026, this results in a cumulative probability of about 1.9%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risk:** The forecast might overestimate the impact of Russian support and underestimate economic constraints.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden diplomatic breakthrough or internal economic crisis could drastically alter the likelihood.
- **Rebuttals:** The strategic need for a test might outweigh economic concerns, especially with Russian backing.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final probability of North Korea conducting a nuclear test before 2026 is:

Final: 40%

# Will North Korea test another nuclear device before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll consider several reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **DPRK's historical testing rate (2006-2017)**: 6 tests over 131 months = 4.6% monthly probability
2. **DPRK's full history including moratorium (2006-present)**: 6 tests over 225 months = 2.7% monthly probability
3. **End-of-strategic-plan demonstrations**: Higher probability (20-30%) in final months of five-year plans
4. **Post-moratorium testing by nuclear powers**: Generally low (<5% annually) unless strategic imperatives change

For this question, we need to assess the probability over a specific 41-day window (Nov 20, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025).

Given the 8-year testing moratorium, the most recent base rate (2.7% monthly) seems most appropriate, but needs adjustment for the specific timeframe. For a 41-day period, this translates to approximately:
2.7% × (41/30) ≈ 3.7%

However, this is the final period of North Korea's current five-year plan, which historically sees increased demonstrations of military capability. I'll adjust the prior upward to **10%** to account for this end-of-plan timing effect.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- North Korea maintains its nuclear program and test site readiness
- The regime continues to use weapons demonstrations as political leverage
- Technical validation remains a key driver for testing

**Key differences:**
- The current 8-year moratorium is unprecedented since testing began
- Russia has emerged as a strategic partner providing diplomatic cover
- North Korea's five-year plan explicitly calls for tactical nuclear weapons development
- The international environment is distracted by other conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East)
- The January 2026 Party Congress creates a political deadline for achievements

These differences significantly alter the strategic calculus compared to the base case period.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring a test:**

1. **Technical validation needs** (Strong ↑)
   - P(E|H): ~90% - If NK plans to test, it's very likely driven by need to validate tactical warhead designs
   - P(E|~H): ~30% - Without testing, NK would need alternative validation methods or accept uncertainty
   - LR: ~3.0 - Strong evidence for testing

2. **Russian strategic partnership** (Strong ↑)
   - P(E|H): ~80% - Russian diplomatic cover significantly reduces costs of testing
   - P(E|~H): ~40% - Partnership benefits NK regardless of testing decisions
   - LR: ~2.0 - Substantial evidence for testing

3. **Political calendar pressure** (Moderate ↑)
   - P(E|H): ~70% - The January 2026 Party Congress creates deadline pressure
   - P(E|~H): ~40% - Other achievements could substitute for nuclear demonstration
   - LR: ~1.75 - Moderate evidence for testing

4. **Confirmed technical readiness** (Weak ↑)
   - P(E|H): ~95% - Testing requires site readiness
   - P(E|~H): ~80% - NK maintains readiness regardless of immediate plans
   - LR: ~1.2 - Weak evidence for testing

**Evidence against a test:**

1. **Economic priorities** (Moderate ↓)
   - P(E|H): ~50% - Testing despite economic focus suggests security trumps economy
   - P(E|~H): ~80% - Economic priorities favor avoiding sanctions-triggering actions
   - LR: ~0.63 - Moderate evidence against testing

2. **Preference for "gray zone" tactics** (Weak ↓)
   - P(E|H): ~60% - Testing would represent escalation from recent pattern
   - P(E|~H): ~75% - Continued preference for lower-risk provocations
   - LR: ~0.8 - Weak evidence against testing

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability of 10% (odds of 1:9)

First update (Technical validation needs):
- Prior odds: 1:9 (0.1)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3:9 = 1:3
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+3) = 25%

Second update (Russian partnership):
- Prior odds: 1:3 (0.25)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 2:3 = 0.67
- Posterior probability: 0.67/(1+0.67) ≈ 40%

Third update (Economic priorities):
- Prior odds: 0.67 (0.4)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 0.63 ≈ 0.42
- Posterior probability: 0.42/(1+0.42) ≈ 30%

Fourth update (Political calendar pressure):
- Prior odds: 0.42 (0.3)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.42 × 1.75 ≈ 0.74
- Posterior probability: 0.74/(1+0.74) ≈ 42%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 42%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the Russia factor; China still has significant influence and opposes testing
- The 8-year moratorium suggests a strategic shift away from testing that I might be underappreciating
- The short timeframe (41 days) makes a test less likely than over a longer period
- North Korea might prefer to conduct a test after the Party Congress to set the tone for the new plan

**Alternative scenarios:**
- North Korea might choose to demonstrate capability through other means (e.g., ICBM tests, satellite launches)
- Technical or logistical issues could delay testing beyond 2025
- International developments (e.g., diplomatic overtures) might create incentives to postpone

**Adjustments:**
Given the short timeframe and considering that North Korea might prefer to wait until after the Party Congress in January 2026, I should adjust my probability downward slightly. The 42% seems too high for a 41-day window.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the short timeframe (41 days), the unprecedented length of the current moratorium, but also the strong technical and political drivers for a test before the January 2026 Party Congress, I adjust my final probability to 35%.

Final: 35%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is not the long-term average of North Korean nuclear tests but rather the likelihood of a major strategic weapons test during a politically significant period. The current context is the final months of the 2021-2025 five-year defense plan, culminating just before the 9th Party Congress in January 2026. Such periods often feature "capstone" events to declare success.

A reasonable starting point is to estimate the probability of a nuclear test during the entire year of 2025. Given the long hiatus since 2017, the base rate is low, but the specific drivers in 2025 (the political calendar, the need to validate new tactical warheads, and the new strategic relationship with Russia) elevate it significantly. I will set a prior probability of **30% for a nuclear test occurring at any point in 2025**. This reflects a belief that the confluence of factors makes this year uniquely likely for a test compared to the 2018-2024 period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The question concerns the period from August 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025. As of today, November 20, 2025, a test has not yet occurred. The probability is not uniformly distributed throughout the year; it is heavily concentrated in the second half, particularly in the final quarter, to maximize political impact before the January 2026 Congress.

Therefore, we must update our prior based on the fact that ~10.7 months of the year have passed without a test. This is a conditional probability problem. Let's assume, for simplicity, that the entire 30% probability for 2025 was concentrated in the final six months (July-December).

*   P(Test in 2025) = P(Test in Jul-Dec) = 0.30
*   P(No Test in Jul-Dec) = 0.70

We are now on November 20, meaning ~4.7 months of this 6-month window have passed. We need to find the probability of a test in the remaining ~1.3 months, given that one has not yet occurred.

Assuming a constant monthly hazard rate `p` during this 6-month period:
(1 - p)^6 = 0.70
1 - p = (0.70)^(1/6) ≈ 0.942
p ≈ 0.058, or a 5.8% chance per month.

The probability of a test in the remaining 1.3 months is:
P(Test in next 1.3 months) = 1 - (1 - p)^1.3 = 1 - (0.942)^1.3 ≈ 1 - 0.925 = 0.075 or **7.5%**.

This 7.5% figure represents our updated prior, but it assumes a uniform risk distribution within the 6-month window. This is likely incorrect. The pressure for a "victory" announcement grows as the January 2026 deadline approaches, meaning the daily probability should be increasing. Therefore, the true probability for the final ~40 days should be significantly higher than the average for the whole period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

We will now adjust this 7.5% prior based on the specific evidence provided, treating the concentration of risk towards the end of the year as a key piece of evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Political and Technical Deadlines (↑ Large)**
    *   The 5-year plan requires validation of new tactical warheads, a powerful technical driver for a test. The Jan 2026 Party Congress is a hard political deadline for demonstrating success. The probability of a test is much higher in the weeks immediately preceding this deadline than in the months before.
    *   P(E | H): Very high. If a test happens in this 5-month window, it is extremely likely to be timed for maximum political effect near the end.
    *   P(E | ~H): Low. If no test is planned, there is no reason for the risk to be concentrated at the end of the year.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: This evidence strongly suggests that our 7.5% prior (based on a uniform distribution) is too low. A qualitative adjustment is needed. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of **2.5x** to account for this end-of-year clustering effect.

*   **Evidence 2: Russia-DPRK Strategic Alignment (↑ Large)**
    *   Russia's diplomatic cover at the UN Security Council, economic support, and potential technical aid dramatically lower the political and economic costs of a nuclear test for North Korea. This is the single biggest change in the strategic environment since 2017.
    *   This factor was already incorporated into our initial high prior (30% for the year), so we should avoid double-counting. However, its continued strength reinforces the initial assessment.

*   **Evidence 3: Competing Economic Priorities & Preference for "Gray Zone" Tactics (↓ Moderate)**
    *   The regime has also emphasized economic development and has recently preferred lower-risk provocations (e.g., missile tests, satellite launches). A nuclear test could invite new unilateral sanctions and jeopardize economic goals.
    *   This suggests that even with favorable conditions, the regime might choose a less costly alternative to signal strength, such as a novel ICBM test. This evidence pushes the probability down. Let's assign a likelihood ratio of **0.8x**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the conditional prior:** 7.5% (or odds of 0.075 / 0.925 ≈ 0.081).
2.  **Apply update for end-loaded risk (LR = 2.5):**
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.081 × 2.5 = 0.2025
    *   Intermediate Probability = 0.2025 / (1 + 0.2025) ≈ 16.8%
3.  **Apply update for competing priorities (LR = 0.8):**
    *   Final Odds = 0.2025 × 0.8 = 0.162
    *   Final Probability = 0.162 / (1 + 0.162) ≈ 0.139 or **14%**.

This step-by-step update seems to result in a probability that feels a bit low given the gravity of the drivers. The interaction of the drivers is potent. Let's reconsider the initial adjustment for the non-uniform risk. A simple doubling or tripling of the baseline conditional probability might be more intuitive. Starting from 7.5%, a simple doubling to account for the deadline effect brings us to 15%. This seems like a more direct and reasonable estimate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of ~15% could be wrong for several reasons.
*   **Too high:** I may be over-weighting the "deadline-ism." North Korea can declare victory without a test, perhaps by showcasing a mock-up of the new warhead. The 8-year hiatus may represent a stable new reality where Kim has decided the risks of testing outweigh the benefits, and the Russia relationship is primarily about conventional arms and economic aid, not a green light for nuclear escalation.
*   **Too low:** I may be under-appreciating the paradigm shift caused by Russia's support. The cost of a test has plummeted, and the technical need to validate a new class of tactical weapons may be non-negotiable for the regime's military planners. A confluence of a technical imperative, a political deadline, and a permissive international environment is rare and points toward action. A forecast of 25-30% would be plausible under this view.

Balancing these considerations, the 15% estimate feels like a reasonable middle ground. It acknowledges the significantly elevated risk in this specific time window while stopping short of making a test seem inevitable.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for a test in 2025 is significantly elevated due to a "perfect storm" of a political deadline (Jan 2026 Party Congress), a technical need (validating new tactical warheads), and a permissive geopolitical environment (Russian support). Starting with a 30% probability for the full year and conditioning on the fact that no test has occurred by late November yields a baseline probability of around 7.5% for the remaining ~40 days. However, this assumes a uniform risk, whereas the political drivers strongly suggest the risk is concentrated at the end of the year. Adjusting for this clustering effect, the probability increases substantially. After a final adjustment for countervailing economic pressures, I arrive at a final probability of 15%.

Final: 15%
