### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Pakistani Judicial Crises (2007):** The most relevant reference class is the 2007 constitutional crisis under General Pervez Musharraf. When he declared a state of emergency and issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO), judges were required to take a new oath. Approximately 60 judges of the superior courts, including the Chief Justice, refused and were dismissed. This was not a "resignation" in the technical sense but a functional equivalent—a mass refusal to serve under a new, contested legal framework. This suggests a **base rate of dozens (e.g., 40-60) of departures** in a full-blown confrontation between the judiciary and the executive/military.
2.  **Politically-Motivated Individual Resignations:** In non-crisis periods, judicial resignations in Pakistan are extremely rare. Judges typically serve until retirement. When resignations do occur, they are often individual acts of protest against specific government actions or internal judicial politics. The base rate for this class is **near zero (0-1) per year**.
3.  **Total Pool of Judges:** The total number of judges in Pakistan's superior courts (Supreme Court and the five High Courts) is approximately 160-170. The Supreme Court has 17 authorized positions. The High Courts have a combined strength of around 150 (Lahore: ~60, Sindh: ~40, Peshawar: ~20, Balochistan: ~15, Islamabad: ~10). The three resignations to date represent about 2% of the total pool.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed. — ↑ — The precipitating event, a fundamental challenge to judicial independence, creating the conditions for protest resignations.
*   **2025-11-14** Two Supreme Court justices (Shah and Minallah) resign. — ↑ — A strong initial signal from senior judges that the amendment is unacceptable, potentially triggering a cascade.
*   **2025-11-15** One Lahore High Court justice (Mirza) resigns. — ↑ — The protest spreads from the Supreme Court to the High Courts, suggesting broader discontent.
*   **2025-11-18** Reports highlight executive power to transfer judges without consent. — ↑ — This provision acts as both a reason to resign in protest and a potential coercive tool to force unwanted judges out via "constructive" resignation.
*   **2025-12-01** Reports indicate the new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) is operational and the judiciary appears "divided." — ↓ — A crucial counter-signal. If a significant portion of the judiciary is engaging with the new system, a mass resignation movement is unlikely to materialize.
*   **2025-11-16 to 2025-12-06** No further resignations reported in the ~3 weeks since the initial wave. — ↓ — The most significant recent development is a non-event. The momentum for resignations appears to have stalled, suggesting the initial wave may have been the peak.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand/Judicial Solidarity:** Judges with a strong commitment to judicial independence and the existing constitutional order may resign as a matter of principle. A cascade could be triggered if a critical mass of senior, respected judges resigns, creating peer pressure for others to follow. (Size: Large, if a cascade occurs; otherwise, small).
2.  **Government Coercion and Inducements:** The government can use the new powers (e.g., forced transfers) to make continued service untenable for specific judges, effectively forcing them out. Conversely, it can offer plum positions on the new FCC or other assurances to persuade key judges to stay, thereby breaking judicial unity. (Size: Moderate).
3.  **Political Affiliation and Opposition:** Judges with known sympathies for the opposition (like Justice Mirza, whose brother-in-law is a PTI leader) are more likely to resign. The scale of opposition protests could embolden more judges to act. (Size: Moderate).
4.  **Lack of Unified Resistance:** If the judiciary is divided, with some willing to work within the new framework (e.g., by accepting appointments to the FCC), the impetus for protest resignations will weaken significantly. Those who might have resigned will feel their sacrifice would be futile. (Size: Large).
5.  **Personal Calculation (Career/Pension):** Judges must weigh the personal cost of resignation (loss of salary, pension, status) against the principle. Judges closer to retirement may be more willing to resign, while younger judges with more to lose may opt to stay and resist from within or simply acquiesce. (Size: Moderate).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Constitutional Amendment vs. Extra-Constitutional Order:** Unlike Musharraf's 2007 PCO, this change is a formal constitutional amendment. This gives it a veneer of legality that makes organized resistance more complex. Judges cannot simply refuse to take an "illegal" oath; they must defy a part of the constitution itself.
*   **No Clear Focal Point:** The 2007 Lawyers' Movement rallied around the popular and defiant Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. There is currently no equivalent unifying figurehead for the judicial resistance, making a large-scale, coordinated movement less likely.
*   **Co-optation Strategy:** The creation of the new Federal Constitutional Court is a key difference. It's not just a power grab; it's a restructuring that creates new, powerful positions. This allows the executive to co-opt senior judges, dividing the judiciary by offering them seats on the new court, a tool Musharraf did not have in the same way.
*   **Stalled Momentum:** In 2007, the defiance was immediate and widespread. Here, an initial burst of three resignations was followed by weeks of inaction. This suggests that the judges inclined to take a hardline stance have already done so, and the remainder are adopting a "wait-and-see" approach or have accepted the new reality.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Given the amendment's severity, a prior informed by the 2007 crisis but tempered by the legal form (amendment vs. PCO) might be a distribution centered around 5-10 resignations, with a long tail allowing for a much larger number. (Equivalent n: low, e.g., 4, reflecting high uncertainty).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Moderate) The resignations of two SC justices and one HC justice confirm the crisis is severe enough to trigger high-level protest.
    *   (↓ Large) The ~3-week lull since the last resignation is strong evidence that a mass cascade is not occurring and that the initial wave has passed.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Reports of a "divided" judiciary and the operational status of the new FCC suggest a lack of unified will to resist via mass resignation.
    *   (↑/↓ Small) The power to forcibly transfer judges could lead to a few more "constructive" resignations but also serves as a threat that may keep others in line.
*   **Net effect:** The initial evidence (the amendment and first resignations) supported the high-end of the prior. However, the subsequent evidence (the long lull, the divided judiciary) strongly pulls the estimate down. The posterior should be heavily updated downwards, centered on a number very close to the 3 already observed, with only a small probability of a few more.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Resignation of a very senior judge, like a Chief Justice of a High Court or another SC judge.
    *   A unified statement from a major Bar Council (e.g., Supreme Court Bar Association) calling for resignations.
    *   The government uses the new transfer power on a well-respected judge, who then resigns in protest.
    *   Mass protests escalate dramatically, creating a public pressure cooker environment for the judiciary.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The end of December arrives with no further resignations.
    *   Senior judges publicly accept appointments to the new Federal Constitutional Court.
    *   Bar associations focus their efforts on legal challenges rather than calls for resignation.
    *   Government successfully transfers a High Court judge without them resigning.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution specifies "resign." This may not capture judges who are sidelined, forcibly transferred to an undesirable post and go on leave, or are otherwise removed from their duties without formally resigning.
*   **Information Lag/Control:** The political environment is tense. Information about further resignations, especially from smaller High Courts, might be delayed or suppressed.
*   **Short Horizon:** The resolution period ends in less than a month (Dec 31, 2025). This short timeframe makes a slow-building cascade of resignations less likely; any major increase would have to happen very soon.
*   **Constructive Resignation:** A judge transferred from Lahore to Quetta against their will might resign, but this is a different causal pathway than a pure protest resignation. The count would be the same, but the mechanism is different.

**Final Research Summary:** The constitutional crisis is severe, but the initial wave of three protest resignations appears to have dissipated. The lack of further resignations for three weeks, combined with signs of a divided judiciary, strongly suggests a large-scale repeat of the 2007 crisis is not materializing, and the final number will likely be very close to the three already recorded.

To forecast the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class:** The most relevant historical reference is the 2007 constitutional crisis under General Pervez Musharraf, where approximately 60 judges were dismissed for refusing to take a new oath. However, this was not a resignation in the technical sense. In non-crisis periods, judicial resignations are rare, typically near zero per year.
- **Base Rate Selection:** Given the current constitutional crisis, a base rate informed by the 2007 crisis but tempered by the legal form (amendment vs. PCO) is appropriate. We start with a prior centered around 5-10 resignations, acknowledging the severity of the amendment but also the legal and structural differences.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Mean/median around 5-10 resignations, with a long tail allowing for more, reflecting high uncertainty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The amendment represents a severe challenge to judicial independence, similar to the 2007 crisis.
- **Differences:** The amendment is a formal constitutional change, not an extra-constitutional order, complicating organized resistance. The judiciary lacks a unifying figurehead, and the new Federal Constitutional Court offers co-optation opportunities.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Initial Resignations:** The resignation of two Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice indicates significant discontent, suggesting a potential for more resignations.
- **Lack of Further Resignations:** The absence of additional resignations over three weeks is strong evidence against a mass resignation movement.
- **Divided Judiciary:** Reports of a divided judiciary and the operational status of the new FCC suggest a lack of unified resistance.
- **Government Coercion:** The power to transfer judges could lead to a few more resignations but also serves as a deterrent.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Initial Update:** The initial resignations supported the high end of the prior distribution.
- **Subsequent Evidence:** The lack of further resignations and the divided judiciary strongly pull the estimate down.
- **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The posterior should be centered around the 3 resignations already observed, with a small probability of a few more.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of delayed resignations or suppressed information. The short timeframe reduces the likelihood of a slow-building cascade.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden escalation in protests or a high-profile resignation could trigger more resignations.
- **Adjustments:** Given the evidence, the forecast remains centered around the current number, with slight adjustments for potential tail risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Calibrated Percentiles:** Based on the analysis, the forecast is adjusted to reflect the current evidence and potential risks.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 4  
P80: 5  
P90: 6

# Forecasting the Number of Pakistani Judges Resigning in Late 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two key reference classes:

1. **The 2007 Pakistani Judicial Crisis**: When General Musharraf declared emergency rule, approximately 60 judges from superior courts refused to take new oaths and were effectively removed. This represents an upper bound for judicial resistance.

2. **Normal-time Judicial Resignations**: In non-crisis periods, resignations from Pakistan's superior courts are extremely rare, typically 0-1 per year.

Given the current situation falls between these extremes, my prior distribution centers around 5-10 resignations, with a wide variance to account for uncertainty. This reflects that while the constitutional amendment is serious enough to trigger some resignations, it differs from the 2007 crisis in important ways.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases:**
- Like 2007, this is a fundamental challenge to judicial independence
- The amendment grants powers to transfer judges without consent, similar to previous executive overreach
- There is opposition mobilization and civil society outrage

**Key differences:**
- Unlike 2007's extra-constitutional emergency, this is a formal constitutional amendment with a veneer of legality
- There is no unifying figurehead like Chief Justice Chaudhry to rally around
- The government has created a co-optation strategy via the new Federal Constitutional Court
- Most critically, after an initial burst of 3 resignations, there has been a ~3-week lull with no further action

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers:**
- Three high-profile judges (two Supreme Court, one High Court) have already resigned (strong evidence, ×3 likelihood for numbers >3)
- The amendment fundamentally alters judicial independence (moderate evidence, ×2 likelihood for numbers >5)
- The power to forcibly transfer judges may trigger "constructive resignations" (weak evidence, ×1.2 likelihood for numbers >3)

**Evidence supporting lower numbers:**
- No further resignations in ~3 weeks since the initial wave (very strong evidence, ×0.3 likelihood for numbers >5)
- Reports indicate a "divided judiciary" with some accepting the new system (strong evidence, ×0.5 likelihood for numbers >5)
- The new Federal Constitutional Court is operational, suggesting institutional adaptation (moderate evidence, ×0.7 likelihood for numbers >5)
- Personal career/pension considerations create strong incentives against resignation (moderate evidence, ×0.8 likelihood for numbers >5)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 5-10 resignations, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - Initial resignations:**
- The fact that 3 judges have already resigned confirms this is a serious crisis
- This slightly increases my estimate, shifting the distribution rightward
- Updated median: ~7-8 resignations

**Second update - Three-week lull:**
- The absence of further resignations for ~3 weeks is very strong evidence against a cascade effect
- This dramatically reduces my estimate for higher numbers
- Updated median: ~4-5 resignations

**Third update - Divided judiciary:**
- Reports of a divided judiciary and functioning FCC further reduce the likelihood of mass resignations
- This suggests the initial wave may have been the peak
- Final median: ~4 resignations

The posterior distribution is now heavily weighted toward the lower end, with a median around 4 and a narrower spread than my prior.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the 3-week lull; historical judicial crises sometimes develop slowly
- Information control might mean more resignations have occurred but aren't being reported
- The short resolution timeframe (until end of December 2025) limits the potential for a slow-building cascade

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A "tipping point" scenario where one more high-profile resignation triggers a cascade
- A "forced transfer" scenario where the government uses its new powers aggressively, triggering multiple constructive resignations
- A "status quo" scenario where the initial three resignations represent the complete protest movement

On reflection, I believe I've adequately accounted for these possibilities, but I'll slightly widen my distribution to acknowledge the uncertainty.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After careful consideration of the evidence and potential scenarios, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 4
P60: 5
P80: 7
P90: 10

Answering the question: How many judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts will resign during late 2025?

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of judicial resignations during a two-month period (Nov-Dec 2025) amid a major constitutional crisis in Pakistan.

*   **Primary Reference Class:** The 2007 Pakistani judicial crisis under General Musharraf. In that event, approximately 60 judges of the superior courts were dismissed for refusing to take a new, unconstitutional oath. While technically dismissals, they represent a functional equivalent to mass protest resignations. This sets a plausible, high-end anchor for a full-blown confrontation, suggesting a potential for dozens of departures.
*   **Secondary Reference Class:** Politically motivated resignations in non-crisis periods. In normal times, such resignations are extremely rare, with a base rate near zero per year. This highlights how extraordinary the current situation is.
*   **Constraint:** The total pool of superior court judges is around 160-170, which forms the absolute upper bound.

Given the severity of the constitutional changes, my prior distribution is centered much higher than the non-crisis base rate but lower than the 2007 peak, as the nature of the crisis is different. A prior centered around 10-15 resignations, with a wide, right-skewed tail allowing for a 2007-like scenario, seems appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has similarities and crucial differences compared to the 2007 crisis.

*   **Similarities:** A fundamental challenge to judicial independence by the executive/military, sparking outrage from civil society and the legal community.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Legality:** The current changes are enacted via a formal constitutional amendment, not an extra-constitutional order like Musharraf's PCO. This gives the government's actions a veneer of legitimacy that complicates organized resistance.
    2.  **Co-optation vs. Confrontation:** The creation of the new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) is a key strategic difference. It allows the government to co-opt senior judges with new, powerful positions, thereby dividing the judiciary. In 2007, the choice was clearer and more confrontational (take the oath or be dismissed).
    3.  **Leadership:** The 2007 movement had a clear figurehead in the deposed Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. No such unifying figure has emerged in the current crisis.

These differences suggest that a repeat of the 2007 mass departure is less likely. The government's strategy appears more sophisticated, aiming to divide and absorb rather than purely confront.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence chronologically to update my prior.

*   **Evidence 1: 27th Amendment passed & 3 initial resignations (Nov 13-15).**
    *   This is strong evidence *for* a significant number of resignations. The fact that two Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice resigned immediately confirms the crisis is severe enough to trigger principled stands at the highest level.
    *   **Update:** This evidence shifts the prior distribution to the right. The likelihood of a high number of resignations (e.g., >20) increases substantially.

*   **Evidence 2: No further resignations reported (Nov 16 - Dec 6).**
    *   This is the most critical piece of evidence. A three-week lull following the initial burst of activity is highly inconsistent with a building cascade of mass resignations. Collective action movements like this rely on momentum; this long pause strongly suggests momentum has been lost.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The probability of observing a 3-week lull if the final total were, say, 30 is extremely low. The probability of observing this lull if the final total is close to the current number of 3 is very high. This provides a powerful update downwards.
    *   **Update:** This evidence dramatically reduces the probability of a high final count and pulls the posterior distribution's mass heavily towards the current number of 3.

*   **Evidence 3: Reports of a "divided" judiciary and operational FCC (Dec 1).**
    *   This evidence corroborates the signal from the lull. It provides a mechanism for the stalled momentum: a lack of judicial unity, with a faction willing to work within the new system.
    *   **Update:** This further strengthens the downward revision of the forecast, making a large-scale, unified protest action seem very unlikely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Centered around 10-15, with a long tail towards 60.
*   **Likelihood from initial resignations:** Shifts the distribution rightward, making the tail more plausible. The median might move up to ~20.
*   **Likelihood from the 3-week lull & divided judiciary:** This is a massive update. The likelihood ratio strongly favors the hypothesis of "few resignations" over "mass resignations."
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution is now collapsed around the current number of 3. The mode is 3. The median is also likely 3 or perhaps 4. The distribution is now highly right-skewed, but from a very low base. The probability of the total exceeding 10 is now very small. The 2007 scenario is now a remote tail risk.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could there be a delayed, coordinated mass resignation planned for later in December? This is unlikely. Such coordination is difficult to keep secret, and the loss of momentum makes it harder to execute.
*   **Tail Risk:** The primary remaining risk for a higher number is a new trigger event. For example, if the government uses its new power to forcibly transfer a widely respected judge, that individual might resign, potentially prompting a few colleagues to join them in solidarity. This could lead to a small, second cluster of resignations.
*   **Adjustment:** My forecast is heavily concentrated at 3. To account for the "new trigger" tail risk, I will slightly fatten the right tail of my distribution. While the most likely outcome is 3, there is a non-trivial chance of a few more resignations before the year ends. Therefore, my P80 and P90 should be higher than 3, reflecting this possibility.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is heavily skewed. The most likely outcome (mode) is that the number of resignations remains at 3. However, there is a reasonable chance of a few more individual resignations before December 31. The probability of a large-scale cascade is now very low.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 4
P80: 5
P90: 7
