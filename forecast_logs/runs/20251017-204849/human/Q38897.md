### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical base rate for countries, particularly Argentina, successfully taming hyperinflation to below 30% within two years of a major stabilization plan?
    *   What are the primary mechanisms of the Milei administration's disinflationary policy, and how effective have they been to date according to the provided sources?
    *   What are the main risks and countervailing pressures that could cause inflation to stall or re-accelerate before December 2025?
    *   How do forecasts from different credible institutions (IMF, OECD, private banks) compare, and what explains their divergence?
    *   What makes this specific stabilization attempt different from previous ones in Argentina or elsewhere?

2.  **Information Extraction Strategy (from provided sources):**
    *   **Historical Precedent:** Synthesize knowledge of past stabilization plans (e.g., Argentina's Convertibility Plan, Brazil's Real Plan) to construct a reference class. The sources don't provide this directly, so it will rely on general economic history.
    *   **Policy Effectiveness:** Extract all data points on monthly and YoY inflation, fiscal balance (surplus/deficit), GDP growth, poverty rates, and key policy actions (devaluation, spending cuts, removal of controls).
    *   **Risks:** Scan sources for keywords like "recession," "poverty," "unemployment," "social," "political," and "sustainability" to identify headwinds.
    *   **Forecasts:** Create a table of all explicit 2025 inflation and GDP forecasts from the sources (IMF, BBVA, OECD, Santander, Argentine government) to map the landscape of expert opinion.
    *   **Uniqueness:** Identify descriptions of the policy as "shock therapy," "ambitious," or "unprecedented" and note the specific elements that differ from historical norms (e.g., speed of fiscal adjustment).

3.  **Synthesize Key Findings:**
    *   The core of the government's strategy is a rapid and severe fiscal consolidation, which has successfully generated a primary surplus and anchored expectations, causing a dramatic fall in monthly inflation.
    *   This success has come at the cost of a deep recession and a significant increase in poverty, creating a major risk of political and social backlash that could undermine the program's sustainability.
    *   There is a significant divergence in expert forecasts. Private sector analysts (Santander, BBVA) and the OECD are more optimistic, projecting inflation near or below the 30% threshold. The IMF is notably more pessimistic, with a recent upward revision to its 2025 forecast.
    *   The key tension is whether the powerful disinflationary momentum from the fiscal anchor can be maintained against the headwinds of social pressure and potential political instability in the final months of 2025.

4.  **Draft the Research Brief:** Structure the synthesized findings into the required format, ensuring each section directly addresses the needs of a statistician updating a prior.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Argentine Stabilization Plans (1980s-2000s):** Argentina has a long history of attempting to quell high inflation with stabilization plans (Austral, Convertibility, etc.). Most have ultimately failed due to an inability to maintain fiscal discipline, leading to a collapse of the monetary anchor. The base rate of success for an Argentine plan achieving sustained low inflation is very low, perhaps **10-15%**. This class highlights the immense political and structural challenges endemic to Argentina.
*   **Global "Shock Therapy" / Heterodox Stabilizations:** This class includes countries that implemented drastic, front-loaded reforms to end hyperinflation (e.g., Bolivia 1985, Israel 1985, Brazil 1994). These plans have a higher success rate when they credibly establish a long-term fiscal anchor. The base rate for reducing YoY inflation below 30% within two years is arguably higher, perhaps **30-40%**. This class emphasizes the potential effectiveness of the chosen policy mix if implemented with sufficient political will.
*   **Limitations:** Both reference classes are imperfect. The current plan's libertarian ideological underpinnings and the specific global context (e.g., commodity prices) differ from historical precedents. The extreme speed and depth of the fiscal adjustment may also place it in a class of its own.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-14** IMF downgrades 2025 growth to 4.5% and *raises* 2025 inflation forecast to 41.3%. ↓ — A key external monitor sees higher-than-desired inflation persisting, casting doubt on the final "last mile" of disinflation before year-end.
*   **2025-07-07** OECD reports Argentina achieved a 1.8% of GDP primary surplus in 2024 and projects 5.2% GDP growth in 2025. ↑ — Confirms the fiscal anchor, the core of the disinflationary plan, is holding strong and a robust recovery is underway, which could ease social pressures.
*   **2025-05-13** Euromonitor notes pension increases in 2024 were below inflation, a key component of achieving fiscal balance. ↑ — Demonstrates the government's continued commitment to politically difficult spending cuts, reinforcing the credibility of the fiscal anchor.
*   **2025-04-XX** OECD source mentions the removal of most currency and capital controls in April 2025. ↑ — A major step toward economic normalization, signaling confidence from policymakers and likely boosting investment and growth, which supports the plan's sustainability.
*   **2025-03-13** Prime Economics reports poverty rate hit 52.9% in the first half of 2024 due to austerity. ↓ — Highlights the severe social cost of the adjustment, which is the primary source of risk for political instability and potential policy reversal.
*   **2025-01-13** Santander projects 2025 annual inflation will be below 30% and notes a tax amnesty brought in $22B. ↑ — A very optimistic private sector forecast, combined with evidence of capital returning to the system, which strengthens the government's financial position.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Fiscal Anchor (Large ↑):** The primary driver. By aggressively cutting spending and achieving a fiscal surplus, the government has eliminated the need for monetary financing of the deficit ("printing money"), which was the root cause of past hyperinflation. This is the core of the plan's credibility.
*   **Recessionary Demand Destruction (Large ↑):** The "shock therapy" induced a severe recession in 2024. This collapse in economic activity and consumer spending has put powerful downward pressure on prices, contributing significantly to the rapid initial disinflation.
*   **Expectations Channel (Moderate ↑):** The decisiveness of the fiscal adjustment and Milei's strong political mandate (initially) helped to break the inflationary inertia. Economic agents began to believe the new "regime" was credible, altering their price-setting behavior.
*   **Political & Social Sustainability (Large ↓):** The main counter-mechanism. Soaring poverty and collapsing real wages create immense pressure for policy relaxation (e.g., increased social spending, wage hikes). A major protest movement or loss of political support could force a reversal, reigniting inflation.
*   **Relative Price Adjustments (Moderate ↓):** The initial phase of the plan involved unfreezing many controlled prices (utilities, transport). Lingering adjustments and potential future devaluations of the peso could create pockets of inflationary pressure that make the final descent to <30% "sticky."

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Fiscal Adjustment Speed:** Unlike most past plans (in Argentina and elsewhere) that phased in austerity, Milei's "motosierra" (chainsaw) approach front-loaded the entire fiscal correction. This achieved a primary surplus in the first quarter, a speed rarely seen.
*   **Lack of Price/Wage Controls:** Many historical stabilization plans (like the Austral Plan) relied on temporary price and wage freezes. Milei's plan, rooted in libertarian economics, has largely eschewed these, relying almost entirely on the fiscal and monetary anchor.
*   **Strong Initial Electoral Mandate for Austerity:** Milei was elected on an explicit platform of drastic cuts. This gave him a unique, albeit potentially temporary, political runway to implement policies that would have been politically impossible for traditional governments.
*   **Starting Point of Hyperinflation:** The plan was launched amidst true hyperinflation (25% monthly rate). This created a "crisis mandate" where the population was more willing to accept painful medicine than they might be during periods of chronic-but-lower inflation.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a reference class blend, a prior of ~25% seems reasonable, reflecting the high historical failure rate of such plans, especially in Argentina (equivalent n=4; 1 success, 3 failures).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The achievement and maintenance of a primary fiscal surplus is the single most important piece of evidence. It directly addresses the root cause of Argentine inflation and is a major departure from the reference class of failed plans.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The rapid fall in monthly inflation to low single digits and the successful removal of capital controls demonstrate the policy is working as intended and the economy is beginning to normalize.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The severe social costs (50%+ poverty) represent a powerful and persistent risk of political reversal, which is the primary failure mode for such plans.
    *   **↓ (Small/Moderate):** The IMF's pessimistic forecast (41.3%) from a credible, data-driven institution provides a strong counter-signal to the more optimistic private sector views and suggests the "last mile" of disinflation is difficult.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for the plan's core mechanism succeeding (the fiscal anchor) is exceptionally strong and concrete. The negative evidence relates primarily to second-order risks (sustainability) and divergent forecasts. The posterior should move significantly upward from the low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (YES more likely):**
    *   October and November 2025 monthly inflation prints below 2.0%.
    *   Government continues to post primary fiscal surpluses in Q3/Q4 2025 data releases.
    *   Central Bank continues to accumulate foreign reserves, indicating capital inflows.
    *   Major social protests or general strikes fail to materialize or gain widespread traction.
    *   The gap between the official and parallel ("blue") exchange rates remains narrow.
*   **DOWN indicators (NO more likely):**
    *   Monthly inflation proves "sticky" and remains in the 2.5-3.5% range.
    *   Government announces "emergency" social spending packages or relaxes fiscal targets.
    *   Large-scale, sustained protests emerge, forcing policy concessions.
    *   A sudden widening of the parallel exchange rate gap, signaling renewed capital flight.
    *   Key political allies withdraw support for the government's economic program.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Integrity:** The resolution depends on official INDEC statistics. While generally considered professional, political pressure on statistical agencies has been an issue in Argentina's past.
*   **Political Instability:** The entire forecast hinges on the political survival of the economic plan. An unexpected political crisis could unravel the disinflationary process very quickly. This is a "black swan" risk.

To forecast the probability that Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for Argentina successfully reducing hyperinflation to below 30% within two years of a stabilization plan is low, around 10-15%, due to past failures in maintaining fiscal discipline. However, global "shock therapy" plans have a higher success rate, around 30-40%. Given the unique aspects of Milei's plan, a blended prior of 25% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The plan involves aggressive fiscal consolidation, similar to successful "shock therapy" plans.
   - Differences: The speed and depth of fiscal adjustment, lack of price controls, and Milei's strong initial mandate are unique. These differences suggest a potentially higher success rate than past Argentine plans.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Fiscal Surplus (Large ↑):** Achieving a primary surplus is a strong indicator of success, significantly increasing the probability.
   - **Monthly Inflation Drop (Moderate ↑):** The rapid fall in monthly inflation supports the plan's effectiveness.
   - **Social Costs (Large ↓):** High poverty rates pose a risk of political reversal, decreasing the probability.
   - **IMF Forecast (Moderate ↓):** The IMF's pessimistic forecast suggests challenges in achieving the target, decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 25% probability = 1:3 odds.
   - Likelihood ratio for fiscal surplus and inflation drop: Strong positive evidence increases odds.
   - Likelihood ratio for social costs and IMF forecast: Negative evidence decreases odds.
   - Posterior odds are adjusted upwards due to strong fiscal evidence but tempered by social risks and IMF's forecast.
   - Posterior probability is estimated to be around 40%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for political instability.
   - Alternative scenario: A major political crisis could derail the plan, suggesting a lower probability.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unforeseen political events and adjust the probability slightly downwards.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering all evidence and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is 35%.

Final: 35%

# Will Argentina's year-over-year inflation be below 30% for December 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes. From the research report, I can identify two key reference classes:

1. **Argentine Stabilization Plans (1980s-2000s)**: Historical success rate of 10-15% for Argentina's previous inflation stabilization plans.
2. **Global "Shock Therapy" / Heterodox Stabilizations**: Success rate of 30-40% for countries implementing drastic reforms to end hyperinflation.

Given that Milei's plan has unique characteristics but still operates within Argentina's challenging economic and political context, I'll blend these reference classes with a slight tilt toward the global comparison due to the unprecedented nature of the current approach.

**Prior probability**: 25% (as suggested in the research brief's Bayesian update sketch)

This prior reflects the historical difficulty of taming hyperinflation in Argentina specifically, while acknowledging that some shock therapy approaches have succeeded elsewhere.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Argentina has a long history of failed stabilization attempts due to inability to maintain fiscal discipline
- The country started from a position of hyperinflation (25% monthly rate in December 2023)
- The plan faces significant social and political pressures that could undermine sustainability

**Key differences**:
- **Unprecedented fiscal adjustment speed**: Unlike most past plans that phased in austerity, Milei front-loaded the entire fiscal correction
- **Lack of price/wage controls**: The plan relies almost entirely on fiscal and monetary anchors rather than controls
- **Strong initial electoral mandate**: Milei was elected explicitly on a platform of drastic cuts
- **Early success**: Monthly inflation has already fallen dramatically from 25.5% to 2.4% as of November 2024
- **Primary fiscal surplus achieved**: A key differentiator from failed historical attempts

These differences are significant and suggest the current plan may have a higher chance of success than the historical base rate would indicate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence favoring success (inflation below 30%)**:

1. **Achievement of primary fiscal surplus (1.8% of GDP in 2024)**
   - P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Successful disinflation almost always requires fiscal discipline
   - P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Failed stabilizations rarely maintain fiscal surpluses
   - Likelihood ratio: ~4.5 (strong positive evidence)

2. **Rapid fall in monthly inflation to low single digits (2.4% by November 2024)**
   - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Successful plans show early progress in monthly rates
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even failed plans can achieve temporary improvements
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (moderate positive evidence)

3. **Removal of most currency and capital controls (April 2025)**
   - P(E|H): Moderately high (~0.7) - Successful stabilizations eventually normalize financial markets
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This could happen even if inflation remains above 30%
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.75 (modest positive evidence)

4. **Santander projection of 2025 inflation below 30%**
   - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Expert forecasts align with success
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Experts can be optimistic even in challenging cases
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (modest positive evidence)

**Evidence against success (inflation above 30%)**:

1. **IMF forecast of 41.3% inflation for 2025 (October 2025 update)**
   - P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - IMF would likely forecast below 30% if success were likely
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - IMF forecasts tend to be well-calibrated
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (strong negative evidence)

2. **Poverty rate of 52.9% in first half of 2024**
   - P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Successful stabilizations often involve short-term pain
   - P(E|~H): Moderately high (~0.7) - Extreme poverty increases risk of policy reversal
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.71 (modest negative evidence)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 25:75 (or 1:3), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

1. **Update based on fiscal surplus achievement**:
   - Prior odds: 1:3
   - Likelihood ratio: 4.5
   - Posterior odds: 1 × 4.5 : 3 = 4.5:3
   - Posterior probability: 4.5/(4.5+3) ≈ 60%

2. **Update based on IMF forecast**:
   - Prior odds (from previous update): 4.5:3
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.25
   - Posterior odds: 4.5 × 0.25 : 3 = 1.125:3
   - Posterior probability: 1.125/(1.125+3) ≈ 27%

3. **Update based on rapid fall in monthly inflation**:
   - Prior odds (from previous update): 1.125:3
   - Likelihood ratio: 2.0
   - Posterior odds: 1.125 × 2.0 : 3 = 2.25:3
   - Posterior probability: 2.25/(2.25+3) ≈ 43%

After incorporating these key pieces of evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 43%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting recent progress and underestimating the difficulty of the "last mile" of disinflation
- The research brief may have selection bias in the sources it draws from
- The political sustainability risk could be greater than I've accounted for
- There's limited information about potential external shocks (global recession, commodity price changes)

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Optimistic case (65-70%)**: The fiscal anchor holds, growth returns strongly in 2025 as projected by the OECD (5.2%), easing social pressures and allowing the final push below 30% inflation
- **Pessimistic case (20-25%)**: Political pressure forces fiscal loosening in late 2025, or relative price adjustments create persistent inflation inertia that keeps the rate in the 35-45% range

**Adjustments needed**:
- The IMF's recent upward revision to 41.3% deserves significant weight as it comes from a credible institution with access to detailed data
- The December 2025 timeframe is tight - even if the plan is broadly successful, hitting below 30% by that specific month requires everything to go right
- Historical precedent suggests the "last mile" of disinflation is often the hardest

Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast slightly downward from 43% to around 40%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evaluating the evidence, and accounting for potential blind spots, I assess that Argentina's year-over-year inflation has a 40% probability of being below 30% for December 2025.

Final: 40%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will blend two reference classes:
1.  **Argentine Stabilization Plans:** Argentina has a long history of attempting to control high inflation. Most of these plans (e.g., the Austral Plan) have ultimately failed due to an inability to maintain long-term fiscal discipline, leading to a collapse of the monetary anchor. The historical success rate for these plans in achieving sustained low inflation is very low, perhaps 10-15%.
2.  **Global "Shock Therapy" Programs:** This class includes countries that implemented drastic, front-loaded reforms to end hyperinflation (e.g., Bolivia 1985, Israel 1985). These plans have a higher success rate, particularly when they credibly establish a long-term fiscal anchor. The success rate for reducing YoY inflation below 30% within two years is arguably in the 30-40% range.

Given that this is a "shock therapy" plan (higher success class) implemented in Argentina (lower success class), a blend of these two is appropriate. I will start with a **prior probability of 25%**. This acknowledges the potential of the policy mix while heavily weighting the deep-seated structural challenges of the Argentine political economy. In odds form, this is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The core challenge remains political sustainability. The current plan has induced a severe recession and a sharp rise in poverty (to over 50%), creating immense social pressure for policy relaxation. This is the classic failure mode for past Argentine plans.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the unprecedented speed and depth of the fiscal adjustment. President Milei's "chainsaw" approach achieved a primary fiscal surplus within the first quarter, a feat rarely seen. This front-loaded the pain but also established credibility much faster than gradual plans. Furthermore, Milei was elected on an explicit mandate for austerity, giving him a unique, if temporary, political runway.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence presented, assessing its impact on the initial prior.

*   **Evidence 1 (Strongly Positive): Achievement of a Primary Fiscal Surplus.** This is the most crucial piece of evidence. The government has successfully cut spending and eliminated the primary deficit, removing the need for inflationary monetary financing.
    *   P(E | H: Inflation < 30%): High. A fiscal anchor is the core mechanism for success.
    *   P(E | ~H: Inflation >= 30%): Low. Without this, failure would be almost certain.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is very high (>> 1).** This evidence strongly increases the probability of success.

*   **Evidence 2 (Strongly Negative): IMF's October 2025 Inflation Forecast Revision.** The IMF recently *raised* its 2025 inflation forecast to 41.3%. This is a powerful negative signal for several reasons:
    *   It comes very late in the forecast period (October 2025), suggesting it's based on recent data showing inflation is "sticky" or re-accelerating.
    *   It comes from a major, data-driven international institution.
    *   A yearly average of 41.3% makes a year-end YoY figure below 30% mathematically challenging, requiring a sharp drop in inflation in the final months that the IMF evidently does not expect.
    *   P(E | H): Low. It's unlikely the IMF would issue such a forecast if the true trajectory was towards <30%.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. This forecast is very consistent with inflation remaining above 30%.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is low (<< 1).**

*   **Evidence 3 (Moderately Negative): High Social Costs.** The poverty rate hitting 52.9% highlights the main risk: political and social sustainability. This increases the probability that the government will be forced to relax austerity, which would reignite inflation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is less than 1.**

*   **Counter-Evidence (to Evidence 2): History of Pessimistic Forecasts.** The background notes that forecasters have consistently been too pessimistic about the speed of Milei's disinflation. This suggests the IMF's models may be systematically biased towards Argentina's historical failures and unable to properly model the current "regime change." This weakens the negative impact of the IMF forecast, but does not eliminate it, especially given the late-stage upward revision.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a conceptual update from the 25% prior.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1/3 (25% probability).
2.  **Update for Positive Evidence:** The achievement of the fiscal surplus is a game-changer and a massive departure from the Argentine base case. This evidence is strong enough to warrant a large update. I'll estimate a likelihood ratio of 6 for this factor.
    *   Posterior Odds = (1/3) * 6 = 2.
    *   This translates to a probability of 2 / (1 + 2) = 66.7%. This reflects a scenario where the plan's core mechanism is working perfectly.
3.  **Update for Negative Evidence:** Now, I must account for the significant headwinds: the IMF's very pessimistic (and recent) forecast and the high social costs. While the IMF has been wrong before, an upward revision in October is a serious warning. I will assign a combined likelihood ratio of 2/3 to this negative evidence, which discounts the IMF's warning but still treats it as a significant negative signal.
    *   Final Odds = 2 * (2/3) = 4/3.
    *   Final Probability = (4/3) / (1 + 4/3) = 4/7 ≈ 57.1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 57% is slightly below the Manifold market's 61%. This seems appropriate. The market may be overweighting the past trend of "beating expectations" and underweighting the new information from the IMF's upward revision. The "last mile" of disinflation is notoriously difficult, and the combination of sticky prices and extreme social pressure makes a failure to meet the <30% target by a specific deadline a very plausible outcome. My forecast could be too high if the social situation deteriorates rapidly, forcing a policy reversal. It could be too low if the fiscal anchor proves so powerful that it crushes inflation in the final months, proving the IMF's models wrong once again. The 57% figure balances these strong competing forces.

### 6. Final Forecast
The evidence of a sustained fiscal surplus is a powerful argument for success, representing a genuine break from Argentina's inflationary past. However, the severe social costs and the recent pessimistic revision from the IMF are significant counter-signals suggesting the final stage of disinflation will be difficult and is not guaranteed. Balancing these factors, I update my initial 25% prior to a final probability of 57%.

Final: 57%
