### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Claims of "solved" grand challenges in computing.** This includes claims like "passing the Turing Test" (e.g., Eugene Goostman in 2014) or achieving "quantum supremacy" (Google in 2019). Such claims occur infrequently, perhaps once every 5-10 years for a given field. This suggests a ballpark annual base rate of **10-20%**. However, these past claims were often contested and narrower in scope than AGI.
-   **Reference Class 2: Transformative product announcements by major tech firms.** This includes events like the launch of the iPhone or the public release of ChatGPT. These are strategic decisions designed to capture a market. AGI is the ultimate product in this space. Major firms make 1-2 such "paradigm shift" announcements per decade. The annual probability for any *one* specific firm is low, but across the ~18 listed entities, the chance of one making a bold claim is higher. This suggests a base rate of **5-15%** for a claim of this magnitude in a given year.
-   **Limitations:** Both reference classes are imperfect. An AGI claim is unique due to its perceived existential stakes and economic implications, which could either accelerate a premature claim (hype) or delay it (fear of scrutiny/regulation). There has never been a prior claim of achieving AGI from a major lab, so we are in a truly novel regime.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-27] Article highlights race to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), with some projections for 2035-2040. — **↓** — The focus on ASI, a step beyond AGI, may shift the goalposts, making a mere "AGI" claim seem less monumental or premature for labs aiming for the ultimate prize.
-   [2025-09-11] Article notes intensifying conversation around ASI, with some speculating its arrival as early as 2025. — **↑** — Highlights the extreme bullishness in some expert circles, which could create the technical and social conditions for a lab to feel justified in making a claim.
-   [2025-07-07] Report on Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) turning down a $32B acquisition offer. — **↓** — SSI's explicit mission of "scaling in peace" and prioritizing safety over hype creates a powerful counter-narrative to a reckless race to claim AGI, potentially influencing other labs' PR strategies.
-   [2025-06-21] SSI is formally founded by top AI talent with a safety-first mission. — **↓** — The departure of key talent like Ilya Sutskever from a frontier lab (OpenAI) to start a safety-focused one signals that the "move fast and break things" culture is facing serious internal pushback.
-   [2025-10-28] **Implicit evidence:** No major lab has made an AGI claim in the first ~10 months of 2025. — **↓ (Large effect)** — With only two months remaining in the resolution period, the available time for a major, planned announcement has shrunk dramatically. The null result so far is strong evidence.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Competitive Dynamics (Large ↑):** The intense race between a few well-funded labs (OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, Meta, xAI) for talent, funding, and market leadership creates immense pressure to be the "first" to declare a breakthrough.
-   **Ambiguous Definition of AGI (Large ↑):** The lack of a universally agreed-upon, falsifiable definition of AGI allows a lab to "define the target they have hit." A claim could be based on a set of impressive but not comprehensive capabilities, technically satisfying a loose definition.
-   **Financial Incentives (Moderate ↑):** A credible AGI claim could lead to a massive surge in a company's valuation, attract enormous investment, and solidify its market position for years to come.
-   **Regulatory Preemption (Moderate ↓):** Making a public claim of AGI would act as a lightning rod, inviting immediate and intense scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Many labs may prefer to continue development "under the radar" for as long as possible.
-   **Reputational Risk (Moderate ↓):** If a lab claims AGI and the system subsequently fails public tests or is easily "debunked" by rivals, the reputational damage would be immense and long-lasting. This incentivizes caution.
-   **The "Safety" Counter-Movement (Moderate ↓):** The rise of influential safety-focused organizations (e.g., Anthropic, SSI) creates a cultural pressure against premature, hyped claims that could be seen as reckless.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Stakes:** Unlike "quantum supremacy" or passing the Turing Test, AGI is widely seen as a technology with civilization-level economic and existential implications, magnifying both the incentives and disincentives for a claim.
-   **Extreme Resource Concentration:** A handful of private corporations control the vast majority of the compute, data, and talent required for frontier AI development, making the decision to "make a claim" rest in the hands of a few CEOs.
-   **The "Claim" is a Speech Act:** The resolution depends on a public relations decision, not a physically verifiable outcome. This makes it more susceptible to strategic timing, marketing considerations, and individual psychology than a traditional scientific discovery.
-   **Real-time Scrutiny:** The level of public, media, and governmental attention on AI is orders of magnitude higher than for previous technological breakthroughs, meaning any claim will be instantly and globally dissected.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the reference classes, would be a low probability for a claim in any given year, perhaps around 10% (equivalent n ≈ 10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↓ (Large):** The year is almost over. The fact that no claim has been made by late October is the strongest piece of evidence against a 2025 resolution.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The establishment and high valuation of SSI signals a powerful, well-funded counter-narrative focused on safety over hype, potentially tempering the behavior of other labs.
    -   **↑ (Moderate):** The underlying competitive and financial pressures to be first remain extremely high, and the fuzzy definition of AGI always leaves the door open for a marketing-led claim.
    -   **↓ (Small):** The intellectual conversation among some experts is shifting to ASI, potentially making a simple "AGI" claim seem like a less significant milestone to announce.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests a significant downward update. The time decay is the dominant factor, heavily outweighing the persistent upward pressures from competition. The posterior should be substantially lower than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A major lab (e.g., OpenAI, Google) unexpectedly schedules a "special announcement" for November or December.
    -   Key leaders (Altman, Hassabis, Musk) begin using highly definitive language on social media (e.g., "The threshold has been crossed," not "We are getting close").
    -   Widespread internal leaks from a major lab about a monumental, unreleased model with unprecedented capabilities.
    -   Sudden, coordinated efforts by a lab's policy team to "prepare" regulators for a major breakthrough.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   End-of-year announcements focus on incremental updates (e.g., a slightly better GPT-4 model) or specialized tools.
    -   CEOs give interviews emphasizing the long and difficult path still ahead for AGI.
    -   Key labs release 2026 roadmaps that frame AGI as a multi-year goal.
    -   No major AI-related press events are scheduled by the listed labs for the remainder of the year.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The primary risk is a lab making a heavily qualified or narrow claim that meets the letter of the resolution criteria but not the spirit of "true" AGI (e.g., "We have achieved AGI in the domain of text and image reasoning").
-   **Wildcard Actor:** Elon Musk (xAI) has a history of making bold, sudden announcements. He represents a significant source of unpredictable variance.
-   **"Leadership" Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria includes "labs' leadership." A claim from a prominent but not top-level leader (e.g., a VP of Research) in a blog post or conference talk could trigger a YES resolution.
-   **Leak vs. Claim:** A leak is not a public claim. The resolution requires a deliberate, public statement by the organization or its leadership.
-   **Black Swan Breakthrough:** A sudden, unexpected algorithmic or scaling breakthrough could render current timelines obsolete, though the window for this to be productized and announced in 2025 is extremely small.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a major AI lab claiming to have developed AGI in 2025 is low. The year is nearly complete with no such claim, and the rise of a safety-focused counter-narrative acts as a brake on hype, despite intense underlying competitive pressures.

To forecast the probability of a major AI lab claiming to have developed AGI in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1:** Claims of "solved" grand challenges in computing occur infrequently, suggesting an annual base rate of 10-20%.
- **Reference Class 2:** Transformative product announcements by major tech firms suggest a base rate of 5-15% for a claim of this magnitude in a given year.
- **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the unique nature of an AGI claim, a reasonable prior probability is around 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The competitive dynamics and financial incentives are similar to past transformative announcements.
- **Differences:** The stakes are unprecedented, and the decision to claim AGI is more strategic and PR-driven than past technological claims.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **No Claim by Late October (Large ↓):** The absence of a claim by late October significantly decreases the probability, as the time window for a claim is closing.
- **Safety-Focused Counter-Narrative (Moderate ↓):** The rise of safety-focused organizations like SSI suggests a cultural shift towards caution, reducing the likelihood of a premature claim.
- **Competitive and Financial Pressures (Moderate ↑):** These pressures remain high, slightly increasing the probability of a claim.
- **Focus on ASI (Small ↓):** The shift in conversation towards ASI may make an AGI claim seem less significant.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The large effect of no claim by late October and the moderate effect of the safety narrative suggest a strong downward adjustment.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
  - Adjusting for the large negative evidence (no claim by late October), the odds decrease significantly.
  - Adjusting for the moderate negative evidence (safety narrative), the odds decrease further.
  - Adjusting for the moderate positive evidence (competitive pressures), the odds increase slightly but are outweighed by the negative evidence.
- **Posterior Probability:** The combined evidence suggests a substantial decrease from the prior probability, resulting in a posterior probability significantly lower than 10%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a last-minute strategic announcement or a wildcard actor like Elon Musk making a bold claim.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden breakthrough or a strategic PR move could lead to a claim, but the likelihood remains low given the current evidence.
- **Adjustment:** Given the low probability of a claim and the strong negative evidence, the forecast remains conservative.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability of a major AI lab claiming to have developed AGI in 2025 is low.

Final: 3%

# Will a major AI lab claim in 2025 that they have developed AGI?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a major AI lab claiming to have developed AGI in 2025.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Major technological breakthrough claims by leading tech companies
- Previous AGI-related announcements or claims
- The frequency of "we've solved X" claims in AI history

Looking at historical patterns, major tech breakthroughs (like quantum supremacy or passing specific AI benchmarks) are announced roughly every few years. However, AGI specifically represents a much higher threshold than most previous claims. No major lab has yet claimed to have achieved AGI, despite significant advances.

Given that we're already in late October 2025 with no such claim yet, and considering the historical rarity of such monumental claims, I'll set a prior of **8%**.

This prior reflects:
- The inherent rarity of paradigm-shifting technological claims
- The fact that AGI represents an exceptionally high bar compared to other AI milestones
- The significant reputational risk of making a premature AGI claim

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The competitive landscape remains intense among major AI labs
- Financial and prestige incentives for being "first" to AGI remain strong
- The definition of AGI remains somewhat ambiguous, allowing for strategic claims

**Key differences:**
- We're already in late October 2025, with only two months remaining in the year
- The establishment of safety-focused organizations like SSI signals a counter-narrative to rushing AGI claims
- The conversation is already shifting toward ASI (Artificial Superintelligence), potentially making an AGI claim seem less significant
- The stakes and scrutiny around AGI claims are unprecedented compared to previous technological milestones

These differences, particularly the time constraint, significantly reduce the probability compared to what it might have been at the start of 2025.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: No claim has been made through late October 2025**
- P(E|H): If a lab were going to claim AGI in 2025, there's perhaps a 20% chance they would wait until November-December (for strategic timing, year-end announcements, etc.)
- P(E|~H): If no lab is going to claim AGI in 2025, there's a ~100% chance we would observe no claim by late October
- Likelihood ratio: 0.20 (strong evidence against a claim in 2025)

**Evidence 2: Establishment of SSI with safety-first mission**
- P(E|H): If a lab were planning to claim AGI in 2025, there's perhaps a 70% chance we would still see safety-focused organizations emerge
- P(E|~H): If no lab is planning to claim AGI in 2025, there's perhaps a 90% chance we would see safety-focused organizations emerge
- Likelihood ratio: 0.78 (moderate evidence against a claim)

**Evidence 3: Ongoing competitive pressures between major labs**
- P(E|H): If a lab were planning to claim AGI in 2025, there's a ~100% chance we would observe intense competition
- P(E|~H): If no lab is planning to claim AGI in 2025, there's still a ~95% chance we would observe intense competition
- Likelihood ratio: 1.05 (very slight evidence for a claim)

**Evidence 4: Shift in conversation toward ASI**
- P(E|H): If a lab were planning to claim AGI in 2025, there's perhaps a 60% chance the conversation would already be shifting to ASI
- P(E|~H): If no lab is planning to claim AGI in 2025, there's perhaps an 80% chance the conversation would be shifting to ASI
- Likelihood ratio: 0.75 (moderate evidence against a claim)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 8% (odds of 0.087):

**Update on Evidence 1 (No claim by late October):**
- Prior odds: 0.087
- Likelihood ratio: 0.20
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 0.20 = 0.0174
- Posterior probability: 0.0174 / (1 + 0.0174) ≈ 1.7%

This is the most significant update, as the time constraint severely limits the possibility of a claim in 2025.

**Update on Evidence 2 (SSI establishment):**
- Prior odds: 0.0174
- Likelihood ratio: 0.78
- Posterior odds: 0.0174 × 0.78 = 0.0136
- Posterior probability: 0.0136 / (1 + 0.0136) ≈ 1.3%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Competitive pressures):**
- Prior odds: 0.0136
- Likelihood ratio: 1.05
- Posterior odds: 0.0136 × 1.05 = 0.0143
- Posterior probability: 0.0143 / (1 + 0.0143) ≈ 1.4%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Shift toward ASI):**
- Prior odds: 0.0143
- Likelihood ratio: 0.75
- Posterior odds: 0.0143 × 0.75 = 0.0107
- Posterior probability: 0.0107 / (1 + 0.0107) ≈ 1.1%

After considering all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 1.1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the willingness of certain labs (particularly xAI under Elon Musk) to make bold, unexpected claims
- The definition of "claiming AGI" might be more flexible than I'm assuming
- There could be strategic reasons for a year-end AGI announcement that I'm not fully accounting for
- A breakthrough could have already occurred but is being kept secret until a strategic moment

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A lab might make a qualified AGI claim (e.g., "domain-specific AGI" or "narrow AGI") that technically satisfies the resolution criteria
- A lab might be planning a major December announcement to coincide with end-of-year reviews or conferences
- Competitive pressure might force a premature claim if rumors of a rival's breakthrough emerge

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for the possibility of unexpected announcements or strategic timing. However, the time constraint remains the dominant factor.

## 6. Final Forecast

After careful consideration of the base rate, available evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that a major AI lab will claim in 2025 that they have developed AGI at 2%.

The primary factors driving this low probability are:
1. The limited time remaining in 2025 (only November-December)
2. The absence of any such claim through late October
3. The emergence of safety-focused counter-narratives
4. The shift in conversation toward ASI rather than AGI

While competitive pressures remain strong, the reputational risks of a premature AGI claim and the increasingly safety-conscious AI ecosystem make such a claim unlikely in the remaining months of 2025.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a public claim of achieving AGI by a major AI lab within a specific year (2025). A suitable reference class would be major, paradigm-shifting announcements or claims from leading technology companies.

-   **Reference Class 1: Claims of solving "grand challenges" in computing.** Examples include Google's 2019 claim of "quantum supremacy" or the recurring claims of passing the Turing Test. Such field-defining claims are infrequent, occurring perhaps once every 5-10 years within a specific domain. This suggests an annual base rate of 10-20%.
-   **Reference Class 2: Transformative product announcements.** Events like the launch of the iPhone or the public release of ChatGPT are rare. A major tech company might make such an announcement once a decade. However, the question lists ~18 potential labs. If each had a small independent chance, the aggregate probability would be higher.

Given the unprecedented nature of AGI, the intense competition, and the large number of well-funded players, a relatively high annual base rate is warranted. A claim is a lower bar than an actual achievement. I will set the prior probability, as of January 1, 2025, at **15%**.

Prior Odds: P(H) / (1 - P(H)) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176 (or about 1-to-5.6 against).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from historical tech races in several key ways:

-   **Ambiguous Definition:** Unlike landing on the moon, AGI lacks a universally accepted definition. This makes it easier for a lab to "move the goalposts" and declare victory based on their own criteria, increasing the likelihood of a claim.
-   **Extreme Stakes:** The perceived economic and existential stakes of AGI are far higher than for previous technologies. This creates both immense pressure to be first (upward pressure on a claim) and immense fear of backlash or regulation if the claim is premature or the technology is perceived as dangerous (downward pressure).
-   **The "Claim" is a Speech Act:** The question resolves on a public relations decision, not a verifiable scientific milestone. This makes it highly dependent on the strategic calculations and risk tolerance of a few key individuals (e.g., Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Elon Musk).

These factors introduce high variance, but the ambiguity of the AGI definition is a strong argument for why a claim is more likely than the base rate for a truly verifiable breakthrough might suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most critical piece of evidence is the current date: **October 28, 2025**.

-   **Evidence 1 (E1): No claim has been made in the first ~10 months of 2025.**
    -   Let H be "a claim is made in 2025" and ~H be "no claim is made in 2025".
    -   P(E1 | ~H) = 1. If no claim is made in the entire year, it is certain that no claim was made by October 28.
    -   P(E1 | H): If a claim *was* going to be made in 2025, what is the probability it would happen in the last two months? Assuming major announcements are spread evenly, the probability would be 2/12 ≈ 17%. This means P(E1 | H) is high (≈83%), but lower than P(E1 | ~H).
    -   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) = P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H) < 1.** This evidence provides a strong update downwards. The fact that 10 out of 12 months have passed without an event significantly reduces the probability that the event will occur in the remaining time.

-   **Evidence 2 (E2): The rise of a well-funded, safety-focused counter-movement (e.g., SSI's founding in June/July).**
    -   This creates a cultural and reputational brake on making hyped, potentially reckless claims. Labs like OpenAI and Google must now weigh the risk of being labeled as irresponsible compared to the safety-first approach of SSI.
    -   This evidence makes a premature claim slightly less likely than it would be otherwise. It exerts a moderate downward pressure on the probability. **LR < 1.**

-   **Evidence 3 (E3): Persistent, intense competition and financial incentives.**
    -   This is the primary driver for a "Yes" outcome. The race for talent, compute, and market dominance remains fierce. This is a constant background factor providing upward pressure. However, this was already incorporated into our initial 15% prior.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior probability of 15% for the entire year 2025. The most powerful update comes from the time decay.

-   **Prior:** P(H) = 15% (for the full year).
-   **Update for Time Decay:** We have passed 10/12 (≈83%) of the year. If we assume the probability of a claim is uniformly distributed throughout the year, the initial 15% probability is now concentrated in the remaining 2/12 of the year. The updated probability would be roughly (2/12) * 15% = 2.5%.
-   However, tech companies often schedule major announcements for Q4. Let's consider a scenario where 50% of such announcements occur in Q4 (Oct-Dec). The prior probability for a Q4 announcement would be 0.50 * 15% = 7.5%. Since October is almost over, two months (Nov, Dec) remain, which is 2/3 of Q4. The remaining probability would be (2/3) * 7.5% = 5%.

This simple model suggests the probability has fallen from 15% to around **5%** due to the passage of time, even accounting for a Q4-heavy announcement schedule. The downward pressure from the safety movement further reinforces this low probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of a low probability could be wrong if:
1.  **A Wildcard Actor Makes a Sudden Claim:** Elon Musk (xAI) has a history of bold, unexpected announcements on social media. A simple tweet like "xAI has achieved AGI" would resolve this question "Yes". This is the most plausible scenario for a "Yes" resolution and is difficult to model with precision.
2.  **A "Soft Claim" is Made:** A lab's leader might make a qualified claim in an interview or blog post (e.g., "Our latest model meets our internal definition of AGI"). This has a lower barrier than a formal product launch and could happen quickly.
3.  **Competitive Panic:** A credible leak that a competitor is about to announce could trigger a preemptive, rushed claim from another lab.

These factors suggest that the probability, while low, should not be near zero. The 5% figure derived from the Q4-weighted time decay model seems to adequately account for these possibilities. It correctly frames the event as very unlikely given the late date, but not impossible due to the unpredictable and competitive nature of the field.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial 15% annual probability is significantly diminished by the fact that ten months of 2025 have passed without a claim. While the underlying competitive pressures remain high and the ambiguous definition of AGI makes a claim easier, the lack of any signals or major scheduled events is strong evidence against a 2025 claim. The rise of a safety-focused counter-narrative also disincentivizes a hyped, premature announcement. The remaining probability is concentrated in the small chance of a surprise end-of-year announcement or a wildcard claim from an unpredictable actor. A 5% probability reflects this balance of factors.

Final: 5%
