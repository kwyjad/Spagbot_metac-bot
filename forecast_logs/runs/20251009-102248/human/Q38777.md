### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major legislation overhaul by a new unified government (trifecta):** A new administration with control of both houses of Congress often attempts to pass or repeal signature legislation. The 2017 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the successful passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) are key examples. The success rate is mixed; passing new legislation (TCJA) is often easier than repealing existing, entrenched programs (ACA).
    *   **Base rate (for significant amendment/repeal):** 30-40%. The ACA repeal failed despite a trifecta, but the TCJA passed. The IRA's structure (tax credits and spending) makes it more like the TCJA and thus more vulnerable to budgetary changes than the ACA's regulatory structure.
2.  **Use of Budget Reconciliation to enact fiscal priorities:** This is the most likely legislative vehicle. Reconciliation allows a simple majority in the Senate to pass budget-related legislation. It was used to pass the TCJA (2017) and the IRA itself (2022). When a party has a trifecta, they almost always use reconciliation to advance their agenda.
    *   **Base rate (for a reconciliation bill passing):** 70-80%. Given a trifecta, the primary question is not *if* a reconciliation bill will be attempted, but *what* it will contain and whether leadership can secure the votes.
3.  **Significant modification of energy/environmental policy after a change in administration:** Major shifts in this area are common. The Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement and rolled back numerous regulations. The Biden administration rejoined and passed the IRA. This suggests a high likelihood of *attempted* change.
    *   **Base rate (for successful legislative change in the first year):** 40-50%. Administrative actions are easier and more common than passing new laws, which face more friction.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-05** House and Senate pass a budget resolution including reconciliation instructions for committees to find savings by amending IRA climate provisions. — ↑↑ — This is the critical procedural step that formally begins the process of drafting a bill that can bypass the Senate filibuster.
*   **2025-08-12** A coalition of Republican senators from southern and midwestern states with new EV battery and solar manufacturing plants publicly urges caution, advocating for "reform, not repeal." — ↓ — Signals significant internal party friction and a potential bloc of votes against a full repeal, making a more modest amendment more likely.
*   **2025-07-22** The House Ways and Means Committee holds hearings titled "Rolling Back the Green New Deal," where conservative groups advocate for full repeal of all IRA tax credits. — ↑ — Demonstrates that the party base and key committee leadership are still focused on a major rollback, providing political momentum for action.
*   **2025-06-24** Senate Republicans introduce a bill to repeal most IRA clean energy tax credits, fulfilling a campaign promise. — ↑ — Confirms that legislative action is a stated priority for the new majority, though this bill lacks a path forward outside of reconciliation.
*   **2025-04-18** Major industry groups, including automotive and utility trade associations, launch a significant lobbying effort to preserve key IRA tax credits, highlighting job creation in Republican districts. — ↓ — Establishes a powerful, well-funded counter-narrative and opposition force that cross-cuts party lines, complicating the political calculus for repeal.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Unified Republican Government (Trifecta):** The necessary condition for any legislative action. Without the White House, Senate, and House, this is a non-starter. (Size: Large ↑)
2.  **Budget Reconciliation Process:** The key legislative tool. It allows a bill to pass the Senate with 51 votes, bypassing the filibuster. The IRA's provisions are almost entirely fiscal (tax credits, spending), making them highly vulnerable to this process. (Size: Large ↑)
3.  **Campaign Promises & Base Politics:** The GOP, and particularly former President Trump, campaigned heavily on repealing the IRA's "Green New Scam." Failure to act would be seen as a broken promise to their base. (Size: Moderate ↑)
4.  **Economic "Facts on the Ground":** Billions in IRA-spurred investments are flowing to manufacturing facilities in Republican-held states (e.g., Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee). This creates a powerful counter-lobby from local businesses and politicians to protect those projects. (Size: Moderate ↓)
5.  **Broad Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves "Yes" if a bill reduces funds "by any amount." This is a very low bar. A compromise bill that preserves 95% of the IRA but makes minor cuts to appease fiscal hawks would still trigger a "Yes." (Size: Moderate ↑)
6.  **Narrow Congressional Majorities:** A slim majority in the Senate (e.g., 51-49) would give immense power to one or two moderate or parochial senators, making it difficult to pass a bill that imposes concentrated costs on their state. (Size: Small ↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Entrenched Private Capital:** Unlike the ACA, which primarily restructured insurance markets and government benefits, the IRA's main effect is incentivizing massive, long-term private capital investment. These projects (factories, etc.) are harder to unwind and create a powerful corporate constituency for policy stability.
*   **Geographic Distribution of Benefits:** The IRA's benefits are disproportionately flowing to Republican-controlled states, creating a "strange bedfellows" political dynamic where GOP members are cross-pressured to protect local projects, a stronger counterweight than existed during the ACA repeal debate.
*   **Vulnerability to Reconciliation:** The IRA is almost purely a fiscal bill. The ACA had significant regulatory components that were difficult to address via reconciliation (due to the Byrd Rule). The IRA's core—tax credits—is the exact type of policy reconciliation is designed to handle.
*   **Low Resolution Bar:** The reference class often involves "full repeal" or "major overhaul." This question's threshold is far lower ("reduce...by any amount"), making a "Yes" resolution much more plausible than historical analogues would suggest. A symbolic cut could be enough.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the base rate for a new trifecta using reconciliation to enact fiscal priorities (~75%), but temper it slightly due to the unique political cross-pressures. A reasonable prior might be **65% with an equivalent n of 10.**
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Reconciliation instructions have been adopted. This confirms the legislative vehicle is moving forward, overcoming the first and largest hurdle.
    *   (↓ Moderate) A "red-state caucus" has emerged, signaling that a *full repeal* is likely off the table and that any final bill will require significant compromise.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The resolution criteria's low bar means that the likely compromise—a bill with modest cuts or reforms—still resolves as "Yes." This significantly mutes the impact of the "red-state caucus" on the final outcome of this question.
    *   (↑ Small) Sustained pressure from the party's base and conservative groups ensures that leadership cannot simply abandon the effort entirely.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly confirms the *process* is underway, while the primary counter-evidence (GOP infighting) points toward a *less severe* amendment rather than no amendment at all. Given the low resolution bar, this still points toward a "Yes." The posterior should move **moderately up** from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   House Ways & Means or Senate Finance committees scheduling a markup of a reconciliation bill.

To forecast the probability of a new bill amending the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) becoming law in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for significant amendment or repeal of major legislation by a new unified government (trifecta) is estimated at 30-40%. However, given the IRA's fiscal nature and vulnerability to budget reconciliation, a higher base rate of 65% is more appropriate. This accounts for the historical success of budget reconciliation in passing fiscal priorities when a party holds a trifecta.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a Republican trifecta, similar to past scenarios where significant legislative changes were attempted or enacted (e.g., TCJA in 2017).
- **Differences:** The IRA's benefits are geographically distributed in Republican states, creating internal party pressure against full repeal. The resolution criteria for this question are also lower, requiring only a minor amendment to resolve as "Yes."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Reconciliation Instructions Adopted (↑ Large):** The adoption of reconciliation instructions is a strong indicator that legislative action is moving forward, increasing the likelihood of an amendment.
- **Red-State Caucus Emergence (↓ Moderate):** The emergence of a GOP faction advocating for reform rather than repeal suggests internal party friction, decreasing the likelihood of a full repeal but not necessarily a minor amendment.
- **Low Resolution Bar (↑ Moderate):** The question's low threshold for resolution means even minor amendments will result in a "Yes," increasing the probability.
- **Party Base Pressure (↑ Small):** Ongoing pressure from the GOP base ensures continued efforts to amend the IRA, albeit potentially in a limited form.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 65% probability translates to odds of 0.65 / 0.35 = 1.857.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is moderately positive. Let's assume a combined likelihood ratio of 1.5 for the evidence.
- **Posterior Odds:** 1.857 (prior odds) × 1.5 (likelihood ratio) = 2.7855.
- **Posterior Probability:** 2.7855 / (1 + 2.7855) ≈ 73.6%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be overconfident given the internal GOP divisions and the economic benefits of the IRA in Republican states.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where GOP infighting leads to no amendment is plausible, but the low resolution bar mitigates this risk.
- **Adjustment:** Considering these factors, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential overconfidence is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Adjusted Probability:** After considering the evidence and potential overconfidence, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a more cautious stance.

Final: 72%

# Forecasting: Will a new bill amending the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act become law in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

1. **Major legislation amendment by a new unified government (trifecta)**: When a party gains control of the White House, Senate, and House, they often attempt to modify or repeal signature legislation of the previous administration. Historical examples suggest a 30-40% success rate for significant amendments.

2. **Budget reconciliation bills under a trifecta**: This is the most likely legislative vehicle for IRA amendments, as it bypasses the Senate filibuster. When a party has unified control, reconciliation bills pass at a rate of 70-80%.

3. **First-year legislative changes to energy/environmental policy after administration change**: Historical data suggests a 40-50% success rate for legislative (not just regulatory) changes.

Given the question's specific focus on any amendment to the IRA's climate provisions becoming law in 2025, I'll weight these reference classes and select a prior of **65%**. This reflects the high likelihood of a reconciliation bill under a trifecta, tempered by the challenges of passing specific policy changes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The scenario involves a new administration with unified government control attempting to modify signature legislation of the previous administration
- Budget reconciliation provides a viable legislative pathway requiring only simple majorities
- The political incentives align with campaign promises to modify the legislation

**Key differences:**
- The IRA's climate provisions have created significant economic investments in Republican-held states, creating cross-pressures for GOP lawmakers
- Unlike some previous legislation (like the ACA), the IRA is primarily fiscal in nature, making it more vulnerable to reconciliation
- The resolution criteria is notably low - any bill that reduces funds "by any amount" counts as a Yes
- The timeline is constrained to 2025 only, not the full presidential term

These differences generally increase the likelihood compared to the base rate, particularly the low threshold for resolution and the fiscal nature of the IRA making it amenable to reconciliation.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Budget resolution with reconciliation instructions passed (2025-09-05)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If an amendment will pass, this procedural step is nearly certain
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.15) - Without intent to pass an amendment, this step is unlikely
- Likelihood ratio: ~6.3
- This strongly increases probability, as it formally initiates the reconciliation process

**Evidence 2: Republican senators from states with IRA investments urge "reform, not repeal" (2025-08-12)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - This is consistent with a modest amendment rather than full repeal
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This resistance would be stronger if no amendment were to pass
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75
- This slightly decreases probability, indicating internal party friction

**Evidence 3: House committee hearings on "Rolling Back the Green New Deal" (2025-07-22)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Such hearings typically precede legislative action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Hearings can be symbolic without resulting legislation
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
- This moderately increases probability, showing committee-level commitment

**Evidence 4: Industry lobbying to preserve IRA tax credits (2025-04-18)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - This could lead to a compromise amendment rather than full repeal
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Strong lobbying might prevent any amendment
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63
- This moderately decreases probability, showing significant opposition forces

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 65% (odds of 65:35 or 1.86:1), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on reconciliation instructions:**
- Prior odds: 1.86:1
- Likelihood ratio: 6.3
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 6.3 = 11.72:1
- Posterior probability: 11.72/(1+11.72) = 92.1%

This is a substantial increase, reflecting the critical importance of the reconciliation process being formally initiated.

**Update on industry lobbying:**
- Prior odds: 11.72:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 11.72 × 0.63 = 7.38:1
- Posterior probability: 7.38/(1+7.38) = 88.1%

**Update on Republican senator resistance:**
- Prior odds: 7.38:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.75
- Posterior odds: 7.38 × 0.75 = 5.54:1
- Posterior probability: 5.54/(1+5.54) = 84.7%

**Update on committee hearings:**
- Prior odds: 5.54:1
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 5.54 × 2.0 = 11.08:1
- Posterior probability: 11.08/(1+11.08) = 91.7%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately **92%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Overconfidence in reconciliation process**: While reconciliation instructions have been passed, the process could still break down due to:
   - Narrow Senate majority making every vote critical
   - Procedural complications with the Byrd Rule
   - Calendar constraints as 2025 ends

2. **Underestimating industry influence**: The economic impact of IRA investments may create stronger resistance than anticipated, especially if key senators from states with major investments become immovable.

3. **Potential for presidential veto**: If moderate amendments don't satisfy the administration's goals, a veto could occur, requiring a higher threshold to override.

4. **Time constraints**: With only about 3 months left in 2025, procedural delays could push legislation into 2026.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability downward somewhat. The time constraint is particularly concerning given today's date (October 9, 2025).

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of a bill amending the IRA's climate provisions becoming law in 2025 is high but not as high as my initial calculation suggested.

The reconciliation process is underway, which is the biggest hurdle, but time constraints and potential internal party disagreements could still derail or delay the legislation beyond 2025.

Adjusting for these factors, I revise my forecast to:

Final: 82%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is a newly elected, unified government (a "trifecta" controlling the White House, Senate, and House) attempting to pass major fiscal legislation via the budget reconciliation process in its first year. Historically, this is a very common and often successful strategy.

*   **Examples:** The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (GOP trifecta), the 2021 American Rescue Plan (Democratic trifecta), and the 2001/2003 Bush tax cuts (GOP trifecta) all used this path successfully.
*   **Failure Case:** The 2017 attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is the primary counterexample, where a trifecta failed to pass its signature legislative priority despite using reconciliation.

Given that passing a reconciliation bill is a top priority for any new trifecta, and success is common but not guaranteed, a reasonable base rate for a major fiscal bill becoming law under these conditions is approximately **75%**.

This corresponds to prior odds of 3 to 1 in favor of a bill passing.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The scenario assumes a Republican trifecta, mirroring the 2017 base case.
*   The legislative goal (amending the IRA) is a core campaign promise, similar to repealing the ACA.
*   The intended legislative vehicle is budget reconciliation, which bypasses the Senate filibuster.
*   The IRA's provisions are almost entirely fiscal (tax credits and spending), making them perfectly suited for the reconciliation process.

**Differences:**
*   **Nature of the Opposition:** The opposition to repealing the IRA is different from the ACA. Billions of dollars in IRA-spurred investments are located in Republican-held states, creating a powerful internal lobby of GOP members who want to protect local jobs and projects. This "facts on the ground" dynamic is a stronger internal counter-pressure than what existed for the ACA.
*   **Resolution Criteria:** The bar for this question is extremely low: "reduce the available funds for any climate program by any amount." The ACA repeal effort was a much larger and more complex undertaking. Here, a bill that makes only minor cuts or reforms, while preserving the vast majority of the IRA, would still resolve as "Yes." This makes a positive resolution far more likely than a full repeal scenario.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided timeline of events from 2025 acts as evidence to update the prior.

*   **Evidence of Intent (June-July):** The introduction of repeal bills and committee hearings confirms that amending the IRA is a high priority for the new majority. This evidence is expected if a bill is to pass (P(E|H) is high) but could also be political theater if it's not (P(E|~H) is moderate). This slightly increases the probability. **(Likelihood Ratio > 1)**
*   **Evidence of Internal Friction (April, August):** Lobbying from industry and a public statement from GOP senators urging "reform, not repeal" confirms the political cross-pressures. This evidence makes a *full repeal* less likely. However, by making a compromise *amendment* the most probable path forward, it actually increases the likelihood of this question resolving "Yes" due to the low resolution bar. A compromise bill is easier to pass than a maximalist one. **(Likelihood Ratio > 1 for this specific question)**
*   **Evidence of Procedural Action (September):** The passage of a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions is the most powerful piece of evidence. This is the formal legislative step that unlocks the filibuster-proof process. While not a guarantee of final passage (as seen in 2017), it is a necessary and critical step. The probability of seeing this step, given that a bill will ultimately pass, is very high (P(E|H) ≈ 1). The probability of seeing this step and the process still failing is low (P(E|~H) is low). **(Likelihood Ratio >> 1)**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior:** 75% (3 to 1 odds).
*   **Initial Evidence (Intent & Friction):** The evidence confirms the political landscape is ripe for a legislative battle, with the most likely outcome being a compromise amendment rather than a full repeal or no action. This nudges the probability up slightly, as a compromise is more passable than a maximalist bill. Let's adjust to ~80% (4 to 1 odds).
*   **Key Evidence (Reconciliation Instructions):** The passage of reconciliation instructions is a major procedural hurdle cleared. This is strong evidence that leadership believes they have a viable path to passing a bill. This significantly updates the probability upwards. Applying a likelihood ratio of ~2.5 (reflecting that this step makes passage much more likely but doesn't eliminate the risk of failure) to our 4:1 odds gives us new odds.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 4 × 2.5 = 10 to 1.
    *   Posterior Probability = 10 / (1 + 10) = ~91%.

This calculation suggests a high probability, reflecting the immense procedural momentum.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary reason this forecast might be wrong is a repeat of the 2017 ACA repeal failure. In a narrowly divided Senate (e.g., 51-49 or 50-50), a single senator can derail the entire process. The "reform, not repeal" caucus could fracture, with some members refusing to vote for a bill they deem too harsh, while hardliners refuse to vote for one they see as too weak. The House and Senate could pass different versions and fail to agree on a final bill.

The ~91% probability implies a ~9% chance of failure. This seems to be a reasonable estimate for the risk of legislative collapse due to the dynamics of a narrow majority, where any single senator has immense leverage. The low resolution bar makes a compromise easy to define, but it doesn't eliminate the political risk of the process breaking down entirely. The high 80s or low 90s seems like the correct range. I will adjust slightly downward to better account for the inherent chaos of the legislative process.

### Final Forecast
The combination of a unified government, a clear campaign promise, and the use of the powerful reconciliation process creates a strong presumption that a bill will be passed. The key evidence—the formal passage of reconciliation instructions—confirms this process is well underway. While internal party friction creates challenges, it also makes a compromise amendment the most likely outcome, and due to the question's low resolution bar, such a compromise would result in a "Yes." The main remaining risk is a legislative collapse due to narrow majorities, similar to the 2017 ACA repeal failure. Weighing the strong procedural momentum against this non-trivial risk leads to a high, but not certain, probability.

Final: 88%
