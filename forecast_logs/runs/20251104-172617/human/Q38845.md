### Reference class & base rates
-   **Primary Reference Class: 2022-2024 HPAI H5N1 Outbreak Annual Totals.** This is the most relevant class as it involves the same viral clade (2.3.4.4b) and current industry/regulatory conditions.
    -   **Base Rates:**
        -   2022: ~58.8 million birds
        -   2023: ~62.9 million birds
        -   2024: ~23.3 million birds (estimated from provided chart)
    -   **Reasoning:** This data reflects the "new normal" of an endemic HPAI virus in North American wild birds. The range is wide (23M to 63M), with a mean of ~48.3M and a median of 58.8M. This suggests a distribution with significant variance and right-skew (a few massive outbreaks dominate the total).
    -   **Limitations:** This is a very small sample (n=3). The lower 2024 number could represent successful adaptation or random chance, making a simple average potentially misleading.

-   **Secondary Reference Class: Major US HPAI Outbreaks.** The only comparable event was the 2014-2015 HPAI outbreak.
    -   **Base Rate:** ~50.5 million birds culled over the entire event.
    -   **Reasoning:** This provides another data point for a catastrophic, nationwide HPAI event. It suggests that totals in the tens of millions are characteristic of severe outbreaks.
    -   **Limitations:** The 2014-15 virus was eradicated from wild bird populations, whereas the current H5N1 clade is considered endemic, creating a constant re-introduction pressure that did not exist post-2015.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*As of 2025-11-04, the forecast horizon is <3 months. The last 6 months are most relevant.*

-   [2025-02-25] Report indicates over 157.77 million birds affected since Feb 2022. (↑) — This cumulative total, up from ~138.7M a week prior, confirms a massive surge of ~19M birds in early 2025, setting a high baseline of viral pressure for the year.
-   [2025-03-05] Report notes over 750,000 birds culled in California's San Joaquin Valley in Jan-Feb 2025. (↑) — Provides specific, regional confirmation of the severe start to the year in a key agricultural area.
-   [2025-07-07] CDC confirms H5 is widespread in wild birds, poultry, and dairy cows. (↑) — Highlights the persistence of the virus through the summer and the establishment of a novel mammalian reservoir, increasing overall environmental viral load.
-   [2025-07-20] California is declared HPAI-free. (↓) — Demonstrates that even after severe outbreaks, containment is possible and that a typical seasonal summer lull in cases occurred.
-   [2025-08-18] HPAI is detected again in a California poultry flock. (↑) — Underscores the fragility of "HPAI-free" status and the high likelihood of re-introduction from endemic wild bird populations as fall migration approaches.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Wild Bird Migration (Large):** The primary pathway for introducing the virus into new regions. The fall migration (September-December) and spring migration (March-May) are the highest risk periods for new farm infections.
-   **On-Farm Biosecurity (Large):** The single most critical factor in preventing an introduction from becoming a depopulation event. Failures at large facilities (e.g., egg-laying operations with millions of birds) are the primary driver of the overall total.
-   **Mammalian Reservoir in Cattle (Moderate, uncertain):** The 2024-2025 spread through dairy herds creates a new, year-round potential source for viral persistence and spillover back into poultry, potentially dampening seasonal lulls. The magnitude of this effect is not yet well understood.
-   **Poultry Farm Density (Moderate):** Geographic clustering of farms (e.g., in Iowa, Minnesota, California) facilitates lateral, farm-to-farm spread once the virus is introduced to a region, amplifying the impact of a single outbreak.
-   **Virus Evolution (Small-to-Moderate):** Any mutation that increases transmissibility among poultry or via environmental persistence could significantly increase the number of outbreaks.
-   **US Culling Policy (Large):** The USDA's policy of mandatory depopulation of affected and exposed flocks is the direct mechanism translating infections into the resolved number. This policy is stable and unlikely to change in 2025.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Established Mammalian Reservoir:** Unlike 2022-2024, the virus is now widespread in US dairy cattle. This creates a novel and significant reservoir that could alter transmission dynamics, potentially increasing risk outside of traditional migration seasons.
-   **Extremely High Viral Pressure Early in the Year:** The massive surge in cases in late 2024 and early 2025 (e.g., ~19 million birds in one week in Feb 2025) was more severe than the start of previous years, suggesting a very high environmental viral load entering the 2025 fall season.
-   **Accumulated Industry Experience:** The poultry industry has now had over three years of experience with this specific virus, leading to enhanced biosecurity protocols. However, the continued occurrence of large outbreaks shows these measures are not foolproof.
-   **No Vaccine Deployment:** Despite ongoing research and discussion, the US has not implemented a poultry vaccination strategy. The primary control method remains culling, meaning the fundamental response mechanism is unchanged from the base rate period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A log-normal distribution centered on the 2022-2024 median (~59 million), with significant variance to account for the 23M-63M range. This

To forecast the number of farmed birds that will be killed in the United States due to bird flu in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Primary Reference Class:** The annual totals of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks from 2022 to 2024.
  - **Base Rates:** 
    - 2022: ~58.8 million birds
    - 2023: ~62.9 million birds
    - 2024: ~23.3 million birds
  - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean is approximately 48.3 million, and the median is 58.8 million. The distribution is right-skewed with a significant variance due to the wide range (23M to 63M).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The ongoing presence of the H5N1 virus in wild birds and the consistent US policy of depopulation align with past years.
- **Differences:** 
  - The virus is now endemic in dairy cattle, potentially increasing transmission outside typical migration seasons.
  - The early 2025 surge in cases suggests a higher baseline viral pressure than in previous years.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **High Viral Pressure Early in 2025:** The surge of ~19 million birds culled in early 2025 increases the likelihood of a higher annual total.
- **Established Mammalian Reservoir:** This could lead to increased transmission, making higher outcomes more likely.
- **Industry Experience:** While biosecurity measures have improved, the continued outbreaks suggest these are not foolproof, maintaining the likelihood of significant depopulation events.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Log-normal distribution centered on the median of ~59 million with significant variance.
- **Update with Likelihoods:** The early 2025 surge and mammalian reservoir increase the likelihood of outcomes on the higher end of the distribution.
- **Posterior Shift:** The mean shifts upwards, and the variance increases slightly to account for the new evidence of higher viral pressure.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of an unexpected reduction in cases due to improved biosecurity or other factors.
- **Tail Risks:** The potential for a catastrophic outbreak or a novel intervention (e.g., vaccine deployment) could significantly alter outcomes.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with improved containment could result in lower numbers, but the evidence suggests this is less likely.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the number of farmed birds killed due to bird flu in 2025 are:

P10: 30 million  
P20: 40 million  
P40: 55 million  
P60: 65 million  
P80: 75 million  
P90: 85 million

# Forecasting the Number of Farmed Birds Killed Due to Bird Flu in the US in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the annual totals from the 2022-2024 HPAI H5N1 outbreak as my primary reference class:
- 2022: ~58.8 million birds
- 2023: ~62.9 million birds
- 2024: ~23.3 million birds

This gives a mean of 48.3 million and a median of 58.8 million birds. The distribution appears right-skewed with significant variance (standard deviation of ~21.8 million).

I'm selecting this reference class because:
1. It involves the same viral clade (2.3.4.4b) as the current situation
2. It reflects the "new normal" of endemic HPAI in North American wild birds
3. It captures the current regulatory framework of mandatory culling

The prior distribution is likely log-normal to account for the right skew, with most of the probability mass between 20-70 million birds, but with a long right tail allowing for more extreme outcomes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The same H5N1 viral clade remains endemic in wild bird populations
- The US maintains the same culling policy for affected and exposed flocks
- Similar poultry industry structure and farm density patterns
- Seasonal migration patterns of wild birds remain the primary introduction vector

**Key differences:**
- Established mammalian reservoir in dairy cattle (novel compared to 2022-2024)
- Extremely high viral pressure early in 2025 (~19 million birds in one week in February)
- The poultry industry now has 3+ years of experience with this virus, potentially improving biosecurity
- We're already in November 2025, with only ~2 months remaining in the year

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
1. The massive surge in early 2025 (~19M birds in one week in February) suggests 2025 started with much higher viral pressure than previous years. This strongly suggests 2025 will be on the higher end of the historical range. (Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes)

2. The establishment of a mammalian reservoir in dairy cattle creates a novel year-round source for viral persistence and spillback into poultry. This moderately increases the likelihood of sustained transmission outside migration seasons. (Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes)

3. The re-detection of HPAI in California in August 2025 after being declared HPAI-free in July demonstrates the fragility of containment and suggests high risk for the fall migration season. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring higher outcomes)

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
1. The fact that California was declared HPAI-free in July suggests effective containment is possible, even if temporary. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring lower outcomes)

2. With only ~2 months remaining in 2025, there's limited time for additional major outbreaks to accumulate. (Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring lower outcomes)

3. The industry's accumulated experience with this virus over 3+ years may have improved biosecurity practices. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 favoring lower outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 58.8 million birds (the median from 2022-2024), I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - Early 2025 surge:**
The massive surge in February 2025 (~19M birds in one week) strongly suggests 2025 will be a high-impact year. With a likelihood ratio of 3:1 favoring higher outcomes, this shifts my distribution upward.

Prior median: 58.8 million
Updated median: ~70 million

**Second update - Limited time remaining in 2025:**
With only ~2 months left in the year (as of November 4, 2025), there's limited time for additional major outbreaks. With a likelihood ratio of 2:1 favoring lower outcomes, this significantly pulls down my estimate.

Updated median: ~70 million → ~60 million

**Third update - Mammalian reservoir:**
The established reservoir in dairy cattle creates a novel transmission pathway. With a likelihood ratio of 2:1 favoring higher outcomes, this moderately increases my estimate.

Updated median: ~60 million → ~65 million

The posterior distribution is still log-normal but with:
- A higher mean than the prior (shifted upward by the early surge and mammalian reservoir)
- Reduced variance (we have more information about 2025 with only 2 months remaining)
- The right tail remains significant due to the possibility of major outbreaks during fall migration

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be underestimating the impact of the remaining fall migration period. November-December can see significant wild bird movement that could trigger large outbreaks.

2. I haven't fully accounted for the cumulative total so far in 2025. If we already have, say, 50+ million birds culled through October, then even modest additional outbreaks would push the total well above my median estimate.

3. I might be overestimating the effectiveness of industry biosecurity improvements. The continued occurrence of large outbreaks suggests these measures have limited effectiveness.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would place more weight on the early 2025 surge and predict a much higher total (80-100 million birds). This would be plausible if:
- The early surge was just the beginning of an exceptionally bad year
- The mammalian reservoir significantly amplifies transmission
- Fall migration triggers multiple large-scale outbreaks in densely populated poultry regions

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The limited time remaining in 2025 constrains how high the total can go, unless we see unprecedented outbreaks in the final months. Additionally, summer typically shows reduced transmission, suggesting the total accumulated through October may not be as high as the alternative forecast assumes.

**Adjustment:**
I'll widen my distribution to account for these considerations, particularly increasing my upper percentiles to reflect the possibility of major late-year outbreaks.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 45,000,000
P20: 52,000,000
P40: 62,000,000
P60: 70,000,000
P80: 85,000,000
P90: 95,000,000

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My primary base rate is the annual number of birds culled during the ongoing HPAI H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) outbreak in the United States. This is the most relevant reference class because it involves the same virus, the same regulatory environment (USDA culling policy), and the same industry structure.
-   **2022:** ~58.8 million birds
-   **2023:** ~62.9 million birds
-   **2024:** ~23.3 million birds (from provided chart, as of late 2024)

This small dataset (n=3) gives a median of 58.8 million and a mean of approximately 48.3 million. The wide range (23M to 63M) indicates high year-to-year volatility. The distribution is likely right-skewed, as the total is driven by a few catastrophic outbreaks at very large facilities. My prior distribution for a given year would therefore be a log-normal distribution centered around 50-60 million, with significant variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast is for the 2025 calendar year. The situation is similar to the 2022-2024 base period in that the virus remains endemic in wild birds, and the USDA's depopulation policy is unchanged. However, there are two critical differences for 2025:

1.  **Established Mammalian Reservoir:** Unlike in previous years, the virus became widespread in US dairy cattle herds in 2024-2025. This creates a novel, large, and potentially year-round reservoir for the virus, increasing the overall environmental viral load and creating new potential pathways for spillover to poultry. This is a significant factor pushing the forecast higher than the simple base rate.
2.  **Forecasting Horizon:** The forecast is being made on November 4, 2025. This means over 10 months of the year's data are already "in the books." The problem is less about forecasting a full year from scratch and more about estimating the year-to-date (YTD) total and then forecasting the final two high-risk months.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The research report provides crucial, albeit sparse, information about events within 2025.

-   **Evidence of a Severe Year (Strong Upward Signal):** The report notes a "massive surge" in early 2025, with reports of ~19 million birds affected in a single week in February. This implies that the total for just the first two months of 2025 was already substantial, likely in the 15-20 million range. This makes a low-end outcome for the year, similar to 2024 (~23M), extremely improbable.
-   **Evidence of Seasonal Pattern (Neutral Signal):** The report mentions a summer lull (California declared HPAI-free in July) followed by a re-emergence in August. This confirms that the typical seasonal pattern of the virus held, but it doesn't constrain the magnitude of the spring or fall peaks.
-   **Estimating Year-to-Date (YTD) Total:** Given the severe start and a typical seasonal pattern, it is reasonable to infer that the YTD total as of early November is already high. A severe spring migration period following the initial surge, a quiet summer, and the start of the fall migration could plausibly place the YTD total in the 40-50 million range.
-   **Forecasting the Remainder (Nov-Dec):** These are historically two of the highest-risk months due to wild bird migration. The presence of the cattle reservoir likely amplifies this risk. The number of birds culled in these final two months could range from a few million (if biosecurity holds) to over 40 million (if multiple large egg-laying facilities are affected).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My process is to update my initial prior based on the strong evidence from within 2025.

-   **Prior:** A log-normal distribution with a median around 59 million.
-   **Likelihood:** The evidence of a "massive surge" in early 2025 makes outcomes below 30 million highly inconsistent with the data. It strongly favors a final total in the range of the previous "bad" years (2022, 2023) or worse.
-   **Posterior:** My posterior distribution is effectively my estimate of the YTD total (~45 million) plus a distribution for the remaining two months. I model the remainder with a right-skewed distribution with a median of ~15 million. This leads to a final posterior distribution with a median around 60 million. The variance is still high due to the uncertainty of the fall peak, especially with the new cattle reservoir factor. The distribution is heavily skewed to the right.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider how this forecast could be wrong.

-   **Alternative Scenario (Lower):** My estimate of the YTD total could be too high. Perhaps the spring and early fall were much quieter than I inferred. If the YTD is only ~35M and the rest of the year is also quiet, the final total could be closer to 40M. My P10 is set to capture this possibility.
-   **Alternative Scenario (Higher):** This is the more significant risk. The cattle reservoir could be a true game-changer, leading to an unprecedented fall/winter outbreak season. A single outbreak at a massive egg-laying complex can involve 5-10 million birds. If two or three such facilities are hit in November/December, the annual total could easily exceed 100 million. My P90 of 90 million acknowledges this substantial tail risk, implying a 10% chance of an outcome that is significantly worse than any previous year in this outbreak.

My final distribution attempts to balance these risks, anchoring the median near previous severe years but widening the distribution (especially to the upside) to account for the high degree of uncertainty in the final two months of the year and the novel epidemiological situation.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 46,000,000
