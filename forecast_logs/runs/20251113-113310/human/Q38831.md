### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Sub-Saharan African Countries (1950-2023):** This broad class provides a long-term historical base rate. Using the Powell & Thyne coup dataset, there have been 214 coup attempts in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 106 succeeding. This yields an approximate annual probability of a successful coup per country-year of **~2.0%**. For the ~1.5 month period until 2026, this translates to a raw base rate of **~0.25%**. This class is broad but captures general regional political dynamics.
2.  **Personalist Autocracies with Long-Serving Leaders (>20 years):** This class is more specific to Cameroon's regime type. Such regimes are often brittle, with stability highly dependent on the leader. While they excel at coup-proofing, succession periods are moments of extreme vulnerability. The historical rate of irregular leadership turnover (including coups) in these specific contexts is significantly higher than the regional average, estimated at **4-6% annually**. This suggests a base rate of **~0.5% - 0.75%** for the forecast period.
3.  **African Countries in a Post-Election Period (<3 months after a contentious election):** This is the most specific and relevant reference class. Contentious elections, especially those extending the rule of an aging autocrat, are known coup triggers. Data is sparse for a precise rate, but qualitative evidence suggests this is a period of maximum risk. A plausible base rate for a coup in this window is likely an order of magnitude higher than the general rate, perhaps in the **10-15% annual range**, translating to **~1.2% - 1.8%** for the ~1.5 month period.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-29** Paul Biya is declared the winner of his eighth presidential term. **↑** — A highly contentious election outcome for a 92-year-old leader after 43 years in power is a classic catalyst for elite dissent and military intervention.
*   **2025-07-16** Biya announces his candidacy, reportedly causing friction within the ruling coalition. **↑** — This decision foreclosed any possibility of a managed succession, raising the stakes for competing factions who now see no peaceful path to power.
*   **2025-05-13** Speculation intensifies regarding Biya's health and capacity to govern. **↑** — Perceptions of a leader's weakness or incapacitation can embolden rivals and convince military actors that intervention is necessary to prevent a power vacuum or chaotic collapse.
*   **2025-03-24** Reports highlight a succession struggle between Biya's son, Franck Biya, and Secretary-General Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh. **↑** — Deep divisions among the ruling elite create competing power centers, one of which might seek military backing to secure its position.
*   **2024-05-25** The junta in Burkina Faso extends its rule by five years, citing security concerns. **↑** — This reinforces a regional norm where military takeovers are not short-term events, potentially making a coup seem like a more viable long-term strategy to plotters in Cameroon.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Elite Fragmentation over Succession:** The unresolved "post-Biya" question has created factions (e.g., around Franck Biya vs. Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh). A coup could be initiated by one faction to preempt another from seizing power upon Biya's death or incapacitation. **(Impact: Large)**
2.  **Presidential Incapacitation:** Biya's advanced age (92) and reported health issues create a high risk of a sudden power vacuum. A pre-emptive "stability" coup by the military to manage the transition is a plausible scenario. **(Impact: Large)**
3.  **Post-Election Crisis:** The recent, likely fraudulent, 2025 election provides a window of opportunity and a pretext for a coup. Widespread protests could give the military a justification to intervene to "restore order." **(Impact: Moderate)**
4.  **Regional Contagion:** The wave of successful coups in Francophone Africa (Niger, Gabon, Burkina Faso, etc.) provides a powerful demonstration effect, lowering the perceived barriers and risks for potential plotters in Cameroon's military. **(Impact: Moderate)**
5.  **Military Grievances:** The Cameroonian military is stretched thin fighting insurgencies in the Anglophone regions and the Far North (Boko Haram). Grievances over resources, strategy, or casualties could fuel dissent within the officer corps. **(Impact: Small to Moderate)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Longevity & Coup-Proofing:** Unlike a typical autocracy, Biya has had over four decades to perfect his coup-proofing strategy, creating redundant security services (e.g., the Presidential Guard) and placing loyalists from his own ethnic group in key command positions.
*   **Dual Internal Conflicts:** Cameroon's military is battle-hardened from fighting two separate, long-running insurgencies. This could either make them more capable of executing a coup or too distracted and divided to attempt one.
*   **Succession is the Central Crisis:** Unlike the Sahelian coups, which were largely justified by failures to contain jihadist insurgencies, the primary driver in Cameroon is the political crisis of succession, not state collapse. This may change the calculus and composition of potential plotters.
*   **Absence of Strong Opposition:** The political opposition is described as fragmented and severely limited. A coup is therefore less likely to be a response to a powerful popular movement and more likely to be an entirely elite-driven affair.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the reference class of personalist autocracies in a post-election crisis, suggesting a prior around **1.5%** for the ~1.5 month period (equivalent n ≈ 65). This acknowledges the elevated risk but inherent rarity.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The highly contentious re-election of a 92-year-old has created a focal point for elite discontent and a moment of maximum stress on the regime.
    *   **↑ (Large):** The clear and public fragmentation of the ruling elite over succession provides both motive and potential competing plotters, increasing the probability of action.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The regional "coup belt" provides a playbook and reduces the perceived international consequences for a successful takeover.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Four decades of systematic coup-proofing have created a formidable and complex security architecture designed to prevent exactly this scenario. Its effectiveness is the key uncertainty.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability up. The acute, recent stressors (election, succession infighting) likely outweigh the chronic, structural defenses (coup-proofing). The posterior should be significantly higher than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Unusual movements or deployments of the Presidential Guard (BIR) in the capital, Yaoundé.
    *   Arrest or dismissal of a high-ranking military official or cabinet member (especially Ngoh Ngoh).
    *   President Biya fails to appear at a scheduled key state event.
    *   State television (CRTV) broadcasting is interrupted or begins showing patriotic music/symbols.
    *   Reports of internet or mobile network disruptions in the capital.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A public, joint appearance by Biya, his son, and key military commanders pledging loyalty.
    *   Successful suppression of any post-election protests with no signs of military insubordination.
    *   France issues an unusually strong and explicit statement of support for Biya's new term.
    *   Key elite rivals (e.g., Ngoh Ngoh) are successfully purged without military pushback.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Black Box:** The inner workings of the Biya regime are notoriously opaque. Intelligence on military loyalty and elite pacts is scarce and unreliable.
*   **Coup-Proofing Uncertainty:** The effectiveness of Biya's coup-proofing is untested against a severe internal shock like the current succession crisis. It may be a paper tiger or an iron cage.
*   **Palace Coup vs. Military Coup:** A "palace coup" where one faction uses a small, loyalist armed unit to seize control might be less visible initially than a full-scale military takeover, but would still meet the resolution criteria.
*   **The 7-Day Rule:** An initial attempt could succeed for a few days before being reversed by a loyalist counter-coup. The 7-day threshold for success is a critical detail.
*   **Health as a Wildcard:** A sudden natural death of President Biya could trigger a chaotic scramble for power that might look like a coup but could resolve differently depending on constitutional processes versus armed seizure.

**Final Research Summary:** Cameroon is at its highest risk for a coup in decades. The acute stress of a contentious election and an unresolved succession struggle for a 92-year-old president is colliding with a regime built on decades of coup-proofing, making the outcome highly uncertain but tilted towards instability.

To forecast the probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** We start with the reference class of personalist autocracies with long-serving leaders, which suggests a base rate of **4-6% annually** for irregular leadership turnover, including coups. Given the specific context of Cameroon, we will use a base rate of **5% annually**. For the period from now until 2026 (approximately 1.5 months), this translates to a base rate of approximately **0.625%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Cameroon fits the profile of a personalist autocracy with a long-serving leader, Paul Biya, who has been in power for over four decades. The country is experiencing a contentious post-election period, which is a known trigger for coups.
- **Differences:** Unlike some other countries in the region, Cameroon has a highly developed coup-proofing strategy, which may reduce the likelihood of a successful coup. However, the current succession crisis and elite fragmentation increase the risk.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Contentious Election Outcome:** The re-election of a 92-year-old leader in a contentious election increases the likelihood of a coup. Likelihood ratio: **↑ Large**.
- **Elite Fragmentation:** The succession struggle between Franck Biya and Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh increases the probability of a coup. Likelihood ratio: **↑ Large**.
- **Regional Coup Contagion:** Recent coups in Francophone Africa provide a demonstration effect, increasing the likelihood of a coup. Likelihood ratio: **↑ Moderate**.
- **Coup-Proofing:** Biya's long-standing coup-proofing measures decrease the likelihood of a successful coup. Likelihood ratio: **↓ Moderate**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 0.625% translates to odds of approximately 1:159.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1, suggesting an increase in probability.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:** 
  - Let's assume the combined likelihood ratio from the evidence is around 3 (a rough estimate considering the large and moderate impacts).
  - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:159 × 3 = 3:159 ≈ 1:53.
- **Posterior Probability:** 
  - Posterior probability = 1 / (1 + 53) ≈ 1.85%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the uncertainty in the effectiveness of coup-proofing and the opacity of the regime.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden health crisis for Biya could trigger unexpected dynamics.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A peaceful transition or managed succession could occur, reducing the likelihood of a coup.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight upward adjustment to account for the high uncertainty and potential for rapid change is warranted.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all factors, the final probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026 is adjusted to reflect the heightened risk and uncertainty.

Final: 2%

# Will there be a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a successful coup in Cameroon in the remaining ~1.5 months of 2025 (from November 13 to December 31, 2025).

The most relevant reference class is **personalist autocracies in a post-election crisis period**, which suggests a base rate of approximately **1.5%** for the ~1.5 month period. This is derived from:

- The general annual coup probability in Sub-Saharan Africa (~2.0%)
- Adjusted upward for personalist regimes with long-serving leaders (4-6% annually)
- Further adjusted for the post-election crisis period (10-15% annually)
- Then scaled down to the ~1.5 month timeframe remaining in 2025

This prior acknowledges both the rarity of coups in general and the specific heightened risk factors present in Cameroon's current situation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to the base case:**
- Cameroon fits the profile of a personalist autocracy with a long-serving leader
- The country has just experienced a contentious election (October 29, 2025)
- There are internal security challenges (insurgencies in multiple regions)
- The country is in a region that has experienced recent coups

**Key differences:**
- **Extreme longevity of rule**: Paul Biya has been in power for 43 years (since 1982), which is exceptional even among long-serving autocrats. This has allowed him to perfect coup-proofing strategies over decades.
- **Advanced age**: At 92, Biya's age creates unique succession pressures and uncertainty.
- **Dual internal conflicts**: The military is engaged in two separate insurgencies, which could either distract from coup planning or provide motivation for one.
- **Regional contagion**: The recent wave of coups in neighboring Francophone countries provides a powerful demonstration effect.

These differences suggest the base rate should be adjusted upward, as the succession crisis combined with the post-election period creates an unusually high-risk environment.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Contentious re-election of 92-year-old Biya (October 29, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - A successful coup would very likely be preceded by a contested election
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Contested elections often occur without leading to coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This significantly increases the probability of a coup

**Evidence 2: Elite fragmentation over succession (Franck Biya vs. Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Elite fragmentation is a common precursor to coups
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Elite conflicts can exist without resulting in coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.67
- This substantially increases the probability of a coup

**Evidence 3: Regional coup contagion in Francophone Africa**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Regional demonstration effects often precede coups
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many countries resist regional coup trends
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This moderately increases the probability of a coup

**Evidence 4: Decades of systematic coup-proofing by Biya**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Successful coups rarely occur in regimes with extensive coup-proofing
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Extensive coup-proofing often prevents coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This substantially decreases the probability of a coup

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 1.5% (odds of 1:66), let's update based on the evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (Contentious re-election):**
- Prior odds: 1:66 (0.015)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 2.25:66 = 1:29.33
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+29.33) ≈ 0.033 or 3.3%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Elite fragmentation):**
- Prior odds: 1:29.33
- Likelihood ratio: 2.67
- Posterior odds: 2.67:29.33 = 1:10.99
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+10.99) ≈ 0.083 or 8.3%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Regional contagion):**
- Prior odds: 1:10.99
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 1.75:10.99 = 1:6.28
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+6.28) ≈ 0.137 or 13.7%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Coup-proofing):**
- Prior odds: 1:6.28
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25:6.28 = 1:25.12
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+25.12) ≈ 0.038 or 3.8%

After incorporating all evidence, our posterior probability is approximately 3.8%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overestimating the effectiveness of Biya's coup-proofing measures, which have never been tested in a severe succession crisis.
- The opacity of Cameroon's regime means we have limited visibility into military loyalty and elite dynamics.
- The research report may overstate the level of elite fragmentation if public reports exaggerate internal divisions.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A palace coup rather than a military coup could occur, where one faction uses a small armed unit to seize control.
- Biya could die naturally in the next 1.5 months, triggering a constitutional succession that prevents a coup.
- International actors (particularly France) might intervene diplomatically to stabilize the situation.

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might put the probability at 1% or lower, arguing that:
- Biya's coup-proofing is extremely effective
- The military is too divided to coordinate a coup
- The international community would strongly oppose a coup

Rebuttal: While these factors are relevant, they don't fully account for the acute crisis created by the contested election and succession struggle, nor the regional demonstration effect.

**Adjustments:**
Given the limited time window (only 1.5 months) and the uncertainty about internal dynamics, I should slightly reduce my estimate from 3.8% to around 3.5%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for coups in personalist autocracies during post-election periods, adjusting for Cameroon's specific circumstances, and updating based on the available evidence, I forecast a 3.5% probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026.

Final: 3.5%

Here is a thinking process that leads to the final probability estimate:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Identify the Event:** A successful coup in Cameroon between now (November 13, 2025) and January 1, 2026. This is a very short window of about 1.5 months.
- **Select a Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is not just "Sub-Saharan African countries" (too broad) or even "personalist autocracies" (better, but still broad). The most specific and appropriate reference class is **"personalist autocracies with extremely long-serving, elderly leaders in the immediate aftermath (<3 months) of a contentious election."**
- **Justify and Quantify:** This period is known to be one of maximum stress and vulnerability for such regimes. The research report suggests a plausible annual coup rate for this class is 10-15%. Given the extreme factors in Cameroon (leader is 92, succession is publicly contested), I will use the higher end of this range, 15%, as my starting point for the annual rate.
- **Calculate the Prior for the Period:** The forecast period is ~1.5 months, or roughly 0.125 years.
  - Prior Probability = 1 - (1 - Annual Rate)^(Period in Years)
  - Prior Probability = 1 - (1 - 0.15)^0.125 ≈ 1 - 0.979 = 0.021
- **Initial Prior:** My initial prior probability is **2.1%**. This represents the baseline risk for a country fitting this specific high-risk profile during this short window. In odds form, this is 0.021 / 0.979 ≈ 1-to-47 odds.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Cameroon perfectly fits the reference class profile: a long-serving autocrat (Biya), a recent contentious election extending his rule, and regional instability providing a "demonstration effect" for coups.
- **Differences:**
    - **Factor Decreasing Risk:** Cameroon is an extreme outlier in terms of regime longevity (43 years). This implies an exceptionally robust and time-tested **coup-proofing strategy**. This makes it more resilient than the average country in the reference class.
    - **Factor Increasing Risk:** Biya's extreme age (92) and reported frailty make the succession crisis not a theoretical future problem, but an immediate, acute one. The public infighting among elites (Franck Biya vs. Ngoh Ngoh) is a clear symptom of this acute crisis. This makes Cameroon *more* volatile than the average country in the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence relative to the 2.1% prior.

- **Evidence 1: Extreme & Proven Coup-Proofing.**
  - P(E | ~H): Very high. The reason a coup *wouldn't* happen is precisely because this system works.
  - P(E | H): Low. If a coup happens, it means this system failed.
  - **Likelihood Ratio (LR): << 1.** This is strong evidence that pushes the probability down. It's the single best argument against a coup.

- **Evidence 2: Acute Succession Crisis & Elite Fragmentation.**
  - P(E | H): Very high. A coup is a likely outcome of a succession struggle where one faction uses the military to gain an advantage.
  - P(E | ~H): Moderate. Elites can fight for position without resorting to a coup, but the risk is elevated.
  - **Likelihood Ratio (LR): >> 1.** This is strong evidence that pushes the probability up, suggesting the current moment is especially dangerous.

- **Evidence 3: Biya's Mortality Risk.**
  - This is a separate causal pathway. The annual mortality rate for a 92-year-old male is ~20%. For a 1.5-month period, the probability of Biya dying from natural causes is roughly 2.5% (20% / 8).
  - If he dies, a chaotic power grab that meets the coup definition (e.g., military seizes control, bypassing constitutional succession) is highly plausible. Let's estimate the probability of a coup *conditional on his death* is high, say 50%.
  - This pathway alone contributes an additional `P(Coup | Death) * P(Death) = 0.50 * 0.025 = 1.25%` to the total probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a two-step update. First, I'll adjust the prior for a coup happening while Biya is alive, then I'll add the risk from the mortality pathway.

1.  **Adjusting the "Coup while Alive" Probability:**
    - Start with the prior of 2.1%.
    - The two key factors are the coup-proofing (pushes down) and the acute succession crisis (pushes up). The research report's tone ("highest risk in decades," "tilted towards instability") suggests the acute crisis factors currently outweigh the chronic stability factors.
    - I'll estimate that the net effect of these competing forces is to increase the probability from the base rate. The acute crisis seems more potent than the historical defenses it is testing. Let's apply a net likelihood ratio of 1.5 to our prior odds.
    - Prior Odds ≈ 0.021.
    - Posterior Odds (Coup while Alive) = 0.021 * 1.5 = 0.0315.
    - Posterior Probability (Coup while Alive) = 0.0315 / 1.0315 ≈ **3.05%**.

2.  **Combining the Pathways:**
    - The two main scenarios are mutually exclusive: either a coup happens while Biya is alive, or his death triggers a coup.
    - P(Total Coup) ≈ P(Coup | Biya Alive) * P(Biya Alive) + P(Coup | Biya Dies) * P(Biya Dies)
    - P(Total Coup) ≈ (3.05%) * (97.5%) + (50%) * (2.5%)
    - P(Total Coup) ≈ 2.97% + 1.25%
    - P(Total Coup) ≈ **4.22%**

This calculation provides a posterior probability of around 4.2%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Is this too high?** A 4% chance of a coup in the next 48 days is an annualized rate of over 35%. This is extremely high and implies a state of severe crisis. However, the evidence (92-year-old autocrat, post-election turmoil, public succession battle) supports this being an exceptionally rare and dangerous moment. The Biya regime has survived everything for 43 years; its resilience should not be underestimated. Perhaps the coup-proofing is more effective than I credited.
- **Is this too low?** The regime could be a hollowed-out shell. The loyalty of the security forces might evaporate the moment Biya is perceived as truly incapacitated. The public elite infighting could be the tip of the iceberg, with serious plotting already underway. My estimate of a 50% chance of a coup upon his death might even be too low.
- **Adjustment:** The 4.22% figure feels about right, balancing the immense historical stability against the unprecedented acute pressures. It correctly identifies that the situation is highly volatile. I will round down slightly to 4% to account for the deep uncertainty and the regime's proven history of survival.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability of a coup in Cameroon before 2026 is low in absolute terms but significantly elevated given the current circumstances. The base rate for a country in this specific situation is already high (a ~2.1% chance in the next 1.5 months). This is pushed upwards by the acute succession crisis and the significant, independent risk of President Biya's natural death (~2.5% chance) triggering a power grab. These upward pressures are counteracted, but not completely negated, by the regime's four decades of proven coup-proofing. The net result is a situation of high tension where a coup is a very plausible outcome. My final estimate combines the probability of a coup during Biya's life with the probability of one triggered by his death.

Final: 4%
