### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Nations in high-intensity, protracted (>2 years) attrition warfare lowering conscription age.** Historically, nations facing existential threats and severe manpower depletion eventually lower the age of service. Examples include Germany and Japan in the final stages of WWII, or Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. The base rate for this action *at some point* during such a conflict is high, perhaps **60-70%**. However, this is often a "last resort" measure taken after several years of war.
2.  **Modern democracies making deeply unpopular, politically risky wartime policy changes.** Lowering the conscription age is politically toxic, especially in a country with a severe demographic deficit. It risks alienating the population and undermining national unity. The base rate for a democratically-accountable leader taking such a step, when other options (even if less effective) exist, is significantly lower. This reference class suggests a base rate of **20-30%**.
3.  **Countries that have recently (within 1-2 years) already made a significant mobilization policy change.** Ukraine lowered the age from 27 to 25 in April 2024. Governments typically allow time to assess the impact of a major policy before enacting another, more drastic one in the same domain. The base rate for a second, more controversial change in such a short period is low, likely **15-25%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-22** A new Russian offensive in the Sumy region intensifies, stretching Ukrainian reserves thin and leading to public calls from military commanders for more troops. — ↑ — Highlights the acute and worsening manpower crisis, making drastic measures more likely.
*   **2025-10-15** A draft law is registered in the Verkhovna Rada by a group of opposition MPs to further lower the mobilization age to 23, but it is not added to the parliamentary agenda. — ↑/↓ — Shows the topic is being actively considered (↑), but the lack of immediate traction from the presidential party signals continued high-level resistance (↓).
*   **2025-09-28** President Zelenskyy, in an interview with The Economist, reiterates that the focus is on "technology, not numbers" and maximizing the effectiveness of current troops through better equipment and training. — ↓ — A clear public signal from the ultimate decision-maker against lowering the age, framing the solution in alternative terms.
*   **2025-09-05** Ukraine's Ministry of Defence reports that the recruitment drive targeting Ukrainian men abroad has yielded fewer than 15,000 returnees, falling far short of goals. — ↑ — The failure of a key alternative manpower strategy increases the pressure to consider more controversial domestic options.
*   **2025-08-15** A poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) shows 85% of Ukrainians oppose lowering the mobilization age below 25, with the highest opposition among parents of young men. — ↓ — Reinforces the immense political cost and public backlash the government would face, making the move extremely difficult.
*   **2025-07-20** General Syrskyi states that the manpower situation is "tense but manageable" following the full absorption of the cohort mobilized after the age was lowered to 25. — ↓ — Suggests the military leadership, while concerned, does not yet see the situation as catastrophic enough to force the President's hand on a politically toxic issue.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Battlefield Attrition & Russian Offensives (Large ↑):** A sudden, large-scale Russian breakthrough or a catastrophic loss of Ukrainian troops is the most powerful driver. It could override all other political considerations and force the government's hand as a matter of national survival.
2.  **Domestic Political Viability (Large ↓):** The policy is overwhelmingly unpopular. President Zelenskyy's legitimacy, already debated due to postponed elections, could be severely damaged. The risk of social unrest is a powerful deterrent.
3.  **Demographic Concerns (Large ↓):** Ukraine is acutely aware of its post-Soviet demographic "hollow." Sacrificing the small cohort of men in their early 20s is seen as jeopardizing the nation's long-term future, a cost many leaders are unwilling to pay.
4.  **Effectiveness of Alternatives (Moderate ↓):** The success or failure of other manpower initiatives—recruiting prisoners, enticing expatriates to return, mobilizing more women for non-combat roles, substituting soldiers with drones—directly impacts the perceived necessity of lowering the age. So far, these have had limited success, which keeps the pressure on.
5.  **Western Pressure & Aid (Moderate ↑):** While the US and allies want Ukraine to solve its manpower issues, they are unlikely to make lowering the age a hard condition for aid, recognizing the risk of destabilizing the government. The pressure is more of a persistent nudge than a direct command.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Demographic Trough:** Unlike historical examples like WWI Germany, Ukraine's cohort of 18-25 year-olds is exceptionally small due to the birth rate collapse in the 1990s, making the long-term cost of their loss uniquely severe.
*   **Democratic Accountability:** Even under martial law, the Ukrainian government is sensitive to public opinion in a way that autocratic regimes in the reference class (e.g., Iran) were not. Zelenskyy's political capital is a finite and crucial resource.
*   **Technological Substitution Potential:** The unprecedented role of FPV drones, AI-powered targeting, and other technologies offers a partial, albeit incomplete, substitute for infantry that was unavailable in previous attrition wars.
*   **Recency of Prior Change:** The age was just lowered from 27 to 25 in April 2024. The political and logistical capital for that change has been spent, and there is institutional inertia against another immediate, more controversial revision.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, blending the high need (Ref Class 1) with the high political cost (Ref Classes 2 & 3), would be around **35%** with an equivalent n of 12 (moderately strong conviction that this is a difficult but not impossible step).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Overwhelming and persistent public opposition makes the political cost almost prohibitive for a government concerned with legitimacy.
    *   (↓ Moderate) President Zelenskyy's consistent public rhetoric against the measure signals a lack of political will at the highest level.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The acute, ongoing manpower crisis and failure of alternative recruitment strategies create a powerful, unresolved need.
    *   (↓ Small) The very short time remaining before the 2026 deadline makes passing such a contentious law logistically and politically challenging.
    *   (↑ Small) Continued, but not decisive, pressure from Western partners keeps the option on the table.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests that while the *need* for more soldiers is high, the *political will* to enact this specific, toxic policy is very low. The posterior should move down significantly from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A sudden, major Russian breakthrough on a key front (e.g., towards Kharkiv or Kyiv).
    *   Zelenskyy or his chief of staff (Yermak) publicly floating the idea as a "difficult but necessary" step.
    *   A key US official (e.g., Secretary of State/Defense) explicitly linking a major aid package to Ukraine addressing its manpower shortfall via mobilization changes.
    *   The Verkhovna Rada fast-tracking a draft law on mobilization age.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A major new Western arms package focused on force-multiplying technologies (e.g., advanced drones, robotic systems).
    *   Zelenskyy announcing a different major initiative to solve manpower (e.g., a new foreign legion, mandatory non-combat service for certain groups).
    *   A battlefield stabilization or successful Ukrainian defensive operation that eases immediate pressure.
    *   The question of Zelenskyy's legitimacy and the need for post-war elections becoming a dominant domestic political issue, making him even more risk-averse.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Event:** A sudden collapse of a section of the front line could render all political calculations moot and force emergency measures within weeks.
*   **Information Warfare:** Russia may amplify reports of Ukrainian manpower crises to sow panic, while Ukraine may downplay them to maintain morale. Official numbers are unreliable.
*   **Palace Intrigue:** The decision could be driven by internal power struggles between the President's office and the military leadership that are not visible to the public.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The law could be passed in late December 2025 but with an effective date in early 2026. The resolution criteria ("implemented into law") suggests passage is sufficient, but this could be a point of contention.
*   **Ceasefire Possibility:** A sudden, unexpected ceasefire before the deadline, however unlikely, would resolve the question to "No" per the criteria.

**Final Research Summary:**
Ukraine's severe manpower shortage creates a logical case for lowering the mobilization age, but the immense domestic political toxicity and catastrophic demographic implications make it a measure of last resort. Given the short timeframe and President Zelenskyy's clear reluctance, it is unlikely to be implemented before 2026 unless forced by a dramatic battlefield collapse.

To forecast the probability of Ukraine reducing the minimum age for compulsory military service before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1:** Nations in high-intensity, protracted warfare often lower conscription age as a last resort. Base rate: 60-70%.
- **Reference Class 2:** Modern democracies making politically risky wartime changes have a lower base rate: 20-30%.
- **Reference Class 3:** Countries that recently changed mobilization policy have a base rate: 15-25%.

Given Ukraine's current situation, a blended base rate considering the high need but also the political and demographic costs is around **35%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Ukraine is in a protracted conflict with significant manpower needs, similar to historical cases where conscription age was lowered.
- **Differences:** Ukraine faces extreme demographic challenges and political risks, making such a decision more costly and less likely compared to historical autocratic regimes.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Public Opposition (↓ Large):** 85% opposition to lowering the age makes it politically costly. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **Zelenskyy's Stance (↓ Moderate):** Consistent public rhetoric against lowering the age. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Manpower Crisis (↑ Moderate):** Ongoing crisis and failure of alternatives increase pressure. Likelihood ratio greater than 1.
- **Western Pressure (↑ Small):** Continued but non-decisive pressure from allies. Likelihood ratio slightly greater than 1.
- **Short Timeframe (↓ Small):** Limited time to enact such a change. Likelihood ratio less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 35% probability translates to odds of 0.54 (35/65).
- **Evidence Impact:** The strong public opposition and Zelenskyy's stance significantly decrease the odds, while the manpower crisis slightly increases them.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:** 
  - Adjusted odds considering evidence: approximately 0.3 (reflecting a significant decrease due to political and public opposition).
  - Posterior Probability: 0.3 / (1 + 0.3) ≈ 23%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden military crisis forcing a change.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A sudden Russian breakthrough or a shift in Western aid conditions could increase the likelihood.
- **Rebuttals:** The political and demographic costs remain significant deterrents.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering all evidence and potential scenarios, the probability of Ukraine reducing the minimum age for compulsory military service before 2026 is **23%**.

Final: 23%

# Will Ukraine reduce the minimum age for compulsory military service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I need to identify an appropriate base rate for this event. There are several relevant reference classes:

1. **Countries in protracted, high-intensity warfare lowering conscription age**: When facing existential threats and manpower shortages, countries often eventually lower conscription ages. Historical examples include Germany and Soviet Union in WWII, Iran during the Iran-Iraq War. Base rate: ~60-70% over the full course of such conflicts.

2. **Democratic countries making deeply unpopular wartime policy changes**: Lowering conscription age is politically toxic, especially in a democracy with demographic challenges. Base rate: ~20-30%.

3. **Countries that recently made a significant mobilization policy change**: Ukraine already lowered the age from 27 to 25 in April 2024. Governments typically allow time to assess impact before making another change in the same domain. Base rate: ~15-25%.

4. **Time constraint**: We're looking at implementation before January 1, 2026 - less than 2 months from now (November 5, 2025). This significantly reduces probability.

Considering these factors, I'll use a prior of **25%** - acknowledging the severe pressure Ukraine faces but also the political challenges and very short timeframe remaining.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Ukraine is in an existential war with severe manpower shortages
- Western allies are pressuring Ukraine to address manpower issues
- The military situation continues to be challenging

**Key differences**:
- The timeframe is extremely short (less than 2 months remaining)
- Ukraine already lowered the age from 27 to 25 in April 2024
- Ukraine faces a unique demographic crisis with a small cohort of young men
- President Zelensky has repeatedly emphasized technology over manpower
- Public opposition is extremely high (85% against according to KIIS polling)
- Ukraine maintains democratic accountability despite martial law

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the historical base rate of countries eventually lowering conscription age during protracted conflicts.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence increasing probability**:
1. **Acute manpower shortage**: Ukraine continues to face severe troop shortages, with alternative recruitment strategies (targeting expatriates) falling short.
   - P(E|H) = 0.9 (Very likely to see manpower shortages if age will be lowered)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.7 (Still likely to see shortages even if age won't be lowered)
   - LR = 1.29 (Modest increase)

2. **Western pressure**: US officials including future National Security Advisor Mike Waltz have explicitly supported lowering the age to 18.
   - P(E|H) = 0.8 (Likely to see Western pressure if age will be lowered)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.5 (Might still see pressure even if age won't be lowered)
   - LR = 1.6 (Moderate increase)

**Evidence decreasing probability**:
1. **President Zelensky's consistent public opposition**: He has repeatedly emphasized technology over numbers and directly opposed lowering the age.
   - P(E|H) = 0.2 (Unlikely to see such opposition if age will be lowered)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.8 (Very likely to see opposition if age won't be lowered)
   - LR = 0.25 (Strong decrease)

2. **Overwhelming public opposition**: 85% of Ukrainians oppose lowering the age below 25.
   - P(E|H) = 0.3 (Somewhat unlikely to see such opposition if age will be lowered)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.7 (Likely to see opposition if age won't be lowered)
   - LR = 0.43 (Significant decrease)

3. **Very short timeframe**: Less than 2 months remain before 2026.
   - P(E|H) = 0.2 (Unlikely to see such a short timeframe if age will be lowered)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.8 (Likely to see this constraint if age won't be lowered)
   - LR = 0.25 (Strong decrease)

4. **Recent mobilization change**: Ukraine just lowered the age from 27 to 25 in April 2024.
   - P(E|H) = 0.3 (Somewhat unlikely to see recent change if another is coming)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.7 (Likely to see this if no further change is coming)
   - LR = 0.43 (Significant decrease)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 25:75 (0.25/(1-0.25) = 1/3)

Updating with evidence:
- Manpower shortage: 1/3 × 1.29 = 0.43
- Western pressure: 0.43 × 1.6 = 0.69
- Zelensky's opposition: 0.69 × 0.25 = 0.17
- Public opposition: 0.17 × 0.43 = 0.07
- Short timeframe: 0.07 × 0.25 = 0.018
- Recent mobilization change: 0.018 × 0.43 = 0.008

Converting back to probability: 0.008/(1+0.008) = 0.008 or approximately 0.8%

This seems too low given the complexity and uncertainty. Let me reconsider with a more holistic approach.

The strongest factors are:
1. The extremely short timeframe (less than 2 months)
2. Zelensky's consistent opposition
3. The recent mobilization change already made

Even with severe battlefield pressure, passing and implementing such a controversial law in less than 2 months seems highly unlikely. A more reasonable posterior is around 10-15%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the severity of Ukraine's manpower crisis
- A catastrophic battlefield development could force emergency measures
- Western aid could be explicitly conditioned on this specific policy
- The law could be passed quickly under martial law if political will exists

**Alternative scenarios**:
- Ukraine could pass the law in late December 2025 with implementation in early 2026
- A compromise measure could be introduced (e.g., voluntary service at 18, mandatory at 23)
- A sudden ceasefire could make the question moot

**Best alternative forecast**: 
A reasonable alternative would be 20-25%, arguing that Ukraine's desperate situation will force this action despite political costs. However, this doesn't adequately account for the extremely short timeframe and Zelensky's consistent opposition.

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 12%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the severe manpower shortages and Western pressure, there is some possibility Ukraine will lower the conscription age. However, this is strongly counterbalanced by President Zelensky's consistent opposition, overwhelming public disapproval, the extremely short timeframe remaining before 2026, and the fact that Ukraine already lowered the age from 27 to 25 in April 2024.

The most likely scenario is that Ukraine will continue to resist this measure in the near term, focusing instead on technological solutions and other recruitment strategies. A catastrophic battlefield development could change this calculation, but absent such a black swan event, implementation before January 1, 2026 is highly unlikely.

Final: 12%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will blend three reference classes:

1.  **Nations in high-intensity, protracted attrition warfare:** Historically, nations facing existential threats and severe manpower depletion often lower their conscription age as a "last resort." The base rate for this action *at some point* during such a conflict is high, perhaps 60-70%. Ukraine is clearly in this situation.
2.  **Modern democracies making deeply unpopular wartime policy changes:** Lowering the conscription age is politically toxic, especially in a country with a severe demographic deficit. The research report notes 85% public opposition. The base rate for a democratically-accountable leader taking such a step, when other options exist, is significantly lower, perhaps 20-30%.
3.  **Countries that recently made a similar policy change:** Ukraine lowered the mobilization age from 27 to 25 in April 2024. Governments typically allow time to assess the impact of a major policy before enacting another, more drastic one. The base rate for a second, more controversial change in the same domain within less than two years is low, likely 15-25%.

Blending these conflicting factors—high need, low political feasibility, and recent policy change—suggests a starting point that is neither very high nor very low. A synthesized prior of **35%** seems appropriate. This acknowledges the severe pressure for the change but also accounts for the immense political and institutional friction against it. In odds form, this is 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.54.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation in Ukraine has unique features that distinguish it from the general reference class of "nations at war":

*   **Similarities:** Ukraine is in an existential war of attrition against a larger foe and is experiencing a severe manpower crisis, which is the classic trigger for such policy changes.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Extreme Demographics:** Ukraine's cohort of men aged 18-25 is exceptionally small due to the post-Soviet birth rate collapse. Mobilizing them carries a uniquely severe long-term cost for the nation's future, making leaders far more hesitant.
    *   **Democratic Accountability:** Despite martial law, the government remains sensitive to public opinion. President Zelenskyy's legitimacy is a critical asset, and enacting a policy opposed by 85% of the population poses a significant risk of domestic instability.
    *   **Technological Alternatives:** The unprecedented role of drones and other technologies provides a partial, though incomplete, substitute for infantry, offering an alternative path that was unavailable in most historical conflicts.
    *   **Short Timeline:** The forecast is being made on November 5, 2025, with a resolution deadline of January 1, 2026. This leaves less than two months to pass and implement an extremely contentious law.

These differences, particularly the demographic and political costs, suggest that the bar for Ukraine to take this step is significantly higher than for the historical average.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report, considering the short timeframe.

*   **Evidence Increasing Probability (↑):**
    *   **New Russian Offensive & Manpower Need (Oct 2025):** A new offensive in Sumy and public calls from commanders for more troops directly highlight the acute and worsening manpower crisis. This is the primary driver that could force the government's hand. The failure of alternative recruitment strategies (e.g., enticing men from abroad) further amplifies this pressure. This evidence is significantly more likely if Ukraine is being forced to consider this policy (P(E|H) > P(E|~H)).

*   **Evidence Decreasing Probability (↓):**
    *   **Zelenskyy's Public Stance (Sep 2025):** The President's explicit statement prioritizing "technology, not numbers" is a strong signal against the policy. It is highly unlikely a leader would publicly argue against a policy he intends to implement just weeks later, unless it is deliberate misdirection. This is much more likely if he does *not* intend to lower the age (P(E|~H) >> P(E|H)).
    *   **Overwhelming Public Opposition (Aug 2025):** The 85% opposition rate makes the political cost of this policy almost prohibitive, representing a massive deterrent for the government.
    *   **Lack of Parliamentary Traction (Oct 2025):** An opposition draft law to lower the age was not even added to the agenda. This signals a lack of will from the ruling party to engage with the topic.
    *   **Short Timeframe (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026):** With less than two months remaining, the logistical and political window to pass such a controversial law is extremely narrow. This is a strong structural factor against resolution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will start with the prior and update based on the net effect of the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 0.54 (35% probability).
*   **Update Step:** The evidence of acute military need (Sumy offensive, failed recruitment) pushes the probability up. However, this is counteracted by stronger evidence of a lack of political will (Zelenskyy's statement, public opposition, parliamentary inaction) and the severe practical constraint of the short timeline. The political barriers appear higher than the immediate military pressure, at least for now.
*   Let's perform a conceptual update. The prior of 35% reflects a situation where the decision is difficult but plausible. The recent evidence, particularly Zelenskyy's direct statement and the very short timeline, strongly suggests that the default path is "No," barring a sudden, catastrophic change. The likelihood ratio of this combined negative evidence is strong.
*   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds (0.54) × Likelihood Ratio (Net Evidence). The net likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1. For instance, if the positive evidence (need) has a likelihood ratio of 2, and the negative evidence (political will + timeline) has a combined likelihood ratio of 1/5, the net effect is 2/5 or 0.4.
*   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.54 × 0.4 = 0.216.
*   **Posterior Probability** = 0.216 / (1 + 0.216) ≈ 18%.

The final probability is significantly lower than the prior, reflecting that while the *need* for such a policy is clear, the *will and ability* to implement it before 2026 are very low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 18% could be wrong.

*   **Case for a Higher Probability (>18%):** The primary reason for a "Yes" resolution would be a "black swan" event: a sudden and catastrophic collapse of a section of the front line in the next seven weeks. If national survival is imminently at stake, all political calculations become secondary. The Sumy offensive could be the beginning of such a scenario. My forecast might be underestimating the probability of the military situation deteriorating this rapidly. If such a collapse occurs, the probability of this law passing would skyrocket.
*   **Case for a Lower Probability (<18%):** I might be overestimating the government's willingness to choose this specific unpopular solution even in a crisis. They might prefer other "last resort" options, such as ceding territory, attempting another wave of mobilization of older men, or gambling on new weapon systems turning the tide. The political toxicity and demographic fears could be so profound that this option is truly off the table, making the real probability closer to 5%.

Considering these, the 18% forecast attempts to balance these risks. It correctly identifies the status quo path as "No" but assigns a non-trivial (nearly 1-in-5) chance to a crisis scenario forcing the government's hand within the tight deadline.

### 6. Final Forecast

The immense political and demographic costs, combined with President Zelenskyy's stated opposition and the extremely short timeline, make it unlikely that Ukraine will lower the minimum age for compulsory military service before 2026. However, the severe and worsening manpower crisis, exemplified by the new Russian offensive, creates a plausible, albeit narrow, path to a "Yes" resolution should the battlefield situation deteriorate catastrophically in the coming weeks. My final probability balances these strong opposing forces.

Final: 18%
