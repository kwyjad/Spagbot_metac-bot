### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical base rate for the number of snow days in NYC during the specified 31-day period (Dec 11 - Jan 10)?
    *   What are the dominant short- and long-term climate trends affecting NYC winter precipitation?
    *   What are the key meteorological mechanisms that produce snow in NYC during this period?
    *   What is the current state of major climate drivers (e.g., ENSO, AO, NAO) for the Winter 2025-26 season?
    *   How does the season's progress to date (no snow by Dec 5) influence the forecast for this specific window?
    *   What are the key uncertainties and potential pitfalls in this forecast?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `NYC Central Park historical daily snowfall data December January`
    *   `NOAA CPC winter outlook 2025-2026 Northeast US`
    *   `ENSO forecast winter 2025-2026`
    *   `Arctic Oscillation (AO) North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) forecast December 2025 January 2026`
    *   `Impact of La Nina on NYC winter snowfall`
    *   `Impact of El Nino on NYC winter snowfall`
    *   `NYC climate change winter temperature and snowfall trends`
    *   `Typical storm tracks for NYC snow events`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The provided 10-year data is the most direct reference class. The mean is 1.9 days, median is 2, but the mode is 0. This suggests a distribution skewed toward fewer snow days.
    *   Recent years (2022-2024) have featured record-breaking "snow droughts," indicating a potential shift or increased volatility in the climate system. The winter of 2023-24 was the 4th warmest on record.
    *   Key mechanisms are the phase of the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO/AO), the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) state, and the specific track of coastal storms (Nor'easters). A negative NAO/AO is critical for allowing cold air to reach the city.
    *   The November 2025 polar vortex event, while not hitting NYC directly with snow, confirms that significant cold air masses are present in the hemisphere, a necessary precondition for snow.
    *   The lack of snow by Dec 5 is not a strong signal, as the average first snow date is around Dec 13. It doesn't significantly alter the outlook for the period.
    *   Long-term forecasts for winter 2025-26 will be crucial. For this brief, I will assume a neutral or weak La Niña state, which tends to correlate with variable but potentially colder/snowier winters in the Northeast compared to El Niño.

4.  **Drafting the Brief:** I will now structure the synthesized information into the required format for the forecasting panel.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **10-Year Recent History (2015-16 to 2024-25):** This is the most relevant reference class. For the period Dec 11–Jan 10, the average number of snow days was **1.9**. The distribution over these 10 years is:
    *   0 days: 40% (4 seasons)
    *   1 day: 10% (1 season)
    *   2 days: 20% (2 seasons)
    *   3 days: 20% (2 seasons)
    *   4 days: 10% (2 seasons)
    *   ≥5 days: 0% (0 seasons)
    This data shows high variability, with 0 days being the most frequent outcome, but a 50% chance of 2 or more days.

*   **Longer-Term Climate Normals (1991-2020):** Central Park averages ~2.5 snow days in December and ~2.8 in January. Pro-rating for the 31-day period (21 days in Dec, 10 in Jan) suggests a historical base rate of approximately **2.6 days** `(2.5 * 21/31 + 2.8 * 10/31)`. This is higher than the 10-year average, consistent with a warming trend that has suppressed snowfall in the most recent decade.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-11] Polar vortex brings snow to upstate NY — ↑ — Confirms the presence of potent cold air masses in the broader region, a key ingredient for potential snow events in NYC.
*   [2025-12-05] Central Park has no measurable snow for the season — ↓ — A slightly later-than-average start to the snow season could indicate a persistent mild weather pattern, though it is not a strong predictor for this specific 31-day window.
*   [2024-03-21] Report confirms Winter 2023-24 was 4th warmest on record — ↓ — Reinforces the strong recent trend of warmer winters with below-average snowfall, increasing the probability of low-end outcomes (0-1 days).
*   [2024-01-16] NYC ends a 701-day "snow drought" — ↔ — Demonstrates that while long snowless periods are becoming more common, significant snow events are still possible and can break the pattern abruptly.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **NAO/AO Phase:** A negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and/or Arctic Oscillation is the primary driver for cold air outbreaks in the Eastern US. A sustained negative phase is almost a prerequisite for multiple snow events. (Size: Large)
*   **ENSO State:** The El Niño-Southern Oscillation influences seasonal patterns. El Niño typically leads to warmer, less snowy NYC winters. La Niña is more variable but can favor colder patterns and coastal storms. A neutral state offers no strong signal. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Coastal Storm Track:** For snow to occur, a low-pressure system (e.g., a Nor'easter) must track close enough to the coast to provide moisture but far enough offshore to keep cold air in place. A track slightly inland will pull in warm Atlantic air, turning snow to rain. (Size: Large)
*   **Urban Heat Island Effect:** NYC's infrastructure retains heat, often elevating surface temperatures by several degrees. This can turn marginal, city-wide snow events into rain or a mix within Central Park, preventing accumulation from reaching the "measurable" threshold. (Size: Small to Moderate)
*   **Long-Term Climate Warming:** The background warming trend increases the average winter temperature, making it statistically less likely for precipitation to fall as snow, especially in the early part of winter. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Recent "Snow Drought" Regime:** The 10-year base rate includes the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons, which were exceptionally snow-poor. This suggests the underlying probability of a "0 day" outcome may be higher now than the simple 40% frequency in the last decade implies.
*   **Increased Volatility:** Recent winters have shown a pattern of long, mild, snowless stretches punctuated by brief, intense cold or single snow events, rather than consistent winter cold. This favors a more bimodal distribution (0-1 days or a single storm producing 2-3 snow days) over a smooth distribution.
*   **Early Season Cold Air Availability:** The strong November polar vortex event upstate is a notable feature. While not a direct predictor for the forecast window, it signals that the hemispheric pattern is capable of delivering arctic air, contrasting with some recent winters where such cold was absent until later in the season.
*   **Assumed ENSO State:** Assuming a neutral or weak La Niña for Winter 2025-26, this differs from strong El Niño years which heavily favor rain. This condition increases the *potential* for snow compared to an El Niño winter, though it does not guarantee it.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the 10-year reference class distribution (mean 1.9, mode 0) is appropriate, with an equivalent n of ~10. This reflects a belief that recent history is the best guide.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The demonstrated "snow drought" regime of 2022-2024 and overall warming trend strongly increases the likelihood of 0 or 1 day.
    *   (↑ Small) The November polar vortex activity provides a countervailing signal that ingredients for cold are available this season.
    *   (↔/↑ Small) A non-El Niño ENSO state removes a major barrier to snowfall and slightly increases the probability of a favorable storm track.
    *   (↓ Small) The slightly late start to the season offers weak evidence for a persistent mild pattern.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests a net downward update from the 10-year mean of 1.9. The posterior distribution should be more heavily weighted towards the **0, 1, and 2-day outcomes**, with reduced probability for 3 or more days compared to the raw base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Forecasts for a persistently negative NAO/AO index in late December/early January.
    *   Medium-range (6-10 day) forecasts showing a "blocking high" over Greenland or Eastern Canada.
    *   Weather models showing a "Miller A" or "Miller B" coastal storm development.
    *   Sustained (3+ days) periods of below-freezing high temperatures in NYC.
*   **DOWN indicators

To forecast the number of snow days in New York City between December 11, 2025, and January 10, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **0 days:** 40% (4 out of 10 years)
- **1 day:** 10% (1 out of 10 years)
- **2 days:** 20% (2 out of 10 years)
- **3 days:** 20% (2 out of 10 years)
- **4 days:** 10% (1 out of 10 years)
- **≥5 days:** 0% (0 out of 10 years)

These base rates are derived from the historical data provided for the last 10 years.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The historical data is directly relevant as it represents the same time period in previous years.
- **Differences:** Recent trends show a warming climate and snow droughts, suggesting a potential shift towards fewer snow days. The presence of a polar vortex indicates the availability of cold air, which could lead to snow if conditions align.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Polar Vortex (↑ Small):** Indicates potential for cold air, slightly increasing the likelihood of snow.
- **No Snow by Dec 5 (↓ Small):** Suggests a mild start, slightly decreasing the likelihood of snow.
- **Recent Warm Winters (↓ Large):** Strong evidence of a trend towards fewer snow days.
- **Neutral/Weak La Niña (↔/↑ Small):** Slightly increases potential for snow compared to El Niño conditions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **0 days:** Prior 40%, updated to 45% due to strong evidence of recent warming and snow droughts.
- **1 day:** Prior 10%, updated to 15% as a mild start and warming trend suggest fewer snow days.
- **2 days:** Prior 20%, remains at 20% as evidence is mixed.
- **3 days:** Prior 20%, updated to 15% due to decreased likelihood of multiple snow events.
- **4 days:** Prior 10%, updated to 5% due to strong evidence against frequent snow.
- **≥5 days:** Prior 0%, remains at 0% as historical data shows no precedent.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden cold snap or storm that could increase snow days unexpectedly.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A strong negative NAO/AO could lead to more snow, but current indicators do not strongly support this.
- **Rebuttals:** The warming trend is a significant factor, and recent data supports fewer snow days.

### 6. Final Normalization
Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- **0 days:** 45%
- **1 day:** 15%
- **2 days:** 20%
- **3 days:** 15%
- **4 days:** 5%
- **≥5 days:** 0%

### 7. Output Format
Option_0: 45%  
Option_1: 15%  
Option_2: 20%  
Option_3: 15%  
Option_4: 5%  
Option_≥5: 0%

# Forecasting NYC Snow Days (Dec 11, 2025 - Jan 10, 2026)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the 10-year historical data provided in the background as my primary reference class:

| Number of Snow Days | Frequency | Percentage |
|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| 0 days              | 4/10      | 40%        |
| 1 day               | 1/10      | 10%        |
| 2 days              | 2/10      | 20%        |
| 3 days              | 2/10      | 20%        |
| 4 days              | 2/10      | 10%        |
| ≥5 days             | 0/10      | 0%         |

This gives us a mean of 1.9 days, with 0 days being the most common outcome. The research report also mentions a longer-term climate normal (1991-2020) of approximately 2.6 days for this period, which is higher than the recent 10-year average, suggesting a warming trend.

I'll use the 10-year data as my prior, as it's more recent and likely reflects current climate conditions better.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- We're looking at the exact same 31-day period (Dec 11-Jan 10)
- We're using the same measurement location (Central Park)
- We're using the same definition of "measurable snowfall"

**Differences from base rate scenario:**
- Recent climate trends show accelerating warming, with 2023-24 being the 4th warmest winter on record
- NYC experienced a 701-day "snow drought" that ended in early 2024, suggesting increasing volatility
- The research report notes a polar vortex event in November 2025, indicating cold air masses are present
- As of December 5, 2025, NYC has not yet received measurable snowfall for the season

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Polar vortex in upstate NY on November 11, 2025**
- P(E|H="0 days"): Moderate - Even with cold air masses, NYC could remain snow-free
- P(E|H="1-2 days"): Moderately high - Cold air masses increase likelihood of some snow
- P(E|H="3+ days"): Moderate - Cold air presence is necessary but not sufficient for multiple snow days

**Evidence 2: No measurable snow by December 5, 2025**
- P(E|H="0 days"): High - A late start often correlates with fewer snow days
- P(E|H="1-2 days"): Moderate - Still plenty of time for normal snow patterns
- P(E|H="3+ days"): Low - A late start makes multiple snow days less likely

**Evidence 3: Recent "snow drought" and warming trend**
- P(E|H="0 days"): Very high - Consistent with continued warming pattern
- P(E|H="1-2 days"): Moderate - Still within expected range despite warming
- P(E|H="3+ days"): Low - Requires significant pattern change from recent years

**Evidence 4: Increased volatility in winter patterns**
- P(E|H="0 days"): Moderate - Consistent with long mild periods
- P(E|H="1-2 days"): Moderate - Consistent with brief snow events
- P(E|H="3+ days"): Low-moderate - Requires sustained cold pattern

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update our prior probabilities based on the evidence:

**Update for "0 days" (Prior: 40%)**
- Prior odds: 40/60 = 0.67
- Likelihood ratio (combined evidence): ~1.5 (favoring this hypothesis)
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 1.5 = 1.0
- Posterior probability: 1.0/(1.0+1) = 50%

The warming trend, recent snow droughts, and lack of early season snow all increase the probability of a zero-snow outcome.

**Update for "1 day" (Prior: 10%)**
- Prior odds: 10/90 = 0.11
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2 (slightly favoring this hypothesis)
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 1.2 = 0.132
- Posterior probability: 0.132/(1.132) = 11.7% → 12%

The increased volatility pattern slightly favors single-event outcomes.

**Update for "2 days" (Prior: 20%)**
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.9 (slightly against this hypothesis)
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.9 = 0.225
- Posterior probability: 0.225/(1.225) = 18.4% → 18%

The warming trend slightly reduces this probability.

**Update for "3 days" (Prior: 20%)**
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.6 (against this hypothesis)
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.6 = 0.15
- Posterior probability: 0.15/(1.15) = 13.0% → 13%

The warming trend and late start to the season reduce this probability.

**Update for "4 days" (Prior: 10%)**
- Prior odds: 10/90 = 0.11
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (against this hypothesis)
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 0.5 = 0.055
- Posterior probability: 0.055/(1.055) = 5.2% → 5%

Recent climate patterns make this outcome less likely.

**Update for "≥5 days" (Prior: 0%)**
- Prior odds: 0/100 = 0
- Even with the polar vortex evidence, this remains unlikely but not impossible
- Assigning a small probability: 2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent warming trends. Climate is complex, and a single cold winter can buck the trend.
- The polar vortex in November could signal a colder-than-average winter pattern that persists.
- The 10-year sample size is relatively small and may not capture the full range of variability.
- Extreme weather events are becoming more common with climate change, which could include unusual snow patterns.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would place more weight on the polar vortex evidence and less on the warming trend, resulting in higher probabilities for 2-4 snow days. This would argue that the early polar vortex activity signals a winter pattern conducive to more frequent cold air outbreaks.

**Rebuttal:**
While the polar vortex is notable, the overwhelming evidence of warming trends and recent snow droughts suggests that multiple snow days are becoming less common in NYC. The research report specifically notes that recent winters show "long, mild, snowless stretches punctuated by brief, intense cold or single snow events."

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red team thinking, my final probabilities are:

0 days: 50%
1 day: 12%
2 days: 18%
3 days: 13%
4 days: 5%
≥5 days: 2%

Sum: 100%

## 7. Output Format

0: 50%
1: 12%
2: 18%
3: 13%
4: 5%
≥5: 2%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast, following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My primary base rate is the empirical frequency of snow days during the exact period (December 11 - January 10) over the last 10 years (2015-16 to 2024-25), as provided in the background data. This is the most relevant reference class as it reflects the recent climate regime.

The historical data from the last 10 seasons shows the following distribution:
- **0 days:** 3 times (30%)
- **1 day:** 1 time (10%)
- **2 days:** 2 times (20%)
- **3 days:** 2 times (20%)
- **4 days:** 2 times (20%)
- **≥5 days:** 0 times (0%)

This distribution, with a mean of 1.9 days, serves as my initial prior. The mode is 0 days, but there is significant probability mass on outcomes of 2, 3, and 4 days.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The forecast is for the identical location (Central Park), time period, and resolution criteria as the base rate data. The fundamental meteorological drivers (coastal storms, NAO/AO phases) remain the same.
- **Differences:**
    1.  **Ongoing Climate Trend:** The base rate period itself contains recent "snow drought" years. The continued background warming and the extremity of recent warm winters (like 2023-24) suggest the underlying probability of low-snow outcomes might be even higher now than the 10-year average implies.
    2.  **Specific ENSO State:** The research brief assumes a neutral or weak La Niña state for Winter 2025-26. The 10-year base rate is an average over various ENSO states, including strong El Niños which are very unfavorable for NYC snow. A non-El Niño state removes a significant barrier to snowfall, increasing the potential for cold and snow compared to the 10-year average, though it doesn't guarantee it. This increases the plausible variance of outcomes.
    3.  **Antecedent Conditions:** The November 2025 polar vortex event, while not directly impacting NYC with snow, confirms that potent cold air masses are available in the hemisphere this season. This is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for snow.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence 1: Recent "snow drought" regime and warming trend.** This evidence is more likely given a low-snow outcome (0 or 1 day) than a high-snow outcome (3 or 4 days). The likelihood ratio P(E1 | H=0 days) / P(E1 | H≠0 days) is greater than 1, pushing probability toward the lower bins.
- **Evidence 2: Assumed neutral/weak La Niña.** This evidence removes the strong suppressing effect of El Niño. It makes both average (2-3 days) and bust (0 days) outcomes plausible, as La Niña winters are notoriously variable in the Northeast. It slightly decreases the probability of a guaranteed "El Niño-style" bust, thereby shifting some probability mass from the 0-day bin to the 1-4 day bins.
- **Evidence 3: November polar vortex upstate.** This is weak evidence but slightly supports the hypothesis that the ingredients for a snow event are present this season. It slightly disfavors the "persistently mild winter" scenario, providing a small nudge away from the 0-day outcome.
- **Evidence 4: No snow by Dec 5.** This is very weak evidence, as it's close to the average first snow date. It provides a negligible nudge toward lower snow outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
I will start with the prior distribution from the 10-year data and update it based on the evidence.

- **Prior:** P(0)=30%, P(1)=10%, P(2)=20%, P(3)=20%, P(4)=20%, P(≥5)=0%.

- **Update for Warming Trend:** The strongest signal is the ongoing warming trend, which suggests the 30% chance of 0 days is likely an underestimate. I will shift probability from the highest outcomes (3 and 4 days) to the lowest outcomes (0 and 1 day). Let's move 8 percentage points, increasing P(0) by 6% and P(1) by 2%, while decreasing P(3) by 4% and P(4) by 4%.
    - *Intermediate distribution:* P(0)=36%, P(1)=12%, P(2)=20%, P(3)=16%, P(4)=16%.

- **Update for ENSO & Cold Air:** The neutral/La Niña state and the available cold air (from the polar vortex) provide a countervailing effect. They make a complete bust less certain than under El Niño and increase the potential for a significant storm. This suggests shifting some probability back from the 0-day bin to the middle-of-the-range outcomes that would represent one or two decent storms. I will move 3% from P(0) and distribute it to P(2) and P(3).
    - *Intermediate distribution:* P(0)=33%, P(1)=12%, P(2)=22%, P(3)=18%, P(4)=15%. (Adjusting P(4) down slightly to balance).

- **Final Polish & Tail Risk:** The 10-year data has no instances of ≥5 days, but this is a small sample. A single large, slow-moving Nor'easter could produce snow on multiple consecutive days. I will assign a small probability (3%) to this tail risk, funded primarily from the 4-day outcome which is adjacent to it.

This leads to my final posterior distribution.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast heavily weights the recent warming trend, resulting in a 33% chance for 0 days. An alternative view would be to give more weight to the La Niña pattern, which can produce very snowy winters, and argue that the recent snow droughts were anomalies. This alternative forecast would lower the probability of 0 days and increase the probabilities for 2, 3, and 4 days, looking more like the original base rate.

However, I maintain my forecast because the background warming acts as a persistent headwind. Even in a favorable large-scale pattern (like La Niña), individual storms face a higher chance of being marginal rain/snow events in a warmer world, especially in a coastal city with a strong urban heat island effect. My forecast, with a mean of ~1.8 days (slightly below the 1.9-day base rate), reflects this net downward pressure on snowfall.

### 6. Final Normalization
The final probabilities are adjusted to sum to 100%.

- 0: 33%
- 1: 12%
- 2: 22%
- 3: 16%
- 4: 14%
- ≥5: 3%
- **Total: 100%**

This distribution reflects a high chance of a low-snow outcome (33% for zero days) consistent with recent trends, but also a substantial chance (55%) of 2 or more snow days if a favorable storm track materializes in the neutral/La Niña environment.

0: 33%
1: 12%
2: 22%
3: 16%
4: 14%
≥5: 3%
