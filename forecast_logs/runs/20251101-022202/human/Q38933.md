### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major U.S. Technology Regulation:** This class includes significant legislation creating new regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies (e.g., Communications Decency Act, COPPA, aspects of the PATRIOT Act for surveillance). Historically, such laws take multiple years of debate and several congressional sessions to pass. The base rate of a specific, novel tech regulation being introduced and passed within a single two-year congressional term is low, perhaps 10-15%. The probability of it passing in the final two months of a Congress if it hasn't already passed at least one chamber is exceedingly low, likely <1%.
2.  **Legislation in Response to National Security Threats:** This class includes laws passed to address perceived high-stakes national security risks (e.g., post-9/11 security laws, CFIUS expansions). These can sometimes move faster, especially after a "focusing event." However, even here, the process is typically deliberative. The base rate for passage within a single Congress might be higher, perhaps 20-30%, but the <2 month timeline remains a severe constraint.
3.  **Provisions Attached to "Must-Pass" Legislation:** This class involves attaching a novel policy proposal to a large, essential bill like the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) or an omnibus spending bill during a lame-duck session. This is the most plausible path for passage in a short timeframe. The base rate for a *non-germane, complex, and new regulatory framework* being successfully attached this late in the process is very low, likely under 5%, as it can jeopardize the entire vehicle.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-15** U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), under NIST, releases its first binding guidance for federal agencies procuring AI, emphasizing model security and testing. (↓) — This action, stemming from the 2023 Executive Order, provides a non-legislative path for regulation, reducing pressure on Congress to act urgently.
*   **2025-09-22** Senate Majority Leader Schumer states that while AI remains a priority, passing a comprehensive budget and addressing expiring programs are the focus before the session ends. (↓) — Signals that a standalone AI bill is not a top priority for the limited remaining floor time, making attachment to another bill the only viable, yet difficult, path.
*   **2025-08-05** A bipartisan group of senators introduces the "AI Security and Transparency Act," but it is not scheduled for committee markup before the August recess. (↓) — Shows continued interest but highlights the lack of procedural progress. A bill not yet through committee by August has almost no chance of passage by December.
*   **2025-06-18** A widely reported security audit by a university research group reveals significant, though not yet exploited, vulnerabilities in a leading open-source AI model. (↑) — Increases public and political salience of AI cybersecurity, providing ammunition for legislative proponents, but did not trigger an immediate, overwhelming response.
*   **2024-12-20** (Slightly outside 6-month window but critical context) The 118th Congress adjourns without passing any major AI safety legislation, despite numerous hearings and proposed bills throughout 2023-2024. (↓) — Establishes a strong precedent of legislative inaction and gridlock on this specific topic, which has continued into the current 119th Congress.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Legislative Clock & Calendar (Large ↓):** With less than two months until the end of the 119th Congress, the procedural window is nearly closed. Any bill not already passed by one chamber is exceptionally unlikely to navigate committees, floor votes, reconciliation, and presidential signature.
2.  **Executive Action as an Alternative (Large ↓):** The Biden Administration's 2023 AI Executive Order has empowered agencies like NIST to create standards and reporting requirements (using the Defense Production Act). This provides a "good enough" regulatory framework for now, lowering the perceived urgency for Congress to pass a new law.
3.  **A Catastrophic "Focusing Event" (Large ↑):** The most powerful driver for a "Yes" outcome. A confirmed, high-impact incident, such as a powerful AI model being stolen and used for a major cyberattack or disinformation campaign, could force emergency legislative action, likely via attachment to a must-pass bill.
4.  **Bipartisan Disagreement on Specifics (Moderate ↓):** While there is broad, bipartisan agreement on the *need* for AI safety, there is significant disagreement on the *how*: scope of regulation, enforcement agency, liability, and impact on innovation. This makes drafting a consensus bill that can pass quickly very difficult.
5.  **Industry Lobbying & Self-Regulation (Moderate ↓):** Major AI labs have actively lobbied for a light-touch approach and have established their own safety commitments (e.g., at the AI Safety Summits). This creates a narrative that industry can handle the problem, reducing political will for stringent legislation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Extreme Time Constraint:** The primary difference. Unlike a typical legislative forecast at the start of a session, this question is posed at the absolute end, making the base rate for "passage of complex legislation" almost zero.
2.  **Proactive Executive Action:** The existence of a comprehensive AI Executive Order and an active NIST/AISI is a significant departure from previous tech waves (e.g., social media), where executive action was slower and less prescriptive. This provides a powerful off-ramp for legislative pressure.
3.  **Unprecedented Pace of Technology:** AI capabilities are advancing faster than the technologies in our reference classes. This creates a stronger sense of urgency among policymakers than usual, but this urgency has so far failed to overcome procedural and political gridlock.
4.  **High Degree of Bipartisan *Interest*:** Unlike more polarized tech issues, AI safety has attracted serious, collaborative interest from both parties from the outset. This makes a last-minute deal more plausible than on other topics, though still highly unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the reference class of complex legislation passing in the final two months of a Congress: extremely low, perhaps 2% (n=50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The legislative calendar is nearly expired, representing an almost insurmountable procedural barrier.
    *   (↓ Large) The 2023 Executive Order and subsequent NIST actions are functioning as a substitute for legislation, venting political pressure.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The 118th and 119th Congresses have a track record of failing to pass such a bill, indicating persistent gridlock.
    *   (↑ Small) A recent security audit has slightly raised the issue's salience, but not to a crisis level.
    *   (↓ Small) Leadership has signaled other end-of-session priorities.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces and strengthens the extremely low prior. The posterior should move down significantly, towards a floor of ~1%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A major, undeniable AI-related security catastrophe (e.g., theft of a frontier model).
    *   Schumer, McConnell, Johnson, and Jeffries announce a surprise, last-minute bipartisan deal to attach an AI security provision to the final omnibus spending bill.
    *   A major AI company reverses its position and publicly calls for immediate, binding legislation.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Congress passes a final Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government into the next session, punting major decisions.
    *   Leadership press conferences in December focus exclusively on the budget, judicial nominees, or other non-AI priorities.
    *   The final text of the NDAA or omnibus bill is released and contains no language on AI model security.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria hinge on the *intent* of the bill being for "powerful" models. A bill ostensibly about privacy or copyright could have security clauses. A judging panel would need to interpret, introducing uncertainty.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** The forecast is highly contingent on the absence of a catastrophic AI incident. Such an event would invalidate the current political calculus.
*   **Lame-Duck Dynamics:** The final weeks of a congressional session can produce unexpected outcomes and log-rolling. A small, unrelated provision could be traded for the inclusion of an AI security measure, though this is unlikely for such a complex topic.
*   **Vehicle Risk:** The only path to passage is via a must-pass bill. If that vehicle fails (e.g., a government shutdown), the chance of this question resolving "Yes" becomes zero.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability is extremely low. The dominant factor is the legislative clock; with less than two months left in the congressional session and no bill having passed either chamber, the procedural hurdles are immense, and executive actions have already addressed the most urgent political pressures.

To forecast the probability of the U.S. passing legislation requiring cybersecurity around AI models before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for passing significant, novel tech regulation within a single congressional term is low, around 10-15%. Given the extreme time constraint of less than two months remaining in the congressional session, the base rate for passing complex legislation is even lower, approximately 2%. This is based on historical data of legislative processes and the procedural hurdles involved.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The situation involves complex, novel tech regulation, similar to past cases where legislation took multiple years to pass.
- The legislative process is nearing the end of a session, which historically results in very few new laws being passed.

**Differences:**
- There is a heightened sense of urgency due to rapid AI advancements and potential security risks.
- Executive actions have already addressed some regulatory needs, reducing immediate legislative pressure.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Legislative Calendar (↓ Large):** The procedural barriers are significant, with less than two months left. The likelihood of passing new legislation is very low.
- **Executive Action (↓ Large):** The 2023 Executive Order and NIST actions provide a regulatory framework, reducing the need for immediate legislation.
- **Historical Inaction (↓ Moderate):** Previous congressional sessions have failed to pass similar legislation, indicating persistent gridlock.
- **Security Audit (↑ Small):** A recent audit highlighted vulnerabilities, slightly increasing the issue's salience but not to a crisis level.
- **Leadership Priorities (↓ Small):** Current legislative priorities do not include AI, making passage unlikely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 2%, the overwhelming evidence suggests a decrease in probability. The legislative calendar and executive actions significantly reduce the likelihood of new legislation. The posterior probability, after considering all evidence, is adjusted downward to approximately 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast could be overconfident in assuming no last-minute legislative action. However, the procedural and political barriers are substantial.
- **Tail Risks:** A catastrophic AI-related event could drastically change the legislative landscape, but this remains speculative.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more optimistic forecast might consider a higher probability due to bipartisan interest, but the procedural constraints are a strong counterargument.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential tail risks, the final forecast reflects a very low probability of the U.S. passing the specified legislation before 2026.

Final: 1%

# Will the U.S. pass legislation requiring cybersecurity around AI models before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider the probability of passing specific technology regulation legislation within a tight timeframe (by December 31, 2025, which is about 2 months from the current date of November 1, 2025).

The most appropriate base rate is the probability of passing complex technology regulation in the final two months of a congressional session. This is extremely low, around 2%, because:

- Complex regulatory frameworks typically take multiple congressional sessions to develop and pass
- The legislative calendar is nearly expired for the 119th Congress
- Legislation not already through committee by August has historically had almost no chance of passage by December
- The 118th Congress already failed to pass AI safety legislation despite numerous hearings

I'll start with a prior of 2%.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This involves complex technology regulation requiring significant technical expertise
- It faces the same procedural hurdles as other late-session legislation
- It requires bipartisan support in a divided government

**Key differences:**
- AI safety has unusually strong bipartisan interest compared to other tech issues
- The Biden Administration's 2023 Executive Order has already established some regulatory framework
- The pace of AI advancement creates more urgency than typical technology regulation
- Recent security vulnerabilities in AI models have raised the salience of the issue

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Legislative calendar constraints**
- P(E|H): If legislation passes, it would be extremely unusual to navigate committees, floor votes, reconciliation in <2 months
- P(E|~H): If legislation doesn't pass, this time constraint is the expected reason
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors ~H (legislation not passing)
- Direction: Decreases probability significantly

**Evidence 2: Executive Order and NIST/AISI actions**
- P(E|H): If legislation passes, it would be despite existing executive actions
- P(E|~H): If legislation doesn't pass, the executive actions serve as a substitute
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors ~H
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Recent security audit revealing vulnerabilities**
- P(E|H): If legislation passes, such security concerns would be a driving factor
- P(E|~H): If legislation doesn't pass, these concerns weren't sufficient to overcome barriers
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors H
- Direction: Increases probability slightly

**Evidence 4: Senate leadership prioritizing budget and expiring programs**
- P(E|H): If legislation passes, it would be despite stated leadership priorities
- P(E|~H): If legislation doesn't pass, this aligns with stated priorities
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors ~H
- Direction: Decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2:98 (2% probability)

First update (Legislative calendar constraints):
- This is a very strong constraint, reducing the odds by a factor of 0.5
- New odds: 1:98 (approximately 1%)

Second update (Executive Order substitute):
- This moderately reduces the odds by a factor of 0.7
- New odds: 0.7:98 (approximately 0.7%)

Third update (Security audit concerns):
- This slightly increases the odds by a factor of 1.5
- New odds: 1.05:98 (approximately 1.1%)

Fourth update (Leadership priorities):
- This moderately reduces the odds by a factor of 0.8
- New odds: 0.84:98 (approximately 0.85%)

Converting to probability: 0.84/(0.84+98) ≈ 0.85%

However, I need to account for the possibility of a "black swan" event - a major AI security catastrophe that could force emergency legislation. This would be rare but possible, adding perhaps 1-2% to our estimate.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of attaching AI security provisions to must-pass legislation like the NDAA or omnibus spending bill
- The bipartisan interest in AI safety could enable faster-than-normal legislative action
- A security incident could occur in the next two months, dramatically changing the calculus

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might argue that AI security is uniquely positioned for last-minute action because:
1. Both parties agree on the need (just not the specifics)
2. The technical nature makes it easier to include as a "technical fix" in larger legislation
3. Industry might suddenly support regulation if they fear worse outcomes

However, even accounting for these possibilities, the procedural barriers remain nearly insurmountable without a major focusing event.

**Adjustments:**
I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of:
- A security incident occurring
- A surprise bipartisan agreement
- Attachment to must-pass legislation

This brings my estimate to approximately 3%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the base rate, and potential scenarios, I assess that the probability of the U.S. passing legislation requiring cybersecurity around AI models before 2026 is extremely low. The procedural barriers are nearly insurmountable at this late stage, executive actions have reduced urgency, and leadership has other priorities.

Final: 3%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the historical frequency of a novel, complex piece of technology regulation being passed in the final two months of a U.S. Congressional session (the "lame-duck" period). This is a very high bar.

*   **Reference Class:** Non-essential, complex legislation introduced but not yet passed by either chamber, heading into a lame-duck session.
*   **Reasoning:** The U.S. legislative process is slow and deliberative by design. For a bill that isn't considered "must-pass" (like government funding), to navigate committee, floor debate, reconciliation between chambers, and presidential signature in under two months is exceptionally rare. The research report suggests a base rate of under 5% even for the most plausible path (attachment to a must-pass bill) and under 1% for a standalone bill.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will select a prior of **3%**. This acknowledges that attaching the provision to a must-pass bill is the only viable path, which has a slightly higher (though still very low) base rate of success than a standalone bill.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors the typical base case of legislative gridlock. There is broad agreement on the problem's existence but significant disagreement on the specific solution, leading to inaction. The legislative calendar is a hard, unforgiving constraint, just as in any other session.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(Negative) Existence of an Executive Alternative:** Unlike many historical examples, the Biden administration's 2023 AI Executive Order and subsequent actions by NIST have created a parallel regulatory track. This provides a political "off-ramp," significantly reducing the pressure on Congress to act immediately.
    *   **(Positive) Bipartisan Interest & Urgency:** AI safety is a topic with unusually high bipartisan interest and a perceived sense of urgency due to the technology's rapid advancement. This makes a last-minute deal more plausible than for more politically polarized topics.
    *   **(Wildcard) Potential for a "Focusing Event":** The primary reason this situation differs is the potential for a sudden, catastrophic AI-related security incident. Such an event could dramatically alter the political calculus in a way that is not typical for most stalled legislation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Legislative Clock and Inaction (Strongly Decreases Probability)**
    *   The timeline shows a bill was introduced in August 2025 but has not had a committee markup. The 118th Congress (2023-2024) also failed to pass similar legislation. Senate leadership has signaled other priorities (budget).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This state of affairs is extremely likely if no law is going to pass (P(E|~H) is high) and extremely unlikely if a law were on the verge of passing (P(E|H) is very low). The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is therefore very small (<< 1).

*   **Evidence 2: Executive Action via NIST (Strongly Decreases Probability)**
    *   NIST released binding guidance for federal agencies in October 2025, stemming from the 2023 Executive Order.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The existence of a robust, alternative regulatory path via executive action makes urgent legislative action less necessary. This evidence is much more likely if Congress is not expected to pass a law (P(E|~H) > P(E|H)). This is a strong negative update.

*   **Evidence 3: Public Salience from Security Audit (Slightly Increases Probability)**
    *   A June 2025 security audit revealed vulnerabilities in a major AI model.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This event, while not catastrophic, provides ammunition for proponents and increases the issue's salience. It is slightly more likely to observe such an event preceding the passage of a law than not. However, the report notes it "did not trigger an immediate, overwhelming response," which mutes its impact. The likelihood ratio is slightly greater than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 3% probability corresponds to odds of 3:97, or approximately 1-to-32.
*   **Update Step:** The evidence of the legislative clock, leadership priorities, and the executive action "off-ramp" are powerful and correlated. Combined, they represent an overwhelming procedural and political barrier. This evidence cluster would massively decrease the odds, perhaps by a factor of 10 or more (i.e., a likelihood ratio of 0.1).
    *   *Updated Odds ≈ (1/32) × 0.1 = 1/320*
*   The small positive update from the security audit is insufficient to counteract this. Even with a likelihood ratio of 1.5, the odds would only move to 1.5/320, or about 1-to-213.
*   **Posterior Probability:** Odds of 1-to-213 convert to a probability of 1 / (1 + 213) ≈ 0.47%. This calculation suggests the probability is extremely low, likely in the 1-2% range. The forecast hinges almost entirely on the possibility of a "black swan" event, not on the normal legislative process. The normal process path has a near-zero chance of success at this point.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is very low, which could be an overconfident reading of the political situation.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher Probability):** A catastrophic AI security event occurs in the next month (e.g., a frontier model is stolen and used in a major attack). In the ensuing panic, a pre-negotiated, bipartisan bill is attached to the must-pass omnibus spending bill and passed with little debate. The probability of this is not zero. Let's estimate P(catastrophe in 2 months) as 5% and P(successful legislative response | catastrophe) as 20%. This path alone yields a 1% chance.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Definition-based):** The resolution could be met by a very narrow, uncontroversial provision. For example, a single paragraph in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requiring major AI companies that are also defense contractors to adhere to NIST's cybersecurity standards. This would be far easier to pass than a comprehensive bill. This is a significant risk to a very low forecast.
*   **Rebuttal:** Even in a crisis, the US legislative process is slow. The more likely response would be emergency hearings and a promise to act in the next Congress. The executive branch would also likely use emergency powers, again reducing the immediate need for legislation. The "narrow provision" risk is real, but the resolution criteria specify a law that "requires all U.S. actors" fitting criteria, which sounds broader than just defense contractors.

Considering the small but real chance of a crisis-driven response, a forecast slightly above 1% is warranted to account for this tail risk.

### 6. Final Forecast
The procedural window for passing legislation is nearly closed. The existence of a viable regulatory alternative via the Executive Order has removed the political urgency. The overwhelming evidence points toward continued legislative inaction for the remainder of 2025. The only plausible path to a "Yes" resolution is a major, catastrophic AI security incident that forces Congress's hand, an outcome that is itself a low-probability event.

Final: 2%
