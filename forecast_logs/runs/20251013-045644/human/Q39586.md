### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Virginia Gubernatorial Elections vs. Presidential Party (The "Virginia Curse"):** Since 1977, the party holding the White House has lost the Virginia gubernatorial election in 11 out of 12 contests. The only exception was in 2013 (Democrat Terry McAuliffe won with Democrat Barack Obama in the White House). This suggests a ~92% base rate that the non-presidential party wins. The background information implies a Republican holds the presidency in 2025, making the Democrat the non-presidential party candidate. **Base Rate (Democrat wins VA): ~90%**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This reference class is highly specific and has demonstrated powerful predictive value. The mechanism is a combination of backlash against the president's party and motivational advantages for the opposition.
    *   *Limitations:* The sample size is small (n=12). The 2013 exception and the increasingly nationalized, polarized environment could weaken this historical pattern.

2.  **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (Modern Era, 2001-2021):** In the six gubernatorial elections this century, Democrats have won four times (2001, 2005, 2017, 2021) and Republicans have won twice (2009, 2013). **Base Rate (Democrat wins NJ): ~67%**.
    *   *Reasoning:* This reflects NJ's "blue-leaning but competitive" nature in state-level contests. It captures both Democratic structural advantages and the potential for Republican victories (e.g., Chris Christie) under the right conditions.
    *   *Limitations:* This period covers varied national environments. The 2021 election was unexpectedly close (Democrat Murphy won by only 3.2%), suggesting the state may be more competitive than this base rate implies.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-10** NJ Poll shows Sherrill leading Ciattarelli — ↑ (Both/Only NJ) — A recent poll shows Democrat Sherrill leading by 6 points, suggesting a durable, if not overwhelming, lead for the Democrat in the final month.
*   **2025-10-02** Spanberger and Earle-Sears hold first debate in VA — neutral — The debate was described by most outlets as a draw, with both candidates performing competently and no major gaffes. This likely reinforces existing voter preferences rather than shifting the race.
*   **2025-09-15** Q3 fundraising reports released — ↑ (Both) — Reports show both Spanberger (VA) and Sherrill (NJ) significantly outraised their Republican opponents, providing a late-game resource advantage for advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts.
*   **2025-09-02** Analysis of NJ legislative races suggests GOP gains — ↓ (Only NJ/Both) — While Democrats are expected to retain their majority, GOP hopes of picking up seats indicate grassroots energy and potential for a closer-than-expected gubernatorial race.
*   **2025-08-20** National poll shows Republican President's approval rating at 41% — ↑ (Both) — An unpopular sitting president is a primary driver of the backlash effect in off-year elections, providing a strong tailwind for Democratic candidates in both states.
*   **2025-06-18** Spanberger campaign emphasizes moderate, bipartisan profile — ↑ (Only VA/Both) — Spanberger's strategic focus on her CIA background and bipartisanship is a proven playbook for Democrats to win in purple states like Virginia.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Approval (National Environment):** An unpopular president of the opposite party is the strongest driver, creating a backlash that boosts turnout and persuasion for the challenging party. (Size: Large)
2.  **Candidate Quality and Ideological Fit:** Candidates perceived as moderate and tailored to their state (e.g., Spanberger in VA, Sherrill in NJ) have a higher chance of winning over independents than those seen as ideological extremists. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **State-Specific Issues:** Perennial issues like property taxes in New Jersey or education policy in Virginia can animate specific segments of the electorate and influence the outcome, sometimes independent of national trends. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **The Post-Dobbs Political Landscape:** The issue of abortion access remains a powerful motivator for Democratic and independent voters, potentially overriding other concerns and boosting Democratic performance above historical baselines. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Incumbency/Familiarity:** In NJ, Ciattarelli is a known quantity from his strong 2021 run. This provides high name recognition but may also mean his support has a lower ceiling, as most voters already have a firm opinion of him. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Flipped "Virginia Curse":** The most significant difference is that the powerful VA historical pattern, which usually works *against* the party that won the last presidential election, is now aligned to work *for* the Democrat, Spanberger, due to an assumed Republican in the White House.
*   **Strong Democratic Candidates:** Both Spanberger and Sherrill fit a successful archetype for their respective states: former federal prosecutors/intelligence officers with a focus on security and a moderate profile, which can neutralize traditional GOP attacks.
*   **A Repeat Challenger in NJ:** It is somewhat unusual for a non-incumbent candidate (Ciattarelli) to be the nominee in a second consecutive cycle. This dynamic differs from a typical open-seat race, as he carries both the benefits of name ID and the baggage of his prior loss.
*   **Sustained Salience of Abortion Rights:** Unlike many past off-year elections, the 2022 Dobbs decision has created a durable, high-salience issue that consistently benefits Democratic candidates, potentially altering the electorate's composition and priorities compared to the reference class period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference classes, a reasonable prior would be centered on **"Only New Jersey"**. This reflects NJ's general blue lean (~67% Dem win rate) and the historical competitiveness of Virginia, even with the "curse" considered. Equivalent n: ~10 observations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Both) An assumed Republican in the White House creates a strong, favorable national environment for Democrats. (Large)
    *   (↑ Both) The post-Dobbs issue environment provides a durable, structural advantage for Democratic turnout and persuasion. (Moderate)
    *   (↑ Both) Both Democratic candidates are high-quality, with profiles well-suited to their states, contrasting with a more conservative VA Republican and a repeat NJ challenger. (Moderate)
    *   (↑ Both) Democratic fundraising advantages in both races provide superior resources for the final campaign stretch. (Small)
    *   (↓ Both / ↑ Only VA) Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 shows a viable path for a Republican in NJ, suggesting the race could be closer than fundamentals imply. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the powerful effect of the national environment, strongly pushes away from the prior. The probability for **"Both elections"** should increase substantially, becoming the most likely outcome. The probability for "Neither" should decrease to near-zero, and "Only Virginia" should remain the least likely outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Democrats winning more races):**
    *   Final polls in both states show Democratic leads widening to high single digits.
    *   Republican President's approval rating drops below 40%.
    *   Late-breaking stories focus on abortion access or Earle-Sears' conservative social positions.
    *   High early-voting turnout in heavily Democratic areas (Northern Virginia, North Jersey suburbs).
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Democrats winning fewer races):**
    *   Final polls tighten to within the margin of error, especially in New Jersey.
    *   The President

To forecast the outcome of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities for each scenario.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections:** The base rate for Democrats winning both elections is derived from the individual probabilities of winning each state. Given the base rates of ~90% for Virginia and ~67% for New Jersey, the naive joint probability would be 0.90 * 0.67 = 60.3%. However, these events are not independent, as they are influenced by common factors like national political climate.
  
- **Only Virginia:** The base rate for Democrats winning only Virginia is the probability of winning Virginia (~90%) and losing New Jersey (1 - 0.67 = 33%), which is 0.90 * 0.33 = 29.7%.

- **Only New Jersey:** The base rate for Democrats winning only New Jersey is the probability of losing Virginia (1 - 0.90 = 10%) and winning New Jersey (67%), which is 0.10 * 0.67 = 6.7%.

- **Neither election:** The base rate for Democrats losing both elections is the probability of losing Virginia (10%) and New Jersey (33%), which is 0.10 * 0.33 = 3.3%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The current scenario aligns with historical trends where the party opposite the sitting president often performs well in off-year elections. Both Democratic candidates are leading in polls, which is consistent with the base rates.

- **Differences:** The national political climate, including the Republican president's low approval rating and the post-Dobbs political landscape, may enhance Democratic chances beyond historical norms.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia:** The "Virginia Curse" and Spanberger's moderate profile increase the likelihood of a Democratic win. The likelihood of Spanberger winning given the evidence is high (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).

- **New Jersey:** Sherrill's lead in polls and fundraising advantage suggest a higher likelihood of a Democratic win than the base rate alone. However, Ciattarelli's previous strong performance and GOP grassroots energy introduce uncertainty.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Both elections:** The evidence of a Republican president's low approval and strong Democratic candidates increases the likelihood of Democrats winning both elections. The posterior probability for "Both elections" should be adjusted upwards from the base rate of 60.3%.

- **Only Virginia:** While Virginia remains likely for Democrats, the strong evidence for New Jersey also shifts probability away from this option.

- **Only New Jersey:** The evidence does not strongly support this scenario, as Virginia appears more favorable for Democrats.

- **Neither election:** This scenario is highly unlikely given the current evidence and should be adjusted downwards.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** The assumption of strong Democratic performance could be overestimated if late-breaking events favor Republicans.

- **Alternative Scenarios:** A significant shift in voter sentiment or turnout could alter outcomes, particularly in New Jersey.

### 6. Final Normalization

After considering all factors, the probabilities should be adjusted to reflect the evidence and ensure they sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 70%  
Only Virginia: 15%  
Only New Jersey: 10%  
Neither election: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the strong evidence favoring Democratic wins in both states, with Virginia being more certain than New Jersey.

# Analysis of 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical pattern ("Virginia Curse"): Since 1977, the party opposite the White House has won the governorship in 11 of 12 elections (~92%)
- With a Republican president assumed in 2025, this strongly favors Democrat Spanberger
- Prior probability (Democrat wins VA): ~85%

**New Jersey:**
- Recent history (2001-2021): Democrats won 4 of 6 gubernatorial elections (~67%)
- New Jersey is generally Democratic-leaning but can elect Republican governors
- Prior probability (Democrat wins NJ): ~70%

**Combined priors:**
- Both elections: ~60% (0.85 × 0.70)
- Only Virginia: ~25% (0.85 × 0.30)
- Only New Jersey: ~10% (0.15 × 0.70)
- Neither election: ~5% (0.15 × 0.30)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
- Both states are holding off-year elections with term-limited incumbents
- The "Virginia Curse" pattern remains relevant
- New Jersey maintains its Democratic lean but competitive nature

**Differences:**
- Both Democratic candidates (Spanberger and Sherrill) have strong profiles as moderates with national security backgrounds
- Ciattarelli in NJ is a repeat challenger who nearly won in 2021 (48%)
- Post-Dobbs political environment benefits Democrats on abortion rights
- Current polling shows Democrats leading in both states

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring Democrats in both states:**
- Current polling shows leads for both Spanberger and Sherrill
- Unpopular Republican president (41% approval) creates favorable environment for Democrats
- Both Democratic candidates have raised more money than their opponents
- Abortion remains a salient issue benefiting Democrats

**Evidence favoring Republicans in one or both states:**
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (48%) suggests NJ is competitive
- Analysis of NJ legislative races suggests GOP momentum
- Historical volatility in both states means upsets are possible

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior probabilities:
- Both elections: ~60%
- Only Virginia: ~25%
- Only New Jersey: ~10%
- Neither election: ~5%

**Key update: Current polling and national environment**
- Likelihood ratio for "Both Democrats win" given current polling and unpopular Republican president: ~1.5
- Posterior odds = 60/40 × 1.5 = 90/40 = 2.25
- Updated probability for "Both elections": 2.25/(1+2.25) ≈ 69%

**Update for "Only Virginia":**
- The Virginia pattern is very strong, but Ciattarelli's previous close race makes NJ more competitive
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.8 (slightly negative update)
- Posterior odds = 25/75 × 0.8 = 20/75 ≈ 0.27
- Updated probability: 0.27/(1+0.27) ≈ 21%

**Update for "Only New Jersey":**
- This scenario requires Spanberger losing despite the strong "Virginia Curse" pattern
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (negative update)
- Posterior odds = 10/90 × 0.5 = 5/90 ≈ 0.056
- Updated probability: 0.056/(1+0.056) ≈ 5%

**Update for "Neither election":**
- Requires both Democrats losing despite favorable environment
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (negative update)
- Posterior odds = 5/95 × 0.5 = 2.5/95 ≈ 0.026
- Updated probability: 0.026/(1+0.026) ≈ 3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polls can be systematically biased, especially in off-year elections with uncertain turnout
- The "Virginia Curse" pattern could break down in our increasingly nationalized politics
- Local issues not captured in national reporting could be decisive
- Unexpected October surprises could still emerge with a month to go

**Alternative scenarios:**
- If Republican turnout significantly outperforms expectations, "Neither election" becomes more plausible
- If Ciattarelli's previous strong performance indicates a genuine shift in NJ, "Only Virginia" becomes more likely

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce confidence in "Both elections" outcome
- Slightly increase "Only Virginia" probability to account for NJ's competitiveness

## 6. Final Normalization

After adjustments and ensuring probabilities sum to 100%:

Both elections: 68%
Only Virginia: 23%
Only New Jersey: 6%
Neither election: 3%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 68%
Only Virginia: 23%
Only New Jersey: 6%
Neither election: 3%
(sum 100%)

This forecast analyzes the 2025 gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey. The core of the analysis involves assessing the probability of a Democratic victory in each state separately and then combining those probabilities to address the four options. The analysis assumes, based on the provided research report, that a Republican holds the U.S. Presidency in 2025.

### **Individual Race Analysis**

#### **Virginia: Spanberger (D) vs. Earle-Sears (R)**

1.  **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**: The most relevant base rate is the "Virginia Curse," a strong historical pattern where the party holding the White House loses the Virginia gubernatorial election. Since 1977, this has happened in 11 of 12 elections. With a Republican assumed to be in the White House, this pattern favors the Democrat, Abigail Spanberger. This establishes a strong prior probability of a Democratic win.
    *   **P(Democrat wins VA) ≈ 92%** (11/12).

2.  **Comparison to Base Case**: The current situation aligns perfectly with the mechanism driving the base rate: an off-year election serving as a referendum on the sitting president. The report's mention of a low presidential approval rating (41%) strengthens the parallel to past instances of this backlash effect. A key difference from most of the reference period is the post-*Dobbs* political landscape, where abortion rights have become a major, durable motivator for Democratic and independent voters, likely providing an additional tailwind for the Democratic candidate.

3.  **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**:
    *   **Unpopular Republican President (E1)**: This evidence is highly likely given a Democratic win (P(E1|D win) is high) and less likely given a Republican win (P(E1|R win) is low). This strongly confirms the base rate.
    *   **Strong Democratic Candidate Profile (E2)**: Abigail Spanberger's profile as a moderate former CIA officer is well-suited for a purple state like Virginia. This is a playbook that has proven successful for Democrats in neutralizing traditional GOP attacks. This evidence moderately increases the probability of a Democratic win.
    *   **Fundraising Advantage (E3)**: The report notes Spanberger is significantly outraising her opponent. This financial advantage for late-stage advertising and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts is a material factor that increases the likelihood of a win.

4.  **Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**: The prior of ~92% is already very high. The evidence presented (unpopular president, strong candidate, fundraising) is uniformly positive for the Democrat and reinforces the prior. There is little contradictory evidence. The main reason for caution is that the "curse" is not a physical law and has failed once before. However, the current conditions seem to amplify, not weaken, the historical trend. Therefore, we maintain a high probability.
    *   **Final P(Democrat wins VA) = 92%**

#### **New Jersey: Sherrill (D) vs. Ciattarelli (R)**

1.  **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**: New Jersey is a blue-leaning state but has elected Republican governors. In the six gubernatorial elections since 2001, Democrats have won four times.
    *   **P(Democrat wins NJ) ≈ 67%** (4/6).

2.  **Comparison to Base Case**: The most significant difference from the base case is the national environment. The two Republican wins in the reference period (2009, 2013) occurred with a Democrat in the White House, fitting the backlash pattern. In 2025, the national environment (unpopular GOP president) provides a strong tailwind *for* the Democrat, Mikie Sherrill. However, the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, is a known quantity who ran a very close race in 2021 (losing by only 3.2%), demonstrating a viable path to victory for the GOP.

3.  **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**:
    *   **Unpopular Republican President (E1)**: As in Virginia, this is a strong positive factor for the Democrat, pushing the probability of a win well above the base rate.
    *   **Ciattarelli's Strong 2021 Performance (E2)**: This is the strongest piece of evidence for the Republican. It proves he can be highly competitive in New Jersey, even in a blue-leaning state. This evidence significantly tempers the optimism from the national environment and pulls the probability down.
    *   **Polling and Fundraising (E3)**: The report notes Sherrill is leading in a recent poll by 6 points and has a significant fundraising advantage. These are positive, but not decisive, indicators for the Democrat. A 6-point lead is solid but within a range where an upset is possible, especially given polling errors in the 2021 NJ race.
    *   **GOP Grassroots Energy (E4)**: The suggestion of GOP gains in legislative races hints at underlying Republican enthusiasm, which was a factor in the close 2021 race. This is a negative indicator for the Democrat.

4.  **Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**:
    *   **Prior odds**: P(D win) / P(R win) = 67/33 ≈ 2:1.
    *   **Update for national environment**: The favorable national environment is a powerful factor. Let's say it has a likelihood ratio of 3:1 in favor of a Democratic win. Posterior odds become 2:1 * 3 = 6:1 (P ≈ 86%).
    *   **Update for GOP competitiveness**: Ciattarelli's 2021 performance and signs of GOP energy are strong counter-signals. This evidence makes a GOP win more plausible than the national environment alone would suggest. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 1:2 (i.e., this evidence makes a GOP win twice as likely). Posterior odds become 6:1 * (1/2) = 3:1.
    *   This update results in a posterior probability of 3 / (3+1) = 75%. This balances the favorable environment for Democrats with the demonstrated competitiveness of the Republican candidate.
    *   **Final P(Democrat wins NJ) = 75%**

### **Combining Probabilities and Final Forecast**

Using the individual probabilities P(D_VA) = 92% and P(D_NJ) = 75%, and assuming independence as a starting point:
*   P(Both) = 0.92 * 0.75 = 69%
*   P(Only Virginia) = 0.92 * 0.25 = 23%
*   P(Only New Jersey) = 0.08 * 0.75 = 6%
*   P(Neither) = 0.08 * 0.25 = 2%

5.  **Red Team Thinking**: The primary assumption is the independence of the two races. In reality, a major national event could cause both outcomes to correlate. A late surge for Republicans nationally would make the "Neither" outcome more likely, while a Democratic surge would boost the "Both" outcome. To account for this correlation, I will slightly increase the probability of the correlated outcomes ("Both" and "Neither") by taking a small amount of probability from the mixed outcomes ("Only Virginia" and "Only New Jersey"). I will shift 2% from "Only Virginia" and 1% from "Only New Jersey", adding 2% to "Both" and 1% to "Neither". This better reflects the possibility of a single national trend affecting both races.

6.  **Final Normalization**:
    *   **Both elections**: 69% + 2% = 71%
    *   **Only Virginia**: 23% - 2% = 21%
    *   **Only New Jersey**: 6% - 1% = 5%
    *   **Neither election**: 2% + 1% = 3%
    The sum is 100%. This distribution reflects that a Democratic sweep is the most likely outcome, with the next most likely scenario being a GOP upset in the more competitive New Jersey race while the powerful Virginia trend holds.

Both elections: 71%
Only Virginia: 21%
Only New Jersey: 5%
Neither election: 3%
