### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern Era World Championships (2013–2024):** This is the most plausible reference class, covering the 12 tournaments since the LCK (South Korea) and LPL (China) regions established their modern professional infrastructure.
    *   **Base Rate:** LCK/LPL Winner: 100% (12 of 12). LCK Winner: 75% (9 of 12). LPL Winner: 25% (3 of 12).
    *   **Reasoning:** This period accurately reflects the current global power structure in League of Legends, where teams from South Korea and China have exclusively dominated the final stage. Earlier tournaments (2011-2012) represent a nascent, less-developed professional scene.
2.  **All World Championships (2011–2024):** A broader but less representative class including the first two tournaments.
    *   **Base Rate:** LCK/LPL Winner: ~86% (12 of 14). LCK Winner: ~64% (9 of 14). LPL Winner: ~21% (3 of 14). EMEA/Americas/Other: ~14% (2 of 14).
    *   **Reasoning:** Including the first two years slightly increases the base rate for Western or other Asian teams, but this is likely misleading as the competitive gap has widened significantly since then.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The horizon is less than three months, emphasizing events from the last six months. The provided sources primarily cover 2024 and early 2025 announcements, establishing the competitive landscape leading into the 2025 season.

*   [2024-11-02] T1 wins 2024 World Championship (↑ T1, ↑ LCK) — T1 defeated China's Bilibili Gaming (BLG) 3-2, securing their second consecutive title and reinforcing their status as the world's top team.
*   [2024-12-07] Post-season analysis confirms LCK strength (↑ LCK) — Reports following the 2024 season highlighted the continued dominance of top LCK teams like T1 and 2024 MSI champions Gen.G in international play.
*   [2025-01-08] Worlds 2025 location confirmed as China (↑ LPL, ↓ Other regions) — Hosting the tournament provides a small but tangible advantage to Chinese teams due to reduced travel and favorable crowd support.
*   [2025-07-25] Worlds 2025 schedule and cities finalized (no change) — Solidified the logistical framework, confirming the multi-city tour ending in Chengdu, which may introduce travel fatigue for all teams.
*   [2025-10-08] Qualified teams list finalized (no change) — The standard slot allocation (3 guaranteed seeds for LCK/LPL, with a 4th competing) was confirmed, ensuring the strongest regions are heavily represented as expected.
*   [2025-10-09] Pre-tournament analysis notes high South Korean player count (↑ LCK) — The fact that 9 of 17 teams feature South Korean players underscores the region's unparalleled talent depth, a key resource for success.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Regional Ecosystem Strength (Large):** The LCK and LPL possess superior infrastructure, coaching, talent development pipelines, and domestic competition. This creates a powerful feedback loop that consistently produces championship-caliber teams.
2.  **Roster Cohesion & Experience (Large):** Stable rosters with extensive experience playing together, particularly in high-stakes international Best-of-5 series, have a significant performance advantage.

To forecast the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship, we will apply Bayesian reasoning, considering historical data, recent developments, and the competitive landscape.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **T1, Gen.G, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster (LCK Teams):**  
  Base Rate: 75% (9 out of 12 championships won by LCK teams in the modern era).  
  Reasoning: LCK teams have historically dominated the World Championships, with T1 being the reigning champion.

- **Bilibili Gaming, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming, Anyone's Legend (LPL Teams):**  
  Base Rate: 25% (3 out of 12 championships won by LPL teams in the modern era).  
  Reasoning: LPL teams are strong contenders, with a significant home advantage for the 2025 championship.

- **An Asia-Pacific team (excluding LCK/LPL):**  
  Base Rate: 0% (No championships won by other Asia-Pacific teams in the modern era).  
  Reasoning: Historically, no other Asia-Pacific teams have won, and the competitive gap remains large.

- **An EMEA team, An Americas team:**  
  Base Rate: 0% (No championships won by EMEA or Americas teams in the modern era).  
  Reasoning: The competitive gap is significant, with no recent evidence of these regions closing it.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The dominance of LCK and LPL teams continues, with strong infrastructure and talent pipelines.
- **Differences:** The tournament is hosted in China, providing a slight advantage to LPL teams due to reduced travel and local support.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **T1's Recent Victory (↑ T1):**  
  Likelihood if T1 wins: High, as they are the defending champions.  
  Likelihood if T1 does not win: Lower, as their recent success suggests strong form.

- **LCK Strength (↑ LCK):**  
  Likelihood if LCK wins: High, given the historical dominance and player talent.  
  Likelihood if LCK does not win: Lower, as the evidence supports their continued strength.

- **Tournament in China (↑ LPL):**  
  Likelihood if LPL wins: Higher due to home advantage.  
  Likelihood if LPL does not win: Lower, as the home advantage is a significant factor.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **T1:**  
  Prior odds = 0.75  
  Likelihood ratio (based on recent victory and LCK strength) = 1.2  
  Posterior odds = 0.75 * 1.2 = 0.9  
  Posterior probability = 0.9 / (1 + 0.9) ≈ 47%

- **Gen.G, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster (Other LCK Teams):**  
  Combined prior odds = 0.75  
  Adjusted for T1's dominance, each team ≈ 8%

- **Bilibili Gaming, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming, Anyone's Legend (LPL Teams):**  
  Combined prior odds = 0.25  
  Adjusted for home advantage, each team ≈ 6%

- **An Asia-Pacific team, An EMEA team, An Americas team:**  
  Combined prior odds = 0%  
  No significant evidence to increase likelihood.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** The dominance of LCK and LPL is well-supported, but unexpected upsets can occur.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a breakout performance from a non-LCK/LPL team, though unlikely.
- **Adjustment:** Slightly increase the probability for LPL teams due to home advantage.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

T1: 47%  
Gen.G: 8%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 8%  
KT Rolster: 8%  
Bilibili Gaming: 6%  
Anyone's Legend: 6%  
Top Esports: 6%  
Invictus Gaming: 6%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 2%  
An EMEA team: 2%  
An Americas team: 1%  

(Total: 100%)

# Analysis of 2025 League of Legends World Championship Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Looking at historical data, I'll establish base rates for each option:

**South Korean Teams (LCK):**
- T1: 33% (Won 5 World Championships, including 2023 and 2024)
- Gen.G: 8% (Strong LCK team, won 2024 MSI)
- Hanwha Life Esports: 5% (Competitive LCK team)
- KT Rolster: 4% (Competitive LCK team)

**Chinese Teams (LPL):**
- Bilibili Gaming: 8% (2024 World Championship finalist)
- Top Esports: 6% (Historically strong LPL team)
- Anyone's Legend: 3% (Less established LPL team)
- Invictus Gaming: 3% (Former champion but less dominant recently)

**Regional Categories:**
- An Asia-Pacific team: 3% (Non-LCK/LPL Asian teams have historically underperformed)
- An EMEA team: 4% (European teams occasionally reach finals but rarely win)
- An Americas team: 3% (North American teams historically struggle at Worlds)

These priors are based on the modern era (2013-2024) where LCK teams won 75% of championships and LPL teams won 25%, with no other regions winning.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The tournament structure remains similar to previous years
- The regional qualification system is unchanged
- LCK and LPL continue to dominate international competitions

**Differences from base case:**
- The 2025 World Championship is being held in China, potentially giving LPL teams a home advantage
- T1 is seeking an unprecedented third consecutive World Championship
- Team rosters may have changed since 2024 (though specific roster changes aren't detailed in the report)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for T1:**
- Won back-to-back World Championships in 2023 and 2024
- Defeated Bilibili Gaming in a close 3-2 final in 2024
- Has the most World Championship titles in history (5)
- P(E|H) is high for T1 winning again; P(E|~H) is lower

**Evidence for Gen.G:**
- Won the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational
- Consistently strong LCK team
- P(E|H) is moderate for Gen.G winning; P(E|~H) is moderate

**Evidence for Bilibili Gaming:**
- Finalist in 2024 World Championship
- Home advantage in China for 2025
- P(E|H) is moderate for BLG winning; P(E|~H) is moderate

**Evidence for LCK dominance:**
- 9 of 17 teams at Worlds 2025 feature South Korean players
- LCK teams have won 9 of the last 12 World Championships
- P(E|H) is high for an LCK team winning; P(E|~H) is low

**Evidence for LPL advantage:**
- Tournament being held in China gives home advantage
- LPL teams have won 3 of the last 12 World Championships
- P(E|H) is moderate for an LPL team winning; P(E|~H) is moderate

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update T1's prior probability:
- Prior: 33%
- Evidence: Back-to-back World Championships in 2023-2024
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (significantly more likely to see this evidence if T1 will win)
- Prior odds: 33/67 = 0.493
- Posterior odds: 0.493 × 1.5 = 0.7395
- Posterior probability: 0.7395/(1+0.7395) = 42.5%

For Bilibili Gaming:
- Prior: 8%
- Evidence: 2024 finalist + home advantage in China
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- Prior odds: 8/92 = 0.087
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 1.4 = 0.1218
- Posterior probability: 0.1218/(1+0.1218) = 10.9%

For Gen.G:
- Prior: 8%
- Evidence: Won 2024 MSI
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
- Prior odds: 8/92 = 0.087
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 1.3 = 0.1131
- Posterior probability: 0.1131/(1+0.1131) = 10.2%

Updating other options similarly based on available evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- Roster changes not captured in the research report could significantly impact team strength
- The report doesn't mention team performance in regional leagues during 2025
- I may be overweighting recent results (recency bias)
- I might be underestimating the potential for upsets or breakthrough performances

Alternative scenarios:
- An EMEA team could make a breakthrough similar to how G2 and Fnatic have reached finals in the past
- The home advantage for LPL teams might be more significant than I've accounted for
- T1's dominance might fade if key players have left or if other teams have improved significantly

Adjusting for these considerations, I'll slightly reduce T1's probability and increase the chances for some other options.

## 6. Final Normalization

After adjustments and ensuring probabilities sum to 100%:

## 7. Output Format

T1: 38%  
Bilibili Gaming: 12%  
Gen.G: 11%  
Top Esports: 8%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 7%  
KT Rolster: 6%  
An EMEA team: 5%  
Anyone's Legend: 4%  
Invictus Gaming: 4%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 3%  
An Americas team: 2%  
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary reference class is the "Modern Era" of League of Legends World Championships, from 2013 to 2024. This 12-year period reflects the established dominance of the South Korean (LCK) and Chinese (LPL) professional leagues.

*   **P(LCK/LPL win):** 100% (12 out of 12 winners).
*   **P(LCK win):** 75% (9 out of 12 winners).
*   **P(LPL win):** 25% (3 out of 12 winners).
*   **P(Other Region win):** 0%.

A 0% base rate for other regions is too strong and ignores tail risk. To create a more robust prior, I will start with a slightly softened version of this base rate, assigning a small probability to other regions based on the full history of the tournament (2011-2024), where Western and other Asian teams won the first two championships.

*   **Initial Prior P(LCK/LPL win):** 95%
*   **Initial Prior P(Other Regions win):** 5%

Within the 95% for the top two regions, I'll use the 75/25 split from the modern era:
*   **Prior P(LCK win):** 95% * 0.75 = ~71%
*   **Prior P(LPL win):** 95% * 0.25 = ~24%
*   **Prior P(EMEA win):** ~2.5% (Historically the strongest "other" region)
*   **Prior P(APAC win):** ~1.5%
*   **Prior P(Americas win):** ~1%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current case is highly similar to the base rate scenario, where LCK and LPL teams are the overwhelming favorites. The key differences are the specific teams' current form and the tournament's location, which will be used as evidence to update the priors.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate several key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence A: T1 won the 2024 World Championship, their second consecutive title, and Gen.G won the 2024 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI).**
    *   This is extremely strong evidence for the LCK's current dominance. The region holds both major international titles from the preceding year.
    *   The likelihood of this evidence (P(E|H)) is much higher if an LCK team is the true favorite for 2025 (H) than if an LPL or other regional team were the favorite (~H). This evidence strongly increases the probability for the LCK as a region, and specifically for T1 and Gen.G.

*   **Evidence B: The 2025 World Championship will be held in China.**
    *   This provides a marginal advantage to LPL teams (home crowd, less travel).
    *   The likelihood of this evidence is neutral to team strength, but it acts as a causal factor. It slightly increases the probability of an LPL team winning compared to a non-LPL team. This will temper the strong update from Evidence A.

*   **Evidence C: Bilibili Gaming (BLG) was the 2024 Worlds runner-up.**
    *   This establishes BLG as the clear top team from the LPL and a credible contender, but also reinforces that the very best LCK team (T1) was superior in the final. This evidence boosts BLG's individual chances significantly relative to other LPL teams.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Priors:** P(LCK) ≈ 71%, P(LPL) ≈ 24%, P(Other) ≈ 5%.
    *   Prior Odds (LCK vs. Not LCK) ≈ 71 / 29 ≈ 2.45 to 1.

2.  **Update on Evidence A (LCK won both 2024 international titles):** This is strong evidence. I'll apply a likelihood ratio of approximately 2.0, meaning this evidence is twice as likely if the LCK is the strongest region.
    *   Posterior Odds (LCK vs. Not LCK) ≈ 2.45 * 2.0 = 4.9 to 1.
    *   New P(LCK) ≈ 4.9 / (1 + 4.9) ≈ 83%.
    *   The remaining 17% is distributed to P(LPL) ≈ 13% and P(Other) ≈ 4%.

3.  **Update on Evidence B (Worlds in China):** This provides a small boost to the LPL. I will shift ~5 percentage points of probability from the LCK to the LPL to account for this advantage.
    *   P(LCK): 83% -> 78%
    *   P(LPL): 13% -> 18%
    *   P(Other): 4% (remains unchanged, as this advantage primarily affects the top contenders).

4.  **Distribute to Teams:** Now I distribute these regional probabilities among the individual teams based on the specific evidence.
    *   **LCK (78%):** T1 (back-to-back champs) and Gen.G (MSI champs) are the clear top tier. T1's achievement is greater, but a three-peat is historically difficult. I will assign T1 a slightly higher share than Gen.G. The remaining LCK teams (HLE, KT) are a tier below.
        *   T1: ~38% of LCK share -> 30%
        *   Gen.G: ~33% of LCK share -> 26%
        *   HLE: ~17% of LCK share -> 13%
        *   KT: ~12% of LCK share -> 9%
    *   **LPL (18%):** BLG is the clear #1 from the LPL as the 2024 runner-up. TES is a historically strong contender.
        *   BLG: ~55% of LPL share -> 10%
        *   TES: ~28% of LPL share -> 5%
        *   IG & AL: Split the remainder -> 3% total.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily concentrated on two LCK teams (T1 and Gen.G at a combined 56%). Is this overconfident? A single meta shift or player slump could upend this. The LPL has a massive talent pool and the home-field advantage, making a team like BLG a very real threat. I believe the 10% assigned to BLG is a fair reflection of their chances as the "best of the rest." The small probabilities for Western teams are justified by over a decade of consistent underperformance at Worlds. The current distribution acknowledges the LCK's proven dominance while still giving a credible chance to the top LPL challenger and accounting for tournament variance among the other strong Eastern teams.

### 6. Final Normalization

After distributing the probabilities and performing the red team check, I will finalize and normalize the numbers.

*   T1: 29%
*   Gen.G: 26%
*   Hanwha Life Esports: 13%
*   KT Rolster: 9%
*   Bilibili Gaming: 10%
*   Top Esports: 5%
*   Invictus Gaming: 2%
*   Anyone's Legend: 1%
*   An EMEA team: 2.5%
*   An Asia-Pacific team: 1.5%
*   An Americas team: 1%

The sum is 100%. The hierarchy reflects the evidence: two LCK titans at the top, followed by the best LPL team and other strong LCK contenders, with a significant drop-off to the rest of the field.

T1: 29%
Hanwha Life Esports: 13%
KT Rolster: 9%
Gen.G: 26%
Bilibili Gaming: 10%
Anyone's Legend: 1%
Top Esports: 5%
Invictus Gaming: 2%
An Asia-Pacific team: 1.5%
An EMEA team: 2.5%
An Americas team: 1%
