### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US government takes non-crisis equity stakes in major domestic/allied-country corporations.** This is the most specific reference class. Historically, this is extremely rare. Outside of wartime, the US government avoids taking ownership stakes in healthy, private companies as a matter of industrial policy. The base rate is very low, likely **<1%** in any given year for a specific company.
2.  **US government takes equity stakes in corporations during a systemic crisis.** This is more common but still infrequent. Examples include the 2008 financial crisis (TARP bailouts of banks, AIG, GM, Chrysler) and the 1979 Chrysler bailout. These are reactive measures to prevent economic collapse, not proactive industrial strategy. The base rate is low and conditional on a major crisis, which is not the current context.
3.  **A new US administration significantly alters the terms of a major, recently enacted industrial subsidy program.** This is a plausible reference class for policy change. Administrations frequently review, modify, or attempt to repeal the signature legislation of their predecessors. The probability of significant modification is moderate to high, perhaps **20-40%**. However, "modification" does not typically include demanding equity.

*Reasoning & Limitations:* The first reference class is the most relevant but has few data points, making the base rate uncertain. The current situation is unusual because it combines a non-crisis environment with a crisis-style intervention (equity stakes), driven by a specific presidential ideology. The base rate is therefore very low, but the unique context suggests it may not be a reliable guide.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-28] GlobalFoundries (GF) announces its CHIPS funding has no equity stake. **↓** — This confirms a major company on the list has secured a non-equity deal, setting a counter-precedent to the Intel deal and narrowing the field of potential targets.
*   [2025-08-28] Intel deal announced, with the US government receiving a 10% stake. **↑** — This is a powerful proof-of-concept, establishing a clear precedent and demonstrating the administration's intent and ability to execute this policy.
*   [2025-08-21] Commerce Secretary Lutnick clarifies equity terms will not apply to TSMC and Micron. **↓↓** — This is a major development, explicitly removing two of the five named companies from consideration and signaling a pragmatic, rather than purely ideological, approach.
*   [2025-08-07] Trump announces a plan for 100% tariffs on imported chips for non-investing firms. **↑** — While not directly about equity, this shows the administration's focus on the sector and its willingness to use aggressive, unconventional tools to force company behavior.
*   [2025-04-01] Trump signs an executive order creating the "United States Investment Accelerator" to oversee CHIPS. **↑** — This creates the specific bureaucratic vehicle to renegotiate deals, moving the policy from rhetoric to an operational plan.
*   [2025-03-05] Trump calls for a full repeal of the CHIPS Act. **↓** — This earlier stance suggested a "repeal and replace" or "repeal and neglect" strategy, not a "reform and use" strategy. Later events show a clear pivot away from this position.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Ideology ("Transactional Nationalism"):** The administration views subsidies as "handouts" but equity stakes as "smart deals" that provide a return for the taxpayer. This is the primary driver of the policy. (Size: Large)
2.  **The Intel Precedent:** The successful Intel deal creates a powerful template and political momentum. It makes it easier to demand similar terms from other companies ("Why should you get a better deal than Intel?"). (Size: Large)
3.  **Company Leverage and Resistance:** Companies, especially foreign ones like TSMC and Samsung, can threaten to cancel or scale back US investments. Companies with already-finalized deals (like GlobalFoundries) have a strong case against renegotiation. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Pragmatism of Implementers:** Officials like Commerce Secretary Lutnick may moderate the President's maximalist stance to avoid scaring off critical investment, as seen with the TSMC/Micron carve-out. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Narrowing Field of Targets:** With TSMC, Micron, and GlobalFoundries now very unlikely targets, the administration's political and bureaucratic capital is focused on the remaining companies: Samsung and Microchip Technology. This increases the pressure on them. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Deal Complexity and Timeline:** Negotiating equity stakes is complex and time-consuming. The ~14-month horizon is plausible but could be a constraint if negotiations are not already underway. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** Unlike historical bailouts (TARP), this policy is not a response to corporate failure or systemic risk. It is a proactive use of state power to reshape industrial policy and capture upside.
*   **Ideologically Driven:** The policy is a direct reflection of President Trump's personal "deal-making" approach to governance, rather than an established economic doctrine or institutional response.
*   **Single-Sector Focus:** The effort is narrowly targeted at the strategically vital semiconductor industry, unlike broad-based bailout programs.
*   **Modification of Existing Program:** The administration is repurposing an existing, funded, and popular bipartisan program (CHIPS Act) rather than creating a new authority from scratch. This provides a ready vehicle for implementation.
*   **Explicit Public Precedent:** The Intel deal serves as a very recent and highly specific template, which was not present in prior, more ad-hoc government interventions.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 5%) based on the historical rarity of non-crisis government equity stakes. Use a relatively low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=20) to reflect that this is an unusual situation where new evidence should have a strong impact.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The Intel deal is a "smoking gun" that proves both intent and capability. It dramatically increases the probability from the base rate.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The creation of the "US Investment Accelerator" provides the official mechanism to execute the policy.
    *   **↓↓ (Large):** The explicit exemption of TSMC and Micron, plus the confirmed non-equity deal for GlobalFoundries, removes 60% of the named companies from the pool of likely targets. This is a powerful piece of countervailing evidence.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The narrowing of focus onto Samsung and Microchip Technology concentrates the administration's pressure, slightly increasing the odds for those specific firms.
*   **Net effect:** A significant upward revision from the very low prior. The Intel deal is a game-changer, but the exemptions for three of the five companies are a massive constraint. The posterior should be substantially higher than the base rate but well below 50%, reflecting a focused but not guaranteed effort against the remaining targets.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from the administration naming Samsung or Microchip Technology as next in line for negotiations.
    *   Leaks or reports of active negotiations between the Commerce Department and Samsung/Microchip.
    *   President Trump publicly praising the Intel deal as a model for all future CHIPS funding.
    *   Appointments of known hardline negotiators to the "US Investment Accelerator" board.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Public statements from Samsung or Microchip Technology executives ruling out an equity stake in exchange for funding.
    *   Commerce Secretary Lutnick or other officials suggesting a flexible approach or alternative "taxpayer protection" mechanisms for remaining deals.
    *   Announcements of CHIPS funding for Samsung or Microchip that explicitly state "no equity stake."
    *   Significant delays in the disbursement of any further CHIPS funds, suggesting bureaucratic paralysis or a policy rethink.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fictionalized Scenario:** The analysis is based on a provided, fictional set of news articles. The dynamics of this specific, hypothetical Trump administration may not perfectly mirror reality.
*   **Resolution on a Disjunction:** The question resolves "Yes" if a deal is made with *any* of the five companies. The probability is not on a single company but on the set. With three companies now very unlikely, the question has become "Will the US acquire stock in Samsung or Microchip Technology?"
*   **Definition of "Acquire Stock":** The resolution criteria is broad. This could include common stock, preferred stock, or even warrants (options to buy stock), which are a common feature in government financing deals (e.g., the 2020 airline bailout). A deal involving warrants would resolve this question as "Yes."
*   **Presidential Volatility:** The administration's policy is highly dependent on the President's focus and could be reversed or abandoned with little warning.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most important information—the status of private negotiations with Samsung and Microchip—is not public. We are forecasting based on external signals only.

To forecast the probability of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of the US government taking non-crisis equity stakes in major domestic/allied-country corporations. This is extremely rare, with a base rate likely less than 1% per year for a specific company. Given the unique context, we will start with a slightly higher prior of 5% to account for the unusual proactive policy stance.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves the US government potentially taking equity stakes in private companies, which is rare outside of crises.
   - Differences: The proactive nature of the policy, driven by a specific presidential ideology, and the existence of a recent precedent (Intel deal) make this situation unique. These differences suggest a higher probability than the historical base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Intel Deal (↑ Large):** The US government acquiring a 10% stake in Intel sets a precedent, significantly increasing the likelihood of similar actions with other companies.
   - **US Investment Accelerator (↑ Moderate):** Establishing a mechanism to facilitate such deals increases the probability.
   - **Exemptions for TSMC, Micron, and GlobalFoundries (↓↓ Large):** These exemptions remove major companies from consideration, decreasing the probability.
   - **Narrowing Focus on Samsung and Microchip Technology (↑ Small):** With fewer targets, the administration's efforts are more concentrated, slightly increasing the probability for these companies.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Start with a prior probability of 5%.
   - The Intel deal and the establishment of the US Investment Accelerator significantly increase the probability.
   - The exemptions for TSMC, Micron, and GlobalFoundries are strong counter-evidence, reducing the probability.
   - After considering all evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted upwards but remains below 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The Intel precedent is strong, but the exemptions are equally significant. The probability should not be too high given the limited number of remaining targets.
   - Alternative scenarios: The administration could face resistance or legal challenges, or shift focus due to political or economic changes.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of warrants or other forms of equity-like arrangements that could resolve the question as "Yes."

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential scenarios, the final probability reflects a cautious increase from the prior, acknowledging both the precedent and the constraints.

Final: 25%

# Will the US government acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for the US government acquiring equity stakes in private companies outside of crisis situations, specifically in the semiconductor sector.

The most relevant reference class is: **US government taking equity stakes in major corporations as part of industrial policy (not crisis response)**. Historically, this has been extremely rare. The US government has generally preferred subsidies, tax incentives, and regulatory approaches rather than direct ownership.

**Prior probability**: I'll set this at approximately **5%** based on the historical rarity of such actions. This reflects:
- The US government's traditional reluctance to take ownership positions in private companies
- The preference for market-based solutions in US industrial policy
- The exceptional nature of government equity stakes outside of financial crises

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The semiconductor industry is strategically important but not in immediate crisis
- The companies in question are mostly financially stable and profitable
- The government has other policy tools available (subsidies, regulations, tariffs)

**Key differences**:
- The Trump administration has explicitly stated its intention to take equity stakes
- There is already a precedent with the Intel deal (10% stake)
- The CHIPS Act provides a ready-made funding vehicle that can be repurposed
- The administration has created a specific entity (US Investment Accelerator) to implement this approach
- This is driven by a specific presidential ideology of "transactional nationalism"

These differences significantly increase the probability above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Intel deal with 10% government stake**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the government intends to acquire stakes in semiconductor companies, we would expect to see exactly this kind of precedent-setting deal
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.1) - If the government had no intention of acquiring stakes in other companies, the Intel deal would be an unusual one-off
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.0
- Direction: Strongly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Explicit exemption of TSMC and Micron**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if the government plans to acquire stakes in some companies, strategic exemptions for certain firms are plausible
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If the government is backing away from the equity approach, we'd expect to see exemptions
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 3: GlobalFoundries confirms no equity stake in its CHIPS funding**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If the government is pursuing equity stakes broadly, allowing GlobalFoundries to avoid this would be surprising
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If the government is not broadly pursuing equity stakes, this outcome is expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Creation of "US Investment Accelerator" to oversee CHIPS**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Creating a dedicated entity aligns with serious intent to implement the equity approach
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - The entity could serve other purposes even without equity stakes
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 5: Narrowing field of potential targets (mainly Samsung and Microchip Technology)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.7) - Focusing efforts on fewer companies increases the chance of success with those specific targets
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - The narrowing could also reflect a scaling back of ambitions
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- Direction: Slightly increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on Intel deal**:
- Prior odds: 1:19 (5%)
- Likelihood ratio: 9.0
- Posterior odds: 9:19 = 0.474
- Posterior probability: 0.474/(1+0.474) = 32.2%

**Update on TSMC/Micron exemption**:
- Prior odds: 0.474
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.474 × 0.5 = 0.237
- Posterior probability: 0.237/(1+0.237) = 19.2%

**Update on GlobalFoundries confirmation of no equity**:
- Prior odds: 0.237
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 0.237 × 0.375 = 0.089
- Posterior probability: 0.089/(1+0.089) = 8.2%

**Update on creation of US Investment Accelerator**:
- Prior odds: 0.089
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.089 × 2.0 = 0.178
- Posterior probability: 0.178/(1+0.178) = 15.1%

**Update on narrowing field of targets**:
- Prior odds: 0.178
- Likelihood ratio: 1.4
- Posterior odds: 0.178 × 1.4 = 0.249
- Posterior probability: 0.249/(1+0.249) = 19.9%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately **20%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the administration's determination to implement this policy broadly
- The Intel deal could create stronger momentum than anticipated
- Private negotiations with Samsung or Microchip Technology might be more advanced than public reporting suggests
- The definition of "acquiring stock" could include warrants or other equity-like instruments that might be more palatable to companies

**Alternative scenarios**:
- The administration could pivot to a hybrid approach (partial equity + subsidies) that makes deals more likely
- Samsung, as a foreign company, might face greater pressure due to tariff threats
- Time constraints might push the administration to accept token equity stakes just to claim victory

**Counterarguments**:
- With three of five named companies already excluded, the probability space has narrowed significantly
- The timeline (by end of 2025) creates practical constraints on complex negotiations
- Companies have significant leverage and can threaten to cancel US investments
- The administration may prioritize actual investment over ideological purity

After considering these factors, I believe my estimate of 20% is reasonable but could be slightly conservative. I'll adjust it upward slightly to account for the possibility of creative deal structures and intense focus on the remaining targets.

## 6. Final Forecast

Based on the historical rarity of government equity stakes in private companies, but accounting for the unprecedented Intel precedent, explicit administration policy, and the narrowed field of potential targets (mainly Samsung and Microchip Technology), I forecast a 22% probability that the US government will acquire stock in at least one of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026.

Final: 22%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is the historical frequency of the US government taking non-crisis, non-bailout equity stakes in major healthy corporations as a form of industrial policy.
*   **Reasoning:** Historically, this is extremely rare. The US government has a long-standing policy of avoiding direct ownership in private industry, preferring tools like subsidies, tax credits, and regulations. Outside of systemic crises (e.g., TARP in 2008) or wartime, direct equity stakes are nearly unprecedented.
*   **Initial Prior:** Based on this historical rarity, the base rate probability is very low. I will set the prior at **5%**. This is slightly higher than a pure historical frequency might suggest, to account for the existence of the CHIPS Act itself, which is already a significant government intervention in the sector. In odds form, this is 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation does not involve a systemic economic crisis or corporate failure, which is consistent with the base case where the government does not intervene with equity.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Administration Ideology:** The primary difference is the hypothetical Trump administration's transactional ideology, which reframes subsidies as "handouts" and equity stakes as "smart deals." This is a radical departure from the norm and the main driver of the potential event.
    2.  **Specific Precedent:** The recent deal with Intel, where the government took a 10% stake, creates a powerful, contemporary precedent that did not exist in the base case. It proves both the administration's intent and its capability to execute such a policy.
    3.  **Existing Mechanism:** The CHIPS Act provides a ready-made legislative and financial vehicle. The administration is not creating a new program but rather changing the terms of an existing one, which is an easier political and bureaucratic lift.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will assess the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the initial 5% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The Intel Deal (US govt. receives 10% stake).**
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is far more likely if the government intends to acquire stock from other companies (H) than if it does not (~H). It establishes a clear precedent and template. This is a "smoking gun" piece of evidence. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is very high (e.g., >10).
    *   **Impact:** Massively increases the probability from the 5% base rate.

*   **Evidence 2: Exemptions for TSMC and Micron.**
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The Trade Secretary explicitly stated the new terms would not apply to TSMC and Micron. This is more likely if the government is not going to acquire stock from any of the remaining companies (~H) than if it is (H). This signals pragmatism, a willingness to compromise, and sets a counter-precedent that other companies can point to. The likelihood ratio is less than 1.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly decreases the probability. It removes two of the five potential companies from consideration.

*   **Evidence 3: GlobalFoundries' deal confirmed to have no equity stake.**
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Similar to the TSMC/Micron exemptions, this confirms another company has secured funding without ceding equity. This further strengthens the counter-precedent. The likelihood ratio is less than 1.
    *   **Impact:** Further decreases the probability. With TSMC and Micron, this means three of the five named companies are now extremely unlikely targets.

*   **Evidence 4: Administration's focus and rhetoric (creating "US Investment Accelerator," threatening tariffs).**
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This is more likely if the administration is serious about pursuing equity deals (H) than if it is not (~H). It demonstrates continued focus and the creation of bureaucratic tools to implement the policy. The likelihood ratio is greater than 1.
    *   **Impact:** Increases the probability. It shows the policy is not just a one-off idea but an ongoing strategic priority.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the updates conceptually.

1.  **Prior:** Start at 5% (Odds 1:19).
2.  **Update for Intel Deal:** The powerful precedent of the Intel deal dramatically overcomes the low base rate. A strong update (e.g., LR of 15) would move the probability to ~44%.
3.  **Update for Exemptions (TSMC, Micron, GF):** This is strong countervailing evidence. It removes 60% of the targets and shows the administration's policy is not absolute. This significantly reduces the probability. If we apply a moderately strong downward update (e.g., LR of 0.5), the probability would fall from 44% to ~28%.
4.  **Update for Continued Focus/Rhetoric:** This shows the administration has not abandoned the policy, increasing the pressure on the remaining two targets (Samsung, Microchip). A modest upward update (e.g., LR of 1.5) would move the probability from 28% to ~38%.

This leaves us with a posterior probability in the high 30s. The question has effectively become: "Will the US acquire stock in Samsung or Microchip Technology before 2026?" The administration's political capital is now focused on these two firms.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overconfidence Check (Case for a lower probability):** The exemptions for three major players (TSMC, Micron, GF) might be the dominant signal. The Intel deal could have been a one-off, and the administration, having secured one big win, may not have the leverage or political will to force the issue with the remaining, resistant companies. Samsung and Microchip can now point to three other companies that received funding without ceding equity.
*   **Blind Spots (Case for a higher probability):** The question resolves "Yes" for *any* amount of stock. This could include warrants (options to buy stock), which are a much less politically difficult concession for a company to make than direct common stock. A deal involving warrants is a plausible compromise that would resolve the question as "Yes." Furthermore, having made exemptions, the administration may be politically determined to secure at least one more equity deal to prove the policy wasn't a failure, thus concentrating immense pressure on the last two targets.
*   **Conclusion:** The possibility of a compromise involving warrants and the intense political pressure on the remaining two firms are significant factors. The arguments for a higher probability seem slightly more compelling than those for a lower one, nudging the estimate slightly upward from the high 30s. The evidence is very mixed, suggesting a probability below 50%, but the path to a "Yes" is very clear and plausible.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial base rate is very low, but the evidence of the Intel deal is a game-changer, proving the administration's intent and ability. However, this is strongly counteracted by the exemptions granted to three of the five companies, which demonstrates pragmatism and provides a powerful negotiating tool for the remaining firms, Samsung and Microchip. The question now hinges on whether the administration's focused pressure on these last two targets will result in at least one of them conceding, perhaps through a compromise involving warrants. The conflicting evidence suggests a probability near the middle of the range. I assess that it is still more likely than not that both remaining companies will successfully resist or delay past the deadline, but the probability of the administration securing at least one deal is substantial.

Final: 42%
