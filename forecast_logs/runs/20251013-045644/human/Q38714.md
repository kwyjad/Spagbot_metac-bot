### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: World Record (WR) Progression (2015-Present).** This period covers the modern era of magnetic cubes and advanced methods. The average time has dropped from 6.95s (Collin Burns, 2015) to 4.09s (Yiheng Wang, June 2024). This represents an average improvement of approximately 0.32 seconds per year. Extrapolating this linear trend from the June 2024 record to November 2025 (1.42 years) suggests a new record of **~3.64 seconds**.
-   **Reference Class 2: Recent "Prodigy" Era (2022-Present).** This class focuses on the period dominated by Max Park and Yiheng Wang, who have traded the record multiple times. The record fell from 5.00s (Tymon Kolasiński, July 2022) to 4.09s (Yiheng Wang, June 2024), a drop of 0.91s in ~2 years, or ~0.46 seconds per year. This faster rate of improvement, extrapolated to Nov 2025, suggests a new record of **~3.44 seconds**.
-   **Limitations:** Both reference classes use linear extrapolation on a phenomenon (human performance limits) that is inherently non-linear. The rate of improvement must slow as times approach physical and cognitive limits. Therefore, these base rates likely represent a lower bound (i.e., a more optimistic forecast) for the eventual record.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-07-16** Rubik's WCA World Championship 2025 concludes. Yiheng Wang wins with a 4.25s average, failing to break his own 4.09s WR. (↓) — Matters because the highest-pressure event of the year did not produce a new record, suggesting the 4.09s mark is a formidable barrier and not easily broken.
-   **2025-06-22** GAN releases the "15 M Pro" cube, featuring a new dual-adjustment magnetic core. Early reviews praise its stability at high speeds. (↓) — Matters because incremental hardware improvements are a primary driver of time drops, and this provides top competitors with a new tool.
-   **2025-05-12** Max Park achieves an unofficial 3.88s average in a recorded practice session, which circulates widely online. (↓) — Matters because it demonstrates that sub-4-second averages are humanly achievable, even if not yet in an official competition, increasing the psychological plausibility.
-   **2025-04-20** WCA announces a record number of sanctioned competitions for the second half of 2025. (↓) — Matters because a higher frequency of official events provides more opportunities for top competitors to attempt and set a new world record.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Hardware Innovation (Large ↓):** New cube designs (e.g., magnetic cores, auto-alignment, tensioning systems) reduce friction, prevent corner-twisting, and improve stability. A technological leap could shave significant fractions of a second off the record.
-   **Methodological Refinements (Moderate ↓):** While the core CFOP method is dominant, cubers continue to learn more efficient algorithms for specific cases (e.g., ZBLL, Winter Variation). AI-driven analysis can uncover novel solutions, but their human application is a gradual process.
-   **Top-Tier Rivalry (Moderate ↓):** The intense competition between a few elite cubers (primarily Yiheng Wang and Max Park) pushes them to innovate and train harder, increasing the likelihood of a record break at any given event they both attend.
-   **Human Performance Limits (Large ↑):** The physical limits of finger dexterity, reaction time, and pattern recognition create a hard floor. As times get faster, each 0.01-second improvement becomes exponentially more difficult, suggesting a plateau is approaching.
-   **Competition Frequency (Small ↓):** More WCA-sanctioned events provide more official opportunities to set a record. While any single event is a long shot, a greater number of attempts increases the overall probability of a new record within a given timeframe.
-   **The "Luck" of the Scramble (Small ↓):** Although scrambles are standardized, some are inherently easier or better suited to a specific solver's style. A fortuitous set of scrambles in a single round remains a key factor in record-breaking averages.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Proximity to Physical Limits:** Unlike the 2015-2020 period where significant time drops were common, the current 4-second barrier is extremely close to perceived human limits. The base rate's linear extrapolation is less reliable here; diminishing returns are a much stronger factor now.
-   **Concentration of Talent:** The world record is currently a two-person race between Yiheng Wang and Max Park. This is different from earlier eras with a wider pool of potential record-breakers. The forecast is highly dependent on the performance and attendance of these two specific individuals.
-   **Stagnation at the Peak:** The 4.09s record has held since June 2024 (in this scenario, for ~16 months). This is a longer-than-average duration for a WR in the recent era, suggesting that the current barrier is significantly harder to break than previous ones and that the base rate of improvement may have slowed.
-   **Psychological Barrier:** Breaking the 4.00-second average barrier is a major psychological milestone. The pressure to be the "first" could either fuel a breakthrough or cause nerves that prevent it in official attempts.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior distribution centered around **3.55 seconds**, derived from averaging the two reference class extrapolations (3.64s and 3.44s), with an "equivalent n" of 10, reflecting moderate confidence in the historical trend.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ large) The 16-month stagnation of the WR, including the failure to break it at the 2025 World Championship, is strong evidence that the rate of improvement has slowed significantly.
    -   (↓ moderate) Unofficial practice times (e.g., Park's 3.88s) confirm that faster times are possible, suggesting the official record is lagging behind peak human potential.
    -   (↓ small) Continued hardware evolution (new GAN cube) provides the necessary tools for a breakthrough, even if the human element is the main bottleneck.
    -   (↓ small) Increased competition frequency provides more "shots on goal" for a record.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence of stagnation at the highest level of competition is the most powerful signal. It should pull the posterior **upwards** (a slower time) from the aggressive prior. The update should be moderate, moving the forecast from ~3.55s to the **3.70s - 3.90s range**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (slower time / no new record):**
    -   Yiheng Wang or Max Park announce a break from competition in November.
    -   Top competitors post online analyses suggesting the 4.09s record involved exceptionally lucky scrambles.
    -   No major, high-stakes competitions are scheduled for November.
    -   Chatter in cubing forums focuses on a performance plateau among the elite.
-   **DOWN indicators (faster time / new record):**
    -   A new official record is set in late October, resetting the baseline.
    -   Either Wang or Park sets a new personal best average close to the 4.00s mark in a smaller competition.
    -   A major competition with a high prize pool is announced for November, attracting top talent.
    -   A competitor outside of the top two (e.g., Tymon Kolasiński) suddenly posts a series of breakthrough results.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Single Point Resolution:** The question resolves on the *fastest* time in the month, which is a single data point. This makes the outcome highly susceptible to outlier events (one perfect performance on one day).
-   **Scramble Luck:** The "average of 3" format dampens but does not eliminate the role of luck. An unusually easy set of five scrambles for a top competitor could produce a record that is not representative of their typical ability.
-   **Data Gap:** There is no systematic data on unofficial practice times. The true potential of top cubers may be much faster than their official records indicate, making a sudden breakthrough hard to predict.
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution depends on a result being officially posted by the WCA for a competition held in November 2025. Delays in result processing are rare but possible. The record must be set *during* November, not just ratified then.
-   **Black Swans:** A sudden retirement, injury to a top competitor, or a disruptive new solving technique (unlikely, but possible) could dramatically alter the landscape.

Final Research Summary: The historical rate of improvement points towards a new record, but a recent 16-month stagnation at the top level suggests we are hitting a performance plateau. The most likely outcome is a marginal improvement on the current 4.09s record, likely falling in the high 3-second range.

To forecast the fastest average solving time of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube during November 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from the historical progression of world records in the modern era (2015-present), focusing on the fastest averages. The mean of the extrapolated records from the reference classes is approximately 3.55 seconds, with a variance reflecting moderate confidence in this trend.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that technological and methodological improvements continue to drive performance gains. However, it differs due to the proximity to human performance limits and the concentration of talent among a few top competitors, which may slow the rate of improvement.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The 16-month stagnation at the top level suggests a slowdown in improvement, making faster outcomes less likely.
   - Unofficial practice times and new hardware innovations indicate potential for faster times, but these are not yet reflected in official records.
   - Increased competition frequency provides more opportunities for record attempts, slightly increasing the likelihood of faster outcomes.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 3.55 seconds, the evidence of stagnation at the top level is the strongest signal, pulling the posterior upwards. The likelihood of faster times from practice sessions and hardware improvements moderates this shift, resulting in a posterior distribution centered around 3.75 seconds.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence in the forecast leads to a slight widening of the distribution to account for tail risks, such as an unexpected breakthrough or a particularly favorable scramble. The alternative forecast might suggest a slower time due to the plateau effect, but the evidence for potential improvements justifies maintaining a forecast in the high 3-second range.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the calibrated percentiles are as follows:

P10: 3.68  
P20: 3.72  
P40: 3.76  
P60: 3.80  
P80: 3.84  
P90: 3.88

# Forecasting the Fastest Average 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube Solving Time in November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the progression of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube average world records:

- Current record (June 2024): 4.09 seconds by Yiheng Wang
- Historical improvement rate (2015-2024): ~0.32 seconds per year
- Recent "prodigy era" improvement rate (2022-2024): ~0.46 seconds per year

Based on these rates and the current record, linear extrapolation suggests a record between 3.44-3.64 seconds by November 2025. However, I need to account for diminishing returns as we approach human physical limits.

My prior distribution will be centered around 3.75 seconds, with a moderate variance to reflect uncertainty about the rate of improvement slowing down.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- The same elite competitors (Wang, Park) continue to dominate
- Hardware improvements continue incrementally
- Competition frequency remains high, providing opportunities

**Differences that matter:**
- We're now in a period of stagnation (16 months without breaking the 4.09s record)
- The psychological barrier of sub-4 seconds is significant
- We're much closer to theoretical human limits than in previous eras
- The rate of improvement has historically slowed as records approach physical limits

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward slower times (higher values):**
- The 16-month stagnation at 4.09s suggests we're hitting a plateau (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood ratio favoring slower times)
- Failure to break the record at the 2025 World Championship, the highest-pressure event (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood ratio)
- The psychological barrier of breaking 4 seconds may create additional pressure (weak evidence, ~1.2x likelihood ratio)

**Evidence pushing toward faster times (lower values):**
- Max Park's unofficial 3.88s average demonstrates sub-4 averages are humanly possible (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood ratio favoring faster times)
- New GAN "15 M Pro" cube with improved technology (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood ratio)
- Record number of sanctioned competitions in late 2025 provides more opportunities (weak evidence, ~1.2x likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 3.75 seconds, I'll update based on the evidence:

First update (stagnation evidence):
- Prior: centered at 3.75s
- Likelihood: 2x favoring slower times
- Posterior: shifts upward to ~3.85s

Second update (unofficial 3.88s practice average):
- Prior: now centered at 3.85s
- Likelihood: 2x favoring faster times
- Posterior: shifts downward to ~3.80s

Third update (new cube technology + more competitions):
- Prior: now centered at 3.80s
- Likelihood: ~1.3x favoring faster times (combined effect)
- Posterior: shifts slightly downward to ~3.75s

The posterior distribution is now centered around 3.75 seconds, but with a wider right tail (more uncertainty toward slower times) due to the conflicting evidence about whether we're hitting a performance plateau.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a breakthrough. If someone manages to consistently execute a new technique or algorithm set, we could see a sudden drop.
- I might be overestimating the psychological barrier. Elite competitors have repeatedly broken through supposed barriers.
- The question asks for the fastest average in November 2025, not necessarily a world record. A non-record but still exceptional time could be the answer.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view would center around 3.50 seconds, arguing that:
1. The unofficial 3.88s average proves sub-4 is achievable
2. More competitions mean more chances
3. The rivalry between Wang and Park will push both to new heights

Rebuttal: While valid points, the 16-month stagnation is a strong signal that improvement is becoming exponentially harder. The unofficial 3.88s hasn't translated to official competition despite multiple attempts.

**Adjustment for tail risks:**
I should widen my distribution to account for:
- Possibility of a breakthrough (extending the left tail)
- Possibility of continued stagnation (extending the right tail)

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 3.45
P20: 3.55
P40: 3.70
P60: 3.85
P80: 4.05
P90: 4.15

Answering the user's question.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary base rate is the historical progression of the 3x3x3 average world record. The research report identifies two relevant reference classes:
- **Long-term modern era (2015-present):** This period saw an average improvement of ~0.32 seconds per year. A linear extrapolation from the June 2024 record of 4.09s to November 2025 suggests a new record of ~3.64s.
- **Recent "Prodigy" era (2022-present):** This period saw a faster improvement rate of ~0.46 seconds per year, suggesting a new record of ~3.44s.

These linear extrapolations are inherently optimistic as they don't account for the law of diminishing returns as performance approaches human physical limits. A more conservative prior, anchored to the current record of 4.09s, would suggest that any improvement will be marginal. I will blend these by establishing a prior distribution centered well below the current record but significantly above the aggressive linear extrapolations. A starting median around **3.90 seconds** seems appropriate, acknowledging the strong historical trend of improvement while respecting the increasing difficulty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation shares similarities with the past, such as intense rivalry at the top (Wang vs. Park) and continuous hardware innovation, both of which drive times down. However, there are crucial differences:
- **Proximity to Limits:** At ~4 seconds, further improvements are exponentially harder than they were at 6 or 7 seconds. Physical limits on reaction time and finger dexterity are becoming a dominant factor.
- **Performance Plateau:** The scenario describes a 16-month stagnation of the world record (from June 2024 to the forecast date in late 2025). This is a significant deviation from the rapid, consistent improvement seen in the base rate period, suggesting the rate of improvement has slowed dramatically.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update the prior based on the specific evidence provided:
- **(↑ Large) 16-month WR Stagnation:** The failure to break the 4.09s record, even at the 2025 World Championship, is the strongest piece of evidence. It is highly consistent with the hypothesis that we are at or near a performance plateau. This strongly pushes the forecast upwards (towards a slower time) and increases the probability that the record is not broken in November at all.
- **(↓ Moderate) Unofficial 3.88s Average:** Max Park's practice time demonstrates that a sub-4-second average is humanly possible. This acts as a proof of concept, pulling the forecast downwards and confirming that the potential for a new record exists, even if it's difficult to achieve under official competition pressure.
- **(↓ Small) New Hardware & Competition Frequency:** The release of a new top-tier cube and a high number of sanctioned events are enabling factors. They increase the opportunities for a record to be broken, providing a small downward push on the forecast.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at **3.90s**, reflecting historical trends.
- **Update 1 (Stagnation):** The 16-month stagnation is powerful evidence. It suggests my prior is too optimistic. I must shift the distribution's center upwards significantly, making a time above 4.00s more likely. The median moves from 3.90s to ~4.05s.
- **Update 2 (Counter-evidence):** The unofficial 3.88s time, new hardware, and competition frequency pull the distribution back down slightly. However, the official stagnation data is more compelling than unofficial practice times. The net effect is a slight downward adjustment from the post-stagnation update.
- **Posterior:** The final posterior distribution should be centered very close to the current world record of 4.09s. The most significant update is realizing that there is a substantial chance the record is *not* broken in November. Therefore, I will set my median (P50) at **4.09s**, representing a 50% chance that the fastest time in November is a new record (<4.09s) and a 50% chance it is not (≥4.09s). The distribution will have a compressed left tail (improvements are hard) and a wider right tail (a month with no peak performances is plausible).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if the 16-month stagnation is merely a temporary plateau before another significant breakthrough, similar to the 0.28s drop that set the 4.09s record. In that scenario, driven by the new hardware and intense rivalry, the record could be shattered, with a time closer to 3.85s. Conversely, I might be underestimating the performance wall. The 4.09s record could have been the result of exceptionally lucky scrambles, making it a difficult peak to reach again. In that case, the fastest time in November could be significantly slower, perhaps in the 4.20s-4.30s range. My final distribution places the median at the current record, balancing these two possibilities, with tails that account for both a breakthrough performance and a month of relative underperformance from the top competitors.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.85
P20: 3.95
P40: 4.02
P60: 4.18
P80: 4.30
P90: 4.45
