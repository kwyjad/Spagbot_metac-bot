### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Questions of Executive Authority:** This class includes cases where the Court reviews a President's significant and novel use of statutory power, particularly when it has vast economic or political effects. In the last decade, the Court has become increasingly skeptical of such executive actions. Examples include striking down the EPA's Clean Power Plan (*West Virginia v. EPA*), the CDC's eviction moratorium (*Ala. Ass'n of Realtors v. HHS*), and OSHA's vaccine mandate (*NFIB v. OSHA*). In these major questions cases, the executive branch's action has been invalidated roughly 70-80% of the time by the current Court. This suggests a high base rate for a ruling against the tariffs.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain (*United States v. Curtiss-Wright*, *Trump v. Hawaii*). In this reference class, the President's actions are upheld more often, perhaps 60-70% of the time. However, these tariffs blur the line between foreign policy and domestic economic regulation (taxation), which is Congress's domain. This reference class points towards a higher probability of "Tariffs lawful" or a "Mixed ruling" that upholds the more security-focused tariffs.
3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Expedited Review (Certiorari Before Judgment):** Granting this rare procedural request signals the Court views the issue as exceptionally important and requiring immediate resolution. It significantly lowers the probability of "No 2025 ruling." It does not, however, strongly predict the substantive outcome, as it has been used in cases with varying results.

**Derived Base Rates:** Blending these classes, the conflict between executive deference in foreign policy and judicial skepticism of broad domestic power is central. Given the current Court's emphasis on the Major Questions Doctrine and separation of powers, the first reference class appears most relevant. A plausible starting point is: **Tariffs unlawful (45%), Mixed ruling (30%), Other ruling (15%), Tariffs lawful (5%), No 2025 ruling (5%).**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms (7-4) that tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. (↑ Unlawful) — A major appellate court, one level below SCOTUS, provides a strong, reasoned judgment against the tariffs, solidifying the legal case for invalidation.
*   **2025-09-03** The government petitions the Supreme Court for review of the *V.O.S. Selections* decision. (↑ Lawful/Mixed) — Signals the executive branch's confidence and commitment to defending its interpretation of IEEPA, ensuring the issue will be decided at the highest level.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates the cases on an expedited schedule. (↓ No 2025 ruling, ↑ Definitive Ruling) — The Court's agreement to hear the case quickly makes a 2025 decision highly probable and signals the issue's national importance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's conservative majority is increasingly using this doctrine to strike down executive actions of "vast economic and political significance" not explicitly authorized by Congress. Imposing tariffs on most U.S. imports fits this description perfectly. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
2.  **Separation of Powers (Taxing Power):** A core argument against the tariffs is that they are functionally taxes, and the Constitution explicitly grants the power "To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" to Congress. This is a powerful, fundamental constitutional argument. (Large driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
3.  **Statutory Interpretation (Textualism):** The government's case rests on IEEPA's text allowing the President to "regulate... importation." Opponents argue this language, in context, refers to sanctions like embargoes, not setting broad tax rates. The Court's textualist majority will scrutinize this language closely. The ambiguity likely cuts against the government under the Major Questions Doctrine. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs unlawful**).
4.  **National Security Deference:** The Court's traditional reluctance to second-guess the President on national emergency declarations. This is the government's strongest argument, particularly for the "trafficking tariffs" linked to drug cartels. (Moderate driver toward **Tariffs lawful** or **Mixed ruling**).
5.  **Chief Justice Roberts' Institutionalism & Off-Ramps:** The Chief Justice often seeks narrow rulings to avoid placing the Court at the center of major political fights. The existence of two different types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) and two different lower court rationales provides a perfect "off-ramp" for a split-the-difference **Mixed ruling** or a procedural punt (**Other ruling**). (Large driver toward **Mixed ruling** or **Other ruling**).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** Unlike past IEEPA uses for targeted sanctions (e.g., against Iran, North Korea), this is a novel application for broad, economy-wide tariffs, making it a textbook case for the Major Questions Doctrine.
*   **Two Distinct Tariff Regimes:** The case involves both "trafficking tariffs" (arguably linked to national security) and "reciprocal tariffs" (based on purely economic trade deficits). This structure is unusual and provides a clear path for a "Mixed ruling" that a typical executive power case lacks.
*   **Unanimity of Lower Courts on the Outcome:** While their reasoning differed, every lower court to rule on the merits found the tariffs unlawful. This creates strong momentum against the government's position, which is not always present in major SCOTUS cases.
*   **Current Court's Doctrinal Commitments:** Compared to the Court that last interpreted IEEPA broadly in 1981 (*Dames & Moore*), the current 6-3 conservative majority is far more skeptical of broad delegations of legislative power to the executive branch.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on **Tariffs unlawful** (~45%) with a substantial probability for **Mixed ruling** (~30%) seems appropriate, reflecting the conflict between the Major Questions Doctrine and national security deference. Equivalent n ≈ 10.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Unlawful/Mixed) The unanimous lower court outcomes against the tariffs provide strong evidence that the government's legal position is weak. (Large)
    *   (↑ Mixed) The dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) creates a salient and logical path for a split decision, making a "Mixed ruling" more probable than in a case with a single executive action. (Moderate)
    *   (↓ No 2025 ruling) The Court's decision to expedite the case makes a ruling before year-end extremely likely. (Large)
    *   (↓ Lawful) The facts of the case align almost perfectly with the Court's recently articulated Major Questions Doctrine, creating a massive headwind for the government's argument for a sweeping victory. (Large)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the initial prior against "Tariffs lawful" and significantly reduces the probability of "No 202

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Tariffs unlawful (45%)**: Based on the Supreme Court's recent trend of invalidating major executive actions under the Major Questions Doctrine, especially when such actions have vast economic implications.
- **Mixed ruling (30%)**: The presence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) suggests a potential for a split decision.
- **Other ruling (15%)**: The possibility of procedural outcomes or narrow rulings that avoid a definitive stance on the tariffs.
- **Tariffs lawful (5%)**: Historical deference to presidential authority in national security matters, though less applicable here due to the economic nature of the tariffs.
- **No 2025 ruling (5%)**: The expedited review process makes a 2025 ruling highly likely, reducing this probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The case fits the pattern of major questions of executive authority, where the Court has been skeptical.
- **Differences**: The dual nature of the tariffs and the unanimous lower court rulings against them provide a unique context that may influence the Court's decision.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Unanimous lower court rulings against tariffs**: Strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful, increasing the probability of "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Expedited Supreme Court review**: Decreases the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling."
- **National security argument for trafficking tariffs**: Provides some support for "Tariffs lawful" or "Mixed ruling," but less compelling given the economic focus of the tariffs.
- **Major Questions Doctrine**: Strong driver towards "Tariffs unlawful," as the tariffs represent a significant economic action not explicitly authorized by Congress.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **Prior for Tariffs unlawful (45%)**: Updated with strong evidence from lower courts and the Major Questions Doctrine, increasing this probability.
- **Prior for Mixed ruling (30%)**: Updated with the dual nature of the tariffs, maintaining or slightly increasing this probability.
- **Prior for Other ruling (15%)**: Considered less likely given the Court's decision to expedite the case.
- **Prior for Tariffs lawful (5%)**: Remains low due to the strong headwinds from the Major Questions Doctrine.
- **Prior for No 2025 ruling (5%)**: Further reduced due to the expedited review.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence check**: The probabilities for "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling" should not be too high given the complexity and potential for unexpected procedural outcomes.
- **Alternative scenarios**: Consider the possibility of a narrow ruling or procedural dismissal, which could lead to an "Other ruling."
- **Adjustments**: Slightly increase "Other ruling" to account for procedural uncertainties.

### 6. Final Normalization
- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format
Final forecast probabilities:

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 50%  
Mixed ruling: 30%  
Other ruling: 10%  
No 2025 ruling: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the current legal context, the Supreme Court's trends, and the specific characteristics of the case.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant Supreme Court precedents and patterns:

**Tariffs unlawful (50%)**: 
- The current Supreme Court has consistently limited executive power under the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) in cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), and *Biden v. Nebraska* (2023).
- The Court has been skeptical of broad statutory interpretations that grant the executive significant economic powers not explicitly authorized by Congress.
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against these tariffs, albeit with different reasoning.

**Mixed ruling (25%)**:
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases.
- The case presents two distinct tariff types (trafficking vs. reciprocal) that could be treated differently.
- Chief Justice Roberts frequently crafts narrow rulings that split the difference in high-profile cases.

**Tariffs lawful (10%)**:
- The Court has historically shown deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security (*Trump v. Hawaii*, *Dames & Moore v. Regan*).
- IEEPA explicitly grants the President power to regulate imports during declared emergencies.

**Other ruling (10%)**:
- The Court sometimes avoids reaching the merits through procedural rulings.
- Standing issues, ripeness concerns, or other procedural off-ramps could be used.

**No 2025 ruling (5%)**:
- The Court has granted expedited review with argument scheduled for November 2025.
- This timeline strongly suggests a ruling before year-end.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- Like other MQD cases, these tariffs represent a novel, expansive interpretation of statutory authority with major economic consequences.
- The case involves classic separation of powers tensions between Congress's taxing power and the President's foreign affairs authority.
- The Court has granted expedited review, suggesting it views the issue as nationally significant.

**Key differences:**
- Unlike many MQD cases, this involves foreign affairs where courts traditionally grant more deference.
- The dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) creates a clearer path for a mixed ruling than typical executive power cases.
- The unanimity of lower courts against the tariffs is unusual and provides stronger momentum against the government's position.
- The case involves a Republican president's actions being reviewed by a conservative-majority Court, potentially reducing ideological predictability.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Lower court unanimity against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = Very high (~90%)
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Very low (~10%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 2: Court's expedited review and consolidation**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~5%)
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = Very high (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly disfavors "No 2025 ruling"

**Evidence 3: Two distinct tariff regimes with different justifications**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~70%)
- P(E|Uniform ruling) = Moderate (~40%)
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Mixed ruling"

**Evidence 4: Court's recent Major Questions Doctrine jurisprudence**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%)
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 5: National security justification for trafficking tariffs**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~70%)
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = Moderate (~40%)
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Mixed ruling" over "Tariffs unlawful"

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the strongest evidence: the Court's recent Major Questions Doctrine jurisprudence.

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 50%
- Prior odds: 50/50 = 1
- Likelihood ratio: 80/20 = 4
- Posterior odds: 1 × 4 = 4
- Posterior probability: 4/(1+4) = 80%

However, this is too extreme. We need to consider the national security deference that might apply to the trafficking tariffs:

For "Mixed ruling" vs. "Tariffs unlawful":
- Starting with updated probabilities: Unlawful (80%), Mixed (25%)
- Likelihood ratio for national security evidence: 70/40 = 1.75
- This shifts probability from "Unlawful" toward "Mixed"

After considering all evidence and interactions between factors:
- "Tariffs unlawful" decreases from 80% to ~55%
- "Mixed ruling" increases from 25% to ~30%
- "Tariffs lawful" remains low at ~5%
- "Other ruling" increases slightly to ~8%
- "No 2025 ruling" decreases to ~2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the Major Questions Doctrine's applicability to foreign affairs.
- The Court might be more deferential to presidential emergency powers than recent cases suggest.
- I might underestimate the Court's desire to avoid appearing partisan by ruling against a Republican president.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs based on national security while striking down the reciprocal tariffs, making "Mixed ruling" more likely.
- The Court could avoid the merits entirely by finding procedural issues, making "Other ruling" more likely.
- The case could become moot if Trump modifies the tariffs before the Court rules.

**Adjustments:**
- Increase "Mixed ruling" probability slightly given the clear path for a compromise.
- Decrease "Tariffs unlawful" slightly to account for national security deference.
- Maintain low probability for "No 2025 ruling" given the expedited schedule.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations and ensuring probabilities sum to 100%:

Tariffs unlawful: 52%  
Mixed ruling: 32%  
Other ruling: 9%  
Tariffs lawful: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%  
(sum 100%)

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 52%
Mixed ruling: 32%
Other ruling: 9%
Tariffs lawful: 5%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider two primary reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

1.  **Major Questions Doctrine Cases:** This class involves the Court reviewing significant executive branch actions of vast economic and political importance that are based on broad, arguably ambiguous, statutory authority. The current Court has a strong tendency to invalidate such actions (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*). The base rate for the executive action being ruled unlawful in this class is high, approximately 70-80%.
2.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs & National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*). In this class, the President's actions are upheld more frequently, perhaps 60-70% of the time.

The current case sits at the intersection of these two classes. The "reciprocal tariffs" on trade deficits align closely with the Major Questions class, while the "trafficking tariffs" have a stronger claim to the national security class. This tension suggests that neither a simple "lawful" nor "unlawful" ruling is a foregone conclusion, and a "mixed" outcome is highly plausible.

Blending these, with more weight on the Major Questions Doctrine given the current Court's clear jurisprudential direction, I establish the following prior:
*   **Tariffs unlawful:** 40%
*   **Mixed ruling:** 35%
*   **Tariffs lawful:** 10%
*   **Other ruling:** 10%
*   **No 2025 ruling:** 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The case is a textbook example for the Major Questions Doctrine: an executive action with massive economic impact based on a novel interpretation of an old, broad statute (IEEPA).
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the existence of two distinct tariff regimes. The "trafficking tariffs" have a colorable national security justification, whereas the "reciprocal tariffs" are based on a purely economic rationale (trade deficits). This factual predicate is unusual and provides the Court with a clear and logical path to a "split-the-baby" or **Mixed ruling**, an option not always available in other executive power cases. Furthermore, the tariffs function as taxes, implicating Congress's exclusive constitutional power to tax, which presents an even stronger separation-of-powers argument against the President than in typical regulatory cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the background scenario:

*   **Evidence A: Multiple lower courts (Court of International Trade, D.C. District Court, and a 7-4 majority in the Federal Circuit) have ruled the tariffs unlawful.**
    *   **P(Evidence A | "Tariffs unlawful" is true):** High. If the government's legal position is fundamentally weak, we would expect to see consistent losses in the lower courts.
    *   **P(Evidence A | "Tariffs unlawful" is not true):** Low. It would be highly unusual for the government to lose in three separate court decisions, including a key appellate court, if its actions were on solid legal ground.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strongly increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling" while significantly decreasing the probability of "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Evidence B: The Supreme Court granted certiorari on an expedited schedule, with arguments in November 2025.**
    *   **P(Evidence B | "No 2025 ruling" is true):** Very Low. An expedited schedule with argument two months before the end of the year makes a ruling before January 1, 2026, extremely likely.
    *   **P(Evidence B | Any other outcome is true):** High. The Court expedites cases of major national importance that it intends to resolve, regardless of the ultimate outcome.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence collapses the probability of "No 2025 ruling" to a very small number, redistributing that probability among the other outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's conceptually update the prior for "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Prior Odds:** P(Lawful) / P(Not Lawful) = 10% / 90% = 1/9.
*   **Evidence:** The string of lower court losses.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood of seeing these consistent losses if the tariffs were actually lawful is very low compared to the likelihood if they were not. Let's estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/4 (i.e., it's four times more likely to see these losses if the tariffs are unlawful/mixed than if they are fully lawful).
*   **Posterior Odds:** (1/9) * (1/4) = 1/36.
*   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 36) ≈ 2.7%.

This formal step demonstrates how the evidence pushes the probability of a complete government victory to a very low number. A similar, though less dramatic, update occurs for the other options. The evidence from the lower courts strongly favors an outcome where the government loses at least in part. The key remaining uncertainty is whether the loss is total ("Unlawful") or partial ("Mixed"). The dual nature of the tariffs makes the "Mixed" option a very compelling path for a majority coalition on the Court, as it allows them to curb the most expansive assertion of executive power (reciprocal tariffs) while still granting some deference on the national security-related tariffs.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis leans heavily on the Major Questions Doctrine and the lower court outcomes. A critical counterargument is that the Court's traditional deference in national security and foreign affairs is a powerful force that I might be underestimating. The government will argue that both sets of tariffs are essential to national security. A majority of justices could be persuaded by this argument, especially in a perceived emergency. This could lead to a "Mixed" or even a surprising "Lawful" ruling. The "Mixed" ruling is the most plausible compromise, allowing the Court to appear tough on executive overreach while not stripping the President of what some might see as vital tools. Therefore, making "Mixed ruling" the slight favorite over a complete "Unlawful" ruling seems like a prudent hedge against overconfidence in a single judicial doctrine. I have also assigned a non-trivial 10% to "Other ruling," acknowledging the possibility that the Chief Justice steers the court to a procedural off-ramp to avoid a direct political clash.

### 6. Final Normalization

After weighing the priors and the evidence, I adjust the probabilities. The likelihood of "No 2025 ruling" is now very low due to the expedited schedule. The likelihood of "Tariffs lawful" is also very low due to the unanimous lower court outcomes and the Major Questions Doctrine. The main contest is between a complete loss for the government ("Unlawful") and a partial one ("Mixed"). Given the factual setup that provides a clean way to split the difference, I assess "Mixed ruling" as the most probable single outcome, slightly ahead of "Tariffs unlawful."

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 43%
Other ruling: 10%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
