### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine (2019) Ebola Outbreaks in DRC:** This is the most relevant reference class, as it accounts for the game-changing rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine and modern response protocols. Since the end of the major Kivu outbreak in 2020, the DRC has experienced four outbreaks (2020, 2021, 2022x2). These resulted in 11, 6, 5, and 1 deaths respectively.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median death toll for this class is ~5. The current outbreak, with 43 deaths, is already a significant outlier (~8x the median). This class suggests that small, quickly contained outbreaks are now the norm.
2.  **All Ebola Outbreaks in DRC (1976-2025):** This class provides a broader historical perspective, capturing the full range of possibilities. The DRC has had 16 outbreaks. The distribution is extremely right-skewed.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median death toll is approximately 40-50. However, the mean is much higher (~250) due to massive outliers like the Kivu (2,287 deaths) and Yambuku (280 deaths) outbreaks. This class highlights the catastrophic tail risk, even if recent history makes it less likely.
3.  **Global Ebola Outbreaks Exceeding 25 Deaths (Post-2014):** This class includes outbreaks that breached initial containment but occurred in the modern era of heightened global response. It includes the West Africa (2014-16, >11,000 deaths), DRC Kivu (2018-20, 2,287 deaths), and Uganda (2022, 55 deaths) outbreaks.
    *   **Base Rate:** This class has no meaningful central tendency but shows that when modern containment fails, the death toll is typically in the high dozens at a minimum, with the potential for thousands. The Uganda 2022 outbreak (caused by the Sudan strain, for which the Ervebo vaccine is ineffective) is a useful proxy for a moderately severe, but ultimately contained, modern outbreak.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province with 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths. — ↑ — Initial numbers suggest a significant cluster was discovered, not just a single index case.
*   **2025-09-07** Reported figures rise to 32 cases and 15 deaths. — ↑ — Slow initial rise, but confirms ongoing transmission at the start of the response.
*   **2025-10-05** WHO reports no new cases in the past 10 days. Cumulative total is 64 cases and 43 deaths. — ↓↓↓ — This is the strongest signal that containment efforts are succeeding and the outbreak may have peaked.
*   **2025-10-07** CDC reports cumulative totals of 64 cases and 43 deaths. — ↔ — Confirms the WHO report and shows the numbers have stabilized for at least a week.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Vaccine Deployment Speed & Efficacy:** The "ring vaccination" strategy (vaccinating contacts and contacts-of-contacts of confirmed cases) is the primary tool for containment. Its rapid and comprehensive implementation is the most powerful lever for controlling an outbreak. (Large impact)
2.  **Community Trust and Security:** The 2018-20 Kivu outbreak demonstrated that community mistrust and armed conflict can completely undermine a public health response, even with effective tools like vaccines. The security situation in Kasaï is a key variable. (Large impact)
3.  **Speed of Detection and Response:** The time between the index case and the implementation of control measures (case isolation, contact tracing, vaccination) is critical. A delayed response allows the virus to spread exponentially. The current toll of 43 suggests a potential delay or a difficult initial environment. (Large impact)
4.  **Geographic Location and Connectivity:** Outbreaks in dense, highly-connected urban centers are far more dangerous than those in remote, rural areas. Kasaï Province's specific geography and transport links will influence the risk of wide dissemination. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Cross-Border Spread:** Kasaï Province borders Angola. The porosity of the border and the extent of cross-border movement create a risk of regional expansion, which would significantly complicate the response. (Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Outlier in the Post-Vaccine Era:** Compared to the tight reference class of post-2019 DRC outbreaks (median deaths ~5), this outbreak's toll of 43 is already an anomaly. This suggests either a late start to the response, a particularly challenging transmission environment, or initial non-cooperation.
*   **Absence of High-Intensity Conflict:** Unlike the Kivu outbreak (Reference Class #2/3), Kasaï Province is not currently an active warzone. This is a major advantage, allowing health workers safer and more reliable access to affected communities.
*   **Mature Response System:** The DRC's Ministry of Health, Africa CDC, and WHO now have extensive, battle-hardened experience in Ebola response. The systems, personnel, and strategies are well-established, which is a significant structural advantage over pre-2014 outbreaks.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026, less than three months away. Given the 21-day incubation period and 42-day period to declare an outbreak over, there is very little time for a catastrophic resurgence to occur and be fully counted.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** An appropriate prior would be a distribution anchored on the Uganda 2022 outbreak (~55 deaths), acknowledging that this outbreak has already broken out of the "small, post-vaccine DRC" base rate. The distribution should have a significant right tail to account for the historical possibility of escalation, but with low probability.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓↓) **No new cases for over 10 days:** This is powerful evidence that the transmission chains have been largely interrupted. This strongly pulls the posterior down towards the current death toll.
    *   (↑) **Initial death toll of 43:** The fact that the outbreak reached this size indicates some initial failure of containment, which prevents us from being overly confident that there are zero remaining transmission chains.
    *   (↓) **Favorable security environment (vs. Kivu):** The absence of major conflict significantly increases the probability of a successful response, justifying a downward update from a worst-case scenario.
    *   (↓) **Short resolution horizon:** With only ~2.5 months remaining, the time for a large number of new infections, subsequent illnesses, and deaths to occur is limited.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the outbreak is under control. The posterior distribution should be heavily concentrated just above the current death toll of 43, with a rapidly decaying tail. The update from the prior is strongly downwards.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new confirmed cases, especially if the transmission link is unknown.
    *   Geographic spread to a new health zone or a major urban center.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or significant community resistance.
    *   A confirmed case linked to this outbreak appearing in a neighboring country (e.g., Angola).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official start of the 42-day countdown to declaring the outbreak over.
    *   Continued reports of "zero new cases" in weekly WHO/DRC MoH situation reports.
    *   High reported coverage rates for ring vaccination around the last known cases.
    *   All known contacts completing their 21-day monitoring period without symptoms.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag & Revision:** Official numbers from the DRC Ministry of Health can be delayed and are subject to revision, especially the classification of "probable" vs. "confirmed" cases/deaths.
*   **Hidden Transmission:** A small, undetected chain of transmission could still exist in a remote area, which could reignite the outbreak.
*   **Flare-up Risk:** Ebola can persist in survivors and cause flare-ups months or years later. While a new, unrelated outbreak is excluded, a late flare-up from a survivor of *this* outbreak before Jan 1, 2026 would count.
*   **Resolution Definition:** The final number is determined by the DRC Ministry of Health. Political or administrative factors could influence the final official tally.

Final Research Summary: The outbreak is already larger than typical post-vaccine outbreaks in the DRC, but strong recent evidence of containment (no new cases in over 10 days) suggests the final death toll will not be substantially higher than the current 43.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province before 2026, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the post-vaccine Ebola outbreaks in the DRC, with a median death toll of ~5. However, given the current outbreak's death toll of 43, we should consider a broader historical perspective. The Uganda 2022 outbreak, with 55 deaths, serves as a useful prior, acknowledging the potential for moderate escalation but also the effectiveness of modern containment strategies.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The prior mean is around 55 deaths, with a significant right tail to account for potential escalation.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The outbreak is occurring in a post-vaccine era with established response protocols, similar to recent outbreaks.
   - **Differences:** The current outbreak has already exceeded the typical post-vaccine death toll, indicating initial containment challenges. However, the absence of conflict and the mature response system are favorable factors.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **No new cases for over 10 days:** Strong evidence of containment, suggesting a downward adjustment.
   - **Initial death toll of 43:** Indicates some initial containment failure, preventing overconfidence in zero remaining transmission chains.
   - **Favorable security environment:** Increases the probability of successful containment, justifying a downward adjustment.
   - **Short resolution horizon:** Limits the time for a significant increase in deaths, supporting a downward adjustment.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood:** The evidence strongly suggests the outbreak is under control. The posterior distribution should be concentrated just above the current death toll of 43, with a rapidly decaying tail.
   - **Shift:** The posterior mean is slightly above 43, with reduced variance compared to the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of hidden transmission or data lag. Adjust for potential underestimation of tail risks.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A small, undetected chain of transmission could lead to a resurgence. However, the short time horizon and current containment success make this less likely.
   - **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for these risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the final percentiles are:

P10: 43  
P20: 44  
P40: 45  
P60: 46  
P80: 48  
P90: 50

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a hybrid prior based on three reference classes:

1. **Post-vaccine DRC outbreaks (2020-2024)**: Median ~5 deaths, with outbreaks of 11, 6, 5, and 1 deaths.
2. **All DRC outbreaks (1976-2025)**: Median ~45 deaths, mean ~250 deaths (highly skewed by major outbreaks).
3. **Recent outbreaks exceeding 25 deaths**: The 2022 Uganda outbreak (55 deaths) is particularly relevant as a modern outbreak that gained initial momentum but was ultimately contained.

Given that the current outbreak has already reached 43 deaths, I'll center my prior on the Uganda 2022 outbreak (~55 deaths) with a right-skewed distribution to account for the possibility of further escalation. This acknowledges that we've already exceeded the typical post-vaccine outbreak size but incorporates the modern response capabilities.

Prior distribution: Median ~55, with a 90% interval of approximately [45, 150] deaths.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Modern response protocols and vaccine availability (similar to post-2019 outbreaks)
- Occurring in the DRC, where health authorities have extensive Ebola experience
- Initial case detection and response systems are operational

**Key differences:**
- Already reached 43 deaths, making it the largest outbreak since the Kivu epidemic
- No new cases reported in the past 10 days, suggesting containment is working
- Short time horizon (less than 3 months until resolution date)
- Absence of high-intensity conflict (unlike the Kivu outbreak)
- Kasaï Province has different geographic and demographic characteristics than previous outbreak locations

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing the forecast upward:**
- Initial size of 43 deaths indicates delayed detection or challenging initial environment (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher outcomes)
- The outbreak reached 64 cases, suggesting multiple transmission chains were established (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher outcomes)

**Evidence pushing the forecast downward:**
- No new cases reported for over 10 days as of October 5, 2025 (likelihood ratio ~10:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Confirmed case count has stabilized at 64 for at least a week (likelihood ratio ~5:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Short time window until resolution (less than 3 months) limits potential for significant growth (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Absence of conflict in Kasaï Province enables better response compared to Kivu (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring lower outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 55 deaths with a 90% interval of [45, 150]:

The strongest evidence is the absence of new cases for over 10 days, which strongly suggests the outbreak is being contained. This shifts my distribution significantly downward and narrows it.

Applying this update:
- Prior median: 55 deaths
- Likelihood ratio from "no new cases for 10+ days": ~10:1 favoring lower outcomes
- This shifts my posterior median closer to the current death toll of 43
- The posterior becomes more concentrated around values just above 43

The combined effect of all evidence suggests:
- Posterior median: ~45-47 deaths (slightly above current toll)
- Posterior 90% interval narrowing to approximately [43, 65]
- The distribution becomes less right-skewed as catastrophic outcomes become less likely

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overconfident in the "no new cases" report. Data from outbreak zones can be unreliable or delayed.
- The case fatality rate (43/64 = ~67%) is higher than typical Ebola outbreaks (~50%), suggesting potential undetected cases.
- Ebola can persist in survivors and cause flare-ups months later, which could lead to additional deaths before January 2026.
- Cross-border spread to Angola remains a possibility that could complicate containment.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would forecast a higher death toll (~60-70) based on:
1. Potential hidden transmission chains in remote areas
2. The high case fatality rate suggesting incomplete case detection
3. Historical patterns where outbreaks often have late-stage cases

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The 10+ days without new cases is a strong signal of containment, and with each passing day without cases, the probability of undetected chains diminishes. The short time window until resolution further limits potential growth.

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these considerations, particularly extending the upper tail to acknowledge the possibility of undetected cases or flare-ups.

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is not simply historical Ebola outbreaks, but modern outbreaks that have breached initial, rapid containment. The current outbreak, with 43 deaths, has already surpassed the small, post-vaccine flare-ups in the DRC (which had a median of ~5 deaths). Therefore, a better prior is the 2022 Uganda outbreak, which was caused by a different strain (Sudan) but represents a modern, moderately severe (55 deaths), yet ultimately contained outbreak. This provides a prior distribution with a median around 55-60 deaths, acknowledging that once an outbreak reaches dozens of fatalities, it has the potential to grow further, but also that modern response is generally effective. This prior should be right-skewed to account for the historical tail risk of major epidemics.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in Kasaï, DRC has key differences from the Uganda 2022 base case:
*   **Similarities:** It is a modern outbreak that has exceeded the scale of a minor flare-up, requiring a significant public health response.
*   **Differences (Favorable):**
    *   **Effective Vaccine:** The current outbreak is presumed to be the Zaire ebolavirus, for which the Ervebo vaccine is highly effective. This was not the case in the Uganda 2022 (Sudan virus) outbreak, giving responders a much more powerful containment tool.
    *   **Experienced Response:** The DRC Ministry of Health and its partners have more recent and extensive experience managing large Ebola outbreaks than any other country.
    *   **Security:** Kasaï Province is not experiencing the high-intensity armed conflict that severely hampered the 2018-20 Kivu response, allowing for safer and more effective operations.
These differences suggest that, all else being equal, the final toll should be lower than the Uganda base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence from the research report:
*   **(↓↓↓) No new cases for over 10 days (as of Oct 5-7):** This is the single most important piece of evidence. It is highly consistent with a scenario where transmission chains have been successfully interrupted and the outbreak has peaked. This evidence provides a very strong downward update to the prior, pulling the forecast's center of mass towards the current death toll.
*   **(↑) Initial toll of 43 deaths:** The fact that the outbreak reached this size before being controlled indicates some initial challenge, such as a delay in detection or a rapid initial spread. This prevents us from being completely certain that all transmission chains are extinguished, justifying a small right tail on the distribution for a potential flare-up.
*   **(↓) Short Resolution Timeframe:** The question resolves on January 1, 2026, which is less than three months away. Ebola's incubation and disease progression timeline means there is a limited window for a catastrophic resurgence to occur and be fully reflected in the official death statistics. This truncates the extreme right tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A right-skewed distribution with a median around 55-60 deaths.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The evidence of "no new cases for 10+ days" is overwhelmingly more likely if the outbreak is contained than if it is still growing. This powerful likelihood ratio drastically shifts the posterior distribution downwards.
*   **Posterior:** The prior median of ~60 is pulled down sharply by the evidence. The new posterior distribution is now heavily concentrated just above the current confirmed death toll of 43. The median of my posterior is around 45, reflecting the possibility of a few more deaths among the 21 currently ill patients (out of 64 total cases). The distribution retains a slight right skew to account for the small possibility of a newly discovered or re-ignited transmission chain.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the "no new cases" report being accurate and holding. A critical risk is a hidden chain of transmission in a remote community that could re-seed the outbreak. An alternative scenario is that the outbreak is merely in a temporary lull. A more pessimistic forecaster might put the median closer to the Uganda outcome of 55.

However, I rebut this by emphasizing the power of the effective vaccine and the short time horizon. Even if a new cluster emerged tomorrow, it would be met with a rapid ring vaccination campaign, and there is limited time for it to cause a large number of deaths before the resolution date. My upper percentiles (P80, P90) are set to account for this "one last cluster" scenario, with the P90 at 55, matching the Uganda reference case as a plausible but unlikely upper bound. The floor of the forecast is the current death toll of 43.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 43
P40: 44
P60: 46
P80: 51
