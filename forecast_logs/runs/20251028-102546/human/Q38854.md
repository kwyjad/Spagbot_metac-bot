### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New Federal Tech Regulatory Regimes:** Establishing a new federal licensing body or requirement for a novel technology (e.g., commercial drones, genetic engineering) is a multi-year process. It involves extensive hearings, agency rulemaking (per the Administrative Procedure Act), and often legal challenges. The base rate of a new, complex licensing regime going from proposal to binding law in under two years is very low, likely **<5%**. The timeline for this question is even shorter.
2.  **Major California Tech Legislation:** California acts faster than the federal government but still follows a structured legislative process. Major bills like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) were debated over multiple sessions and had implementation delays. The base rate of a novel, economically significant regulatory bill being introduced and signed into law within a single calendar year is perhaps **20-30%**. The rate of passage in the final two months of a year, outside of a special session, is near zero.
3.  **Industry-Specific Licensing Mandates:** The creation of licensing requirements for professions or specific activities (e.g., financial services, construction permits) typically occurs in response to demonstrated, repeated harms. The process is often slow and driven by incumbent desire to create barriers to entry. The base rate for a brand-new field with amorphous risks is low, but the call for regulation from industry leaders is a notable accelerant.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-23] Report on Altman's prediction of AGI within 5 years highlights societal unpreparedness. ↑ — Increases the perceived urgency for regulation among policymakers, though it doesn't create a legislative vehicle.
*   [2025-10-17] Article details OpenAI's need for $400 billion for a massive infrastructure buildout. ↓ — Indicates the industry's primary focus is on scaling and competition, not navigating a new compliance regime. Lobbying efforts likely focus on securing resources, not finalizing regulations.
*   [2025-10-08] Altman interview discusses GPT-5 and Sora, focusing on product and capability advancements. ↔︎ — Reinforces the rapid pace of AI development, a driver for regulation, but the lack of discussion on a legislative push suggests it's not an immediate corporate priority.
*   [2025-09-30] (Hypothetical but procedurally necessary) The 2025 regular session of the California State Legislature adjourns. ↓↓↓ — This is a critical blocker. Without a special session, no new state-level licensing bill can pass in California before 2026.
*   [2025-09-29] Report on Altman's prediction that AGI could arrive before 2030. ↑ — Similar to other predictions, this adds to the background pressure on D.C. to act, but the effect is small given the short time horizon.
*   [2025-06-16] Altman's prediction of AI making "novel insights" in 2026 is widely reported. ↑ — Fuels the narrative that AI is approaching a critical capability threshold, justifying pre-emptive government oversight.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Legislative Clock & Gridlock (Large, Down):** The single most important factor. With ~60 days to resolution, and Congress facing holiday recesses and likely gridlock, the window for passing standalone legislation is effectively closed. The California legislature is not in regular session. This is the primary driver towards NO.
2.  **Catastrophic AI Incident (Large, Up):** A major, publicly visible AI-caused disaster (e.g., a large-scale cybersecurity breach, critical infrastructure disruption, or severe election interference) is the only plausible mechanism that could force an emergency legislative session or executive action.
3.  **Regulatory Capture by Incumbents (Moderate, Up):** Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have incentives to support licensing to raise barriers for new competitors. Their support provides political cover for regulation, but their lobbying power cannot overcome the legislative calendar in this timeframe.
4.  **Executive Action (Small, Up):** The White House could, in theory, use an Executive Order to direct an agency (like the Department of Commerce) to create a registration or permitting process. However, this would likely be a "soft" requirement (e.g., voluntary reporting) and would face immediate legal challenges if it imposed a hard licensing gate without Congressional authority.
5.  **Geopolitical Competition (Moderate, Down):** The argument that burdensome licensing will cede the U.S.'s lead in AI to China is a powerful and frequently used tool by opponents of regulation, making it harder for even motivated politicians to pass restrictive laws quickly.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Unprecedented Speed of Capability Gains:** Unlike the development of aviation or nuclear power, AI capabilities are advancing month-to-month. This creates a sense of urgency not present in most historical regulatory analogies.
2.  **Industry Leaders Calling for Regulation:** It is highly unusual for the CEO of the leading company in a new field (Sam Altman) to publicly call for his own industry to be licensed. This changes the political dynamic from a simple industry vs. government fight.
3.  **Amorphous and Speculative Risks:** The primary risks motivating licensing (AGI, existential risk) are forward-looking and speculative, unlike the concrete, demonstrated harms (e.g., plane crashes, financial fraud) that typically precede licensing regimes. This makes it harder to build broad political consensus.
4.  **Extreme Time Compression:** The question's deadline of Dec 31, 2025, from the current date of Oct 28, 2025, makes this case radically different from any standard legislative reference class. We are not forecasting if a law will eventually pass, but if it will pass in the next ~60 days.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the reference class of major federal/state tech regulation would be low, perhaps 10%, given the complexity and typical multi-year timeline.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ small) Persistent high-level rhetoric from industry leaders (Altman) and accelerating AI capabilities create a political environment conducive to regulation.
    *   (↓↓↓ large) The legislative calendar is the dominant piece of evidence. With the California session over and Congress entering a holiday period, the procedural path to passing and signing a new law is virtually non-existent.
    *   (↓ moderate) The focus of industry players appears to be on capital-intensive scaling and competition, not on the final push for a specific licensing bill.
    *   (↑ small) The possibility of a "black swan" AI incident that triggers an emergency response remains, preventing the probability from being absolute zero.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces a NO resolution. The procedural and timeline-based evidence overwhelms the general sentiment for regulation. The posterior should be revised significantly downward from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The President or Governor of California declaring a state of emergency related to AI.
    *   A major AI company announcing it is pausing a model deployment due to a newly discovered dangerous capability.
    *   A key senator (e.g., Schumer) attempting to attach an AI licensing amendment to a must-pass omnibus spending bill.
    *   The announcement of a special legislative session in California to address AI.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Congress adjourning for the year without any action on AI licensing.
    *   White House announcements on AI that focus on international cooperation or R&D funding, not immediate regulation.
    *   Major AI labs announcing new, more powerful models without any accompanying policy crisis.
    *   Media attention shifting decisively to other topics (e.g., budget, international conflict).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria "license or permit of some type" is broad. A very lightweight registration requirement implemented via executive action could potentially satisfy this, though it's a stretch.
*   **Black Swan Risk:** The forecast is highly sensitive to a low-probability, high-impact AI safety or security event. Such an event would invalidate the base rate assumptions based on normal political process.
*   **Legislative Sleight of Hand:** A licensing provision could be inserted deep inside a massive, unrelated "must-pass" bill at the last minute, bypassing normal debate and scrutiny. This is a known, albeit uncommon, legislative tactic.
*   **State vs. Federal Action:** While California is the most likely state, another state with a surprising legislative push could theoretically act, though this is highly improbable. The focus should remain on CA and Federal levels.

**Final Research Summary:** The legislative clock is the decisive factor. Despite ongoing discussions about AI's risks and calls for regulation, there is no viable legislative or regulatory vehicle in either the US Congress or the California legislature that could realistically become law in the next two months. Barring a major "black swan" AI incident that forces emergency action, this will resolve NO.

To forecast the probability of the US or California requiring licenses to train large AI models before 2026, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a new federal tech regulatory regime being established in under two years is very low, likely <5%, due to the complexity and typical multi-year timeline. For California, the base rate for major tech legislation within a single year is 20-30%. Given the short timeline and the nature of the event, a reasonable prior probability might be around 10%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a novel technology with significant societal impact, similar to past tech regulations.
   - Differences: The legislative calendar is nearly closed, and the risks are speculative rather than demonstrated, making immediate action less likely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Legislative Calendar (↓↓↓ large):** The California session is over, and Congress is nearing recess, making new legislation highly unlikely.
   - **Industry Focus (↓ moderate):** Industry players are focused on scaling and competition, not regulation.
   - **High-Level Rhetoric (↑ small):** Persistent calls for regulation from industry leaders create a conducive environment but lack immediate legislative action.
   - **Black Swan Event (↑ small):** A major AI incident could force emergency action, but this is speculative.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 10% (0.1)
   - Likelihood ratio: Dominated by the legislative calendar, which strongly decreases the probability.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.1 × (very low likelihood of legislative action) = significantly lower than 10%.
   - Posterior probability: Given the overwhelming evidence against immediate legislative action, the probability is revised downward significantly.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could underestimate the impact of a black swan event or executive action.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden AI-related crisis could prompt emergency measures, though this remains unlikely.
   - Adjustments: Consider the small but non-zero probability of an unexpected event forcing action.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the overwhelming procedural barriers and the short timeline, the probability of requiring licenses by 2026 is very low.
   - Final: 2%

# Will the US or California require licenses to train large AI models before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on the likelihood of new regulatory regimes being established in a short timeframe.

The most appropriate reference class is the rate at which major new technology licensing regimes are established at either the federal or California state level within a compressed timeframe (approximately 2 months from now until the end of 2025).

**Base rate considerations:**
- New federal regulatory regimes typically take years to establish, from initial proposal through committee hearings, floor votes, agency rulemaking, and implementation
- California can move faster but still follows a structured legislative process
- The California legislature is not in regular session for the remainder of 2025
- Congress faces holiday recesses and likely gridlock in the remaining weeks of 2025

**Prior probability:** 5%

This low prior reflects the extremely compressed timeline (only about 60 days remaining in 2025) and the procedural hurdles that make passing and implementing a new licensing regime nearly impossible without extraordinary circumstances.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other regulatory processes, AI licensing would require defining scope, establishing standards, and creating enforcement mechanisms
- The political dynamics of industry lobbying, public interest concerns, and legislative priorities follow similar patterns
- The procedural requirements for passing legislation remain unchanged

**Key differences:**
- Industry leaders (notably Sam Altman) have publicly called for regulation, which is unusual and could accelerate the process
- The perceived risks of AI are rapidly evolving with new capabilities being announced regularly
- The timeline is extremely compressed (only ~60 days remaining in 2025)
- The legislative calendar is a major constraint - California's legislature is not in regular session

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Legislative calendar constraints**
- P(Calendar constraints | Licensing happens) = 0.05 (It would be extremely unusual for major legislation to pass outside regular sessions)
- P(Calendar constraints | Licensing doesn't happen) = 0.95 (These constraints typically prevent rapid legislative action)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Industry leaders calling for regulation**
- P(Industry leaders call for regulation | Licensing happens) = 0.8 (This would be expected if licensing is imminent)
- P(Industry leaders call for regulation | Licensing doesn't happen) = 0.3 (Companies might call for regulation they don't expect to materialize)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Focus on AI scaling and competition**
- P(Focus on scaling | Licensing happens) = 0.3 (Companies would likely be more focused on compliance if licensing were imminent)
- P(Focus on scaling | Licensing doesn't happen) = 0.9 (Without imminent regulation, companies focus on growth)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Accelerating AI capabilities and predictions**
- P(Accelerating capabilities | Licensing happens) = 0.7 (Rapid advancement could trigger regulatory action)
- P(Accelerating capabilities | Licensing doesn't happen) = 0.6 (Advancement happens regardless of regulation)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.6 = 1.17
- This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on legislative calendar constraints:**
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio: 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.053 = 0.0028
- Posterior probability: 0.0028/(1 + 0.0028) = 0.28%

This dramatic decrease reflects the reality that without a legislative vehicle or special session, passing a licensing requirement is nearly impossible.

**Update on industry leaders calling for regulation:**
- Prior odds: 0.0028/0.9972 = 0.0028
- Likelihood ratio: 2.67
- Posterior odds: 0.0028 × 2.67 = 0.0075
- Posterior probability: 0.0075/(1 + 0.0075) = 0.74%

**Update on focus on scaling and competition:**
- Prior odds: 0.0075/0.9925 = 0.0075
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.0075 × 0.33 = 0.0025
- Posterior probability: 0.0025/(1 + 0.0025) = 0.25%

**Update on accelerating AI capabilities:**
- Prior odds: 0.0025/0.9975 = 0.0025
- Likelihood ratio: 1.17
- Posterior odds: 0.0025 × 1.17 = 0.0029
- Posterior probability: 0.0029/(1 + 0.0029) = 0.29%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of emergency executive action in response to a crisis
- I might be overlooking potential "backdoor" regulatory paths like attaching licensing requirements to must-pass legislation
- The definition of "license" could be interpreted broadly to include lightweight registration requirements

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major AI safety incident occurs in November/December 2025, triggering emergency regulatory action
- The White House issues an Executive Order creating a temporary registration requirement that functions like a license
- A special legislative session is called in California specifically to address AI risks

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should increase my probability slightly to account for these low-probability but plausible paths to licensing requirements. The procedural barriers remain extremely high, but emergency actions could bypass normal processes.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, I arrive at a final probability of 2%. This reflects the extremely compressed timeline, the absence of a legislative vehicle, and the procedural barriers to establishing a new licensing regime in the next 60 days. While there are some pathways to a "yes" resolution (primarily through emergency action), they remain highly unlikely.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the establishment of a new, mandatory licensing regime for a novel and complex technology (large AI models) at either the federal or California state level within a very short timeframe (approximately two months).

- **Federal Legislation:** The base rate for passing major, new federal legislation creating a regulatory body or licensing requirement is very low, typically taking multiple years of debate, hearings, and negotiation. The probability of such a law passing from the current state to being signed into law in ~60 days is exceedingly small, likely less than 1%.
- **California Legislation:** While California can legislate faster than the federal government, its regular 2025 legislative session has already adjourned. For a new law to pass, the governor would need to call a rare special session, which is reserved for emergencies. The base rate for this is also extremely low.
- **Combined Prior:** A reasonable prior probability, accounting for the high salience of AI as a political topic but constrained by procedural reality, would be low. I will set the prior at **5%**. This is a generous starting point that acknowledges the political pressure to act, while respecting the immense institutional inertia. In odds, this is 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Like other complex regulatory efforts (e.g., for aviation, nuclear power, or biotech), creating an AI licensing regime involves balancing innovation, economic competitiveness, and safety. It faces hurdles from industry lobbying (from those who oppose it) and legislative gridlock.
- **Differences:**
    - **Extreme Time Constraint (Negative):** The most critical difference is the deadline of December 31, 2025. With the current date being October 28, 2025, there are only about two months left. This makes the standard legislative process, which is the base case, virtually impossible.
    - **Industry Calls for Regulation (Positive):** Unusually, leaders of top AI labs (like OpenAI's Sam Altman) have publicly called for licensing. This provides political cover for regulation and could accelerate the process, though it cannot create legislative time that doesn't exist.
    - **Potential for "Black Swan" Events (Positive):** The perceived risk of a catastrophic AI incident is high. A major, publicly visible disaster could trigger an emergency response that bypasses normal procedures, unlike the more predictable risks that drove regulation in other fields.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that a license is required, and ~H be the event that it is not.

- **Evidence 1: The Legislative Calendar.** The California legislature's regular session is over, and the US Congress is nearing its end-of-year recess with a full agenda and typical gridlock.
    - P(E | H): The probability of seeing a closed legislative calendar, if a new law were to pass, is extremely low. It would require an extraordinary event.
    - P(E | ~H): This is exactly the state of affairs we would expect if no new law is passed.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H))**: << 0.1. This is extremely strong evidence against H.

- **Evidence 2: Lack of a Specific Legislative Vehicle.** There is no prominent, late-stage bill for AI licensing currently being fast-tracked through Congress or a California special session.
    - P(E | H): If a law were to pass in two months, we would almost certainly see a specific bill being the subject of intense, final-stage negotiations now. Its absence is very surprising if H is true.
    - P(E | ~H): The absence of a specific bill is perfectly consistent with no law passing.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: << 0.1. This is also very strong evidence against H.

- **Evidence 3: Potential for Non-Legislative Action.** The White House could issue a strong Executive Order (EO), or a licensing provision could be attached as a rider to a must-pass bill (e.g., a government funding bill).
    - This is not evidence that has occurred, but rather a potential mechanism. It represents the most plausible pathway for H to occur. The existence of the EO pathway makes H more likely than it would be if it depended solely on standalone legislation. This evidence slightly increases the probability relative to a scenario with no EO option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1:19 (5% probability).
- **Update Step:** The overwhelming evidence is the legislative clock (Evidence 1 & 2). This is a powerful "reality check" on the prior. The likelihood ratio for this evidence is extremely small, let's say 1/20.
    - Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/19) × (1/20) = 1/380.
    - This corresponds to a probability of ~0.26%.
- **Considering Alternative Paths:** This calculation assumes the legislative path is the only one. However, the possibility of an executive order or a "black swan" event provides an alternative route. The final probability should reflect the chance of one of these extraordinary events occurring. I estimate the probability of a sufficiently strong EO, a successful legislative rider, or a crisis-driven emergency action happening in the next two months to be in the low single digits. A combined estimate for these "outs" is around 2-3%.

The initial 5% prior is therefore reduced dramatically by the legislative reality, settling at a final probability that is essentially the estimated chance of an extraordinary event.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Main risk to this forecast:** I am underestimating the plausibility of a non-legislative solution. The Biden administration's prior EO on AI already established a reporting framework. A new EO could strengthen this into a *de facto* permit system (e.g., requiring approval of safety tests before training can commence). This would be legally contentious but is the most viable path to a "YES".
- **Alternative forecast:** A forecaster who believes a "YES" is more likely might argue that the political pressure from another AI capability leap (e.g., GPT-5 release) could force the White House to act decisively via EO, and that this would meet the resolution criteria. They might place the odds at 10-15%.
- **Rebuttal:** While possible, creating a true "license" (a prior restraint on activity) via EO without explicit Congressional authority is a significant expansion of executive power that would be immediately challenged in court. It is more likely any new EO would expand reporting requirements rather than create a hard gate.
- **Conclusion:** The risk of an EO-based resolution is real and is the primary reason the forecast is not 1%. The 3% estimate accounts for this possibility while still acknowledging it as a low-probability event.

### Final Forecast
The probability of the US or California implementing a licensing requirement for training large AI models before 2026 is extremely low. The primary barrier is the legislative calendar, as normal procedural paths for creating such a law are closed for the remainder of 2025. The forecast therefore hinges on the small probability of an extraordinary event, such as a crisis-driven emergency action, a provision being attached to a must-pass bill, or a legally aggressive Executive Order that establishes a permit-like system. I assess the combined probability of these events as being very small.
