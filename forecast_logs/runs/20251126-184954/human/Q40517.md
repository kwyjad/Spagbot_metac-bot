### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Fiscal Years with Delayed Appropriations (since FY2000):** In the 25 fiscal years from FY2000 to FY2024, Congress has rarely completed all appropriations bills by the October 1 deadline. It is common for work to extend into December. In this period, the median number of bills enacted by January 1 is low, often zero, with the work being completed via large omnibus packages or further CRs. The base rate of passing *additional* bills between late November and December 31, after a CR has already been passed to punt the deadline into the following year, is very low. In most such cases, zero additional bills are passed in that window.
2.  **Fiscal Years with Government Shutdowns:** Shutdowns signal significant partisan disagreement. In the aftermath of a shutdown and the passage of a short-term CR, the focus of legislative energy shifts entirely to the new CR expiration date. The period between the CR's passage and the holidays is typically used for behind-the-scenes negotiation, not floor votes on final bills. The base rate of enacting appropriations bills during a lame-duck session *after* a shutdown and *before* the holidays is near zero.
3.  **Appropriations under Divided Government:** In years with a divided government (different parties controlling the House, Senate, or White House), appropriations are consistently delayed. The process is characterized by brinkmanship, with action concentrated just before CR expirations. The base rate for proactive, early passage of the most contentious bills is extremely low.

**Conclusion:** All relevant reference classes suggest a strong prior that no additional bills will be passed before January 1. The legislative calendar and incentives are not aligned for action in this window. The base rate for the number of *additional* bills passed is heavily skewed towards 0.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-early** A CR is passed funding the government through Jan 30, 2026, and three FY2026 appropriations bills are enacted. **↓** This is the most critical event. By setting the next "fiscal cliff" on Jan 30, it removes nearly all urgency to act before Dec 31, 2025. The three enacted bills were the least controversial, leaving only the most difficult ones.
*   **2025-10-01 to 2025-11-early** The longest government shutdown in U.S. history occurs. **↓** This indicates an exceptionally high level of partisan acrimony and distrust, making compromise on the nine remaining, more controversial bills extremely difficult.
*   **2025-06 to 2025-08** House and Senate committees advance the three least controversial bills (MilCon-VA, Ag, Leg Branch). **↑** This early, bipartisan work explains *why* these three bills were ready to be enacted in November. However, it has no bearing on the remaining nine bills, which did not see similar progress.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **CR Expiration Date as an Action-Forcing Event:** The Jan 30, 2026 deadline is the primary driver of future action. With over two months of funding secured, there is no immediate pressure to negotiate or vote on complex bills in December. (Large impact)
2.  **Congressional Calendar (Holiday Recess):** The powerful incentive for members of Congress to leave Washington D.C. for Thanksgiving and Christmas recess is a major barrier to legislative action in late November and December. (Large impact)
3.  **Concentrated Controversy:** The three enacted bills are consistently the easiest to pass. The remaining nine (e.g., Labor-HHS, Homeland Security, Defense, State-Foreign Ops) contain the vast majority of contentious policy riders and funding disputes. Bundling them requires a complex "grand bargain" that is unlikely to materialize in a few weeks. (Large impact)
4.  **Leadership Strategy:** Congressional leaders may prefer to use the Jan 30 deadline to maximize leverage, rather than settling for a deal in December. A pre-holiday deal would be seen as a concession by the base of one or both parties. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Political Capital Depletion:** The protracted shutdown and contentious CR fight have likely exhausted the political will and capital needed for another major legislative lift before the new year. (Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Partisan Dysfunction:** The background notes the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This is not a typical delay; it signals a level of political breakdown far exceeding the reference class average, making further compromise less likely.
*   **"Easy" Bills Already Cleared:** Unlike years where all 12 bills are unresolved, three have already been passed. This is unusual and fundamentally changes the task from passing a mix of easy and hard bills to passing *only* the hard ones.
*   **Unambiguous Next Deadline:** The CR's expiration on January 30, 2026, is a clear, hard deadline. In some past scenarios, the path forward was less certain. Here, the timeline is set, and it does not include a pre-2026 deadline.
*   **Lame-Duck Session Context:** The November/December 2025 period is a lame-duck session following the 2024 elections. While this can sometimes spur action, given the preceding shutdown, it is more likely to be characterized by political positioning for the next Congress rather than productive legislating.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The base rate suggests a prior heavily concentrated on 0 additional bills being passed before Jan 1, 2026. The final count is thus overwhelmingly likely to be the 3 already enacted. (Equivalent n ≈ 15, reflecting high confidence from historical patterns).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The CR extends funding to Jan 30, 2026, completely removing the December deadline as a forcing mechanism.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The impending holiday recess provides a powerful, competing priority that discourages legislative work.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The historic length of the recent shutdown indicates extreme partisan friction, auguring poorly for complex negotiations.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The remaining nine bills are the most controversial, making a quick deal highly improbable.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The fact that 3 bills *were* passed shows compromise is not impossible, but this is very weak evidence for more success on harder bills in a short timeframe.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior distribution should be even more sharply peaked at 3 total bills (i.e., 0 additional bills).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting >3 bills):**
    *   House and Senate leadership announce a formal, pre-Christmas schedule for floor consideration of a "minibus" package (2-4 bills).
    *   A bipartisan, bicameral deal on top-line spending numbers for the remaining 9 bills is publicly announced.
    *   High-level "four corners" negotiations are reported by credible news outlets as making significant progress.
    *   The White House actively engages in and promotes a pre-holiday appropriations deal.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting the count remains 3):**
    *   Leadership announces the holiday recess schedule without any mention of appropriations votes.
    *   Public statements from party leaders focus exclusively on the "January 30 deadline."
    *   News reports detail ongoing, intractable disagreements over policy riders for the Homeland Security or Labor-HHS bills.
    *   Members of Congress begin leaving D.C. for the holidays in mid-December.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Surprise "Grand Bargain":** A low-probability, high-impact scenario exists where leaders decide to "clear the decks" and agree to a massive omnibus package containing all 9 remaining bills before the holidays.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution rests on the CRS table. A bill must be a "full-year regular appropriation." Any other funding mechanism, even if it lasts a full year, might not count.
*   **External Shock:** A major national security or economic crisis could force rapid, bipartisan action, potentially including appropriations.
*   **Misinterpretation of Signals:** Apparent "progress" in committee-level talks could be posturing rather than a genuine prelude to a floor vote. Focus should be on signals of intent from top leadership (Speaker, Majority Leader).

**Final Research Summary:**
Three of twelve bills have already been enacted. The combination of a continuing resolution that funds the government until January 30, 2026, the powerful incentive of the holiday recess, and the high degree of controversy in the nine remaining bills makes it exceptionally unlikely that any more will be enacted before 2026.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The appropriate base rate for this forecast is the historical pattern of appropriations bill enactment in years with similar conditions: divided government, recent government shutdowns, and a continuing resolution extending funding past the new year. Historically, the base rate for additional bills passed in this scenario is very low, often zero. The mean of this distribution is close to 0, with a variance reflecting occasional outliers where a few bills might be passed.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation aligns well with the historical base case: a divided government, a recent shutdown, and a CR extending funding past the new year. However, the extreme partisan dysfunction and the fact that the easiest bills have already been passed make this situation even more challenging than typical years. This suggests a shift towards an even lower likelihood of additional bills being enacted.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The passage of a CR extending funding to January 30, 2026, significantly reduces the urgency to pass additional bills before the end of the year. This makes higher outcomes less likely.
   - The recent government shutdown indicates high partisan acrimony, further reducing the likelihood of additional bills being passed.
   - The remaining bills are the most controversial, requiring complex negotiations unlikely to be resolved quickly.
   - The holiday recess provides a strong disincentive for legislative action in December.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior heavily skewed towards 0 additional bills, the evidence further reinforces this position. The CR's extension and the holiday recess are strong downward pressures, while the shutdown and controversy of remaining bills add moderate downward pressure. The posterior distribution is thus even more sharply peaked at 0 additional bills, with a very low probability of more than 3 total bills enacted.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes the possibility of a surprise "grand bargain" or an external shock forcing action. However, these scenarios are low probability given the current political climate and historical patterns. The best alternative forecast might suggest 1-2 additional bills, but this would require significant shifts in current dynamics, which are not evident.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong evidence supporting the base rate and the lack of indicators for additional bills, the forecast is heavily weighted towards 0 additional bills being enacted before 2026.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the base rate of appropriations bills passed after a government shutdown but before the end of the calendar year when a CR has already been passed extending into the next year.

Looking at historical patterns since 2000:
- When a shutdown occurs and is resolved with a CR extending into the next year, additional appropriations bills rarely pass before January 1
- The most relevant base rate is the number of bills passed between a post-shutdown CR and the end of the calendar year
- In such scenarios, the prior distribution is heavily concentrated at 0 additional bills

Given that 3 bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA), my prior is:
- Mean: 3 bills total (0 additional)
- Variance: Very low, with perhaps a 10-15% chance of 1-2 more bills, and <5% chance of >2 additional bills

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Divided government with partisan gridlock (typical of shutdown scenarios)
- CR already passed with a deadline well into the next year (January 30, 2026)
- The "easy" bills have already been passed, leaving only contentious ones
- Holiday recess approaching, reducing legislative calendar days

**Differences from base rate:**
- This shutdown was historically long ("longest in US history"), indicating extreme partisan division
- Three bills have already been enacted alongside the CR, which is somewhat unusual
- The CR extends quite far (to January 30), removing any urgency to act in December
- The remaining nine bills contain the most controversial policy riders and funding disputes

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing toward fewer additional bills:**
- The CR extending to January 30, 2026 removes any deadline pressure before 2026 (strong downward push, ~5:1 likelihood ratio favoring 0 additional bills)
- The recent historic shutdown indicates extreme partisan dysfunction (moderate downward push, ~3:1 likelihood ratio)
- Holiday recess will significantly reduce available legislative days (strong downward push, ~4:1 likelihood ratio)
- The remaining bills are the most contentious ones (moderate downward push, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)

**Evidence pushing toward more additional bills:**
- Three bills were already enacted, showing some capacity for compromise (weak upward push, ~1.2:1 likelihood ratio)
- Lame-duck sessions sometimes produce unexpected legislative activity (very weak upward push, ~1.1:1 likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 3 total bills (0 additional):

**First update - CR extension to January 30:**
- Prior: ~80% chance of 0 additional bills
- Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 favoring 0 additional bills
- Posterior: ~95% chance of 0 additional bills

**Second update - Holiday recess constraints:**
- Prior: ~95% chance of 0 additional bills
- Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring 0 additional bills
- Posterior: ~98% chance of 0 additional bills

**Third update - Some demonstrated capacity for compromise:**
- Prior: ~98% chance of 0 additional bills
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring more bills
- Posterior: ~97.5% chance of 0 additional bills

The posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at 3 total bills, with perhaps a 2-3% chance of 4 bills, <1% chance of 5 bills, and negligible probability of >5 bills.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a "clear the decks" mentality before the holidays
- There could be specific bills among the remaining nine that are less controversial and could move separately
- External events (national security crisis, economic shock) could force rapid action
- The lame-duck dynamics might create unexpected incentives for compromise

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would suggest 1-2 additional bills might pass, arguing that:
- Leadership might want to reduce January workload
- Some bills (like Defense) have bipartisan support
- End-of-year legislative packages often include surprises

However, this alternative seems unlikely because:
- The January 30 deadline is the clear action-forcing event
- Holiday recess severely limits legislative calendar
- The remaining bills contain the most controversial provisions
- Post-shutdown partisan tensions remain high

After considering these alternatives, I'll slightly increase my probability of 4-5 total bills, but maintain the strong concentration at 3.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of FY 2026 appropriations bills enacted before January 1, 2026. We know that 3 of the 12 bills have already been enacted. The question is thus about how many *additional* bills (from the remaining 9) will be passed in the ~5-week period between late November and December 31, 2025.

The most appropriate reference class is **legislative activity on appropriations during a lame-duck session after a Continuing Resolution (CR) has already been passed that extends funding into the next calendar year.**

*   **Reasoning:** In this scenario, the primary action-forcing mechanism (a government funding deadline) has been removed for the period in question. Legislative priorities shift to the new deadline (in this case, January 30, 2026) and the impending holiday recess.
*   **Distribution:** Historically, in such situations, Congress does not typically enact further individual appropriations bills. The work is deferred until the new deadline approaches. Therefore, the base rate for the number of *additional* bills passed in this window is heavily concentrated at 0. My prior distribution for the total number of bills is thus a sharp peak at 3, with a small probability of a higher number.
*   **Mean/Median:** The median and mode of this prior distribution are both 3. The mean is slightly higher due to a small probability of a "minibus" or "omnibus" package being passed.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is highly similar to the reference class, but with key differences that strengthen the base rate conclusion.

*   **Similarities:** A CR has been passed, pushing the next "fiscal cliff" to January 30, 2026. The holiday recess is a major competing priority for members of Congress.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Extreme Partisan Acrimony:** The background states this fiscal year saw the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This indicates a level of political disagreement far greater than the average year in the reference class, making further compromise on contentious bills less likely.
    *   **Nature of Remaining Bills:** The three enacted bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are consistently the least controversial. The remaining nine contain the most difficult and partisan issues (e.g., funding for Homeland Security, policy riders in Labor-HHS). The task is not to pass a mix of easy and hard bills, but *only* the hard ones.

These differences strongly suggest that the current situation is even *less* conducive to passing additional bills than the typical base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence in terms of how it affects the probability of passing *additional* bills beyond the current 3.

*   **Evidence 1: CR extends funding to Jan 30, 2026.** This is the most critical piece of evidence. It removes any urgent need to act before December 31. This makes the outcome of 0 additional bills much more likely than any other outcome. (Strongly pushes forecast down to 3 total).
*   **Evidence 2: Recent historic government shutdown.** This signals that the parties are deeply divided on the very issues contained in the remaining 9 bills. It depletes political capital and trust, making a quick, complex deal before the holidays highly improbable. (Strongly pushes forecast down to 3 total).
*   **Evidence 3: Impending Holiday Recess.** The congressional calendar creates a powerful incentive to defer complex work. Leaders are highly unlikely to keep members in Washington to negotiate contentious spending bills when a funding solution is already in place until late January. (Strongly pushes forecast down to 3 total).
*   **Evidence 4: The 3 "easy" bills are already done.** This concentrates all remaining controversy into the final 9 bills. There is no "low-hanging fruit" left to create a small, bipartisan package to build momentum. (Moderately pushes forecast down to 3 total).

The combined weight of this evidence is a powerful confirmation of the base rate. All significant factors point toward legislative inaction on appropriations for the remainder of the calendar year.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution heavily peaked at 3 bills, with a >80% chance of the total being exactly 3.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (Jan 30 deadline, post-shutdown acrimony, holiday calendar, controversial nature of remaining bills) is all highly consistent with the "no more bills passed" hypothesis (total = 3) and highly inconsistent with the "more bills passed" hypothesis (total > 3).
*   **Update Step:**
    *   `P(Total=3 | Evidence) ∝ P(Total=3 | Prior) × P(Evidence | Total=3)`
    *   `P(Total>3 | Evidence) ∝ P(Total>3 | Prior) × P(Evidence | Total>3)`
    *   The likelihood ratio `P(Evidence | Total=3) / P(Evidence | Total>3)` is very large. The evidence is exactly what one would expect to see if Congress were planning to do nothing until the January deadline.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution becomes even more sharply peaked at 3. The evidence has collapsed most of the small probability mass that the prior had assigned to outcomes greater than 3. My updated belief is that there is a >90% chance that no additional bills will be enacted.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The primary alternative is a surprise "grand bargain." Leaders from both parties, exhausted by the shutdown and wanting to start 2026 with a clean slate, could decide to hammer out a deal on the remaining 9 bills in an omnibus package before Christmas.
*   **Plausibility:** This is a low-probability scenario. The same intractable issues that caused the shutdown still exist. A CR was passed precisely because a grand bargain was not achievable. The political incentive is to use the Jan 30 deadline for leverage, not to negotiate a deal early from a potentially weaker position.
*   **Another Alternative:** A small "minibus" of 2-3 of the *next* least controversial bills is passed. This is more plausible than a full omnibus but still unlikely for the same reasons: no deadline pressure and a desire to go home for the holidays.
*   **Adjustment:** These alternative scenarios are possible but highly improbable. My forecast should reflect this by having a "fat tail," but the vast majority of the probability mass must remain at 3. I will model this as a ~90% chance of the outcome being exactly 3, with the remaining 10% spread across higher values (e.g., a minibus of 2 additional bills, or a full omnibus of 9). This distribution means that the 10th through 90th percentiles will all be 3. This seems appropriate given the overwhelming, one-sided evidence.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated at 3. I estimate a ~90% probability that the number of enacted bills will be exactly 3. The remaining 10% of probability is in the upper tail, representing the small chance of a surprise minibus or omnibus package. This structure places the central 80% of the distribution (from P10 to P90) at the value of 3.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3
