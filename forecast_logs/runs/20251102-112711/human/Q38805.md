### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-WWII Interstate Ceasefires:** This class includes ceasefires in wars between two or more states. A study by Virginia Page Fortna ("Peace Time: Cease-fire Agreements and the Durability of Peace") found that about half of such ceasefires break down into renewed warfare within five years. However, the initial period is most fragile. **Base Rate:** Approximately 30-40% of interstate ceasefires fail within the first 90 days. This is often due to unresolved core issues, incentives to use the pause for tactical advantage, and commitment problems.
2.  **Ceasefires in Conflicts with Unresolved Territorial Disputes:** A more specific class involves conflicts where the central disagreement is over territory, which is notoriously difficult to resolve. Examples include Nagorno-Karabakh, Kashmir, and Cyprus. These ceasefires often become "frozen conflicts" but are punctuated by frequent, often rapid, breakdowns. **Base Rate:** The probability of a breakdown within 90 days is likely higher, perhaps 40-50%, as any perceived violation near the line of contact can escalate quickly.
3.  **Previous Russia-Ukraine Ceasefires (Minsk I & II):** This is the most specific, directly relevant reference class. Both the Minsk I (Sept 2014) and Minsk II (Feb 2015) agreements failed to establish a lasting ceasefire. Major combat operations resumed within weeks or months, and low-level fighting never truly ceased. **Base Rate:** Based on this direct precedent, the probability of a ceasefire lasting more than 90 days without significant violations is very low, perhaps 10-20%. The agreements failed because the underlying political goals were irreconcilable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Note: The following are based on the fictional scenario provided in the question background, set in early 2025, with today's date being 2025-11-02.*

-   **2025-03-11** Ukraine agrees to support a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire. — **↓ (shorter duration)** — This explicitly anchors the expected duration to 30 days, creating a natural expiration/re-evaluation point.
-   **2025-03-11** Putin expresses support for the ceasefire idea but notes "outstanding questions." — **↓ (shorter duration)** — Russia's conditional agreement signals a lack of deep commitment and suggests it may use unresolved issues as a pretext to exit the deal.
-   **2025-02-XX** US-Ukraine talks over minerals-for-security guarantees fall through. — **↓ (shorter duration)** — This highlights the transactional and potentially unstable foundation of the US-brokered peace effort, weakening the credibility of any US security guarantees.
-   **2025-02-XX** Trump administration actively involved in restarting negotiations. — **↔ (ambiguous)** — While a US president's involvement is significant, this specific administration's "America First" posture may lead to less reliable enforcement, making the ceasefire more fragile.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Irreconcilable Strategic Goals:** Ukraine seeks the restoration of its 1991 borders. Russia seeks, at a minimum, control over the annexed territories. This fundamental conflict remains the primary driver for ceasefire failure. (Large effect size, pushes for shorter duration).
2.  **Incentive to Rearm and Reposition:** Both sides are likely to view any ceasefire as a tactical pause to rest troops, replenish ammunition stocks, and prepare for future offensives. This creates a strong incentive to break the truce once a relative advantage is perceived. (Large effect size, pushes for shorter duration).
3.  **Third-Party Enforcement Credibility:** The durability of the ceasefire depends heavily on the guarantor's (in this scenario, the US) willingness and ability to punish violations. The transactional nature of the fictional deal suggests enforcement might be weak or conditional, reducing the cost of defection. (Moderate effect size, pushes for shorter duration).
4.  **Domestic Political Constraints:** Both leaders face domestic pressure against conceding territory or sovereignty. A long ceasefire that solidifies unpopular lines of control could be politically untenable, especially for Ukraine's government. (Moderate effect size, pushes for shorter duration).
5.  **War Weariness and Attrition:** After years of high-intensity conflict, both militaries and societies are exhausted. This creates a genuine, if temporary, desire for a pause, which could help the ceasefire hold, at least initially. (Moderate effect size, pushes for longer duration).
6.  **The "30-Day" Anchor:** The explicit proposal of a 30-day ceasefire creates a powerful focal point. It sets expectations for a short duration and provides a low-cost, politically acceptable exit ramp for both parties if they do not wish to extend it. (Large effect size, pushes for the "30 days" bin).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Scale of Conflict:** Unlike many historical examples, this is the largest conventional interstate war in Europe since WWII, involving massive armies and high attrition. The scale of mobilization makes a rapid return to full-scale conflict harder but also raises the stakes of any tactical pause.
2.  **Direct Precedent of Failure:** The Minsk I & II agreements provide a uniquely powerful and negative precedent *for this specific conflict*, suggesting that structural incompatibilities are extremely difficult to overcome.
3.  **Nature of US Involvement (Fictional):** The background implies a Trump presidency. Compared to a more traditional, alliance-focused US administration, this involvement is likely more transactional and less ideologically committed to Ukrainian sovereignty, making US guarantees less credible than in past US-brokered deals (e.g., Dayton Accords).
4.  **Explicit Short-Term Anchor:** The fictional proposal explicitly mentions a 30-day duration. Most historical ceasefires are open-ended or tied to political milestones. This pre-defined, short duration is a significant feature that distinguishes it from the general reference class.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the base rate of fragile interstate ceasefires (Ref Class 1 & 2), skewed towards failure within 90 days. An equivalent of n=10 observations might be: 4 in `<90 days`, 3 in `91+ days`, and 3 spread across the middle bins.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↓ (Large):** The explicit "30-day" proposal in the scenario acts as a powerful anchor, creating a default expiration point.
    -   **↓ (Large):** The core strategic goals of both nations remain fundamentally incompatible, mirroring the reasons for the Minsk agreements' failure.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The incentive for both sides to use the pause to rearm for a future offensive is extremely high, given the lack of a decisive military outcome.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The fictional context of a transactional US guarantee weakens the primary enforcement mechanism compared to historical analogues.
    -   **↑ (Small/Moderate):** Mutual exhaustion and high attrition provide the main countervailing pressure, creating a real need for a pause that could extend beyond a month.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly pushes the posterior toward the shorter-duration bins. The prior's general skew towards early failure is strongly confirmed and sharpened by case-specific evidence, particularly the 30-day anchor. The posterior should be heavily concentrated on the "30 days" and "31-60 days" options, with significant probability also on "<30 days".

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*UP indicators (suggesting a longer duration > 60 days):*
-   Immediate establishment of a robust, third-party (e.g., UN, OSCE) monitoring mission with free access to the front lines.
-   Public statements from both Moscow and Kyiv emphasizing the ceasefire as a first step toward a comprehensive political settlement.
-   A significant, verified pullback of heavy weaponry from the line of contact by both sides.
-   Follow-on diplomatic summits scheduled with high-level participation.

*DOWN indicators (suggesting a shorter duration < 60 days):*
-   Rhetoric from either side framing the ceasefire as a "temporary operational pause."
-   Reports of continued shelling, drone activity, or small-scale skirmishes along the front line ("ceasefire in name only").
-   Accusations of bad faith or ceasefire violations dominating the information space within the first week.
-   Evidence of either side moving reinforcements and ammunition supplies *towards* the front, rather than away from it.
-   The US or other key partners making continued support conditional on new, unrelated demands.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria hinge on "major military operations." This could be a grey area, with a gradual escalation making it hard to pinpoint a single day of breakdown.
-   **Scenario Dependence:** This analysis is heavily dependent on the fictional background provided. A ceasefire emerging from different circumstances (e.g., a military collapse on one side) would have a completely different durability profile.
-   **Information Warfare:** Both sides will likely engage in propaganda, accusing the other of violations to shape international opinion, making it difficult for observers to verify the true state of the ceasefire.
-   **Black Swans:** The health or political survival of key leaders (Putin, Zelenskyy, Trump in this scenario) is a major uncertainty. The removal of any one could dramatically alter the strategic calculus.
-   **Expiration vs. Breakdown:** The question resolves based on the number of *consecutive days*. A 30-day ceasefire that simply expires resolves to "30 days." It does not need to be violently broken to fall into a shorter-duration category.

**Final Research Summary:** The proposed ceasefire is highly likely to be short-lived. The combination of irreconcilable strategic goals, strong incentives to use the pause to rearm, and the specific precedent of the failed Minsk agreements points to a rapid breakdown or expiration, with the fictional 30-day proposal serving as a powerful anchor for this expected duration.

To forecast the duration of a potential ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict in 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### Step 1: Base Rate (Prior) Selection

1. **Less than 30 days**: Based on the historical data of ceasefires in conflicts with unresolved territorial disputes and the specific precedent of the Minsk agreements, the probability of a ceasefire breaking down quickly is high. Base rate: 30-40%.

2. **30 days**: The explicit proposal of a 30-day ceasefire acts as a strong anchor, suggesting a natural expiration point. Base rate: 30-40%.

3. **31-60 days**: While less likely than the first two options, there is still a possibility that the ceasefire could extend slightly beyond the initial 30 days due to mutual exhaustion or temporary stabilization. Base rate: 10-20%.

4. **61-90 days**: Given the historical difficulty in maintaining ceasefires in this conflict, the probability of lasting this long without significant violations is low. Base rate: 5-10%.

5. **91 days or more**: The precedent of failed Minsk agreements and ongoing strategic incompatibilities make this outcome very unlikely. Base rate: 5-10%.

### Step 2: Comparison to Base Case

- The current scenario is similar to past ceasefires in that it involves unresolved territorial disputes and strategic goals. However, the explicit 30-day proposal and the transactional nature of US involvement are unique factors that could influence the duration.

### Step 3: Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1. **30-day proposal**: Strongly suggests a short duration, acting as a focal point for both parties to reassess. P(E | H) is high for "30 days" and "Less than 30 days".

2. **Putin's conditional support**: Indicates potential for early breakdown. P(E | H) is high for "Less than 30 days".

3. **Failed US-Ukraine talks**: Undermines the stability of the ceasefire. P(E | H) is high for "Less than 30 days".

4. **US involvement**: Ambiguous impact, but the transactional nature suggests fragility. P(E | H) is moderate for "Less than 30 days" and "30 days".

### Step 4: Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Less than 30 days**: Prior odds are increased by evidence of unresolved issues and conditional support. Posterior probability increases.

- **30 days**: The 30-day proposal strongly supports this option. Posterior probability increases significantly.

- **31-60 days**: Some evidence of mutual exhaustion could extend the ceasefire slightly beyond 30 days, but less likely. Posterior probability remains low.

- **61-90 days** and **91 days or more**: Little evidence supports these options, so posterior probabilities decrease.

### Step 5: Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs or external pressures that could extend the ceasefire. Adjust probabilities slightly to account for this tail risk.

### Step 6: Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### Final Forecast

Less than 30 days: 35%  
30 days: 40%  
31-60 days: 15%  
61-90 days: 5%  
91 days or more: 5%  

This distribution reflects the strong influence of the 30-day proposal and the historical precedent of rapid ceasefire breakdowns in this conflict.

# Forecasting the Duration of a Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each duration option by examining historical ceasefires in similar conflicts:

**Less than 30 days**: 25%
- Historical data shows many ceasefires in territorial conflicts fail quickly
- The Minsk I agreement in 2014 saw violations within days
- Short-term tactical ceasefires often break down before reaching 30 days

**30 days**: 35% 
- The explicit proposal mentioned is for a 30-day ceasefire
- This creates a powerful anchor and natural expiration point
- Many ceasefires are designed with specific timeframes that become self-fulfilling

**31-60 days**: 20%
- Some ceasefires survive the initial period but fail in the medium term
- The period after the initial agreement often reveals implementation challenges
- Historical data suggests a declining survival rate after the initial period

**61-90 days**: 10%
- Fewer ceasefires reach this duration without either breaking down or becoming more permanent
- This represents a transition zone between temporary and semi-permanent arrangements

**91 days or more**: 10%
- Based on the Fortna study cited, roughly half of interstate ceasefires last beyond a few months
- However, the specific Russia-Ukraine context makes this less likely than the general base rate
- The Minsk II agreement technically lasted years but with constant violations

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other territorial conflicts, this involves disputed land claims that are difficult to resolve
- Similar to other interstate conflicts, both sides have strong incentives to use pauses tactically
- As with previous Russia-Ukraine agreements, fundamental strategic incompatibilities remain

**Key differences:**
- The explicit 30-day timeframe creates a stronger anchor than most historical ceasefires
- The fictional Trump administration involvement suggests a more transactional approach than typical third-party mediators
- The scale of this conflict (largest European conventional war since WWII) creates higher stakes
- The previous failed Minsk agreements provide direct negative precedent for this specific conflict
- The background mentions Putin noting "outstanding questions," suggesting conditional commitment

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Explicit 30-day proposal**
- P(E|30 days): Very high (~0.8) - This creates a powerful focal point exactly at 30 days
- P(E|not 30 days): Moderate (~0.3) - Other durations would require explicit extension or early breakdown

**Evidence: Failed US-Ukraine minerals-for-security talks**
- P(E|<60 days): High (~0.7) - Indicates weak foundation for lasting agreement
- P(E|>60 days): Low (~0.2) - Sustainable ceasefires typically require stronger foundations

**Evidence: Putin's conditional support with "outstanding questions"**
- P(E|<30 days): Moderate (~0.5) - Suggests potential early exit strategy
- P(E|>30 days): Low (~0.2) - Indicates reluctance for long-term commitment

**Evidence: Years of irreconcilable strategic goals**
- P(E|<90 days): Very high (~0.9) - Fundamental incompatibilities remain unresolved
- P(E|>90 days): Very low (~0.1) - Long-term ceasefires require aligned interests

**Evidence: War weariness after years of conflict**
- P(E|<30 days): Moderate (~0.4) - Exhaustion creates genuine desire for pause
- P(E|>30 days): Moderate (~0.4) - Could motivate extension beyond initial period

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the prior for the "30 days" option using the explicit 30-day proposal evidence:

Prior odds for "30 days" = 0.35 / 0.65 = 0.538
Likelihood ratio = 0.8 / 0.3 = 2.67
Posterior odds = 0.538 × 2.67 = 1.44
Posterior probability = 1.44 / (1 + 1.44) = 0.59 or 59%

This represents a significant increase from the 35% prior, reflecting the strong anchoring effect of the explicit 30-day proposal.

For the "Less than 30 days" option, updating based on Putin's conditional support:

Prior odds for "<30 days" = 0.25 / 0.75 = 0.33
Likelihood ratio = 0.5 / 0.2 = 2.5
Posterior odds = 0.33 × 2.5 = 0.83
Posterior probability = 0.83 / (1 + 0.83) = 0.45 or 45%

However, this conflicts with our update for "30 days." The war weariness evidence would pull this down, while the failed talks evidence would push it up. Balancing these factors and considering the strong 30-day anchor, I'll adjust this to 20%.

For the longer duration options, the evidence of irreconcilable strategic goals significantly reduces their probability:

For "91+ days":
Prior odds = 0.1 / 0.9 = 0.11
Likelihood ratio = 0.1 / 0.9 = 0.11
Posterior odds = 0.11 × 0.11 = 0.012
Posterior probability = 0.012 / (1.012) ≈ 0.01 or 1%

Similar calculations for the other options, with adjustments for multiple pieces of evidence, yield the preliminary distribution.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the 30-day anchor effect. While powerful, parties could still break it earlier or extend it.
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a "frozen conflict" scenario where the ceasefire technically holds despite low-level violations.
- The fictional Trump administration's approach is speculative and could vary significantly from my assumptions.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A rapid collapse of one side's military position could lead to a more durable ceasefire (>90 days).
- International pressure or economic factors not mentioned in the background could create stronger incentives for maintaining the ceasefire.
- The ceasefire could be technically maintained while being violated in practice, creating ambiguity about when it "ends."

**Adjustments:**
- I'll slightly reduce the "30 days" probability to account for the possibility of early breakdown.
- I'll slightly increase the "91+ days" probability to account for the possibility of a frozen conflict scenario.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and adjustments, my final distribution is:

Less than 30 days: 20%
30 days: 50%
31-60 days: 20%
61-90 days: 5%
91 days or more: 5%

This sums to 100% and reflects my assessment that the ceasefire is most likely to last exactly 30 days (its proposed duration), with significant probability of breaking down earlier or being extended slightly, but low probability of lasting beyond 90 days given the fundamental incompatibilities and historical precedent.

## 7. Output Format

Less than 30 days: 20%
30 days: 50%
31-60 days: 20%
61-90 days: 5%
91 days or more: 5%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast, following the specified reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary reference class is **previous ceasefires in this specific conflict**, namely the Minsk I (2014) and Minsk II (2015) agreements. Both agreements failed to establish a lasting ceasefire, with major violations occurring within weeks or months and low-level fighting never truly ceasing. This history suggests a very high probability of failure for any new ceasefire. A secondary, broader reference class is ceasefires in interstate conflicts with unresolved territorial disputes, which also have a high rate of failure in the initial months.

Based on the Minsk precedent, my prior is heavily skewed towards a short duration. I would assign a low prior probability (perhaps 15-20%) to a ceasefire lasting more than 90 days. The remaining probability would be distributed across the shorter-term options, reflecting the inherent instability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   **Irreconcilable Goals:** The core reason for the Minsk agreements' failure—Russia's and Ukraine's fundamentally opposed strategic objectives regarding territory and sovereignty—remains unchanged and is the central feature of the current conflict.
*   **Mutual Mistrust:** Decades of conflict, culminating in a full-scale invasion, have created extreme mistrust, making commitment to any agreement fragile.

**Differences:**
*   **Scale of Conflict:** The current war is of a much higher intensity and scale than the 2014-2015 conflict. This increases war weariness, which might provide a stronger incentive to maintain a pause. However, it also raises the stakes, making concessions harder.
*   **Explicit Time Anchor:** The most significant difference is that the hypothetical ceasefire is explicitly proposed as a "30-day ceasefire." This is unlike the more open-ended Minsk agreements. This creates a powerful focal point and a natural, low-cost exit ramp where the ceasefire can simply expire rather than be actively broken.
*   **Broker Identity:** The broker is a hypothetical Trump administration, whose involvement is described as transactional ("minerals for security guarantees"). This differs from the European-led Normandy Format for Minsk and suggests a potentially less reliable third-party enforcer, which would tend to make a ceasefire *more* fragile.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence:** The proposal is for a "30-day ceasefire."
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence makes the "30 days" outcome highly likely (P(E|H="30 days")). If the agreement is for 30 days and simply expires without renewal, this option resolves. This is a very simple and politically easy path for both sides. The likelihood of this evidence, given a much longer duration (e.g., >90 days), is very low, as it would require multiple successful and contentious extensions.
*   **Evidence:** Russian President Putin expresses support but notes "outstanding questions."
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This conditional language is much more likely if Russia has a short-term commitment (P(E|H=short duration)) than if it is genuinely committed to a long-term peace process. It provides a built-in pretext to refuse an extension or to blame the other side for a breakdown.
*   **Evidence:** US involvement is transactional and follows a public clash between the US and Ukrainian presidents.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** A weak or unreliable enforcement mechanism makes defection (breaking the ceasefire) less costly. This evidence is highly likely given a fragile, short-lived ceasefire (P(E|H=short duration)) and unlikely if the ceasefire were to be a durable, long-term one, which typically requires robust security guarantees.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I start with a prior belief that any ceasefire is unlikely to last long, based on the Minsk precedent.

**Prior Odds:** Let's consider the odds of the ceasefire lasting exactly 30 days versus all other outcomes. My prior might be roughly 1:3 (25% probability).

**Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence of an explicit "30-day" proposal is the key update. The likelihood of hearing about a "30-day proposal" if the ceasefire is destined to last exactly 30 days (by expiration) is very high. The likelihood of hearing this if it's destined to last, say, 100 days is very low. This likelihood ratio is strongly in favor of the "30 days" option. Let's estimate it as at least 3:1.

**Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds (1:3) × Likelihood Ratio (3:1) = 3:3 or 1:1. This simple update moves the probability of the "30 days" option from 25% to 50%.

The other evidence (Putin's conditionality, weak US guarantee) further reinforces fragility. This shifts probability away from the longer-duration options (`>30 days`) and towards the shorter ones, particularly the `< 30 days` bin, as it increases the chance of an early, violent breakdown rather than a simple expiration. I will therefore increase the `< 30 days` bin at the expense of the `> 30 days` bins.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis is heavily reliant on the "30-day" anchor. Could I be over-weighting it? An alternative view is that "30 days" is merely an initial period, and if it holds, momentum could build for extensions. War exhaustion is a powerful force that could make both sides reluctant to restart major operations. In this scenario, the probability of the `31-60 days` option should be higher.

However, the fundamental conflict of interest and the specific context of a transactional, potentially unreliable US guarantee are strong counterarguments. The path of least resistance is for the 30-day period to be used for regrouping, followed by a non-renewal. The chance of an early breakdown due to mistrust also remains very high. I believe my distribution, which places a combined 70% probability on the ceasefire ending at or before the 30-day mark, is justified. I have allocated a significant 20% to the `31-60 days` option to account for the "exhaustion leads to extension" scenario, which seems a sufficient hedge against this alternative view.

### 6. Final Normalization

My final probabilities are adjusted to reflect the reasoning above, with the "30 days" option as the clear mode due to the explicit anchor, a significant chance of early failure, a plausible chance of a single short extension, and very low probabilities for any longer-term success. The probabilities sum to 100%.

Less than 30 days: 25%
30 days: 45%
31-60 days: 20%
61-90 days: 6%
91 days or more: 4%
