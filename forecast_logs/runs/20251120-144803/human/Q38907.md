### Reference class & base rates
*   **All Months Since First Test (Oct 2006 - Jul 2025):** North Korea has conducted 6 tests over a period of 225 months. This yields a simple base rate of 6/225 = 2.7% chance per month. For the 5-month resolution window (Aug-Dec 2025), this implies a ~12.8% probability (1 - (1-0.027)^5).
    *   *Limitation:* This model assumes a constant, random probability of a test each month, which is unrealistic. Tests are strategic decisions clustered in time (e.g., 2006, 2009, 2013, 2x in 2016, 2017) and followed by long pauses.
*   **"Testing Cycles" vs. "Moratoriums":** A more refined view separates NK's behavior into two states. The active testing period (2006-2017) saw 6 tests in ~11 years, a much higher frequency. The current period (Sep 2017 - present) is an 8+ year moratorium, the longest by far. The key question is whether we are still in a "moratorium" state or are about to enter a new "testing cycle." The base rate for a test *during* a moratorium is effectively 0%.
*   **Provocation Events by Authoritarian Regimes:** One could consider major military/technological provocations by isolated, nuclear-aspirant states. This class is difficult to quantify but suggests such events are rare and timed to exploit geopolitical distraction or to signal strength during periods of perceived weakness or transition (e.g., post-elections in adversarial states).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-06] South Korean intelligence reiterates that NK has completed preparations at Punggye-ri and can test on short notice. — ↑ — Confirms technical readiness and capability, a necessary precondition for a test.
*   [2025-05-28] A US Congressional Research Service report highlights NK's continued program advancement and readiness for a seventh test. — ↑ — Reinforces that the US intelligence community views a test as a persistent, plausible threat.
*   [2025-03-18] The US Annual Threat Assessment notes Russia's increasing support for NK's nuclear status in exchange for military aid. — ↑ — This alliance provides NK with a diplomatic and economic buffer, lowering the potential cost of international sanctions following a test.
*   [2025-01-01] A Metaculus question for a test before Jan 1, 2025 resolved 'No'. — ↓ — Demonstrates that "imminent test" warnings have been present for over a year without materializing, suggesting a high bar for the final political decision.
*   [2024-10-30] North Korea tests a new, potentially more advanced ICBM, its first in nearly a year. — ↑ — Shows a continued commitment to advancing its strategic arsenal and a willingness to engage in major provocations short of a nuclear test.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Technical Necessity (Large):** The primary driver for a test would be to validate a new warhead design, particularly smaller, "tactical" nuclear weapons for battlefield use or a more advanced thermonuclear device. Without testing, confidence in new designs is low.
*   **Coercive Diplomacy (Large):** A nuclear test is the ultimate signal to force the US and its allies to the negotiating table, extract concessions, or protest joint military exercises. It dramatically raises regional tensions and international attention.
*   **Geopolitical Alignment (Moderate):** The deepening military and political ties with Russia (and to a lesser extent, China) provide a shield against UN sanctions and international condemnation, lowering the expected cost of a test. A test could be timed to support Russian strategic objectives by distracting the West.
*   **Domestic Politics (Moderate):** Kim Jong Un may use a successful test to consolidate internal power, celebrate a military anniversary, or project an image of strength and technological prowess to his domestic audience.
*   **Chinese Restraint (Large):** China, North Korea's primary economic partner, has historically opposed nuclear tests as they destabilize its border and provoke a greater US military presence in the region. Fear of Beijing's reaction is a major deterrent.
*   **Status Quo Sufficiency (Moderate):** The regime may believe its current, untested but assumed, nuclear deterrent is sufficient. It can demonstrate capability through less risky missile tests, avoiding the severe sanctions and backlash a nuclear test would trigger.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The Longest Moratorium:** The current 8+ year pause since the last test in September 2017 is unprecedented in NK's nuclear history. This suggests a significant shift in strategy or a higher threshold for testing compared to the 2006-2017 period.
*   **Russia as a Patron:** Unlike in previous testing periods, North Korea now enjoys active political and likely material support from a permanent UN Security Council member (Russia). This fundamentally alters the international sanctions and condemnation calculus.
*   **Focus on Tactical Nukes:** Recent NK rhetoric and military doctrine have shifted towards the development and deployment of tactical nuclear weapons. Testing such a device would be a primary motivation for a new test, a different goal than the earlier focus on high-yield strategic weapons.
*   **Global Distraction:** The US and its allies are heavily focused on conflicts in Ukraine and other global priorities, potentially creating a window of opportunity for North Korea to test with a less focused and forceful international response.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior around 10-15% seems plausible, derived from the long-run monthly base rate (2.7%) applied over the 5-month window. This should be treated as a weak prior, given the non-random nature of tests.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Confirmed technical readiness at the Punggye-ri site. The capability is clearly in place.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The Russia-North Korea alliance significantly mitigates the expected cost of sanctions and isolation.
    *   ↓ (Large): The 8-year testing moratorium is a powerful piece of evidence for the status quo, indicating a high political barrier to resume testing.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): China's continued, albeit quieter, opposition to regional instability remains a significant constraint on Kim's decision-making.
    *   ↔ (Small): Recent ICBM tests confirm provocative intent but also serve as an *alternative* to a nuclear test, releasing pressure without crossing the ultimate red line.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for *capability* is strong, but the evidence for *intent* within this specific, short window is weak when weighed against the powerful inertia of the 8-year moratorium. The posterior should likely be revised downwards from the simple base rate prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official state media rhetoric specifically mentioning a "new demonstration" of nuclear force or responding to a "hostile" act with the "strongest" response.
    *   Satellite imagery showing evacuation of personnel or unusual vehicle activity at the Punggye-ri test site, beyond simple maintenance.
    *   A major, unexpected US-South Korea military exercise that could serve as a pretext for a test.
    *   A high-level summit between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin that concludes with strong statements of military-technical cooperation.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Resumption of any form of dialogue, even informal, between North Korea and the US or South Korea.
    *   Major domestic pronouncements by Kim Jong Un focusing on the economy or food security, shifting focus away from the military.
    *   Satellite imagery showing a clear stand-down or reversal of preparations at the Punggye-ri site.
    *   Strong, public statements from high-level Chinese officials warning against actions that would raise regional tensions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opacity of Intent:** All analysis of capability is based on external intelligence; analysis of intent is speculative. The final decision rests with one individual, Kim Jong Un, whose calculus is opaque.
*   **Deception Risk:** North Korea could be using preparations at the test site as a form of strategic deception to gain leverage or attention, with no actual intent to test in the near term.
*   **Sudden Pretext:** The regime could seize on an unforeseen event (e.g., a minor border skirmish, a political statement) as a sudden justification for a test, making short-term prediction difficult.
*   **Definition of "Test":** The resolution requires a "nuclear test" confirmed by "credible sources." A very low-yield or failed test could lead to ambiguous or conflicting reports, complicating resolution.
*   **Geopolitical Shocks:** A sudden crisis elsewhere (e.g., Taiwan Strait, major escalation in Ukraine) could either provide cover for a test or, conversely, cause China to clamp down hard on North Korea to prevent a second crisis.

**Final Research Summary:** North Korea is technically prepared to conduct a nuclear test at any time, and its new alliance with Russia lowers the political cost. However, the powerful inertia of its eight-year self-imposed moratorium suggests the political threshold for resuming testing is very high, making a test in the next five months possible but unlikely.

To forecast the probability of North Korea conducting a nuclear test before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for North Korea conducting a nuclear test is derived from historical data. Since 2006, North Korea has conducted 6 nuclear tests over 225 months, giving a base rate of approximately 2.7% per month. For the 5-month period from August to December 2025, this translates to a cumulative probability of about 12.8% (calculated as 1 - (1-0.027)^5). However, this base rate assumes a constant probability, which does not account for strategic decision-making and geopolitical factors.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical base case in several ways:
- **Longest Moratorium:** North Korea has not conducted a test since 2017, marking the longest pause in its testing history. This suggests a potential shift in strategy or increased political barriers to testing.
- **Geopolitical Context:** The alliance with Russia provides a buffer against international sanctions, potentially lowering the cost of testing.
- **Focus on Tactical Nukes:** Recent developments indicate a shift towards tactical nuclear weapons, which may necessitate testing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Technical Readiness (↑):** South Korean intelligence confirms North Korea's readiness to test, indicating high capability. This increases the likelihood of a test.
- **Russia-North Korea Alliance (↑):** This alliance reduces the cost of international backlash, increasing the likelihood of a test.
- **8-Year Moratorium (↓):** The long pause suggests a high political threshold for testing, decreasing the likelihood.
- **Chinese Restraint (↓):** China's opposition to regional instability acts as a deterrent, decreasing the likelihood.
- **Recent ICBM Tests (↔):** These tests show provocative intent but also serve as an alternative to nuclear testing, having a neutral effect.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of around 12.8%, we adjust based on the evidence:
- **Likelihood Ratio for Readiness and Alliance:** Increases probability due to technical and geopolitical readiness.
- **Likelihood Ratio for Moratorium and Chinese Restraint:** Decreases probability due to political and diplomatic constraints.

Given the mixed evidence, the posterior probability should be adjusted slightly downward from the base rate, reflecting the strong inertia of the moratorium and the deterrent effect of Chinese opposition.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risk:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for sudden geopolitical shifts or internal North Korean decisions.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A sudden geopolitical event or internal political need could prompt a test, suggesting a higher probability.
- **Rebuttals:** The consistent moratorium and China's influence remain strong deterrents.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final probability is adjusted to reflect the balance of readiness and deterrence factors.

Final: 20%

# Will North Korea test another nuclear device before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll consider several reference classes to establish a prior:

**Historical Test Frequency (2006-2025):**
- 6 tests over 225 months = 2.7% per month
- For a 5-month window (Aug-Dec 2025), this would be approximately 1-(1-0.027)^5 ≈ 12.8%

**Testing Cycles vs. Moratoriums:**
- North Korea has alternated between active testing periods and moratoriums
- Current moratorium (since Sep 2017) is 8+ years, the longest in their nuclear history
- During moratoriums, the testing rate approaches 0%

**Current State Assessment:**
- Technical capability is confirmed (site is prepared)
- Political decision threshold appears high (given 8-year pause)
- New Russia alliance changes sanctions calculus

Given these considerations, I'll use a prior of 15% - slightly higher than the simple base rate calculation to account for the confirmed technical readiness, but still conservative given the powerful inertia of the 8-year moratorium.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to historical testing periods:**
- Technical capability is present (Punggye-ri site is prepared)
- Continued missile testing shows commitment to weapons program
- Tensions with US/South Korea remain high
- Desire to validate new weapons designs (tactical nukes)

**Key differences:**
- 8-year moratorium is unprecedented (previous longest gap was ~3 years)
- New Russia-North Korea alliance provides sanctions buffer
- Focus has shifted to tactical nuclear weapons (different design goals)
- Global attention divided by multiple conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East)
- China's continued opposition remains a constraint

The current situation suggests a lower probability than during active testing cycles (2006-2017) but higher than during previous moratoriums due to the Russia alliance factor.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Technical Readiness at Punggye-ri**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A test would almost certainly require site readiness
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Site could be maintained as leverage without testing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Russia-North Korea Alliance**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A test would benefit from reduced sanctions impact
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Alliance benefits NK regardless of testing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 3: 8-Year Testing Moratorium**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - A test would break a long-established pattern
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Continued moratorium is consistent with status quo
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Recent ICBM Testing**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Could be escalation toward nuclear test
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Could be alternative to nuclear testing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.0 (neutral impact)

**Evidence 5: US Intelligence Assessment of "Probably Prepared"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Test would validate intelligence assessment
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Assessment could be accurate about capability but not timing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5 (moderately increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15%/85% = 0.176

First update (Technical Readiness):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 1.9 = 0.335
- Posterior probability = 0.335/(1+0.335) ≈ 25.1%

Second update (Russia Alliance):
- Posterior odds = 0.335 × 1.14 = 0.382
- Posterior probability = 0.382/(1+0.382) ≈ 27.6%

Third update (8-Year Moratorium):
- Posterior odds = 0.382 × 0.25 = 0.096
- Posterior probability = 0.096/(1+0.096) ≈ 8.7%

Fourth update (ICBM Testing - neutral):
- Posterior odds = 0.096 × 1.0 = 0.096
- Posterior probability = 0.096/(1+0.096) ≈ 8.7%

Fifth update (Intelligence Assessment):
- Posterior odds = 0.096 × 1.5 = 0.144
- Posterior probability = 0.144/(1+0.144) ≈ 12.6%

The Bayesian updating process yields a posterior probability of approximately 13%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the moratorium's significance - past behavior doesn't guarantee future restraint
- The Russia alliance could be more significant than estimated, especially if it includes technical assistance
- The timing window (5 months) is relatively short, which favors the status quo
- I might underestimate the impact of the US election cycle on NK's strategic calculus

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden crisis could trigger an opportunistic test (25-30% probability)
- NK could be deliberately maintaining test readiness purely as leverage (5-10% probability)
- Technical issues could prevent a test despite political willingness (5% probability)

**Adjustments:**
- The short time window (5 months) slightly reduces the probability
- The US election cycle could create a strategic opportunity, slightly increasing probability
- These factors roughly balance out, so I'll maintain the ~13% estimate

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the 8-year moratorium is the strongest factor suggesting continued restraint, while technical readiness and the Russia alliance are the strongest factors suggesting a potential test. The short time window (5 months) limits the probability somewhat.

Final: 13%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most straightforward base rate is derived from North Korea's entire history as a nuclear-testing state. From its first test in October 2006 to the question's opening in July 2025, there have been 6 tests over 225 months. This gives a simple monthly probability of 6/225 ≈ 2.7%. For the 5-month resolution window (August-December 2025), this implies a probability of 1 - (1 - 0.027)^5 ≈ 12.9%.

However, this simple model is flawed because it assumes a constant probability. The testing history is clustered (2006-2017), followed by an 8+ year moratorium. A more refined approach is to acknowledge that we are in a long-standing "moratorium state." The base rate of breaking such a state in a short period is likely very low. I will therefore select a more conservative prior of **5%**, reflecting the strong inertia of the current status quo. This represents a belief that, absent new information, breaking an 8-year pause in any given 5-month window is a rare event.
*   **Prior P(H): 5%**
*   **Prior Odds: 0.05 / 0.95 ≈ 0.053 to 1**

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the past in that North Korea's strategic objectives (deterrence, coercion) and technical capabilities remain. However, it is starkly different in two ways:
1.  **The Moratorium:** The 8+ year pause is unprecedented, suggesting the political threshold for testing is much higher now than during the 2006-2017 period. This is the primary reason for choosing a low prior.
2.  **The Russia Alliance:** North Korea's new, deep military and political alliance with Russia is a fundamental shift. Unlike in the past, where Russia would join in UN condemnations, it now offers a diplomatic and economic shield. This significantly lowers the potential cost of a test.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event "North Korea tests a nuclear device before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Deepening Russia-North Korea Alliance.** This is the most significant new development. It provides Pyongyang with a permanent UN Security Council patron, mitigating the threat of new sanctions and international isolation. This makes the decision to test much less costly. The likelihood of this deep alliance forming is much higher if North Korea is at least seriously contemplating a major strategic move like a nuclear test (P(E | H) is high) than if it plans to simply maintain the status quo (P(E | ~H) is lower).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) > 1 (Strongly positive).** I estimate this evidence makes a test roughly 2.5 times more likely than my prior suggested.

*   **Evidence 2: Confirmed Technical Readiness.** US and South Korean intelligence have asserted for over a year that North Korea has completed preparations at the Punggye-ri test site and can test at any time. While this is a necessary precondition for a test (P(E | H) ≈ 1), it has also become part of the status quo. North Korea can use this "permanent readiness" as a form of strategic coercion without actually testing. Therefore, its predictive value is low (P(E | ~H) is also high).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) ≈ 1 (Weakly positive).** This evidence confirms capability but says little about near-term intent.

*   **Evidence 3: China's Continued Opposition.** China remains North Korea's primary economic partner and has a strong interest in preventing regional instability that would invite a greater US military presence. This acts as a significant deterrent.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) < 1 (Moderately negative).** This factor is a constant restraint, though its power may be diminished by Russia's countervailing support.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a single update from my conservative prior using the most important piece of new evidence: the Russian alliance.

*   **Prior Odds:** 0.053 to 1 (equivalent to 5% probability).
*   **Likelihood Ratio for Russia Alliance:** I will estimate this at 2.5, signifying that this new geopolitical reality makes a test substantially more plausible.
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.053 × 2.5 = 0.1325 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds)**
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.1325 / 1.1325 ≈ 0.117.

This calculation results in a posterior probability of approximately **12%**. This reflects a significant increase from the low prior, driven almost entirely by the changed geopolitical calculus resulting from Russia's support, while still respecting the powerful inertia of the 8-year moratorium.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too low if North Korea has a pressing technical need to test a new warhead (e.g., for tactical use) and views the current global distraction (e.g., war in Ukraine) and Russian support as a unique, fleeting window of opportunity. In this scenario, the probability could be closer to 25-30%.

Conversely, my forecast could be too high if I am overstating the impact of Russia's support and underestimating China's restraining influence. The current status quo is beneficial for North Korea; it receives Russian aid in exchange for artillery shells without taking the massive risk of a nuclear test that would infuriate Beijing and destabilize the region. If this logic holds, the probability could be less than 5%.

My final forecast of 12% attempts to balance these competing scenarios. It acknowledges the heightened risk due to the new geopolitical alignment but concludes that a test in the specific 5-month window remains an unlikely event, as breaking the long-standing moratorium is a major strategic decision not to be taken lightly.

### Final Forecast
The analysis balances the strong, established inertia of the eight-year testing moratorium against the new, significant factor of Russia's political and economic support, which lowers the cost of a test. Starting from a conservative prior that respects the moratorium, the update for the Russia alliance substantially increases the probability. The resulting forecast reflects a non-trivial but still unlikely chance of a test in the 5-month window.

Final: 12%
