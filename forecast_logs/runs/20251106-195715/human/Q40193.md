### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Attack Nuclear Inspections:** The most relevant reference class is countries allowing international inspections of nuclear facilities shortly after those facilities were subject to a major foreign military attack. Historical examples (e.g., Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981, Syria's Al Kibar facility in 2007) suggest the base rate is extremely low. Attacked nations typically double down on secrecy, deny the program's existence or military nature, and view cooperation as capitulation. **Base rate: <10%.**
2.  **Iran-IAEA Crisis De-escalation:** A broader class is instances where Iran has de-escalated a major crisis with the IAEA over access or undeclared materials. Iran has a long history of brinkmanship, followed by tactical concessions to relieve pressure or enter negotiations (e.g., lead-up to the JCPOA). These cycles often take many months or years to resolve, not weeks. The base rate for resolving a major access dispute within a two-month window is low. **Base rate: 15-25%.**
3.  **Short-Notice Diplomatic Breakthroughs:** This class includes any major international agreement on a highly contentious issue reached in under three months from a point of public breakdown. Such rapid turnarounds are rare and usually require immense external pressure or a significant internal policy shift. **Base rate: <15%.**

*Reasoning*: The first reference class is the most specific and compelling. The direct, overt US military action fundamentally changes the dynamic from prior standoffs, making nationalistic defiance a more powerful factor than in past disputes. The low base rate from this class should be weighted most heavily.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** Grossi calls for cooperation, noting IAEA denied access to key sites despite other inspections. (↓) — Confirms the current state is a stalemate and that Iran is differentiating between access to bombed vs. non-bombed sites.
*   **2025-10-29** IAEA reports no active enrichment but "movement" near stockpiles; notes September deal is unimplemented. (↓) — Ambiguous movement without oversight is a negative signal. Reinforces that the September agreement is currently dead.
*   **2025-10-27** CSIS satellite imagery suggests potential new construction. (↓) — Indicates Iran is focused on rebuilding and future-proofing its program, not on transparency regarding its damaged, legacy sites.
*   **2025-10-20** Reuters reports Iran scrapped the September deal to resume inspections. (↓↓) — The single most important recent event. A definitive reversal from a cooperative path, suggesting hardliners have won the internal debate or the strategic calculus has changed.
*   **2025-09-09** Iran and IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections at bombed sites. (↑) — Showed that a path to "Yes" was plausible and that factions within Iran were willing to cooperate, likely to de-escalate post-war tensions.
*   **2025-07-15** IISS analysis suggests strikes were disruptive but did not destroy key facilities. (Neutral) — This means the 400kg stockpile is likely intact and recoverable, making it a valuable bargaining chip for Iran to conceal.
*   **2025-06-25** Iranian lawmakers vote to suspend IAEA cooperation. (↓) — The immediate, defiant political response to the US strikes, setting the baseline for non-cooperation.
*   **2025-06-22** US B-2 bombers strike Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. (↓↓) — The precipitating event. Creates immense political pressure in Iran against any perceived capitulation to Western demands.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Internal Hardliner Politics & National Pride (↓, Large):** After a direct US military attack, any cooperation with a UN body seen as Western-influenced will be framed as a national humiliation. The IRGC and other hardliners have a strong incentive to block access to preserve revolutionary credibility.
2.  **Strategic Value of Ambiguity (↓, Large):** The 400kg of 60% HEU is Iran's ultimate leverage. The uncertainty about its exact condition, location, and security forces adversaries to act cautiously. Granting access would surrender this powerful bargaining chip for an uncertain return.
3.  **Desire for Sanctions Relief/De-escalation (↑, Moderate):** Iran's economy remains a key vulnerability. A credible offer of significant, immediate sanctions relief in exchange for inspections could empower more pragmatic factions. Fear of further, more devastating strikes could also motivate a tactical concession.
4.  **Need for Technical Assessment (↑, Small):** The bombed sites may pose radiological hazards. Iran might need IAEA technical assistance for assessment and cleanup, which could provide a face-saving pretext for allowing access. This is a weak driver compared to the political stakes.
5.  **International Diplomatic Pressure (↑, Small):** While the IAEA Board of Governors and UN can pass resolutions, Iran has a long track record of ignoring such pressure when it conflicts with core security interests. Without a credible threat (more sanctions/force), this is unlikely to be decisive.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct US Military Attack:** Unlike previous sabotage events, this was a massive, overt US strike using "bunker buster" bombs. This is unprecedented and dramatically elevates the role of national honor and defiance, making concessions far more difficult than in typical Iran-IAEA disputes.
*   **Known High-Value Stockpile:** The issue is not about finding a secret program, but about accounting for a known, near-breakout quantity of 400kg of 60% HEU. The stakes are existential for both sides, reducing room for compromise.
*   **Recent Diplomatic Whiplash:** The rapid sequence of a deal being made (Sept 9) and then publicly scrapped (Oct 20) is unusual. It points to intense internal conflict and suggests the anti-cooperation faction has recently gained the upper hand.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in less than two months (by Jan 1, 2026). This is an exceptionally short period to reverse a major policy decision, negotiate complex modalities for access to bombed military sites, and overcome intense internal opposition.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior is warranted, anchored on the reference class of post-attack inspections. A starting point of ~10% with a moderate "equivalent n" of 10 seems appropriate, reflecting strong historical precedent.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The US strikes and Iran's immediate suspension of cooperation strongly confirm the low prior.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The September agreement to resume inspections was a significant piece of contrary evidence, suggesting a path to "Yes" was possible.
    *   (↓↓ Large) The October scrapping of that same deal is powerful, recency-weighted evidence that decisively reverses the September signal and pushes the probability down significantly.
    *   (↓ Small) Ongoing IAEA statements about non-cooperation and satellite imagery of new construction reinforce the current negative trajectory.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, especially the recent and definitive scrapping of the inspection deal, strongly reinforces the low prior. The posterior should be adjusted downward from the initial 10%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Reports of secret, high-level talks between Iran and the US/E3.
    *   Specific, public offers of sanctions relief from the US Treasury.
    *   Statements from the Iranian Foreign Ministry emphasizing the "technical" nature of the IAEA's work and hinting at a solution.
    *   A sudden halt in new construction activity near nuclear sites.
    *   Unusual diplomatic travel by the Omani or Qatari foreign ministers, who often act as intermediaries.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Fiery, defiant rhetoric from the Supreme Leader or IRGC commanders regarding the nuclear program.
    *   Official Iranian announcements about moving salvaged material or equipment to new, undisclosed locations.
    *   IAEA Board of Governors emergency meeting that results in a referral to the UN Security Council.
    *   Satellite imagery showing accelerated concealment efforts (e.g., moving earth over damaged entrances).
    *   Further deterioration in regional security, distracting from or hardening positions on the nuclear file.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on an "announcement of an agreement." Iran could announce a flimsy, symbolic agreement with no intention of granting meaningful access before the deadline, potentially triggering a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Information Opacity:** Our understanding of the internal power struggle between Iranian factions (e.g., IRGC vs. Foreign Ministry) is limited. A sudden policy shift due to an internal decision is possible but unpredictable.
*   **Deception:** Iran could use the promise of inspections as a tactic to delay further pressure or military action, with no intent to follow through.
*   **External Shocks:** A new regional conflict, a domestic crisis in the US, or other "black swan" events could instantly alter the strategic calculations of all parties.
*   **Physical State of Sites:** The actual damage to the sites is unknown. If the stockpile is buried under rubble and inaccessible, a technical justification for delaying inspections could be credible, complicating the issue.

**Final Research Summary:**
Following a direct and devastating US military attack, Iran's dominant posture is one of defiance, making any cooperation that could be seen as capitulation politically untenable. The recent, explicit cancellation of a prior agreement to allow inspections is the strongest possible signal that Tehran intends to leverage the ambiguity around its damaged nuclear stockpile and is highly unlikely to reverse course in the short time remaining before 2026.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is derived from the historical precedent of countries allowing international inspections of nuclear facilities shortly after those facilities were subject to a major foreign military attack. Historical examples, such as Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981 and Syria's Al Kibar facility in 2007, suggest that the base rate for such cooperation is extremely low. Therefore, a base rate of less than 10% is appropriate. This reflects the tendency of attacked nations to prioritize secrecy and national pride over international cooperation.

**Initial Prior:** 10%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Iran, like Iraq and Syria, has experienced a direct military attack on its nuclear facilities, which typically leads to increased secrecy and defiance.
- The political climate in Iran is characterized by strong nationalistic sentiments and resistance to perceived Western influence.

**Differences:**
- Unlike Iraq and Syria, Iran has a history of tactical concessions and brinkmanship with the IAEA, as seen in the lead-up to the JCPOA.
- The presence of a significant stockpile of 60% enriched uranium adds a layer of complexity, as it represents a critical bargaining chip for Iran.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **US Strikes and Immediate Suspension of Cooperation (↓↓):** The military attack and subsequent suspension of cooperation strongly support the low prior probability. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **September Agreement to Resume Inspections (↑):** This was a positive signal, suggesting a potential path to cooperation. Likelihood ratio greater than 1.
- **October Scrapping of the Deal (↓↓):** This is a decisive piece of evidence indicating a reversal from cooperation. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **Ongoing Non-Cooperation and New Construction (↓):** These reinforce the negative trajectory. Likelihood ratio less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 10%, the evidence overwhelmingly supports a decrease in probability due to the recent scrapping of the inspection deal and ongoing non-cooperation.

**Posterior Odds Calculation:**
- Prior odds = 10% / 90% = 1/9
- Likelihood ratio (considering all evidence) is significantly less than 1, suggesting a decrease in probability.

**Posterior Probability:**
- Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted downward from the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden diplomatic breakthrough, although the short time frame makes this unlikely.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A significant shift in internal Iranian politics or a major external diplomatic initiative could alter the outcome.
- **Rebuttals:** The rapid cancellation of the September deal suggests that hardliners currently dominate the decision-making process, reducing the likelihood of a reversal.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, the strong negative evidence, and the short time frame, the probability of Iran allowing IAEA inspections before 2026 is low.

Final: 5%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

1. **Countries allowing inspections after military strikes on nuclear facilities**: This is rare. After Israel's 1981 strike on Iraq's Osirak reactor and 2007 strike on Syria's Al Kibar facility, neither country allowed immediate international inspections. 

2. **Iran's historical cooperation with IAEA during crises**: Iran has a pattern of initial defiance followed by tactical concessions, but these typically take many months or years to materialize, not weeks.

3. **Iran's specific response to this attack**: Iran's parliament voted overwhelmingly to suspend IAEA cooperation immediately after the US strikes. They briefly announced a deal to resume inspections in September 2025, but scrapped it by October 2025.

Given these considerations, I'll use a base rate of **10%**. This reflects the extremely low historical precedent for allowing inspections after military strikes, Iran's pattern of prolonged resistance before concessions, and the specific context of a direct US military attack which makes cooperation politically difficult.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other countries whose nuclear facilities were attacked, Iran faces strong domestic pressure to demonstrate defiance rather than cooperation
- The Iranian parliament has formally suspended cooperation, consistent with typical initial responses
- The timeline is compressed (less than 2 months until resolution), and diplomatic breakthroughs on contentious nuclear issues typically take much longer

**Differences from base case:**
- The attack was conducted by the US (not Israel), which may intensify Iran's resistance given the historical US-Iran antagonism
- The attack was unusually large-scale, using 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on multiple facilities
- Iran briefly agreed to inspections in September before reversing course in October, showing some internal debate about the appropriate response
- The stockpile is known to be large (400kg of 60% enriched uranium) and strategically significant

These differences generally suggest an even lower probability than the base rate, particularly the scale of the US attack and the recent explicit reversal of the September agreement.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran's parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation (June 25, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this vote would be a temporary, face-saving measure. Probability ~0.7
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this vote would be expected. Probability ~0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.95 = 0.74 (evidence against allowing inspections)

**Evidence 2: Iran and IAEA announced a deal to resume inspections (September 9, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this announcement would be expected. Probability ~0.9
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this could be a temporary diplomatic maneuver. Probability ~0.2
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.2 = 4.5 (evidence for allowing inspections)

**Evidence 3: Iran scrapped the inspection deal (October 20, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this reversal would be unusual. Probability ~0.15
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this reversal would be expected. Probability ~0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.15/0.9 = 0.17 (strong evidence against allowing inspections)

**Evidence 4: IAEA reports no active enrichment but "movement" near stockpiles (October 29, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, they might be preparing sites. Probability ~0.4
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, they might be securing or relocating material. Probability ~0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.7 = 0.57 (moderate evidence against allowing inspections)

**Evidence 5: CSIS satellite imagery suggests potential new construction (October 27, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, new construction is somewhat unexpected. Probability ~0.3
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, rebuilding efforts would be expected. Probability ~0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.38 (evidence against allowing inspections)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior of 10% (odds of 1:9), I'll update based on the most significant pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 3 (scrapping the inspection deal):**
- Prior odds: 1:9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.17
- Posterior odds: 1:9 × 0.17 = 0.17:9 = 0.019:1
- Posterior probability: 0.019/(1+0.019) = 0.019/1.019 = 0.0186 ≈ 1.9%

This is a dramatic decrease, reflecting the strong signal sent by Iran explicitly canceling the inspection agreement. However, this update may be too extreme given the complexity of Iranian politics and diplomacy.

Let me reconsider with a more conservative approach, combining all evidence:
- Evidence 1 (parliamentary vote): LR = 0.74
- Evidence 2 (September agreement): LR = 4.5
- Evidence 3 (deal scrapped): LR = 0.17
- Evidence 4 (movement near stockpiles): LR = 0.57
- Evidence 5 (new construction): LR = 0.38

Combined likelihood ratio: 0.74 × 4.5 × 0.17 × 0.57 × 0.38 ≈ 0.12

Updating the prior:
- Prior odds: 1:9
- Combined likelihood ratio: 0.12
- Posterior odds: 1:9 × 0.12 = 0.12:9 = 0.013:1
- Posterior probability: 0.013/(1+0.013) = 0.013/1.013 = 0.0128 ≈ 1.3%

This seems too low given the complexity and unpredictability of international relations. Let me adjust for potential overconfidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Iran's pragmatism. They have made surprising concessions in the past when facing severe economic pressure.
- The timeline until January 1, 2026 (about 8 weeks) is short but not impossible for diplomatic breakthroughs.
- There could be secret negotiations occurring that aren't public knowledge.
- Iran might see some strategic advantage in allowing limited inspections to prevent further military action.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could announce a highly conditional, limited inspection agreement as a diplomatic maneuver.
- A major change in US policy (e.g., significant sanctions relief offer) could alter Iran's calculus.
- Internal political shifts in Iran could empower more pragmatic factions.

**Adjustments needed:**
My Bayesian update may have compounded multiple pieces of related evidence, leading to an overly confident low probability. The scrapping of the deal and subsequent indicators are not fully independent pieces of evidence.

Given these considerations, I should adjust upward from the calculated 1.3% to account for the inherent uncertainty and possibility of diplomatic surprises. A more reasonable range would be 5-10%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and accounting for uncertainty, I assess that Iran is very unlikely to allow IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile before 2026. The most compelling factors are:

1. The unprecedented nature of the US military attack creates immense political pressure against cooperation
2. The explicit cancellation of the September inspection agreement
3. The extremely short timeframe remaining (less than 2 months)
4. The strategic value of maintaining ambiguity about the stockpile's status

However, I must acknowledge the inherent unpredictability of international relations and Iran's history of occasional pragmatic shifts.

Final: 7%

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the behavior of nations whose nuclear facilities have been subjected to a major foreign military attack. Historical examples, such as Iraq after the Osirak reactor strike in 1981 and Syria after the Al Kibar facility strike in 2007, show a clear pattern. Attacked nations tend to deny the military nature of their programs, increase secrecy, and resist international inspections, viewing cooperation as a form of capitulation. This historical precedent suggests a very low base rate for allowing inspections shortly after an attack.

A broader reference class is Iran's own history of negotiating with the IAEA, which involves cycles of brinkmanship followed by tactical concessions. However, these cycles typically unfold over many months or years, not the short ~7-week period remaining until the deadline.

Given the unprecedented nature of a direct US strike on Iran's main nuclear sites, the "post-attack" reference class is the most relevant. I will set the prior probability based on this, but slightly higher than the near-zero historical rate to account for Iran's more established diplomatic apparatus compared to historical examples.

*   **Prior Probability (P(H)): 10%**. This reflects the strong historical tendency toward non-cooperation after an attack, while leaving some room for Iran's unique diplomatic patterns.
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.10 / 0.90 = 1/9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The core situation involves a sovereign nation's nuclear program being attacked by a foreign power.
*   The immediate political reaction in Iran was one of defiance and suspension of cooperation, mirroring the historical base case.
*   National pride and the influence of hardline security elements (like the IRGC) become dominant factors, making any perceived concession politically toxic.

**Differences:**
*   **Direct US Attack:** Unlike previous Israeli strikes in the region, this was an overt US military action. This dramatically increases the political stakes and the "humiliation" factor for Iran, making cooperation even less likely than in the base case.
*   **Known Stockpile:** The issue is not a suspected, undeclared site, but a known stockpile of 400kg of 60% enriched uranium. This makes the material an extremely valuable piece of strategic leverage for Iran to maintain ambiguity over.
*   **Recent Diplomatic Whiplash:** The announcement of a deal in September, followed by its public cancellation in October, is a key feature not present in the base cases. It indicates a severe internal power struggle in Iran, and that the anti-cooperation faction has recently gained the upper hand.

The differences, particularly the direct US involvement and the recent scrapping of the deal, suggest the situation is even more challenging than the already pessimistic base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most critical pieces of evidence are the dueling announcements from September and October.

*   **Evidence 1: Iran and the IAEA announce a deal on September 9.**
    *   This was a strong positive signal. It demonstrated that a path to "Yes" was considered viable by at least one powerful faction within the Iranian regime, likely to de-escalate post-war tensions. This evidence significantly increased the probability from the low prior.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: > 1 (Increases probability).

*   **Evidence 2: Iran scraps the deal on October 20.**
    *   This is a powerful and more recent piece of negative evidence. It doesn't just negate the September signal; it suggests the anti-cooperation faction has won the internal debate and decisively reversed policy.
    *   P(E | H): The likelihood of publicly scrapping a deal, given that you intend to make another one within two months, is very low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The likelihood of publicly scrapping a deal, given that you do *not* intend to make another one, is very high.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).

*   **Evidence 3: Ongoing reports of non-cooperation and new construction (late Oct/early Nov).**
    *   Reports from the IAEA and satellite imagery analysis confirm that Iran's current posture is one of non-compliance and rebuilding/hardening its program, not preparing for transparency. This reinforces the negative signal from the scrapped deal.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: < 1 (Decreases probability).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a **10% prior**, the September 9th agreement would have caused a significant update upwards, perhaps to the 25-30% range, as it showed a concrete path to resolution.

However, the October 20th announcement that the deal was scrapped is a much stronger, more recent signal in the opposite direction. It indicates the failure of the cooperative path. This evidence is strong enough to not only erase the gains from the September news but to push the probability significantly below the initial prior. The subsequent reports of non-cooperation further solidify this downward trend.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1/9.
*   **Combined Likelihood Ratio of recent evidence (scrapping the deal, new construction):** This is strongly negative. A conservative estimate for the combined LR would be around 0.3.
*   **Posterior Odds ≈** Prior Odds × LR = (1/9) × 0.3 = 0.3/9 = 1/30.
*   **Posterior Probability ≈** (1/30) / (1 + 1/30) = 1/31 ≈ 3%.

This formal update suggests a very low probability. Qualitatively, the political environment in Iran post-attack, combined with the definitive reversal of the only positive diplomatic step, makes another turnaround before 2026 highly improbable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome is that Iran might make a last-minute, tactical "announcement of an agreement" to forestall further military or economic pressure, without any immediate intention of providing meaningful access. The resolution criteria hinge only on the *announcement*, not the implementation. This is a classic Iranian diplomatic tactic. This scenario could be triggered by a significant, secret offer of sanctions relief from the US.

However, the internal political cost of such a move after a direct US attack would be immense for the Iranian leadership. The IRGC and other hardliners would likely view it as a profound betrayal. While a tactical announcement is a plausible path to a "Yes," the political barriers are extremely high, especially on such a short timeline. The current evidence points to the hardliners being in control of this file.

My low forecast of ~3% might be slightly too low, as it doesn't fully price in the possibility of a purely tactical, face-saving announcement that meets the letter of the resolution criteria. I will adjust slightly upward to account for this specific scenario.

### Final Forecast
The starting point is a low base rate of cooperation after a military attack. The most recent and powerful evidence—Iran's public cancellation of a previously agreed inspection deal—strongly reinforces this low prior. The political incentives for the Iranian regime, particularly the powerful hardline factions, are overwhelmingly aligned with defiance and maintaining strategic ambiguity over their valuable uranium stockpile. The extremely short timeframe makes a major policy reversal very unlikely. The only plausible path to a "Yes" is a last-minute tactical announcement, which remains a low-probability scenario.

Final: 8%
