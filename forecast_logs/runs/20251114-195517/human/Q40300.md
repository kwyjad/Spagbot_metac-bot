### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New US unilateral kinetic military operations in a foreign country.** The US has conducted numerous military operations, but most are within existing conflict zones (Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria) or are part of long-standing, low-intensity campaigns (e.g., Somalia, Yemen). A *new* operation in a country that is a major regional partner is much rarer. Since 2001, such actions have occurred perhaps 2-3 times (e.g., initial strikes in Pakistan, the raid in Abbottabad, strikes in Libya). This suggests a base rate of **<5%** for any given country-year where the US is not already engaged in conflict.
2.  **US military interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa.** US military action in Africa is typically limited to advising, training, and targeted counter-terror strikes with at least tacit consent from the host nation (e.g., Somalia, Niger). Major unilateral interventions are exceptionally rare, with the 1992-93 Somalia intervention (Operation Restore Hope) being a notable, and cautionary, example. The base rate for a *new, unilateral attack* in a major African nation is extremely low, likely **<1%** annually.
3.  **Foreign policy threats by President Trump leading to military action.** During his first term, President Trump issued numerous military threats (e.g., against North Korea, Iran). While some led to limited strikes (e.g., Syria chemical weapons strike, killing of Qasem Soleimani), most did not result in sustained campaigns or new interventions. This suggests that a verbal threat, while significant, does not automatically translate to action. The conversion rate from explicit threat to kinetic action within a short timeframe is perhaps **10-20%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-10] First Things article highlights Christian persecution in Nigeria, framing it for a US conservative audience. (↑) — Elevates the issue's salience with the President's political base, providing a domestic political rationale for action.
*   [2025-11-01] President Trump posts on Truth Social, ordering the DoD to "prepare for possible action" and threatening to go in "guns-a-blazing." (↑↑) — The primary driver. A direct, public statement of intent from the Commander-in-Chief dramatically increases the probability from the baseline.
*   [2025-11-03] Anonymous DoD officials leak to the press that AFRICOM is reviewing contingency plans for Nigeria, including targeted strikes and personnel recovery options. (↑) — Confirms the President's order is being actioned, moving it from pure rhetoric to the initial stages of operational planning.
*   [2025-11-05] The Nigerian government issues a statement condemning "foreign interference" and highlighting its own counter-terrorism efforts against Boko Haram/ISWAP. (↓) — Signals a lack of consent, increasing the diplomatic and logistical barriers to a US operation.
*   [2025-11-08] The US State Department issues a travel advisory for Nigeria and authorizes the voluntary departure of non-essential embassy personnel. (↑) — A standard precautionary step before potential military action, indicating the threat is being taken seriously within the US government.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Volition & Domestic Politics (Large):** The primary driver is President Trump's personal commitment to the issue, likely motivated by his appeal to his evangelical Christian base. His willingness to bypass traditional foreign policy processes makes his public statements a powerful causal factor.
2.  **Institutional Inertia/Resistance (Large):** The Department of Defense and State Department are likely to view a unilateral strike on a key regional partner as extremely risky and counterproductive to long-term interests (e.g., counter-terrorism cooperation, regional stability). This institutional friction is a major brake on action.
3.  **Availability of a "Legitimate" Target (Moderate):** The presence of internationally recognized terrorist groups like ISWAP and Boko Haram provides a plausible target set. A strike could be framed as a counter-terrorism operation, even if the stated motive is protecting Christians, making it more palatable than attacking Nigerian state forces.
4.  **Nigerian Government Response (Moderate):** A lack of consent from Nigeria makes any operation an invasion of sovereign territory, dramatically raising the stakes. Conversely, if Nigeria were to launch a major, credible new offensive against the groups in question, it could provide the White House with an "off-ramp."
5.  **Triggering Event / Atrocity (Moderate):** A large-scale, highly publicized massacre of Christians in the coming weeks could force the President's hand, overriding institutional objections to fulfill his public pledge. The absence of such an event allows the issue to fade.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Presidential Directive:** Unlike most latent conflicts, the US President has publicly and personally ordered the Pentagon to plan for an attack. This is a rare and significant departure from the norm.
*   **Primary Justification:** The rationale is explicitly the protection of a religious group, rather than the more common justifications of counter-terrorism, WMDs, or a direct threat to US interests/personnel. This is highly unusual in modern US foreign policy.
*   **Target Nation Status:** Nigeria is not a failed state (like Somalia) or a pariah state (like Syria). It is the most populous country in Africa, a major oil producer, and a key partner in regional security. A unilateral attack would rupture this relationship with severe consequences, unlike strikes in Yemen or Pakistan.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The threat was issued in November 2025 for action before January 2026. This compressed timeframe for planning and execution of a *new* intervention is exceptionally rare without a direct provocation like an attack on a US embassy.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior probability should be very low, anchored on the base rate of new US unilateral attacks on major regional partners (<1%). This prior is strong (high "equivalent n") due to decades of historical data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑↑ Large) President Trump's direct, public order to the DoD to prepare for action.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Confirmation of contingency planning and State Dept travel advisories.
    *   (↓ Small) Nigerian government's public opposition (this was expected).
    *   (↑ Small) Framing of the issue for the President's domestic base.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the President's direct statement, constitutes a massive upward shock to the extremely low prior. The posterior should be orders of magnitude higher than the base rate, moving from "highly improbable" to "a serious, non-trivial possibility."

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Positioning of US military assets (e.g., ISR drones, naval assets in the Gulf of Guinea, special operations forces in neighboring countries).
    *   Further inflammatory rhetoric from President Trump, specifically tying his credibility to taking action.
    *   A high-profile atrocity against Christians in Nigeria that generates significant media coverage.
    *   US intelligence leaks detailing a specific, "targetable" terrorist leader or training camp.
    *   Evacuation orders for non-essential US embassy staff becoming mandatory.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   De-escalatory statements from the Secretary of State or Defense, emphasizing a "diplomatic solution."
    *   Announcement of a high-level US diplomatic visit to Abuja.
    *   The Nigerian military launching a new, well-publicized offensive in the conflict zones.
    *   President Trump's attention becomes consumed by a different domestic or international crisis.
    *   Statements of opposition from key international allies (e.g., UK, France, African Union).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Defining "Attack":** The resolution criteria are broad. A single drone strike against an ISWAP leader would count, which is far more plausible than a bombing campaign or troop deployment. The forecast must account for this wide range of possible actions.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Reality:** The primary evidence is a statement from a President known for dramatic and often unfulfilled threats. Differentiating between genuine policy intent and political posturing is the central challenge.
*   **Intelligence Gaps:** The feasibility of a clean, targeted strike depends on high-quality intelligence, which may be lacking. A failed or messy operation with high civilian casualties is a major deterrent for Pentagon planners.
*   **Nigerian Agency:** The Nigerian government is not a passive actor. It could take actions (military or diplomatic) that fundamentally change the US calculus in a very short period.

**Final Research Summary:**
This is a low-probability event made plausible by the direct, public threat from a President known for unconventional decision-making. The primary tension is between the President's political motivation and the significant institutional and geopolitical constraints against attacking a major regional partner.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for New US Unilateral Military Operations**: Historically, the US has conducted new unilateral military operations in foreign countries very rarely, especially in countries where it is not already engaged in conflict. The base rate for such actions is estimated to be less than 5% annually.
- **Base Rate for US Military Interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa**: Major unilateral interventions in Africa are even rarer, with a base rate likely less than 1% annually.
- **Base Rate for Foreign Policy Threats by President Trump Leading to Action**: During his first term, explicit threats by President Trump led to military action in about 10-20% of cases.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prior probability for a new US military attack in Nigeria, a major regional partner, is extremely low, likely around 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The situation involves a potential new military operation in a country where the US is not currently engaged in conflict, aligning with the base rate for new unilateral operations.
- **Differences**: The explicit directive from President Trump and the framing of the issue as protecting Christians are significant departures from typical US military justifications, which usually involve counter-terrorism or direct threats to US interests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **President Trump's Directive**: The direct order to prepare for possible action significantly increases the likelihood of an attack compared to the base rate. This is a strong piece of evidence (↑↑).
- **Contingency Planning by DoD**: The confirmation of planning activities by the Department of Defense further increases the likelihood (↑).
- **Nigerian Government's Opposition**: The lack of consent from Nigeria decreases the likelihood, as it raises diplomatic and logistical barriers (↓).
- **State Department Travel Advisory**: This precautionary measure indicates the threat is being taken seriously, slightly increasing the likelihood (↑).
- **Domestic Political Framing**: The issue's salience with President Trump's political base provides additional motivation for action (↑).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability**: 1% (0.01 in probability terms)
- **Likelihood Ratio**: The combination of evidence, particularly the President's directive and DoD planning, suggests a significant increase from the prior. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 10, given the unusual nature of the directive and planning.
- **Posterior Odds**: Prior odds (0.01 / 0.99) × Likelihood ratio (10) = 0.101
- **Posterior Probability**: 0.101 / (1 + 0.101) ≈ 9.2%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast must consider the possibility of rhetoric not translating into action, a common occurrence with President Trump's threats.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A major atrocity against Christians could force action, while diplomatic efforts or a shift in focus to another crisis could prevent it.
- **Rebuttals**: Institutional resistance and the high stakes of attacking a key partner like Nigeria are strong counterarguments to action.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential scenarios, the probability of the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood due to the President's directive and planning activities, while accounting for significant institutional and geopolitical constraints.

Final: 9%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria in the next ~6 weeks (from mid-November 2025 to January 1, 2026).

The most relevant base rates to consider:

- **US unilateral military strikes in new countries**: The US has conducted limited strikes in various countries over recent decades, but initiating completely new military operations in countries where they weren't previously engaged is rare. Since 2000, new unilateral military operations have occurred in perhaps 5-7 countries (Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, possibly others), giving a base rate of roughly 5-7 countries over 25 years, or about 0.2-0.3 countries per year.

- **US military operations in Sub-Saharan Africa**: Even more rare, with limited operations in Somalia, occasional drone strikes, and advisory roles in countries like Niger, but very few direct attacks. Perhaps 1-2 countries in 25 years, or about 0.04-0.08 countries per year.

- **US military actions following explicit presidential threats**: During Trump's first term, he made several threats (North Korea, Iran), with only a small portion resulting in actual strikes (Syria, the Soleimani strike). The conversion rate from threat to action was perhaps 15-25%.

Given these considerations, I'll start with a prior of **2%** (0.02 probability or 1:49 odds). This reflects the extreme rarity of new US military operations in Africa, but acknowledges that presidential threats slightly increase the baseline probability.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Nigeria has active terrorist groups (Boko Haram, ISWAP) that the US opposes, similar to other countries where the US has conducted strikes
- There is ongoing violence that could be framed as justifying intervention
- The US has military capabilities in the region that could be deployed

**Key differences:**
- Nigeria is a major regional ally and the most populous country in Africa, unlike typical targets of US unilateral strikes
- The stated motivation is protection of Christians, not counter-terrorism (though this could be reframed)
- The timeline is extremely compressed (weeks, not months)
- President Trump has made an unusually explicit and public threat
- The Nigerian government has explicitly opposed foreign intervention

These differences, particularly Trump's direct public threat and the compressed timeline, suggest the probability should be adjusted upward from the base rate, but the strategic importance of Nigeria as a partner and the Nigerian government's opposition are significant constraints.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate the key pieces of evidence:

**1. Trump's direct order to DoD to "prepare for possible action" and threat to go in "guns-a-blazing"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US were planning to attack, such a statement would be likely
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.2) - Trump has made threats without follow-through before, but this is unusually specific
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5 (strongly increases probability)

**2. DoD officials leaking that AFRICOM is reviewing contingency plans**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - This would be a necessary step before any attack
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Contingency planning often occurs without leading to action
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4 (moderately increases probability)

**3. Nigerian government condemning "foreign interference"**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Expected response if attack is likely
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Also an expected response to mere threats
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.1 (slightly increases probability)

**4. State Department travel advisory and voluntary departure of personnel**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Standard procedure before military action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could be precautionary even without planned attack
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (moderately increases probability)

**5. Framing of Christian persecution for conservative audience**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Building public support would precede action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could be political messaging without intent to attack
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 1:49 (2% probability), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on Trump's direct order:**
- Prior odds: 1:49
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 4.5:49 ≈ 1:10.9
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+10.9) ≈ 8.4%

**Update on DoD contingency planning:**
- Prior odds: 1:10.9
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 2.4:10.9 ≈ 1:4.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+4.5) ≈ 18.2%

**Update on State Department travel advisory:**
- Prior odds: 1:4.5
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 1.8:4.5 ≈ 1:2.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+2.5) ≈ 28.6%

**Update on remaining evidence (combined):**
- Prior odds: 1:2.5
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- Posterior odds: 1.5:2.5 = 3:5
- Posterior probability: 3/(3+5) = 3/8 = 37.5%

This suggests a posterior probability of approximately 38% based on the evidence presented.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Let me critically evaluate this forecast:

**Arguments for a lower probability:**
- Trump has a history of making dramatic threats without follow-through (e.g., North Korea)
- The institutional resistance within DoD and State to attacking a major African partner would be enormous
- The timeline is extremely short (6 weeks) for planning a new military operation
- There are significant diplomatic and strategic costs to attacking Nigeria without consent
- No specific triggering event (like a major massacre) has occurred yet

**Arguments for a higher probability:**
- Trump's second term may feature fewer institutional constraints than his first
- The presence of legitimate terrorist targets (ISWAP, Boko Haram) provides a plausible justification
- Even a single drone strike would count as resolution, lowering the operational threshold
- The explicit nature of the threat creates reputational costs for inaction
- The compressed timeline might actually increase likelihood as it leaves less time for de-escalation

I may be overestimating the likelihood ratio for Trump's statements, given his history of unfulfilled threats. I should also consider that the resolution criteria only requires a single military attack, not a sustained campaign, which lowers the threshold considerably.

Adjusting for these considerations, I believe I should reduce my estimate somewhat, to around 30%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all the evidence, the base rates, and the critical evaluation, I assess that there is approximately a 30% chance that the United States will conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026.

This probability reflects:
- The extremely low base rate for new US military operations in Africa
- The significant upward adjustment due to Trump's explicit threat and preparatory actions
- The short timeline (6 weeks) which constrains planning but also reduces time for de-escalation
- The fact that even a single, limited strike would count for resolution

Final: 30%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the frequency of the United States launching a *new*, unilateral military attack in a country with which it is not already in a state of conflict, particularly a major regional partner. The research report suggests two relevant reference classes:
1.  **New US unilateral kinetic operations:** This is rare, happening only a few times since 2001 (e.g., initial strikes in Pakistan, Libya). This suggests a very low annual probability, perhaps <5%.
2.  **US military interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa:** Major unilateral interventions are exceptionally rare, with most operations involving host-nation consent. The base rate for a new, non-consensual attack on a major African partner like Nigeria is extremely low, likely <1% annually.

I will select the more specific reference class and establish a prior probability of **1%** for a US attack on Nigeria in a given year, under normal circumstances. This reflects the strong historical precedent against such actions. In odds, this is 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** Nigeria hosts internationally recognized terrorist groups (ISWAP, Boko Haram), which provides a plausible set of targets and a potential counter-terrorism justification, similar to US operations in Somalia or Yemen.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Explicit Presidential Directive:** The most significant difference is the direct, public order from President Trump to the DoD to "prepare for possible action." This elevates the situation from a remote possibility to an active contingency being considered at the highest level.
    *   **Target Nation Status:** Nigeria is not a failed state or a pariah regime. It is Africa's most populous nation, a major oil producer, and a key regional security partner. A unilateral US attack would be a major geopolitical event with severe diplomatic consequences, unlike strikes in less stable or adversarial nations.
    *   **Stated Rationale:** The primary justification is the protection of a religious minority (Christians), a highly unusual motive for modern US military intervention, driven by domestic political considerations for the President's base.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will assess the key evidence and its impact on the 1% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: President Trump's public threat and order to the DoD (Nov 1).**
    *   P(E | H): If the US were to attack, it's highly likely the President would first make public threats to build a case and signal intent.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the US were not to attack, it's also plausible that this President, known for dramatic rhetoric, would make such a threat for political posturing without intending to follow through. The research report notes a historical 10-20% conversion rate from his threats to action.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is much more likely if an attack is planned than if it isn't. The LR is significantly greater than 1. This is the single most important piece of evidence, causing a massive upward revision from the base rate.

*   **Evidence 2: DoD confirms contingency planning; State Dept. issues travel advisory (Nov 3 & 8).**
    *   P(E | H): These are necessary bureaucratic steps if an attack is being seriously considered. They are almost certain to occur if H is true.
    *   P(E | ~H): These steps would also be taken out of an abundance of caution and due diligence in response to a presidential directive, even if the leadership of DoD/State thought the attack was a bad idea and unlikely to be approved.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is moderately more likely under H than ~H. It confirms the President's threat is being actioned within the government, moving it beyond mere words. This provides a moderate upward update.

*   **Evidence 3: Nigerian government condemns "foreign interference" (Nov 5).**
    *   P(E | H) vs. P(E | ~H): Nigeria would publicly condemn a public threat regardless of whether they believed the US would follow through. This was an expected reaction and provides no new information to distinguish between the two hypotheses. The likelihood ratio is approximately 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior:** P(H) = 1% (Odds = 1:99).
*   **Update 1 (Trump's Threat):** The threat is the dominant factor. Instead of a formal LR, I will use the research report's "10-20% conversion rate" as a strong anchor for the posterior probability. This figure implicitly accounts for the balance between Trump's rhetoric and the institutional/geopolitical constraints. This single piece of evidence moves the probability from ~1% into the **10-20% range**.
*   **Update 2 (Bureaucratic Action):** The DoD and State Dept actions confirm the threat is being taken seriously internally. This pushes the probability towards the higher end of the plausible range established by the threat itself.
*   **Constraints:** The extremely high strategic cost of alienating Nigeria and the significant institutional resistance from the foreign policy establishment act as a powerful brake, making a probability above 20-25% unlikely without a further triggering event. The very short timeline (before Jan 1, 2026) also presents logistical challenges for a new, non-consensual operation.
*   **Posterior Estimate:** Balancing the powerful upward push from the presidential directive against the significant downward pressure from institutional and geopolitical realities, I arrive at a posterior probability in the low-to-mid teens.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Forecast (Higher, e.g., 30%):** This forecast might be too low if I am underestimating President Trump's personal resolve or overestimating the ability of the Pentagon and State Department to restrain him. A new, high-profile atrocity against Christians in Nigeria could occur in the coming weeks, creating a political imperative for action that overrides all other concerns.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Lower, e.g., 5%):** This forecast might be too high if I am taking political theater too seriously. The threat may be entirely for domestic consumption. The Nigerian government could provide an "off-ramp" by launching its own well-publicized offensive, allowing Trump to claim victory without acting. The logistical hurdles for a clean strike on a short timeline may also be insurmountable.
*   **Adjustment:** The wide range of possible actions, from a single drone strike to a larger campaign, is a key uncertainty. A limited, symbolic strike against a known terrorist leader is the most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution. It would allow the President to claim he fulfilled his promise while minimizing risks. The existence of this "middle ground" option keeps the probability from being lower. My initial assessment seems to balance these risks appropriately.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for such an attack is exceptionally low. However, a direct and public threat from the US President is a rare and powerful piece of evidence that dramatically increases the probability. The primary conflict is between the President's stated intent, driven by domestic politics, and the immense strategic costs and institutional opposition to attacking a key regional partner. The short timeline and logistical challenges are significant constraints, but the broad definition of "attack" allows for a limited, symbolic strike that remains plausible. I assess that while an attack is still unlikely, the threat is credible enough to warrant a significant probability.

Final: 15%
