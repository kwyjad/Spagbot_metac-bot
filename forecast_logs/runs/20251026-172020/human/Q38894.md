### Reference class & base rates
1.  **High-Stakes Corporate IP Litigation:** Lawsuits between major corporations over intellectual property, especially in tech and media, have a very high settlement rate. The risks of a negative trial outcome (adverse precedent, massive damages, reputational harm) and the high costs of litigation incentivize out-of-court resolutions.
    *   **Base Rate (Settlement):** 80-90%. Derived from general legal statistics showing that the vast majority of civil cases, particularly complex commercial ones, settle before trial.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a general base rate and doesn't account for the novel legal questions specific to generative AI, which could make both sides more willing to fight for a landmark precedent.

2.  **Disruptive Technology vs. Copyright Holders:** Historical lawsuits where a new technology's use of copyrighted material was challenged (e.g., Sony v. Universal on VCRs, A&M Records v. Napster on P2P file sharing, Authors Guild v. Google on book scanning).
    *   **Base Rate (Mixed Outcomes):** No clear winner. Tech companies won in *Sony* and *Google Books* (on "fair use" grounds), while copyright holders won in *Napster*. This suggests roughly a 50/50 chance on the core legal question of fair use if the case goes to trial, highlighting the deep uncertainty.
    *   **Limitations:** The specific facts and the "transformative" nature of the technology are paramount. Generative AI's ability to both create novel outputs and reproduce original text verbatim makes it a poor fit for any single precedent.

3.  **Publisher Negotiations with AI Companies:** The emerging class of interactions between news publishers and AI developers. Many major publishers (e.g., Axel Springer, Associated Press, Le Monde) have signed licensing deals with OpenAI.
    *   **Base Rate (Licensing/Settlement):** High and increasing. This suggests a strong commercial incentive for both sides to find a business solution rather than a legal one.
    *   **Limitations:** The NYT is a particularly high-profile holdout and may be seeking to set a precedent for the entire industry, not just secure a deal for itself, making it an outlier.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-02-15** OpenAI files motion to dismiss parts of the lawsuit, arguing NYT used "deceptive prompts" to "hack" ChatGPT into regurgitating content. ↓ (for NYT Win) — Introduces a defense that frames NYT's evidence as unrepresentative of normal use.
*   **2024-02-27** Microsoft files its own motion to dismiss, echoing OpenAI's arguments and framing the lawsuit as "doomsday futurology." ↓ (for NYT Win) — Shows a united defense front and reinforces the "atypical use" argument.
*   **2024-04-15** NYT files its opposition to the motions to dismiss, arguing the "hacking" claim is a baseless distraction from the core issue of massive, unauthorized copying. ↑ (for NYT Win) — Reasserts the strength of its core infringement claim and pushes back on the defense's primary narrative.
*   **2024-04-29** Eight more newspapers owned by Alden Global Capital sue OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. ↑ (for Settlement) — Increases legal pressure on the defendants, making a global settlement with publishers more attractive than fighting a multi-front war.
*   **2024-05-22** OpenAI announces a content partnership with News Corp (Wall Street Journal, etc.), following similar deals with the FT, AP, and Axel Springer. ↑ (for Settlement) — Demonstrates OpenAI's strategy is to license content, making it more likely they will seek a similar business resolution with the NYT.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **The "Fair Use" Doctrine:** This is the central legal battleground. OpenAI's argument that training is a "transformative use" is the core of its defense. A judicial finding on this point will be the most significant driver of the outcome. (Size: Large)
2.  **Risk of Precedent:** For OpenAI/Microsoft, a loss could invalidate their entire business model and expose them to countless other lawsuits. For the NYT, a loss would devalue their content archive and weaken their negotiating position. This mutual risk strongly incentivizes a settlement. (Size: Large)
3.  **Potential for Massive Statutory Damages:** The NYT alleges infringement of millions of articles. Copyright law allows for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work. Even a finding of infringement on a tiny fraction of the works could easily push damages into the billions, giving the NYT immense leverage. (Size: Large)
4.  **Strength of "Regurgitation" Evidence:** The NYT's complaint includes direct, side-by-side examples of ChatGPT reproducing near-verbatim excerpts of its articles. This is powerful, visceral evidence that is harder to defend than the abstract concept of "training." (Size: Moderate)
5.  **DMCA Violation Claims:** The NYT also alleges OpenAI removed copyright management information (like author names and links). This is a separate claim from copyright infringement, is harder to defend under "fair use," and carries its own statutory damages, providing NYT another path to victory. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Industry-wide Trend Towards Licensing:** As more major publishers sign deals with OpenAI, the NYT becomes more of an outlier. This could either isolate the NYT or increase its leverage as the most significant holdout, but it clearly establishes a non-litigious path to resolution. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scale:** Unlike Google Books scanning 20 million books, LLM training involves ingesting a significant portion of the accessible internet. The sheer scale of alleged infringement is orders of magnitude larger than in most precedents.
*   **Dual-Use Nature of Output:** Generative AI is not just a search tool (transformative) but can also be a direct substitute for the original content by "regurgitating" it (infringing). This ambiguity makes applying past "fair use" precedents difficult.
*   **"Black Box" Technology:** The inner workings of LLMs are not fully understood, making it difficult to prove or disprove exactly how the models use and store information from specific copyrighted works.
*   **Existential Stakes for an Entire Industry:** A decisive win for the NYT could fundamentally challenge the legality of how all major generative AI models are currently built, raising the stakes far beyond the two parties involved.
*   **Defendant is a Partnership:** The suit targets both the developer (OpenAI) and the primary distributor/investor (Microsoft), creating a complex dynamic and a very deep-pocketed opposition.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior on "The case is settled" (~85%) based on the reference class of high-stakes corporate IP litigation. Distribute the remaining 15% with a slight edge to NYT winning over OpenAI winning, given the prima facie evidence. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   NYT's direct "regurgitation" evidence: ↑ NYT Wins, ↑ Settlement (large).
    *   OpenAI's "deceptive prompting" defense: ↓ NYT Wins (small-moderate, as it's a rebuttal, not a core defense).
    *   Uncertainty of "fair use" precedent for AI: ↑ Settlement (large, as risk aversion dominates).
    *   Massive statutory damage potential: ↑ NYT Wins ≥$50M (if no settlement), ↑ Settlement (large).
    *   Growing number of publisher licensing deals: ↑ Settlement (moderate).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the high prior on a settlement. The strength of the NYT's evidence and the massive damage potential increase the conditional probability of a high-value NYT win *if* the case goes to trial, but this very fact makes settlement the overwhelmingly rational choice for the defendants. The posterior for "Settlement" should remain very high or even increase slightly.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring NYT Win or high-value Settlement):**
    *   Judge's denial of the defendants' motions to dismiss.
    *   Leaked information from discovery showing internal OpenAI/Microsoft awareness of copyright issues.
    *   Rulings in other, similar AI copyright cases (e.g., Getty, Sarah Silverman) that favor content creators.
    *   Statements from the judge in preliminary hearings that seem skeptical of the "fair use" defense.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring OpenAI/Microsoft Win):**
    *   Judge granting the motions to dismiss key claims (especially the DMCA claim).
    *   Discovery evidence that strongly supports the "deceptive prompting" narrative.
    *   A landmark court ruling in another jurisdiction that finds AI training to be fair use.
    *   NYT dropping certain claims or signaling a willingness to accept a smaller licensing deal.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Settlement Confidentiality:** The most likely outcome is a settlement whose terms are not public. The resolution criteria state this resolves to "The case is settled," but any monetary figures would be unknown.
*   **Judicial Idiosyncrasy:** The case is in the Southern District of New York, but the outcome could heavily depend on a single judge's interpretation of how a 1976 law applies to 2023 technology. This is a major source of uncertainty.
*   **Long Timeline:** This case will likely take years to resolve if it doesn't settle. The legal, technological, and regulatory landscape for AI could change dramatically in that time.
*   **"Other" Resolution:** The possibility of a non-monetary, injunctive relief (e.g., forcing OpenAI to destroy models trained on NYT data) is a low-probability but high-impact "Other" outcome that should not be entirely dismissed.
*   **Definition of "Win":** A settlement is a business decision, not a legal victory. A settlement could involve a payment >$50M but would resolve

To forecast the outcome of the New York Times' copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, let's follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **The case is settled (80-90%)**: High-stakes corporate IP litigation typically results in settlements due to the risks and costs associated with trials. This is supported by historical data showing that most civil cases, especially complex commercial ones, settle before reaching a verdict.
  
- **NYT Wins ≥$50 Million / NYT Wins <$50 Million / OpenAI & Microsoft Win (10-20% combined)**: Based on historical outcomes of disruptive technology vs. copyright holders, where outcomes are mixed and depend heavily on the specifics of the case. Given the high stakes and potential for a landmark ruling, these outcomes are less likely than a settlement.

- **Other (1-5%)**: This accounts for unusual outcomes such as non-monetary resolutions or procedural dismissals.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves high-profile corporate entities and complex IP issues, typical of cases that settle.
  
- **Differences**: The novel legal questions surrounding generative AI and the potential for a landmark precedent could make both parties more willing to fight the case in court.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **NYT's "regurgitation" evidence**: Strong evidence for NYT, increasing the likelihood of a win if the case goes to trial. However, it also increases the incentive for OpenAI/Microsoft to settle to avoid a negative precedent.

- **OpenAI's "deceptive prompting" defense**: Weakens NYT's position slightly but is more of a rebuttal than a core defense.

- **Growing number of publisher licensing deals**: Suggests a trend towards settlements and licensing agreements, reinforcing the likelihood of a settlement.

- **Massive statutory damage potential**: Increases the stakes for OpenAI/Microsoft, making a settlement more attractive to avoid potentially crippling damages.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior for Settlement (85%)**: Given the high base rate for settlements in similar cases.
  
- **Evidence Impact**: The strong evidence from NYT and the trend towards licensing deals reinforce the settlement likelihood. The potential for massive damages further incentivizes settlement.

- **Posterior for Settlement**: Likely remains high, possibly increasing slightly to account for the strong incentives to avoid trial.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Ensure not to overestimate the likelihood of settlement due to the unique aspects of this case.
  
- **Tail Risks**: Consider the possibility of a landmark ruling or procedural dismissal, though these remain low probability.

- **Alternative Forecast**: A plausible alternative is a NYT win if the case goes to trial, given the strength of their evidence. However, the incentives for settlement remain strong.

### 6. Final Normalization

- **Settlement**: 85%
- **NYT Wins ≥$50 Million**: 5%
- **NYT Wins <$50 Million**: 3%
- **OpenAI & Microsoft Win**: 5%
- **Other**: 2%

### 7. Output Format

The case is settled: 85%  
NYT Wins ≥$50 Million: 5%  
NYT Wins <$50 Million: 3%  
OpenAI & Microsoft Win: 5%  
Other: 2%  

These probabilities reflect the strong likelihood of a settlement, given the incentives and historical trends, while accounting for the unique aspects of the case.

# Analysis of NYT Copyright Lawsuit Against OpenAI and Microsoft

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior based on relevant reference classes:

**The case is settled**: ~85%
- Based on high-stakes corporate IP litigation, where 80-90% of cases settle before trial
- Particularly relevant for complex commercial cases with high uncertainty and risk
- Both sides have strong incentives to avoid setting adverse precedents

**NYT Wins ≥$50 Million**: ~5%
- Based on the small percentage of copyright cases that go to trial and result in large damages
- Statutory damages for willful infringement can be up to $150,000 per work, and NYT claims millions of works
- However, courts rarely award maximum statutory damages

**NYT Wins <$50 Million**: ~4%
- Similar reasoning as above, but accounting for courts' tendency to award more modest damages
- Even if NYT prevails, the court may limit the scope of infringement

**OpenAI & Microsoft Win**: ~5%
- Based on tech companies' success rate in "fair use" cases involving new technologies
- Precedents like Google Books suggest transformative use arguments can succeed
- However, "regurgitation" evidence complicates the fair use defense

**Other**: ~1%
- Low probability for non-monetary outcomes like injunctive relief
- Could include partial victories with complex remedies

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like most high-stakes corporate litigation, both sides have strong incentives to settle
- Similar to previous copyright vs. technology cases (Google Books, Napster) in testing fair use boundaries
- Follows pattern of publishers negotiating with AI companies (AP, Axel Springer deals)

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented scale of alleged infringement (millions of articles)
- Dual nature of AI output (both transformative and potentially verbatim reproduction)
- "Black box" technology makes proving/disproving specific infringement difficult
- Existential stakes for an entire industry, not just the parties involved
- Strong evidence of "regurgitation" provides NYT with compelling examples

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring settlement:**
- Industry trend toward licensing deals (OpenAI has signed with AP, Axel Springer, News Corp)
  - P(E|Settlement) = Very High; P(E|Trial) = Low
- Mutual risk of adverse precedent for both parties
  - P(E|Settlement) = High; P(E|Trial) = Low
- Eight additional newspapers filing similar lawsuits increases pressure
  - P(E|Settlement) = High; P(E|Trial) = Moderate

**Evidence favoring NYT Win:**
- Direct evidence of "regurgitation" in the complaint
  - P(E|NYT Wins) = High; P(E|OpenAI Wins) = Low
- DMCA violation claims (harder to defend under fair use)
  - P(E|NYT Wins) = Moderate; P(E|OpenAI Wins) = Low
- Potential for massive statutory damages
  - P(E|NYT Wins ≥$50M) = Moderate; P(E|NYT Wins <$50M) = High

**Evidence favoring OpenAI/Microsoft:**
- "Deceptive prompting" defense in motions to dismiss
  - P(E|OpenAI Wins) = Moderate; P(E|NYT Wins) = Low
- Precedent from Google Books case supporting transformative use
  - P(E|OpenAI Wins) = Moderate; P(E|NYT Wins) = Low

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the key evidence of industry trend toward licensing deals:

Prior odds for Settlement vs. Non-Settlement:
- P(Settlement) / P(Non-Settlement) = 85% / 15% = 5.67

Likelihood ratio:
- P(Licensing Trend|Settlement) / P(Licensing Trend|Non-Settlement) ≈ 3:1

Posterior odds:
- 5.67 × 3 = 17.01

Posterior probability:
- P(Settlement|Licensing Trend) = 17.01 / (1 + 17.01) ≈ 94.4%

This significantly strengthens the case for settlement.

Now, let's update the conditional probabilities if the case does go to trial, focusing on the "regurgitation" evidence:

Prior odds for NYT Win vs. OpenAI Win (conditional on trial):
- P(NYT Win) / P(OpenAI Win) = 9% / 5% = 1.8

Likelihood ratio:
- P(Regurgitation Evidence|NYT Win) / P(Regurgitation Evidence|OpenAI Win) ≈ 4:1

Posterior odds:
- 1.8 × 4 = 7.2

Posterior probability:
- P(NYT Win|Regurgitation Evidence) = 7.2 / (1 + 7.2) ≈ 87.8%

This suggests that if the case does go to trial, NYT has a strong advantage.

For the size of potential damages (≥$50M vs <$50M), the statutory damages framework and scale of alleged infringement suggest:

Prior odds for ≥$50M vs <$50M (conditional on NYT Win):
- P(≥$50M) / P(<$50M) = 5% / 4% = 1.25

Likelihood ratio based on scale of alleged infringement:
- P(Millions of Works|≥$50M) / P(Millions of Works|<$50M) ≈ 2:1

Posterior odds:
- 1.25 × 2 = 2.5

Posterior probability:
- P(≥$50M|Millions of Works) = 2.5 / (1 + 2.5) ≈ 71.4%

This suggests that if NYT wins, damages ≥$50M are more likely than <$50M.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating settlement likelihood based on general litigation statistics
- The novel legal questions might make both sides more willing to seek precedent
- The judge's background and views on technology could significantly impact rulings
- The timeline could extend for years, changing the landscape dramatically

**Alternative scenarios:**
- NYT might view this as a principled stand worth fighting for, regardless of settlement offers
- OpenAI/Microsoft might view a settlement as admission of wrongdoing that threatens their entire model
- The case could be consolidated with other publisher lawsuits, changing the dynamics
- Legislative or regulatory action could intervene before resolution

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce settlement probability to account for principled stance possibility
- Increase "Other" probability to account for complex, non-standard resolutions
- Maintain high conditional probability of NYT win if trial occurs

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:

**Settlement**: 90% (slightly increased from prior due to strong evidence of industry trend)
**NYT Wins ≥$50 Million**: 4% (reduced due to high settlement probability)
**NYT Wins <$50 Million**: 2% (reduced due to high settlement probability)
**OpenAI & Microsoft Win**: 2% (reduced due to high settlement probability)
**Other**: 2% (increased to account for complex resolution possibilities)

## 7. Final Forecast

NYT Wins ≥$50 Million: 4%
NYT Wins <$50 Million: 2%
OpenAI & Microsoft Win: 2%
The case is settled: 90%
Other: 2%
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the outcome of the New York Times' copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, following the specified reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **The case is settled**: The primary reference class is high-stakes corporate intellectual property litigation. Statistics show that the vast majority of such civil cases, likely 80-90%, settle before trial. The immense cost of litigation, the risk of a negative precedent, and the potential for massive damages create strong incentives for both parties to find a resolution out of court. I will select a strong prior of **75%** for this option. This is slightly lower than the 80-90% base rate to account for the unique, precedent-setting nature of this case, which might increase the parties' willingness to see it through to a verdict.
*   **Trial Outcomes (NYT Win, OpenAI/MS Win)**: The remaining 25% of probability is distributed among the non-settlement outcomes. A secondary reference class is landmark lawsuits involving new technology and copyright (e.g., Sony/VCR, Napster/P2P, Google Books). This class has produced mixed results, with no clear historical advantage for either the technology company or the copyright holder. This suggests that if the case goes to trial, the outcome is highly uncertain. Therefore, I will start by splitting the remaining probability roughly evenly between a win for the NYT and a win for OpenAI/Microsoft.
*   **Other**: This option covers outcomes like purely injunctive relief (e.g., forcing model destruction) without monetary damages. Such remedies are rare and drastic, so this is a tail risk. I will assign a small prior of **2%**.

This leaves approximately 23% to be divided among the three win/loss options.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: The case fits the base rate scenario of high-stakes corporate litigation well. The parties are well-funded, the legal questions are complex, and the business risks of a loss are enormous for both sides. This reinforces the strong prior for a settlement.
*   **Differences**: The key difference is the novelty and societal importance of the legal question: is training a generative AI model on copyrighted data "fair use"? Unlike past cases, the technology can both transform content (like a search engine) and reproduce it directly (like a photocopier). The existential stakes for the entire generative AI industry could make OpenAI/Microsoft more willing to fight for a favorable precedent. Conversely, the NYT may see itself as a champion for the publishing industry and refuse a purely financial settlement. These factors increase the uncertainty and slightly raise the probability of a court verdict compared to a standard corporate lawsuit.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: OpenAI's licensing deals with other publishers (AP, Axel Springer, News Corp).** This is strong evidence.
    *   P(Evidence | Settled) is very high. This behavior shows that OpenAI's primary strategy is to secure content access via commercial agreements, making a settlement with the NYT a natural extension of this strategy.
    *   P(Evidence | OpenAI Wins) is low. If OpenAI were confident of winning a landmark "fair use" case in court, it would be less likely to spend hundreds of millions on licenses, as this could be seen as undermining their legal argument.
    *   This evidence significantly increases the probability of "Settled" and decreases the probability of "OpenAI & Microsoft Win".

*   **Evidence 2: NYT's "regurgitation" examples.** The complaint shows direct, near-verbatim outputs from ChatGPT.
    *   P(Evidence | NYT Wins) is high. This is powerful, intuitive evidence of copying that is difficult to defend.
    *   P(Evidence | Settled) is also very high. This evidence creates massive risk for OpenAI, giving them a powerful incentive to settle to avoid a court having to rule on it.
    *   This evidence increases the probability of an NYT win *relative to* an OpenAI win, but its biggest impact is increasing the overall pressure to settle.

*   **Evidence 3: OpenAI's "deceptive prompting" defense.** OpenAI argues the NYT had to "hack" the model to produce the regurgitated outputs.
    *   P(Evidence | OpenAI Wins) is high. This is their core rebuttal to the NYT's strongest evidence.
    *   This defense introduces factual disputes and uncertainty, which makes a trial risky for *both* sides. This complexity slightly increases the chance of a settlement, as it reduces the odds of a clean, predictable win for either party.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Initial State**: Prior is ~75% for Settlement, with the remaining ~25% split between trial outcomes.
*   **Update Step**: Let's focus on the impact of OpenAI's licensing deals. The prior odds of Settlement vs. No Settlement are 75:25, or 3:1. The fact that OpenAI is actively paying other publishers for content makes a settlement with the NYT more likely than a court fight. The likelihood ratio P(Deals | Settle) / P(Deals | No Settle) is greater than 1. This evidence pushes the posterior probability for "Settled" upwards from the 75% prior.
*   Simultaneously, this evidence lowers the conditional probability of an OpenAI win. If they were going to win, they wouldn't need to pay. This shifts probability mass from "OpenAI & Microsoft Win" towards "NYT Wins" and "Settled".
*   The "regurgitation" evidence and the massive potential for statutory damages (up to $150,000 per infringed work) mean that if the NYT *does* win, the award is likely to be substantial. Therefore, P(NYT Wins ≥$50M) should be significantly higher than P(NYT Wins <$50M).

After weighing these factors, I will keep the "Settled" probability high, at 75%, reflecting a balance between the strong base rate and the unique aspects of the case. The evidence against an outright OpenAI win leads me to cap its probability. The strength of the NYT's case warrants a higher probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary assumption is that both parties are rational actors who will act to minimize risk, leading to a settlement. What if this is wrong? The NYT's leadership may have a non-financial motive: to establish a legal principle for the good of journalism. OpenAI/Microsoft might believe winning this specific case is essential to prevent an avalanche of future litigation, making the risk of a trial worth it. This suggests the probability of a trial (23% in my current model) is non-trivial.

The Manifold market implies a ~22% chance of an OpenAI win. My initial analysis put this much lower, but the legal question of "transformative use" is genuinely unresolved. A judge could easily be persuaded by the analogy to the Google Books case. Therefore, assigning equal probabilities (10%) to an NYT win and an OpenAI win (conditional on no settlement) is a reasonable way to model this deep uncertainty.

The final distribution reflects this: a high chance of a rational settlement, but if that fails, it's essentially a coin flip between the two sides on a novel point of law.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will adjust the probabilities to be round numbers that sum to 100%, reflecting the reasoning above.

*   **The case is settled**: 75%. This remains the most likely outcome, driven by strong base rates and risk aversion.
*   **OpenAI & Microsoft Win**: 10%. This reflects the genuine legal uncertainty around "fair use" and the powerful precedent of cases like Google Books.
*   **NYT Wins ≥$50 Million**: 10%. If the case goes to trial and the NYT wins, the potential for massive statutory damages makes a large award more likely than a small one. This is assigned the same probability as an OpenAI win to reflect the high uncertainty of a trial.
*   **NYT Wins <$50 Million**: 3%. A smaller monetary victory is a less likely outcome.
*   **Other**: 2%. This accounts for low-probability outcomes like purely injunctive relief.

The sum is 75 + 10 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 100%.

NYT Wins ≥$50 Million: 10%
NYT Wins <$50 Million: 3%
OpenAI & Microsoft Win: 10%
The case is settled: 75%
Other: 2%
