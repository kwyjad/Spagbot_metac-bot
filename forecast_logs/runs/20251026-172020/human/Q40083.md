### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Recent Short-Term Debt Accumulation (Aug-Oct 2025).** The debt increased from $37 trillion in August 2025 to $38 trillion by October 23, 2025. This is a ~$1 trillion increase in approximately two months, or ~$500 billion per month. Extrapolating this rate for the ~2.25 months until year-end suggests an increase of ~$1.1 trillion, for a final value near $39.1 trillion.
    *   **Base Rate (for "Yes"):** Near 0%. This class suggests the $38.5T threshold will be crossed easily and quickly.
*   **Reference Class 2: Average Monthly Debt Increase in 2025.** Assuming the debt was ~$34.2 trillion at the start of 2025 (based on FRED data trends), it has increased by ~$3.8 trillion in ~10 months, an average of $380 billion per month. This rate would project a year-end total of ~$38.85 trillion.
    *   **Base Rate (for "Yes"):** ~5-10%. This longer-term average is slower than the most recent pace but still points to the debt exceeding the threshold.
*   **Limitations:** Both reference classes rely on simple extrapolation. They do not account for intra-quarter seasonality in spending and revenue or for potential non-linear shocks. However, given the very short time horizon, fiscal momentum is a powerful guide.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-23** U.S. national debt surpasses $38 trillion. **(↓)** This sets a very high starting point, leaving only $500 billion of headroom for the remaining 69 days of the year.
*   **2025-10-18** Reporting highlights a recent daily debt increase of ~$13-25 billion. **(↓)** The observed daily accumulation rate is far higher than the ~$7.25 billion/day required to stay under the $38.5 trillion threshold.
*   **2025-09-30** Deloitte forecasts the 2025 federal deficit at 6% of GDP. **(↓)** This confirms that the underlying structural imbalance between spending and revenue remains large, ensuring continued, rapid borrowing through year-end.
*   **2025-09-11** CRS reports the debt limit was raised to $41.1 trillion in July 2025. **(↓)** This removes any possibility of a debt ceiling standoff or the use of "extraordinary measures" that could artificially and temporarily halt the reported debt's growth before the resolution date.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Structural Deficit (Large ↓):** The fundamental mismatch between government outlays (entitlements, defense, discretionary spending) and revenues is the primary engine of debt growth. This is a high-inertia driver.
*   **Interest on the Debt (Large ↓):** With elevated interest rates (10-year Treasury > 4.1%), payments to service the existing $38T debt are a large and growing mandatory expenditure, automatically adding to the deficit and requiring further borrowing.
*   **Tax Receipt Seasonality (Moderate ↓):** Q4 is not a major period for tax collection compared to Q2 (April filings). Lower-than-average revenue inflows during this period mean deficits are typically wider, accelerating debt accumulation.
*   **Economic Performance (Small ↑):** Stronger-than-expected Q4 GDP growth and corporate profits could modestly increase tax receipts, slightly slowing the rate of debt increase. However, this effect is unlikely to be large enough to alter the outcome.
*   **Supplemental Appropriations (Moderate ↓):** Unforeseen events like natural disasters or new foreign conflicts could trigger emergency spending bills, which would directly and immediately increase borrowing needs.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Accelerated Pace of Accumulation:** The recent increase from $37T to $38T in just two months is noted as the fastest $1 trillion accumulation outside of the pandemic, suggesting fiscal dynamics are worse than the recent historical average.
*   **Elevated Interest Rate Environment:** Unlike the 2010s, the current higher interest rates create a self-reinforcing cycle where higher debt leads to higher interest payments, which in turn leads to even higher debt.
*   **Absence of a Debt Ceiling Constraint:** The July 2025 debt limit suspension to a high ceiling of $41.1T removes a key political mechanism that has, in other periods, temporarily flattened the debt trajectory. The Treasury has a clear runway to borrow as needed.
*   **Post-Pandemic Fiscal Baseline:** Government spending has reset at a significantly higher level than the pre-COVID era, while revenues have not increased commensurately, locking in a higher structural deficit.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference classes, a reasonable prior for "Yes" (debt under $38.5T) would be low, perhaps 5-10%, with a moderate strength (equivalent n=15) reflecting the strong, recent trend.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↓ Large)** The starting point of $38T on Oct 23 leaves an extremely narrow path to stay under the threshold, requiring a daily accumulation rate less than half of the recently observed pace.
    *   **(↓ Large)** The debt ceiling has been raised well beyond the forecast horizon, removing the primary mechanism that could artificially suppress the official debt number.
    *   **(↓ Moderate)** Persistent high interest rates are actively accelerating debt service costs, adding to borrowing needs in a way not seen in the prior decade.
    *   **(↑ Small)** The only plausible path to a "Yes" resolution involves a major shock like a prolonged government shutdown or a significant, unexpected data revision, both of which are low-probability events.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative for the proposition. The posterior probability for "Yes" should be revised sharply downwards from an already low prior, likely into the very low single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)

To forecast whether the US national debt will be under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Given the recent trends and historical data, the base rate for the debt being under $38.5 trillion is very low. Reference Class 1 suggests a near 0% probability, while Reference Class 2 suggests a 5-10% probability. Considering the rapid increase in debt and the structural factors driving it, a base rate of 5% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with the historical trend of increasing debt, driven by structural deficits and high interest rates.
   - **Differences:** The pace of debt accumulation has accelerated recently, and there are no debt ceiling constraints to slow it down. These differences suggest a higher likelihood of exceeding the threshold.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Starting Point ($38T on Oct 23):** The debt is already very close to $38.5 trillion, requiring a significant slowdown in accumulation to stay under the threshold. This is unlikely given current trends. (Likelihood ratio strongly favors exceeding the threshold.)
   - **Daily Debt Increase ($13-25 billion):** The current daily increase far exceeds the rate needed to stay under $38.5 trillion. (Likelihood ratio strongly favors exceeding the threshold.)
   - **Interest Rates and Structural Deficit:** High interest rates and a large structural deficit ensure continued borrowing. (Likelihood ratio favors exceeding the threshold.)
   - **Absence of Debt Ceiling Constraint:** With no ceiling to limit borrowing, the debt is likely to continue rising. (Likelihood ratio favors exceeding the threshold.)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 5% probability translates to odds of 1:19.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the overwhelming evidence, the likelihood ratio is very high, suggesting a significant increase in the odds of exceeding the threshold.
   - **Posterior Odds:** The evidence suggests a posterior probability well below 5%, likely in the low single digits.
   - **Posterior Probability:** After updating, the probability of the debt being under $38.5 trillion is extremely low.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected fiscal policy changes or economic shocks that could slow debt accumulation. However, these are unlikely given the current trajectory and lack of political will for drastic measures.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A major economic downturn or unexpected revenue windfall could alter the trajectory, but these are low-probability events.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the overwhelming evidence and lack of plausible alternative scenarios, the forecast remains robust.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Based on the analysis, the probability of the US national debt being under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025, is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will the US national debt be under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I'll examine recent debt growth patterns:

- As of October 23, 2025, the US national debt is already at $38 trillion
- The debt has grown by $400 billion in the past month (~$25 billion daily)
- Since July 2025, the debt has increased by $1.7 trillion

Looking at the historical trend and recent acceleration, I'll use the following reference classes:
- Recent 2-month growth rate (Aug-Oct 2025): ~$1 trillion, or ~$500 billion/month
- 2025 average monthly growth: ~$380 billion/month

With only 69 days remaining until December 31, 2025, and $500 billion of headroom left before reaching $38.5 trillion, the base rate for staying under this threshold is very low.

**Prior probability (debt under $38.5T)**: 5%

This reflects the strong momentum of debt growth and the limited time remaining.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The structural deficit remains large (6% of GDP per Deloitte)
- Interest rates remain elevated, increasing debt service costs
- No major fiscal policy changes are imminent

**Differences from base case**:
- The recent pace of debt accumulation ($25 billion daily) is faster than historical averages
- The debt ceiling was raised to $41.1 trillion in July 2025, removing a constraint that has historically slowed reported debt growth
- Q4 is typically not a strong period for tax receipts, potentially accelerating debt growth

These differences generally point to faster debt accumulation than the historical average, making it even less likely to stay under $38.5 trillion.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Current debt level and recent growth rate**
- P(E|H): Probability of seeing $38T debt and $25B daily growth if debt will stay under $38.5T = 0.05
- P(E|~H): Probability of seeing this if debt will exceed $38.5T = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This strongly decreases the probability of staying under $38.5T

**Evidence 2: Debt ceiling raised to $41.1T**
- P(E|H): Probability of debt ceiling being raised this high if debt will stay under $38.5T = 0.3
- P(E|~H): Probability of this ceiling if debt will exceed $38.5T = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Q4 seasonal patterns in government finance**
- P(E|H): Probability of Q4 seasonal patterns if debt will stay under $38.5T = 0.4
- P(E|~H): Probability of these patterns if debt will exceed $38.5T = 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.7 = 0.57
- This slightly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (0.053), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 0.053 × 0.053 = 0.0028

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability = 0.0028 / (1 + 0.0028) = 0.0028 / 1.0028 ≈ 0.28%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence that the debt will exceed $38.5 trillion by year-end.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Government shutdown**: A prolonged shutdown could temporarily halt debt issuance, though this would likely only delay crossing the threshold.

2. **Accounting changes**: The Treasury could implement accounting changes that temporarily reduce the reported debt, though this is unlikely without a debt ceiling constraint.

3. **Extraordinary revenue**: An unexpected surge in tax receipts or asset sales could slow debt growth, but this would be highly unusual for Q4.

4. **Data revision**: The Treasury could revise its accounting methodology, affecting reported debt figures.

Even considering these scenarios, the probability remains very low. The most plausible alternative would be a government shutdown lasting through December, but this would merely postpone crossing the threshold.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the current debt of $38 trillion, the recent growth rate of $25 billion daily, and only 69 days until December 31, 2025, it is extremely unlikely that the US national debt will remain under $38.5 trillion.

At the current pace, the debt would increase by approximately $1.7 trillion in the remaining period, far exceeding the $500 billion headroom. Even at a significantly reduced pace, crossing the threshold seems inevitable.

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Event:** The US national debt will be under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025.
*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is the recent rate of US national debt accumulation, given the very short forecast horizon.
*   **Data Points:**
    1.  **Year-to-Date (2025):** The debt grew from ~$34.2T (start of 2025) to $38.0T (Oct 23, 2025), an increase of $3.8T over 296 days. This is an average of **$12.8 billion per day**.
    2.  **Recent Months (Aug-Oct 2025):** The debt grew by $1T in approximately two months, an average of **~$16.7 billion per day**.
    3.  **Recent Weeks (Oct 2025):** An article from Oct 18 noted a monthly increase of $400B, or **~$13.3 billion per day**.
*   **Calculation:** The starting point is $38.0 trillion on October 23, 2025. The resolution date is December 31, 2025, which is 69 days away. The threshold is $38.5 trillion, leaving a headroom of $500 billion. To stay under this threshold, the average daily debt increase must be less than $500 billion / 69 days ≈ **$7.25 billion per day**.
*   **Prior:** Since all recent base rates of accumulation ($12.8B to $16.7B per day) are significantly higher—roughly double—the required rate ($7.25B/day), a simple extrapolation suggests the threshold will be easily surpassed. Therefore, the prior probability of the event (staying under $38.5T) is very low. I will set the prior at **P(H) = 5%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The forecast period is a direct continuation of the reference period. The primary drivers of debt—the structural deficit from entitlement spending, defense, and discretionary programs, plus rapidly growing interest payments—remain firmly in place. Fiscal policy has high inertia, making recent trends a powerful predictor over a short horizon.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Debt Ceiling:** The debt ceiling was raised to $41.1 trillion in July 2025. Unlike in other periods, there is no risk of a debt ceiling standoff artificially and temporarily halting the growth of reported debt. This removes a key mechanism that could have led to a "Yes" outcome, making the base case extrapolation *more* reliable.
    *   **Seasonality:** Quarter 4 is historically a period of lower federal tax receipts compared to Q2 (when April tax filings are due). This seasonal pattern tends to widen the deficit and accelerate borrowing, suggesting the rate of debt accumulation may be even higher than the year-to-date average.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event that the debt is under $38.5T on Dec 31, 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Starting Point of $38.0T on Oct 23.**
    *   This leaves an extremely narrow path for H to occur, requiring the daily borrowing rate to be cut by more than half from its recent average.
    *   P(E | H) is low; P(E | ~H) is high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence 2: Debt ceiling raised to $41.1T.**
    *   This removes the main political mechanism that could artificially suppress the debt number before the resolution date.
    *   P(E | H) is lower than it would be with a binding ceiling; P(E | ~H) is higher.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1 (decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence 3: Q4 Tax Seasonality.**
    *   Lower tax receipts in Q4 typically mean wider deficits and faster borrowing. This factor works against a slowdown in debt accumulation.
    *   P(E | H) is low; P(E | ~H) is high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1 (decreases probability).**

All key pieces of evidence point in the same direction, strongly suggesting that the debt will continue to grow at a pace far exceeding what is required for the event H to occur.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 5%, so Prior Odds = 0.05 / 0.95 ≈ 1 to 19.
*   **Update Step:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative. The mathematical constraint (starting at $38.0T with only $500B headroom) is the most powerful piece of evidence. The observed accumulation rates are 2-3x the maximum allowable rate for a "Yes" outcome. This single piece of evidence warrants a very strong update. Let's use a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/10 for the combined evidence.
*   **Posterior Odds:** (1 to 19) × (1/10) = 1 to 190.
*   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 190) = 1/191 ≈ 0.5%.

The calculation confirms that the posterior probability is extremely low, likely in the very low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenarios for "Yes":** For the debt to stay under $38.5T, a major, unexpected event would need to occur.
    1.  **Prolonged Government Shutdown:** A shutdown would slow spending, but mandatory spending and interest payments continue. A typical shutdown's effect is too small to close the gap between the current borrowing rate and the required rate.
    2.  **Sudden Economic Boom:** An unforecasted surge in economic activity could boost tax revenues, but the scale required in just two months makes this highly implausible.
    3.  **Major Data Revision:** The Treasury could, in theory, revise past debt figures downwards. This is exceptionally rare for this data series and there is no reason to expect it.
*   **Plausibility:** The most plausible of these is a shutdown, but its quantitative impact is insufficient. The inertia of the US fiscal system is immense. The path for the next 69 days is largely predetermined by existing laws and economic conditions.
*   **Conclusion:** The arguments against the event are based on simple arithmetic and high-inertia trends. The arguments for the event rely on low-probability "black swan" events. The forecast should remain very low.

### 6. Final Forecast

The starting point of $38.0 trillion on October 23 leaves only $500 billion of headroom for the remaining 69 days of 2025. This requires the average daily debt increase to be under $7.25 billion. Every piece of recent data, from the year-to-date average ($12.8B/day) to the most recent trends ($13B-$25B/day), shows an accumulation rate at least double this required pace. Furthermore, the lack of a debt ceiling constraint and unfavorable Q4 seasonality reinforce this trend. The path to exceeding $38.5 trillion is clear and arithmetically compelling. The probability of the debt remaining under this threshold is exceptionally small, reserved only for truly unforeseeable events like a major data restatement.
