### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Any MP departure (resignation, death, floor-crossing, expulsion) per parliamentary session.** From 2000-2024 (8 parliaments), there have been approximately 105 such departures, averaging ~13 per 4-year parliament, or ~3.25 per year. With 338 MPs, this yields a monthly base rate of ~0.08% per MP, or roughly a **4% chance** of *any* MP departing in a given 1.5-month period (0.0008 * 338 * 1.5). This is a broad, generic base rate.
*   **Reference Class 2: Floor-crossings in Canadian federal politics.** These are rare events. Since 1990, there have been roughly 25 instances of MPs crossing the floor. This averages less than one per year. The rate is not uniform; they often occur in clusters during periods of political instability or party realignment (e.g., the formation of the Conservative Party in 2003). The base rate for a floor-crossing in a 1.5-month window is very low, likely **<1%**.
*   **Reference Class 3: Departures during a tight minority government.** In periods where the government's survival is tenuous (e.g., Martin 2004-2006, Harper 2006-2011), the political stakes are higher. While this increases incentives for defections, it also increases party discipline to prevent them. The historical record suggests a slightly elevated rate of departures compared to majority governments, but the sample size is small. A plausible range might be **5-10%** for a departure in a 1.5-month window under these conditions.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-06] Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux resigns after reported pressure from his party over talks with Liberals. — (↑) — Signals that the Liberal recruitment effort is real and targeting multiple MPs, and that the Conservative response may be to force resignations rather than risk further floor-crossings.
*   [2025-11-05] Conservative MP Chris d'Entremont crosses the floor to the Liberals, citing ideological disagreement with leader Pierre Poilievre. — (↑↑) — This event breaks a significant psychological barrier, establishes a precedent for others, and confirms a plausible ideological fissure within the Conservative caucus that the Liberals can exploit.
*   [2025-11-05] Liberal government is confirmed to be 3 seats short of a majority after the 2025 election. — (↑) — This establishes the core strategic incentive for the government to actively encourage and reward potential defectors, as a majority is within immediate reach.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Liberal Government Incentives (Large ↑):** The prize of a stable majority government is immense. The Liberals are highly motivated to offer significant inducements (e.g., cabinet positions, parliamentary secretary roles, future appointments, policy concessions) to secure the two MPs needed.
*   **Conservative Party Disunity (Large ↑):** The background explicitly cites d'Entremont's disagreement with Poilievre's leadership. This suggests a real and exploitable rift between the populist/right-wing faction and more moderate "Red Tories," creating a pool of potentially movable MPs.
*   **Conservative Counter-Pressure (Large ↓):** The Jeneroux resignation demonstrates the Conservative party is aware of the threat and is willing to exert extreme pressure ("consequences") to enforce discipline. This could intimidate other potential defectors into staying in line.
*   **Contagion/Precedent (Moderate ↑):** D'Entremont's successful defection makes it easier for others to contemplate the same move. It normalizes the action and provides a template for justifying it to constituents.
*   **Short Timeline & Holiday Recess (Small ↓):** The window for action is only ~6 weeks and includes the Christmas holiday period when Parliament typically rises. This reduces the time for negotiations and the public attention required to stage such a political event, potentially pushing action into the new year.
*   **Personal Ambition/Grievance (Small ↑):** Independent of grand strategy, any of the 338 MPs could have personal reasons (e.g., being passed over for a critic role, facing a difficult nomination battle, seeking a post-political career) that make them receptive to an offer or inclined to resign.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Majority:** Unlike most minority parliaments, the government is not seeking a partner for a stable coalition; it is just two seats away from a full majority. This creates an unusually strong and targeted incentive for poaching individual MPs.
*   **Active & Credible Recruitment:** The reported involvement of Mark Carney's office and the successful flip of d'Entremont show this is not a passive hope but an active, strategic effort by the government.
*   **Identifiable Factional Rift:** The cause of the departures is not random but is linked to a well-known ideological division within the Conservative Party, providing a clear pool of potential targets for the Liberals.
*   **Coercive Opposition Response:** The alleged "consequences" faced by Jeneroux suggest the opposition's response is not just persuasion but coercion, which could backfire and push a wavering MP out the door rather than pull them back in.
*   **Compressed Timeline:** The events are happening in a rapid sequence, creating a sense of crisis and momentum that is not typical of the slow grind of most parliamentary sessions.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the reference class of departures during a tight minority (5-10%), perhaps anchored at 8%, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=15) to reflect the small sample size and allow for significant updates.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The government is only two seats from a majority, creating a massive, immediate incentive.
    *   (↑ Large) A successful defection has already occurred, citing a specific ideological rift that provides a clear vector for more.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Evidence of an active, high-level recruitment campaign by the Liberals.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Strong, coercive counter-pressure from the Conservative leadership could create a chilling effect.
    *   (↑/↓ Ambiguous) The Jeneroux resignation could be seen as a successful deterrent (↓) or a sign that more MPs are unhappy enough to risk their careers (↑). The latter seems more likely in this context.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points upward. The powerful, specific incentives and confirmed party disunity likely overwhelm the low base rate and the deterrent effect of party discipline. The posterior should move significantly higher, perhaps into the 35-55% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Rumors in Ottawa media (e.g., The Hill Times, CBC Power & Politics) about specific Conservative MPs being unhappy or in talks with the government.
    *   A Conservative MP from the moderate wing publicly criticizing party policy or leadership.
    *   Unusual voting behavior, such as a Conservative MP abstaining or being absent from a key vote.
    *   Reports of a pending cabinet shuffle by the Prime Minister (often used to accommodate new members).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A public, unified statement of loyalty to the leader signed by the entire Conservative caucus.
    *   Pierre Poilievre making a significant, public concession or outreach to the moderate wing of his party.
    *   The Liberal government pivoting to secure support from the NDP or Bloc Québécois on the budget, signaling they have given up on poaching MPs.
    *   Parliament rising for the holiday recess with no further public turmoil.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Asymmetric Information:** These negotiations are conducted in extreme secrecy. The public and media will likely have no warning before an announcement is made.
*   **Ambiguity of Resignation:** The resolution criteria include simple resignation. An MP could resign for unrelated personal or health reasons, which is fundamentally unpredictable but would resolve the question as "Yes."
*   **Misinterpreting Jeneroux's Exit:** Jeneroux's resignation is a key data point. If it was a highly effective warning shot that terrified other MPs into silence, the probability of another departure is much lower. If it was a sign of a wider rebellion being quashed, the underlying pressure remains.
*   **Definition of "Party":** An MP could leave their party to sit as an "Independent Conservative" before later rejoining. This would technically satisfy the resolution criteria even if their long-term allegiance doesn't change.
*   **Fictional Scenario Dynamics:** The provided background is a hypothetical. It assumes rational actors responding to clear incentives, but real-world politics involves complex personal relationships, miscalculations, and unpredictable events.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for an MP departure is low, but the current context is highly unusual. The Liberal government's proximity to a majority creates an exceptionally powerful incentive to poach MPs from a demonstrably fractured Conservative caucus, suggesting a significantly higher probability than the reference class would imply.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 3: Departures during a tight minority government** is the most relevant base rate given the current political context. The historical data suggests a 5-10% chance of an MP departure in a 1.5-month window during such periods. I will use an 8% prior probability as a starting point, reflecting the increased stakes and potential for defections in a minority government setting.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a minority government, similar to past instances where departures were slightly more common.
   - **Differences:** The Liberal government is only two seats away from a majority, creating a stronger incentive for defections. Additionally, there is active recruitment by the Liberals and a known ideological rift within the Conservative Party, which are not typical in all minority governments.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Liberal Government Incentives (Large ↑):** The immediate incentive for the Liberals to secure a majority is significant, increasing the likelihood of defections.
   - **Conservative Party Disunity (Large ↑):** The ideological rift within the Conservative Party, as evidenced by d'Entremont's defection, increases the probability of further defections.
   - **Conservative Counter-Pressure (Large ↓):** The Conservative Party's strong response, as seen with Jeneroux's resignation, could deter potential defectors.
   - **Contagion/Precedent (Moderate ↑):** The precedent set by d'Entremont's defection makes it easier for others to follow suit.
   - **Short Timeline & Holiday Recess (Small ↓):** The limited time frame and upcoming holiday recess reduce the window for potential defections.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 8% prior probability translates to odds of 0.087.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong incentives and disunity (↑), countered by Conservative pressure (↓), the net likelihood ratio suggests a significant increase. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of approximately 4, reflecting the strong upward pressure.
   - **Posterior Odds:** 0.087 × 4 = 0.348.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 0.348 / (1 + 0.348) ≈ 25.8%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility that Conservative pressure is more effective than anticipated.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of defections being delayed until after the holiday recess or the Conservatives successfully mitigating the risk.
   - **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential overestimation of defections is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final calibrated probability is adjusted to reflect a balanced view of the situation.

Final: 23%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for an MP defection or resignation in the next ~40 days (from Nov 20 to Jan 1, 2026).

The most relevant reference class is departures during a tight minority government situation. Based on historical data from similar periods (like Martin 2004-2006, Harper 2006-2011), the research report suggests a 5-10% chance of a departure in a 1.5-month window under these conditions.

I'll select a prior of 8% as a reasonable starting point within this range. This reflects the general rarity of MP departures in a short timeframe, while acknowledging the slightly elevated risk during minority governments.

Prior probability: 8% (or odds of 1:11.5)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a minority government situation where party discipline and MP loyalty are tested
- The normal background rate of MP departures for personal/health reasons still applies
- Parliamentary procedures and political norms around floor-crossing remain similar

**Key differences:**
- The Liberal government is exceptionally close to a majority (just 2 seats away)
- Two MPs have already left the Conservative caucus in rapid succession (one defection, one resignation)
- There appears to be an active recruitment campaign by the Liberals targeting Conservative MPs
- The Conservative leadership is reportedly using coercive measures to prevent further defections
- There's an identifiable ideological rift within the Conservative Party that creates a pool of potential defectors

These differences significantly increase the likelihood of another departure compared to the typical minority government situation.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent defection of Chris d'Entremont**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If more defections are coming, we'd expect to see initial defections like this
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If no more defections were coming, this would be an isolated incident
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This strongly increases the probability of another defection

**Evidence 2: Matt Jeneroux's resignation after alleged pressure**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If more MPs are considering leaving, we'd expect the party to apply pressure
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This could be an effective deterrent preventing further departures
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Liberals being just 2 seats from a majority**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - This creates an enormous incentive for the Liberals to recruit aggressively
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with incentives, MPs might resist for various reasons
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Reported ideological rift within Conservative Party**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Ideological differences are a common reason for defections
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many MPs stay despite ideological differences
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:11.5 (8% probability)

First update (d'Entremont defection):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:11.5 × 4.5 = 4.5:11.5 = 1:2.56
- New probability = 1/(1+2.56) = 28%

Second update (Jeneroux resignation):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:2.56 × 2 = 2:2.56 = 1:1.28
- New probability = 1/(1+1.28) = 44%

Third update (Liberals close to majority):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:1.28 × 1.9 = 1.9:1.28 = 1:0.67
- New probability = 1/(1+0.67) = 60%

Fourth update (ideological rift):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:0.67 × 2 = 2:0.67 = 1:0.335
- New probability = 1/(1+0.335) = 75%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 75%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- I may be overestimating the likelihood ratios due to narrative fallacy - these events seem connected but could be coincidental
- The Conservative Party likely implemented strong countermeasures after the first two departures
- The holiday recess reduces parliamentary activity, potentially limiting opportunities for defection
- MPs may be reluctant to face constituents' anger by switching parties after being elected under a party banner
- The sample size of similar historical situations is very small, making the base rate uncertain

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Conservative leadership could make concessions to moderate MPs to keep them in the fold
- The Liberals might pivot to working with other parties rather than continuing to pursue defections
- The two departures might have been unique cases with personal motivations not shared by others

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should moderate my estimate somewhat. The evidence still points to an elevated risk, but perhaps not as high as 75%. A more calibrated estimate would be around 60-65%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and potential biases in my reasoning, I believe there is a 62% chance that another Canadian MP will defect or resign before January 1, 2026.

Final: 62%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is the departure (resignation, floor-crossing, or becoming independent) of a Canadian MP within a specific 1.5-month window (Nov 17 - Dec 31, 2025). The most relevant reference class is not all historical departures, but departures during periods of high political stress, specifically tight minority governments.

Historically, major political moves like floor-crossings are rare, averaging less than one per year. However, they tend to cluster during periods of instability. The research report suggests a plausible base rate for any departure in a 1.5-month window under tight minority conditions is 5-10%. This acknowledges the heightened political stakes compared to a standard majority government, while still treating such an event as relatively unlikely in any given short period.

I will select a prior probability of **10%**. This reflects the upper end of the suggested range, accounting for the fact that a minority government has just been formed, a period often marked by instability. In odds form, this is 1:9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from a generic "tight minority government" base case in several critical ways:

*   **Proximity to Majority:** The Liberal government is not just in a minority; they are precisely two seats away from a stable majority. This creates an exceptionally strong and targeted incentive to encourage defections, a much more powerful driver than in a typical minority situation where a government might need the support of an entire party.
*   **Recency and Momentum:** The forecast period begins immediately after two significant departures from the opposition Conservatives have already occurred. This is not a "cold start." The base rate applies to a random period, whereas this period is clearly "hot," suggesting a causal process is already in motion.
*   **Identifiable Cause:** The first defection was explicitly linked to ideological disagreement with the Conservative leader. This points to a specific, exploitable fissure within the opposition caucus (e.g., "Red Tories" vs. populists), providing a clear pool of potential targets for the government.

These factors suggest the probability is substantially higher than the 10% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of recent evidence as a single cluster, as they are causally linked.

*   **Evidence Cluster (E):** In the past two days, one Conservative MP (d'Entremont) has crossed the floor to the Liberals citing ideological reasons, and a second (Jeneroux) has resigned under party pressure after holding talks with the Liberals. This is happening while the Liberal government is two seats from a majority.
*   **Likelihood if another MP departs (P(E | H)):** This cluster of events is highly probable if another departure is imminent. It's a classic sign of a party in crisis, with momentum building for further change. A successful defection breaks the dam, and the evidence of a second MP in talks confirms the issue is not isolated.
*   **Likelihood if no other MP departs (P(E | ~H)):** This evidence would be very surprising if the situation were to suddenly stabilize with no further departures. It would imply that d'Entremont and Jeneroux were the only two disaffected MPs and that the Conservative party has now perfectly contained the threat. This seems unlikely given the political dynamics at play.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (LR = P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** The LR is significantly greater than 1. The evidence strongly suggests that the underlying conditions for departures are present and active. A conservative estimate for the aggregate likelihood ratio of this evidence cluster would be around 6. This means this sequence of events is about six times more likely if another departure is coming than if it is not.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will update the prior odds using the likelihood ratio for the evidence cluster.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:9 (corresponding to a 10% probability)
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** 6
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/9) × 6 = 6/9 = 2/3
*   **Posterior Probability:** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = (2/3) / (1 + 2/3) = (2/3) / (5/3) = 2/5 = **40%**

This initial update brings the probability to 40%. I will now consider secondary factors. The broadness of the resolution criteria ("resign") means a departure for unrelated personal or health reasons would count. This adds a small, mostly independent probability. More importantly, the sheer intensity of the government's incentive to secure a majority before the 2025 budget process provides a powerful, time-sensitive driver that pushes the probability higher. Conversely, the upcoming holiday recess and the Conservative party's coercive counter-pressure are significant deterrents. Balancing these, the momentum and incentives seem to slightly outweigh the deterrents. I will adjust the probability upward from the calculated 40%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too high if the Conservative party's disciplinary actions (as seen with Jeneroux) are extremely effective, creating a chilling effect that quashes all further dissent. The two departures might have been the only "low-hanging fruit," and the caucus is now unified. The holiday recess could also dissipate the momentum, pushing any further action into the new year.

Conversely, my forecast could be too low. The "dam has broken," and a cascade of departures from disaffected moderates is possible. The Liberal government's offer of a cabinet post or other significant role is a powerful lure that I may be underestimating. The Jeneroux resignation, rather than being a deterrent, could be seen as an act of party bullying that galvanizes others to leave. Given these strong competing forces, a forecast near 50% seems appropriate, as the situation is highly volatile and uncertain. My calculated 40% feels slightly too low, as it doesn't fully capture the "crisis" atmosphere. The momentum from two departures in two days is a very strong signal. I will make a final adjustment to reflect this.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for such an event is low, around 10%. However, the specific evidence—a successful floor-crossing, a second MP pressured to resign, a clear ideological rift in the opposition, and an overwhelming incentive for the government to gain just two seats for a majority—is exceptionally strong. This evidence justifies a significant update from the prior. While strong party discipline and the upcoming holiday recess act as countervailing forces, the current momentum and political drivers make another departure more likely than not in the short timeframe.

Final: 52%
