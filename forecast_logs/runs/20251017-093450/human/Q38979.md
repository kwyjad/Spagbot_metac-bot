### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Lunar Landing Attempts (2022-Present).** This is the most relevant class, reflecting the current technological, economic, and geopolitical environment. In this period, there have been 7 known soft-landing attempts. Of these, 4 were successful (Chandrayaan-3, SLIM, IM-1, Chang'e 6) and 3 failed (Hakuto-R M1, Luna 25, Peregrine M1).
    *   **Base Rate:** ~57% success rate per attempt.
    *   **Limitations:** The sample size is very small, and the actors (national agencies vs. new commercial companies) have different levels of experience.

*   **Reference Class 2: First-Time Commercial Lunar Landing Attempts.** Three private companies have attempted their first lunar landing (ispace, Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines). Only one (Intuitive Machines) succeeded.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~33% success rate for a company's first attempt.
    *   **Limitations:** Extremely small sample size (n=3), but highlights the immense difficulty for new entrants, which comprise most of the remaining planned missions.

*   **Reference Class 3: Planned vs. Actual Missions.** The original question background noted at least 18 planned landings by the end of 2025. As of late 2025, only 7 have been attempted.
    *   **Base Rate:** A significant attrition rate (>60%) from "planned" to "attempted" within a 3-4 year window due to funding, engineering, and launch delays.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a proxy for the "planning fallacy" and not a direct success rate, but it's crucial for calibrating expectations based on announced schedules.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-07-17] NASA cancels the VIPER rover, the primary payload for Astrobotic's Griffin lander. ↓ — This effectively removed the Griffin/VIPER mission from the 2025 schedule, a key planned landing.
*   [2024-06-02] China's Chang'e 6 successfully lands on the lunar far side. ↑ — Solidified the count for 2024 at four successful landings. This was the last successful landing to date.
*   [2024-02-22] Intuitive Machines' IM-1 (Odysseus) successfully lands, becoming the first commercial craft to do so. ↑ — Added one to the 2024 count and demonstrated the viability of the NASA CLPS model, despite a difficult landing.
*   [2024-01-19] JAXA's SLIM lander achieves a successful, precise landing, though it landed upside down. ↑ — Added one to the 2024 count and demonstrated a new national capability.
*   [2024-01-08] Astrobotic's Peregrine Mission 1 fails due to a propellant leak hours after launch. ↓ — Highlighted the high risk and technical difficulty for new commercial providers, setting a negative tone for CLPS missions in 2024.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Schedule Slippage (Large):** The primary driver of the final number. Technical delays, launch vehicle availability, and payload readiness have consistently pushed missions from 2024/2025 into 2026 and beyond. With only ~2.5 months left in the period, this is the most powerful factor.
*   **Technical Success/Failure (Large):** Landing on the moon remains exceptionally difficult. The ~57% success rate in this new era shows that even a launched mission is far from a guaranteed success.
*   **Government Program Viability (e.g., NASA CLPS) (Moderate):** The CLPS program is the financial engine for most US commercial attempts. Its continued funding and acceptance of risk enables these missions, but program-level delays or cancellations (like VIPER) have direct impacts.
*   **Launch Vehicle Readiness (Moderate):** The availability and reliability of rockets like SpaceX's Falcon 9 and ULA's Vulcan Centaur are critical. A delay or failure of a launch vehicle can ground multiple lunar missions.
*   **Geopolitical Competition (Small):** The "new space race" between the US, China, and other nations like India accelerates timelines and encourages funding, but it is a background driver and less impactful on near-term technical execution than other factors.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dominance of Commercial Actors:** Unlike the state-run programs of the Space Race, the current era is characterized by a public-private partnership model, especially in the US. These new commercial entities have less experience, leading to a higher failure rate than the historical base rate of established space agencies.
*   **High Cadence of Attempts:** The period 2022-2025 has seen more landing attempts (7) than the entire period from 1977-2012, representing a significant acceleration in activity.
*   **Lower Cost, Higher Risk:** The CLPS model and general commercial approaches prioritize lower costs, which may come at the expense of the extensive redundancy seen in flagship state-run missions, contributing to the lower success rate.
*   **Multipolar Landscape:** The actors are more diverse than the US/USSR duopoly. Successful landings by India and Japan, alongside the US and China, demonstrate a broader global capability and interest in lunar exploration.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** An initial prior from 2022, based on the ~18 planned missions, might have been a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution centered around 6-8 landings, with high variance (low equivalent n) to account for the known difficulty and high likelihood of delays.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) **Hard Floor:** Four successful landings (Chandrayaan-3, SLIM, IM-1, Chang'e 6) have already occurred. This sets an absolute floor and anchors the posterior.
    *   (↓ Large) **Time Horizon:** We are in late October 2025. The time remaining before the question closes is extremely short (~2.5 months).
    *   (↓ Large) **Schedule Slips:** Public schedules for all other credible landing missions (e.g., IM-2, Blue Ghost) now show launch dates in 2026 or later.
    *   (↓ Moderate) **High Failure Rate:** The 43% failure rate observed in

To forecast the number of spacecraft that will land on the moon from 2022 through 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1: Lunar Landing Attempts (2022-Present).** This is the most relevant class, reflecting the current technological, economic, and geopolitical environment. In this period, there have been 7 known soft-landing attempts. Of these, 4 were successful.
  - **Base Rate:** ~57% success rate per attempt.
  - **Mean/Median:** Given 18 planned missions, a naive expectation might have been around 10 successful landings if all were attempted, but given the attrition rate, a more realistic base rate is around 4-6 successful landings.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current environment is characterized by a high number of planned missions, similar to the base rate period.
- **Differences:** The dominance of commercial actors and the high attrition rate from planned to attempted missions are significant. The current era has a higher failure rate due to the involvement of less experienced commercial entities.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Hard Floor:** Four successful landings have already occurred, setting a minimum bound.
- **Time Horizon:** With only ~2.5 months left in 2025, the likelihood of additional successful landings is low.
- **Schedule Slips:** Most remaining missions have been postponed to 2026 or later, reducing the likelihood of further landings in 2025.
- **High Failure Rate:** The observed 43% failure rate further reduces the likelihood of additional successes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Assume a prior centered around 6 successful landings with a wide variance.
- **Likelihood:** Given the evidence, especially the schedule slips and high failure rate, the likelihood of additional landings is low.
- **Posterior:** The posterior distribution is heavily skewed towards the lower end, with a mean closer to the current count of 4 successful landings.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of unexpected successes, but given the strong evidence of delays and failures, the risk is minimal.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider the unlikely scenario of a rapid, successful launch and landing within the remaining months, but this is improbable given current schedules.
- **Alternative Forecast:** An alternative might predict 5 landings, assuming one more unexpected success, but this is less plausible given the evidence.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecast for the number of successful lunar landings from 2022 through 2025 is:

P10: 4  
P20: 4  
P40: 4  
P60: 4  
P80: 5  
P90: 5

# Forecasting Lunar Landings 2022-2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary Reference Class: Recent Lunar Landing Attempts (2022-present)**
- 7 landing attempts with 4 successes (Chandrayaan-3, SLIM, IM-1, Chang'e 6)
- Success rate: ~57%
- This gives us a floor of 4 confirmed landings already

**Secondary Reference Class: Historical Planned vs. Actual Missions**
- Original question background mentioned 18 planned landings by end of 2025
- Only 7 have been attempted so far (39% attempt rate)
- This suggests significant planning fallacy in space mission schedules

The prior distribution should be centered at 4 (confirmed landings) with a small probability of additional landings in the remaining 2.5 months of 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- The technical difficulty of lunar landings remains extremely high
- The mix of established space agencies and newer commercial entities is consistent
- The geopolitical motivations driving lunar exploration continue

**Key differences:**
- Time constraint: Only ~2.5 months remain in the period (through end of 2025)
- Known schedule slips: Most remaining planned missions have officially moved to 2026+
- Commercial focus: Higher proportion of commercial attempts than historical periods
- Higher failure rate: New commercial entrants have a lower success rate (~33%) than established agencies

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Strong evidence for no additional landings:**
- Time remaining is extremely limited (~2.5 months)
- No publicly announced lunar landing missions with firm launch dates before end of 2025
- NASA's VIPER rover cancellation removed a key planned landing
- Commercial providers (Astrobotic, Intuitive Machines) have experienced significant delays
- The 43% failure rate of recent attempts suggests high technical risk

**Weak evidence for possible additional landings:**
- Surprise/classified missions are possible but extremely unlikely
- A mission currently scheduled for early 2026 could potentially be accelerated

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered at 4 confirmed landings with small probability of additional landings:

**Update based on schedule information:**
- The lack of any publicly scheduled landing attempts in the next 2.5 months strongly shifts the distribution toward 4
- P(exactly 4 landings) increases significantly
- P(>4 landings) decreases substantially

**Update based on technical difficulty:**
- Even if a surprise mission were attempted, the 57% success rate would further reduce the probability of exceeding 4 landings

After these updates, my posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at exactly 4 landings, with small probability mass at 5 landings, and minimal probability at 3 or 6+ landings.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of classified military missions
- There could be small-scale technology demonstrators not widely publicized
- A mission currently scheduled for early 2026 could be accelerated

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A surprise Chinese or Indian mission could be announced and executed quickly
- A mission could fail but still meet the resolution criteria of "transmitting data after landing"
- The definition of "spacecraft" could include components that separate during landing

**Adjustments:**
- I'll slightly increase my upper percentiles to account for these possibilities
- The P10 should remain at 4 given the confirmed landings

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 4
P20: 4
P40: 4
P60: 4
P80: 5
P90: 5

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks for the number of successful lunar landings over a four-year period (2022-2025). A reasonable prior, formulated at the start of this period, would be based on the number of planned missions and a historical success rate.

*   **Reference Class:** Planned vs. Actualized Lunar Missions. The background information from 2022 mentioned "at least 18" planned landings. Historically, space missions are subject to extreme schedule slippage and high failure rates (the "planning fallacy"). A base rate might suggest that only a fraction (e.g., 25-40%) of these planned missions would even attempt a landing within the specified timeframe.
*   **Prior Distribution:** Applying this, a prior might be a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution centered around 18 * 0.33 ≈ 6 landings, with a large variance to account for the high uncertainty of both schedule adherence and technical success. For example, a prior median of 6, with a 90% confidence interval of [2, 12].

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation, as of October 2025, is vastly different from the base case in 2022. The forecast is no longer about a 4-year period of uncertainty. Instead, it's about a ~2.5 month period, with the results of the first 45.5 months already known. The problem has shifted from forecasting future events to tallying past events and assessing the near-term future with high certainty.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence available today is extremely strong and serves to collapse the prior distribution.

*   **Evidence 1: Confirmed Successful Landings (Massive Upward/Anchoring Update).**
    We have a definitive count of successful landings that have already occurred within the resolution period.
    *   2022: 0
    *   2023: 1 (Chandrayaan-3)
    *   2024: 3 (SLIM, IM-1/Odysseus, Chang'e 6)
    *   **Total to date: 4**
    This evidence sets a hard floor for the forecast. The final number must be at least 4. This shifts the entire probability distribution so that P(N < 4) = 0.

*   **Evidence 2: Time Remaining (Massive Downward Update for N > 4).**
    The current date is October 17, 2025. The resolution period ends on December 31, 2025. This leaves only ~2.5 months. The lead time for preparing, integrating, and launching a lunar lander is many months to years. It is not plausible for a mission that is not already publicly scheduled for launch to be launched and landed in this window.

*   **Evidence 3: Public Launch Schedules (Massive Downward Update for N > 4).**
    A review of all credible upcoming lunar missions shows none are scheduled for launch in the remainder of 2025.
    *   Intuitive Machines' IM-2: Slipped to 2026.
    *   Firefly's Blue Ghost M1: Slipped to 2026.
    *   Astrobotic's Griffin Lander: Its primary payload (VIPER rover) was cancelled, effectively removing it from the 2025 schedule.
    *   Other national missions (e.g., China's Chang'e 7, NASA's Artemis 3) are scheduled for 2026 or later.
    This evidence makes the probability of any *additional* landings in 2025 extremely low, approaching zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    *   Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood(4 successes so far) × Likelihood(no launches scheduled in remaining 2.5 months)
*   **Step-by-step:**
    1.  Start with the wide prior centered around 6 (e.g., P(4)=15%, P(5)=18%, P(6)=18%, P(7)=15%...).
    2.  The evidence of "4 successes have already happened" acts as a filter. We discard all parts of the prior where N < 4 and re-normalize. The question becomes "What is P(N=4), P(N=5), P(N=6)... given we are already at 4?"
    3.  The evidence of "no missions scheduled to launch and land in the remaining 2.5 months" provides an extremely strong likelihood function. The likelihood of observing this evidence is very high if the true final number is 4, and extremely low if the true final number is 5 or more.
    4.  This likelihood function effectively multiplies the P(N=5), P(N=6), etc. probabilities by a number very close to zero, concentrating almost all of the posterior probability mass on N=4.

*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution is no longer a broad curve but is now a point mass, or very close to it, at the value 4.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could a secret, unannounced mission launch and land successfully by December 31, 2025? This is exceedingly unlikely. Lunar launches are high-energy, easily detectable events tracked by global space surveillance networks. A clandestine lunar landing is not a credible scenario.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Is it overconfident to place all probability on a single number? In most forecasting situations, yes. However, when a forecast period is almost over and the events in question have very long lead times, such certainty can be justified. The window for new events to occur has effectively closed.
*   **Edge Cases in Resolution:** The resolution criteria are clear ("soft landing... transmit data"). The four identified missions all clearly meet this. For example, SLIM and IM-1 had imperfect landings (upside down, on its side) but both successfully transmitted data and therefore count. There are no known ambiguous cases pending.
*   **Conclusion:** The red team analysis does not reveal any plausible mechanism by which the final number could be anything other than 4. The risk of being wrong is minimal and stems from "unknown unknowns" of an almost conspiratorial nature, which should not be significantly weighted in the forecast.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The analysis shows with very high confidence that four landings have occurred and no more will occur before the deadline. The probability distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated on the integer 4. Therefore, all percentiles from P10 to P90 will fall on this value.

P10: 4
P20: 4
P40: 4
P60: 4
P80: 4
P90: 4
