### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Growth of GiveWell Top Charities.** Organizations designated as "Top Charities" by GiveWell often experience explosive, non-linear growth due to large, catalytic funding inflows and high-trust operational autonomy. Base Rate: It is common for these charities to see growth of 5x-20x in key metrics (e.g., people reached, treatments delivered) over a 3-4 year period following their top recommendation. New Incentives' growth from ~70k in 2020 to ~1.5M in 2023 (~21x) fits this pattern. This suggests continued, but likely decelerating, growth as the program matures.
-   **Reference Class 2: Scaling of Public Health Interventions in Low-Resource Settings.** Large-scale health programs typically follow an S-curve trajectory: a slow start, a period of rapid acceleration (the "steep" part of the S), followed by a slowdown as they approach saturation of the target population or face increasing marginal costs and logistical complexity. Base Rate: The final 10-20% of a scaling target often takes disproportionately longer to achieve than the initial 80-90%. New Incentives appears to be in the latter stages of its rapid acceleration phase, potentially nearing the top bend of the S-curve in its currently targeted states.
-   **Reference Class 3: NGO Program Growth Projections.** Internal growth projections for well-funded NGOs are often optimistic. A base rate adjustment would involve slightly discounting the implied growth rate from funding announcements. However, New Incentives has a strong track record of meeting or exceeding targets, making a significant discount less warranted.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-07-09** GiveWell "Lookback" report published — **↑ (moderate)** — Confirmed the program's successful and high-quality scaling through 2023, increasing confidence in its operational capacity to execute its 2024-2025 expansion plans.
-   **2024-05-01** (Announced July 2024) GiveWell grant to CGD to study funding gaps — **↑ (small)** — Signals continued strong institutional support and belief in the program's model, suggesting funding is not a constraint for the resolution period.
-   **2024-01-01** (As of) Program operating in several states per GiveWell page — **↑ (moderate)** — Indicates the expansion funded in May 2023 was actively underway, setting the stage for continued high enrollment numbers throughout 2024 and 2025.
-   **2023-05-01** GiveWell grant for expansion through 2025 — **↑ (large)** — This is the key event within the recency window. It provided the direct funding for operations and expansion through the resolution date, making sustained growth the default expectation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Funding Levels (Large ↑):** The massive, secured funding from GiveWell and Open Philanthropy is the primary enabler. It removes financial constraints on hiring, logistics, and the cash transfers themselves, allowing the program to scale as fast as operationally feasible.
-   **Operational Expansion to New LGAs (Large ↑):** The core growth mechanism is geographic expansion. The May 2023 grant explicitly funded expansion to 47 new LGAs and continued operations in 104 existing ones. The rate of enrollment is directly tied to the pace of this rollout.
-   **Approaching Saturation (Moderate ↓):** As the program covers all "feasible LGAs" in its 11 target states, the pool of easily-reachable, unenrolled infants will shrink. This will naturally slow the rate of *new* enrollments, causing the cumulative number to grow more slowly.
-   **Programmatic Efficiency & Demand (Moderate ↑):** The program has a proven, effective model (confirmed by RCT) and is in high demand by caregivers. This creates a strong "pull" factor, making enrollment in new areas rapid once operations are established.
-   **Security & Political Stability (Moderate ↓):** The program operates in northern Nigeria, a region with known security challenges. Localized instability can disrupt operations, temporarily halting or slowing enrollment in affected areas. This represents the most significant short-term downside risk.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Exceptional Funding Certainty:** Unlike many NGOs that rely on a diverse and uncertain funding pipeline, New Incentives' operations through 2025 are essentially pre-funded by two of the largest players in effective altruism. This dramatically reduces financial risk.
-   **High-Frequency Public Data:** The "Infants enrolled" counter on their homepage provides near-real-time data, a rarity for NGOs. This reduces reliance on infrequent reports and allows for more accurate short-term extrapolation compared to a typical case.
-   **Singular Programmatic Focus:** New Incentives has a very narrow focus: CCTs for infant vaccination in a specific region. This operational simplicity allows for more efficient and predictable scaling than more complex, multi-intervention programs.
-   **Mature Scaling Phase:** Unlike a program in its infancy, New Incentives has been scaling rapidly for several years. Its operational model is tested, and it is likely approaching the limits of its current geographic strategy, making S-curve dynamics (i.e., deceleration) more relevant than for a newer program.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A simple extrapolation based on recent growth serves as a good starting point. Assuming a figure of ~3.0 million at the end of 2024 and a recent (2025) monthly enrollment rate of 70,000-90,000 infants, a baseline forecast would be 3.0M + (12 * ~80,000) = ~3.96 million. This prior should have a moderate "equivalent n" given the stable funding and operational history.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↑ (Large):** Secured funding through EOY 2025 ensures no financial slowdowns.
    -   **↑ (Moderate):** A proven, high-demand operational model that has successfully scaled in the past.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The program is approaching saturation in its target states, making a linear extrapolation of the peak growth rate risky. The rate of new enrollments is likely to slow.
    -   **↓ (Small):** Latent risk of operational friction or localized security disruptions in the final months.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests that while growth will remain strong, the powerful decelerating force of saturation makes a purely linear extrapolation too optimistic. The posterior should be adjusted slightly downwards from the initial ~3.96M estimate, likely landing in the 3.8M to 4.0M range, with the central tendency below the linear trend.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   The live counter on the New Incentives homepage showing a sustained or accelerating monthly growth rate in Q4 2025.
    -   Announcements of expansion into any new, previously un-targeted states or regions.
    -   Positive reports from GiveWell or New Incentives on operational efficiency.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A noticeable slowdown in the growth rate of the homepage counter over consecutive weeks.
    -   Reports of significant security incidents or health system disruptions in key states of operation (e.g., Katsina, Jigawa, Zamfara).
    -   Any communication from New Incentives or GiveWell mentioning logistical bottlenecks or challenges in reaching "last-mile" communities.

To forecast the number of infants that New Incentives' childhood vaccination program will reach by the end of 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1: Growth of GiveWell Top Charities.** Historical data shows that GiveWell top charities often experience significant growth, with New Incentives growing from ~70k in 2020 to ~1.5M in 2023 (~21x). This suggests a potential for continued growth, albeit at a decelerating rate.
   - **Reference Class 2: Scaling of Public Health Interventions in Low-Resource Settings.** These interventions typically follow an S-curve, with rapid growth followed by deceleration as saturation approaches.
   - **Base Rate:** Given the current stage of New Incentives, a reasonable base rate would be a continuation of growth but at a slower pace than previously observed. Assuming a figure of ~3.0 million at the end of 2024, a base rate growth to ~3.96 million by the end of 2025 is plausible.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The program continues to receive strong funding and has a proven operational model, aligning with the historical growth patterns of GiveWell top charities.
   - **Differences:** The program is nearing saturation in its target areas, which will likely slow growth compared to the explosive rates seen in earlier years.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **↑ (Large):** Secured funding through 2025 ensures no financial slowdowns.
   - **↑ (Moderate):** Proven, high-demand operational model.
   - **↓ (Moderate):** Approaching saturation in target states.
   - **↓ (Small):** Potential for operational disruptions due to security issues.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a base rate of ~3.96 million, the evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment due to saturation effects. The posterior distribution should reflect a central tendency slightly below the linear extrapolation, likely in the 3.8M to 4.0M range.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider potential for unexpected disruptions or slower-than-expected enrollment due to saturation.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where security issues significantly impact operations could lower the forecast. Conversely, if new regions are targeted, growth could exceed expectations.
   - **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential disruptions and saturation is warranted.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the following percentiles are proposed:
P10: 3.75M
P20: 3.80M
P40: 3.85M
P60: 3.90M
P80: 3.95M
P90: 4.00M

# Forecasting New Incentives' Vaccination Program Reach by End of 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use New Incentives' historical growth trajectory combined with their current reach:

- According to their website counter and reports, New Incentives grew from ~70,000 infants in 2020 to ~1.5 million by 2023, representing ~21x growth over 3 years.
- As of October 2024, they've likely reached approximately 2.5-3.0 million infants (extrapolating from their growth trajectory).
- The program operates in 11 states in Nigeria with 151 Local Government Areas (LGAs) - 104 existing and 47 new ones funded by the May 2023 grant.

My base rate is a simple extrapolation: assuming ~3.0 million infants by end of 2024 and a recent monthly enrollment rate of ~80,000 infants, we'd expect approximately 3.0M + (12 × 80,000) = ~3.96 million by end of 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- The program continues to operate with the same proven model of conditional cash transfers.
- Funding is secured through 2025 via the $35 million grant announced in 2023.
- The operational infrastructure and partnerships are established and functioning.

**Differences that matter:**
- The program is likely approaching saturation in its current target areas. As they cover more of the "feasible LGAs" in their 11 target states, the pool of easily-reachable, unenrolled infants will shrink.
- The S-curve effect: New Incentives is likely entering the upper bend of the S-curve, where growth naturally decelerates.
- The May 2023 grant specifically funded expansion to 47 new LGAs, but this expansion may be largely complete by late 2025, limiting further acceleration.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- The May 2023 GiveWell grant provides secured funding through 2025, eliminating financial constraints. (Strong upward push)
- The July 2024 GiveWell "Lookback" report confirmed successful scaling through 2023, validating operational capacity. (Moderate upward push)
- The program has a proven, high-demand model with strong community acceptance. (Moderate upward push)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- Approaching saturation in target states will naturally slow enrollment growth. (Strong downward push)
- Security challenges in northern Nigeria could disrupt operations in some areas. (Moderate downward push)
- The "last mile" problem: reaching the final 10-20% of a target population typically requires disproportionate resources. (Moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of ~3.96 million infants by end of 2025, I'll adjust based on the evidence:

- The strong upward evidence (secured funding, proven model) supports maintaining a high growth trajectory, but not necessarily accelerating beyond the current pace.
- The strong downward evidence (approaching saturation, S-curve dynamics) suggests the growth rate will likely decelerate somewhat in 2025.

Combining these factors, I expect the actual number to be slightly below my linear extrapolation. A reasonable posterior would center around 3.8 million, with a wider range to account for uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of saturation. If New Incentives has already enrolled most eligible infants in their target areas, growth could slow more dramatically.
- Security situations in northern Nigeria are volatile and could worsen, potentially causing significant operational disruptions.
- I might be overlooking the possibility of expansion to new states beyond the current 11, which could accelerate growth.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view might argue that New Incentives will hit significant saturation by mid-2025, causing monthly enrollment to drop to 40,000-50,000 in the latter half of the year. This would yield a total closer to 3.5 million.

Conversely, an optimistic view might suggest that operational efficiencies and potential expansion to new states could maintain or even increase the current growth rate, pushing the total to 4.2 million or higher.

Given these considerations, I should widen my uncertainty bands, particularly on the downside to account for saturation and security risks.

Answering based on the context as of October 28, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Reference Class:** The growth trajectory of a well-funded, mature public health intervention approaching saturation in its target regions. This is a specific application of the "S-curve" growth model common to scaling organizations.
*   **Reasoning:** New Incentives has been a GiveWell top charity for several years and received massive funding in 2023 to scale through 2025. It has already experienced the explosive, steep part of its growth curve (2022-2024). The year 2025 is the final year of this funded expansion within a defined set of 11 states in Nigeria. Therefore, the most relevant base rate is not "early-stage hyper-growth" but "late-stage scaling," where growth rates decelerate as the program reaches the most accessible parts of the target population and faces increasing marginal difficulty.
*   **Base Rate Characteristics:**
    *   **Median:** The annual number of new enrollees should be lower than the peak year (2024). GiveWell's projections implied ~1.2 million enrollments in 2024 (from ~1.8M at EOY 2023 to ~3.0M at EOY 2024). A base rate for 2025 would suggest adding fewer than 1.2 million infants. A reasonable starting point might be a 15-25% reduction, suggesting 900k to 1.0M new enrollments in 2025.
    *   **Prior Median Forecast:** ~3.0M (start of 2025) + 950k (2025 enrollments) = **3.95 million**.
    *   **Spread:** The distribution should be wide enough to account for variance in the speed of saturation and potential operational friction. A plausible range for 2025 enrollments could be from 700k to 1.2M, leading to a total range of 3.7M to 4.2M.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The situation aligns well with the S-curve model. The program's growth is constrained by geography (11 states) and population size, making eventual saturation inevitable.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Exceptional Data Availability:** The resolution is tied to a public counter on the New Incentives homepage. As the forecast date is very close to the resolution date (Oct 28 vs. Dec 31), we can anchor our forecast on a highly informed estimate of the current number and project forward for only two months. This dramatically reduces uncertainty compared to forecasting for a full year.
    *   **High Funding Certainty:** Operations through 2025 are fully funded, removing financial risk as a variable. Growth is limited by operational capacity and population saturation, not budget.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most critical evidence is the implied progress through the first 10 months of 2025.

*   **Anchor Point Estimation (as of Oct 28, 2025):**
    *   Starting point (EOY 2024): ~3.0 million.
    *   The base rate suggests a decelerating monthly enrollment rate from the ~100k/month peak in 2024. Let's model an average rate of ~80k/month for the first 10 months of 2025.
    *   Infants added (Jan-Oct 2025): 10 months * 80,000 = 800,000.
    *   **Estimated current number:** 3.0M + 800k = **3.8 million**.

*   **Forward Projection (Nov-Dec 2025):**
    *   **Saturation (Strong ↓):** This is the primary force. The monthly enrollment rate should continue to decline as the program works through the remaining, harder-to-reach populations. This pushes the forecast for the final two months down. I estimate a rate of 60k-80k/month.
    *   **Security/Political Stability (Moderate ↓, Asymmetric):** The program operates in Northern Nigeria, where localized security issues can disrupt operations. This is an asymmetric risk; a major disruption could halt enrollments in an area, pushing the total down, while it's unlikely an unexpected positive event would cause a huge surge. This adds a "left tail" to the distribution.
    *   **Operational Excellence (Moderate ↑):** New Incentives has a proven, efficient model. This provides a strong floor under the enrollment rate, making a complete collapse unlikely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior (S-curve model centered at 3.95M) × Likelihood (strong anchor at 3.8M in late Oct + decelerating rate).
*   **Update Step:**
    1.  Start with the anchor point of **3.8M** at the end of October.
    2.  Model the enrollments for the final two months (November, December).
    3.  My central estimate for the monthly rate is ~70,000, reflecting continued deceleration. This adds 2 * 70k = 140k.
    4.  This leads to a posterior median of 3.8M + 140k = **3.94 million**.
    5.  The saturation effect caps the plausible upside (unlikely to suddenly return to 100k/month), while the security risk creates a fatter downside tail (a rate of 40-50k/month is possible if there are disruptions).
*   **Posterior Shift:** The proximity to the resolution date allows us to significantly narrow the distribution from the initial prior and anchor it to a data-informed estimate. The median shifts slightly down from the simple annual prior (3.95M -> 3.94M), and the distribution becomes left-skewed to account for asymmetric downside risks in the final months.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A simple linear extrapolation might be a good alternative. If someone believed the 2024 rate of ~100k/month would continue through 2025, they would forecast 3.0M + (12 * 100k) = 4.2M.
*   **Rebuttal:** This is implausible because it ignores the core constraint: the program is saturating a fixed geographic area. Growth cannot remain linear indefinitely when the target population is finite. The S-curve model is far more appropriate for this stage of scaling.
*   **Blind Spots:** My estimate of the "current" number (3.8M) is an inference. The public counter could have a data lag, or a large data correction could occur before the end of the year. This introduces more uncertainty than just projecting forward two months.
*   **Adjustment:** To account for this uncertainty in the anchor point, I will ensure my final distribution has a reasonably wide P10-P90 range. The left-skew will be maintained to reflect that negative shocks (security incidents, operational halts) are more likely and potentially more impactful in the short term than positive shocks.
