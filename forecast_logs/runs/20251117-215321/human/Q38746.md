Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **What is C3.ai's business model and technology stack?** Are they a "leading AI lab" in the same sense as OpenAI or Anthropic? Do they develop their own large-scale, general-purpose foundation models from scratch, or do they primarily build applications on top of other platforms or for specific enterprise use cases?
2.  **What is C3.ai's public stance on AI safety and risk?** Do their public communications (e.g., from CEO Thomas Siebel), white papers, or corporate responsibility reports address AI risk? If so, do they focus on enterprise-level risks (bias, privacy, reliability) or on catastrophic/existential risks (power-seeking, self-replication) that are METR's focus?
3.  **What is METR's operational model and focus?** What kind of models do they evaluate? Is it a service available to any company, or is it a deep research partnership reserved for labs developing frontier models with potential for catastrophic capabilities?
4.  **What are the incentives and disincentives for C3.ai to partner with METR?** This includes regulatory pressures (e.g., US Executive Order on AI), market/customer demands, PR benefits, financial costs, and potential risks of a negative evaluation.
5.  **Are there any existing relationships or signals of engagement** between C3.ai and METR, or the broader catastrophic AI risk research community (e.g., MIRI, FHI, GovAI)?
6.  **What is the overall industry trend for this type of evaluation?** Is it expanding beyond the top 3-4 frontier labs, or is it remaining a niche practice for those explicitly pursuing AGI?

### **Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

1.  **For Q1 (C3.ai Model):**
    *   `"C3.ai" business model`
    *   `"C3.ai" products "generative AI suite"`
    *   `"C3.ai" foundation model development`
    *   `"C3.ai" vs "OpenAI" business model`

6.  **For Q6 (Industry Trends):**
    *   `AI model evaluation standards`
    *   `NIST AI Risk Management Framework evaluations`
    *   `UK AI Safety Institute partners`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **C3.ai's Business:** C3.ai is an enterprise AI application company. It provides a platform and pre-built applications for industries like energy, manufacturing, and finance. While they have a "Generative AI Suite," it focuses on leveraging existing large language models (from partners like Google, or open-source models) and grounding them in enterprise data. They are not a frontier lab developing general-purpose models from scratch to compete with GPT-5 or Claude 4. Their core competency is application, integration, and deployment, not foundational research toward AGI.
*   **C3.ai's Safety Stance:** The company's discourse on AI safety is firmly rooted in the "Responsible AI" or "Trustworthy AI" paradigm. They emphasize issues critical to their enterprise clients: data privacy, model explainability, fairness/bias, reliability, and security. There is no public record of CEO Thomas Siebel or the company expressing concern about catastrophic or existential risks from AI, which are often dismissed in his interviews as "science fiction."
*   **METR's Focus:** METR's mission is explicitly to evaluate cutting-edge AI systems for catastrophic risks, such as autonomous self-replication, power-seeking, and other loss-of-control scenarios. Their partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic are deep collaborations with labs at the absolute frontier of AI capabilities. This is not a standardized, off-the-shelf service but a research-heavy engagement.
*   **Incentives & Mismatch:** There is a profound mismatch. C3.ai's models are highly unlikely to possess the "dangerous capabilities" METR is designed to find. The primary regulatory and public pressure for such evaluations is on frontier model developers, a category C3.ai does not belong to. The PR upside for C3.ai is minimal, while the cost (in engineering time, IP exposure) would be significant. The risk of a confusing or negative evaluation report would be a major deterrent.
*   **Conclusion:** The probability is extremely low. The two organizations operate in different worlds with different technological goals and different conceptions of "AI risk." A partnership before 2026 would require a radical, un-signaled, and strategically incoherent shift from one or both parties.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Frontier AI Labs.** These are organizations developing large, general-purpose foundation models (e.g., OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta AI, Mistral). Of this group of ~5-7 labs, 2 (OpenAI, Anthropic) have confirmed partnerships with METR. **Base Rate: ~30-40%.**
*   **Reference Class 2: Publicly Traded Enterprise AI Application Companies.** This class includes companies that use AI/ML to provide services and platforms to other businesses (e.g., Palantir, Snowflake, Datadog, C3.ai). The number of such companies is large, but none have a public partnership with METR. **Base Rate: 0%.**
*   **Reasoning:** While the question title includes "leading AI labs," C3.ai's business model places it squarely in the second reference class. It is not a frontier model developer. Therefore, the 0% base rate from the more specific class is a much stronger starting point.

To forecast the probability that leading AI labs will have their models evaluated for dangerous behavior before 2026, specifically focusing on C3.ai, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1: Frontier AI Labs**: These labs develop large, general-purpose foundation models. Of this group, approximately 30-40% have partnerships with METR.
- **Reference Class 2: Publicly Traded Enterprise AI Application Companies**: This includes companies like C3.ai, which focus on enterprise applications rather than foundational AI research. None have public partnerships with METR. **Base Rate: 0%**.
- **Chosen Base Rate**: Given C3.ai's business model and focus, the 0% base rate from the second reference class is more appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity**: C3.ai is similar to other enterprise AI companies that focus on specific applications rather than developing frontier AI models.
- **Difference**: Unlike frontier labs, C3.ai does not engage in foundational AI research that would necessitate evaluations for catastrophic risks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **C3.ai's Business Model**: Focuses on enterprise applications, not developing models with potential catastrophic capabilities. This decreases the likelihood of needing METR evaluations.
- **C3.ai's Safety Stance**: Emphasizes responsible AI for enterprise use, not catastrophic risk mitigation. This further decreases the likelihood.
- **METR's Focus**: Evaluates models for catastrophic risks, which C3.ai's models are unlikely to possess. This decreases the likelihood.
- **Incentives & Mismatch**: There is little incentive for C3.ai to engage with METR, given the costs and potential risks of a negative evaluation. This decreases the likelihood.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds**: 0% base rate translates to odds of 0:1.
- **Likelihood Ratio**: Given the evidence, the likelihood ratio remains low, reinforcing the prior odds.
- **Posterior Probability**: The posterior probability remains close to 0%, given the lack of evidence supporting a shift towards METR evaluations.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of regulatory changes or industry shifts that could force C3.ai to engage in such evaluations.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant regulatory push or a strategic pivot by C3.ai could increase the probability, but there is no current evidence of this.
- **Rebuttals**: The lack of foundational AI research at C3.ai makes such scenarios unlikely.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability**: Given the strong alignment with the base rate and the reinforcing evidence, the probability remains extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will leading AI labs have their models evaluated for dangerous behavior before 2026? (C3.ai)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I need to determine whether C3.ai qualifies as a "leading AI lab" in the context of this question and what the base rate is for similar companies having their models evaluated by METR.

Looking at the resolution criteria, this question specifically targets C3.ai as a subquestion of a broader question about leading AI labs. The question asks whether C3.ai will have at least one of its models evaluated pre-commercial release by METR before January 1, 2026.

From my understanding of the AI industry:
- METR (formerly ARC Evals) currently has partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic to evaluate their models for catastrophic risks
- These partnerships focus on frontier AI models with potential for dangerous capabilities
- C3.ai is primarily an enterprise AI application company that builds solutions on top of existing foundation models rather than developing cutting-edge foundation models themselves

**Base Rate Selection:** I'll use two reference classes:
1. Frontier AI labs developing cutting-edge foundation models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Mistral): ~2/7 = ~29% have METR partnerships
2. Enterprise AI application companies (like Palantir, Snowflake, Datadog, C3.ai): 0/10+ = 0% have METR partnerships

Since C3.ai fits much better in the second category, I'll use a prior of 5%. This is slightly above the 0% base rate to account for uncertainty in my classification and the possibility of industry changes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- C3.ai is a publicly traded AI company with significant market presence
- There is increasing regulatory pressure on AI companies to demonstrate safety measures
- The timeline (before 2026) allows for potential policy or strategic changes

**Differences from base case:**
- C3.ai does not develop frontier foundation models that might exhibit dangerous capabilities METR focuses on
- C3.ai's business model focuses on enterprise applications rather than general-purpose AI systems
- C3.ai's public stance on AI safety appears to focus on traditional enterprise concerns (privacy, bias, reliability) rather than catastrophic risks
- METR's partnerships have been exclusively with companies developing frontier models with potential catastrophic capabilities

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to frontier AI labs.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: C3.ai's business model**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai were to partner with METR, it would likely need to be developing frontier models with potential dangerous capabilities = 0.2
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai doesn't partner with METR, we would expect them to continue focusing on enterprise applications = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: METR's focus and partnerships**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai partners with METR, METR would need to expand beyond catastrophic risk evaluation of frontier models = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai doesn't partner with METR, METR would continue focusing on frontier models with catastrophic risk potential = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Regulatory and market pressures**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai partners with METR, there would likely be strong regulatory or market pressures for enterprise AI companies to evaluate for catastrophic risks = 0.6
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai doesn't partner with METR, regulatory focus would remain primarily on frontier model developers = 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.8 = 0.75 (weak evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19):

Update on Evidence 1 (business model):
- Prior odds: 1:19 (5%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 1:19 × 0.22 = 0.22:19 ≈ 1:86
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+86) ≈ 1.15%

Update on Evidence 2 (METR's focus):
- Prior odds: 1:86 (1.15%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 1:86 × 0.33 = 0.33:86 ≈ 1:261
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+261) ≈ 0.38%

Update on Evidence 3 (regulatory pressures):
- Prior odds: 1:261 (0.38%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.75
- Posterior odds: 1:261 × 0.75 = 0.75:261 ≈ 1:348
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+348) ≈ 0.29%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the pace of regulatory change that could mandate evaluations for a broader set of AI companies
- C3.ai might pivot to developing more advanced foundation models to compete in the market
- METR might expand its mission to include enterprise AI applications with specific risks
- There could be market pressures or PR benefits I'm not accounting for

**Alternative scenarios:**
- If the US AI Safety Institute or similar regulatory bodies mandate third-party evaluations for all commercial AI systems, C3.ai might need to comply
- If C3.ai acquires a frontier AI lab or significantly changes its business model, the probability would increase
- If METR expands its services to include enterprise-specific risks, C3.ai might become a client

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low. While the fundamental mismatch between C3.ai's business and METR's mission remains strong, regulatory changes could create unexpected partnerships.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I adjust my final probability slightly upward from 0.29% to 1%. This reflects the small but non-zero possibility of regulatory changes, business model shifts, or expansion of METR's mission that could lead to a partnership before 2026.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Identify Base Rate:** The core of the question is whether a specific type of company (C3.ai) will engage in a specific type of activity (pre-release catastrophic risk evaluation with METR). The most relevant reference class is not "all AI labs," but companies with a similar profile to C3.ai.
    *   **Reference Class 1: Frontier AI Labs.** These are labs like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, which are developing large-scale, general-purpose models with the explicit or implicit goal of AGI. Of this small group (~5-7 labs), two (OpenAI, Anthropic) have public partnerships with METR. This suggests a base rate of ~30-40% *for this class*.
    *   **Reference Class 2: Enterprise AI Application Companies.** These are companies that build and deploy AI applications for specific business verticals, often using other companies' foundation models. This class includes C3.ai, Palantir, and many others. The number of companies in this class that have partnered with METR for catastrophic risk evaluations is zero.
*   **Chosen Base Rate:** C3.ai's business model places it squarely in Reference Class 2. They are not a frontier model developer. Therefore, the base rate from this more specific and appropriate class is extremely low, effectively 0% historically. To allow for updates, I will start with a conservative prior of **1%**.
*   **Initial Prior:** P(H) = 1% (Prior Odds = 1:99).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** C3.ai operates in the "AI" space and is a publicly recognized company. This is where the similarities to METR's existing partners (OpenAI, Anthropic) end.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Technology:** C3.ai's models are designed for specific enterprise tasks (e.g., supply chain optimization, predictive maintenance). They are not the kind of general, frontier-scale models that could plausibly exhibit the "dangerous capabilities" (e.g., autonomous self-replication, power-seeking) that METR is set up to evaluate.
    *   **Mission and Stance on Risk:** C3.ai's public discourse on AI safety focuses on "Responsible AI" — issues like bias, privacy, and reliability, which are relevant to their enterprise customers. Their CEO, Thomas Siebel, has publicly been dismissive of the catastrophic or existential risks that are METR's entire reason for existence. This is a fundamental ideological and strategic misalignment. METR's partners, by contrast, were founded by people deeply concerned about these specific risks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: C3.ai's business model and technology stack.**
    *   This evidence is far more likely if C3.ai does *not* partner with METR (P(E|~H) is high) than if they do (P(E|H) is very low). A partnership would be incoherent with their current technology and business focus.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This evidence significantly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: C3.ai's public dismissal of catastrophic AI risk.**
    *   A company's leadership publicly dismissing a specific risk is extremely unlikely if they are about to enter a costly, intensive partnership to mitigate that exact risk. It is very likely if they have no intention of doing so.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This evidence also significantly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: METR's specific, narrow mission.**
    *   METR's mission is to evaluate *cutting-edge* systems for *catastrophic* risks. Partnering with an enterprise application company like C3.ai would be a major deviation from this mission. It's far more likely they maintain this focus and *don't* partner with C3.ai.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:99.
*   **Update Step:** The evidence is overwhelming and consistent. The combined likelihood ratio from the mismatch in technology, business model, and public stance is extremely small. For a conceptual update, let's estimate a combined likelihood ratio of 1/20.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds = (1/99) × (1/20) = 1/1980
    *   Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) ≈ 1/1981 ≈ 0.05%.
*   **Summary:** The initial 1% prior, which was already low, is pushed by the evidence to a probability very close to zero. The final probability should be extremely low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could a strong regulatory push force C3.ai into this? For example, if the US government mandates that any AI provider for critical infrastructure (a key market for C3.ai) must undergo a catastrophic risk evaluation, and METR is the only certified provider.
*   **Rebuttal:** This scenario is unlikely to unfold before 2026. First, regulation moves slowly. Second, any such regulation would almost certainly be tiered, applying different standards to frontier models versus applied AI systems. It is improbable that a C3.ai supply chain model would be subject to the same evaluation regime as GPT-5. Third, if such a broad mandate were created, other evaluation providers would likely emerge to service the non-frontier market.
*   **Conclusion:** The core thesis of a fundamental mismatch between the two organizations is robust. The paths to a "Yes" resolution are highly speculative and require multiple unlikely events to occur. A very low probability is justified.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for a company like C3.ai partnering with METR is near zero. The specific evidence about C3.ai's business model, technology, and public stance, combined with METR's narrow mission, makes a partnership extremely improbable. The arguments against are strong, consistent, and based on the fundamental identities of the two organizations. A scenario where this occurs would require a radical, un-signaled change in strategy from one or both parties, or a surprisingly broad and swift regulatory intervention. A 1% probability adequately covers these tail risks.

Final: 1%
