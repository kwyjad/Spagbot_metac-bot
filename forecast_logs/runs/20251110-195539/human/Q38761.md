### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What are the specific conditions for a "Yes" resolution? This requires a precise breakdown of the territorial control requirements.
    *   What is the current state of the front line (as of November 2025) and what has been the trend in territorial control over the last 6-12 months?
    *   What is the relative military capacity of Russia and Ukraine (manpower, equipment, ammunition production/supply, technological edge)?
    *   What is the status and likely trajectory of international support for Ukraine, particularly from the US and Europe?
    *   What would be the military requirements for Russia to achieve the resolution goals (capture two major cities) in the remaining timeframe (~50 days)? Is this feasible?
    *   Are there any signs of preparation for a major Russian offensive on the required scale?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `"ISW Russian offensive campaign assessment November 2025"`
    *   `"Ukraine frontline map changes 2025"`
    *   `"Russian military production capacity 2025" "artillery shells" "drones"`
    *   `"Ukrainian army manpower challenges 2025"`
    *   `"US military aid to Ukraine latest package 2025"`
    *   `"European support for Ukraine winter 2025-2026"`
    *   `"Military analysis capture of Kharkiv Odesa"`
    *   `"Russian force concentration near Sumy Kharkiv border 2025"`
    *   `"Status of Russian control Tokmak Svatove 2025"`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The resolution criteria are extremely demanding. Russia must not only hold all its current key positions (like Tokmak, which is under constant Ukrainian pressure) but also conduct two successful, large-scale urban assaults on heavily defended cities (e.g., Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa) within a very short window.
    *   The war since late 2023 has been characterized by attrition, with very slow, costly, and incremental frontline changes, measured in meters per day, not by the capture of major urban centers. Neither side has demonstrated the capacity for a rapid, strategic breakthrough.
    *   Russia has successfully mobilized its defense industry, giving it a significant advantage in artillery shells and drone production. However, it continues to suffer heavy losses in experienced personnel and advanced equipment.
    *   Ukraine remains highly dependent on Western aid, which, while ongoing, has faced political hurdles and is often calibrated to enable defense rather than large-scale offense. Manpower is a growing constraint for Ukraine.
    *   Capturing a single major city like Kharkiv would require a massive concentration of forces and a multi-month operation, which would be easily detectable by satellite and other intelligence. There are no public reports of such a buildup.
    *   The provided source (drone attack on Lozova) is consistent with Russia's strategy of attritional warfare targeting infrastructure, not a prelude to an imminent ground assault on that axis.

4.  **Drafting the Brief:** Based on the synthesis, the brief will emphasize the high bar for a "Yes" resolution and the overwhelming evidence that the war's character is attritional, making such a rapid and significant Russian advance extremely unlikely in the given timeframe.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Modern Wars of Attrition (Post-Initial Phase):** After the initial invasion and counter-offensives of 2022, the conflict settled into a pattern of attrition. In similar conflicts (e.g., Iran-Iraq War, post-2015 Donbas War), front lines become relatively static, and significant territorial expansion by either side is rare. **Base rate for significant expansion: 5-10%.**
*   **Failed Sieges of Major Cities:** Russia attempted to take several of the target cities (Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Sumy) in 2022 with its full pre-war army and failed. The base rate for a second attempt succeeding against a now more experienced, better-entrenched defender, after years of attritional warfare, is very low. **Base rate for capturing two major cities: <5%.**
*   **Late-War Offensives Resulting in Breakthroughs:** Some historical wars see breakthroughs after long stalemates (e.g., Western Front 1918, Eastern Front 1944). This typically requires one side to achieve overwhelming superiority in manpower and materiel, or for the opposing side to suffer a catastrophic collapse in morale or logistics. While not impossible, this is the exception. **Base rate for this type of outcome: 10-15%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-28] Russia intensifies its offensive on the Pokrovsk front, making incremental gains west of Ocheretyne. — ↑ (small) — Shows continued Russian offensive focus and capacity for slow advances, but far from the resolution targets.
*   [2025-10-15] A bipartisan US bill secures $45 billion in aid for Ukraine, focusing on air defense and artillery for 2026. — ↓ (moderate) — Ensures Ukraine can maintain a robust defense through the resolution period, making a collapse unlikely.
*   [2025-09-22] Ukrainian HIMARS/ATACMS strike on a Russian command center in occupied Melitopol reportedly disrupts logistics on the southern front. — ↓ (small) — Degrades Russian command and control, making a large-scale offensive harder to coordinate.
*   [2025-09-04] Russian drone attack damages energy infrastructure in Lozova, Kharkiv Oblast. — ↑ (small) — Demonstrates Russia's ability to strike deep, but is an act of attrition, not a prelude to a ground assault.
*   [2025-07-10] ISW reports Russia has established layered defensive fortifications around Tokmak and Svatove. — ↓ (small) — Indicates a Russian focus on *holding* existing gains, not massing forces for a major new offensive.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Western Military Aid Flow:** The single most critical factor. A sudden, complete cessation of aid could trigger a Ukrainian collapse, enabling Russian advances. A steady flow allows Ukraine to defend effectively. (Large)
*   **Russian Offensive Manpower & Materiel Generation:** Russia's ability to sustain its "meat grinder" assaults and equip new units determines its capacity for offensive action. Its transition to a war economy is a key enabler. (Large)
*   **Ukrainian Mobilization and Morale:** Ukraine's ability to sustain its force levels and willingness to fight is crucial. A collapse in either could create an opening for Russia. (Large)
*   **Technological Asymmetry (Drones/EW):** A decisive advantage in drone warfare or electronic warfare by one side could create conditions for a localized breakthrough, though a strategic one is less likely. (Moderate)
*   **"Black Swan" Political Events:** Sudden political instability in Moscow (e.g., coup, leadership crisis) or Kyiv could dramatically alter the war's trajectory, though this is a low-probability, high-impact driver. (Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented ISR Environment:** The battlefield is transparent due to satellite imagery and ubiquitous drones, making it nearly impossible to assemble a force large enough to take a major city without it being detected weeks or months in advance.
*   **Extreme Fortification:** The front lines and major cities are now among the most heavily fortified and mined areas on earth, making rapid offensive maneuvers far more difficult than in historical reference cases.
*   **High Bar for Resolution:** The question requires not just a breakthrough, but the capture of *two* major cities while simultaneously *not losing* any key hubs along a 1000km front. This dual condition is exceptionally demanding.
*   **Direct External Support:** Unlike most historical wars of attrition, Ukraine is being directly supplied and financially supported by a coalition of the world's wealthiest nations, providing a powerful backstop against collapse.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior (e.g., 5-10%) is warranted, based on the reference class of attritional warfare and the immense difficulty of the resolution criteria. (Equivalent n ≈ 20, strong prior).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The established, multi-year pattern of attritional warfare with minimal territorial change.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Continued, if strained, Western support sufficient for a robust Ukrainian defense.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The extreme difficulty and high cost of modern urban warfare against a prepared defender.
    *   (↑ Small) Russia's superior shell production and larger manpower pool, enabling continued offensive pressure.
    *   (↓ Small) Russia's defensive posture in key areas like Tokmak, suggesting a focus on consolidation over massive expansion.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the low prior. The character of the war has not changed in a way that makes a Russian strategic breakthrough plausible. The posterior should move down from an already low base.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Massing of a 100,000+ troop concentration in Belgorod or Kursk Oblasts.
    *   A sudden, unexpected collapse of a major Ukrainian defensive line (e.g., west of Pokrovsk or near Kupiansk).
    *   A complete, confirmed halt of US military aid for more than 30 days.
    *   Successful, large

To forecast the probability of Russia significantly expanding its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for significant territorial expansion in a modern war of attrition, particularly after the initial phases, is low. Historical conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War and the post-2015 Donbas War show that front lines tend to stabilize, and significant territorial gains are rare. Given the demanding resolution criteria (capturing two major cities while maintaining control of all current key positions), a base rate of 5-10% is appropriate. This reflects the historical difficulty of achieving such objectives in similar conflicts.

**Initial Prior:** 5-10% probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The conflict has settled into a pattern of attrition, similar to historical precedents.
- Both sides are entrenched, with heavily fortified positions, making rapid advances difficult.

**Differences:**
- The unprecedented level of international support for Ukraine, particularly from Western nations, provides a significant backstop against collapse.
- The modern ISR environment (satellites, drones) makes it difficult for Russia to prepare a large-scale offensive without detection.

These differences suggest that the probability of a significant Russian expansion is even lower than the historical base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Continued Attritional Warfare:** The war has been characterized by slow, incremental changes. This evidence strongly suggests a low likelihood of significant territorial expansion. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Large)
- **Western Support for Ukraine:** Recent US aid packages ensure Ukraine's defense capabilities remain robust. This decreases the probability of a Russian breakthrough. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Moderate)
- **Russian Military Capacity:** While Russia has mobilized its defense industry, it still faces challenges in manpower and advanced equipment. This slightly increases the probability but not significantly. (Likelihood ratio: ↑ Small)
- **Russian Defensive Posture:** Russia's focus on fortifying existing positions rather than preparing for large-scale offensives suggests a lower probability of expansion. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Small)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Given the strong evidence reinforcing the low prior probability, the posterior probability should be adjusted downward. Starting with a prior of 5-10%, the evidence suggests a further reduction.

**Posterior Probability Calculation:**
- Prior odds: 0.05 to 0.10 (5% to 10%)
- Likelihood ratios collectively suggest a decrease, reinforcing the low prior.

**Updated Posterior Probability:** Approximately 3-5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for unexpected developments, such as a sudden collapse in Ukrainian morale or a significant shift in international support.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major political shift in Russia or Ukraine could alter the conflict dynamics. However, these are low-probability, high-impact events.
- **Rebuttals:** The possibility of a Russian breakthrough, while unlikely, cannot be entirely dismissed. Adjusting for these considerations, the probability might slightly increase but remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability reflects the low likelihood of Russia significantly expanding its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026.

Final: 4%

# Will Russia have significantly expanded its controlled territory in Ukraine on January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for Russia significantly expanding its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026 (about 50 days from now). The resolution criteria are very specific and demanding:
- Russia must capture at least TWO major Ukrainian cities it doesn't currently control
- Russia must maintain control of ALL its current key positions

Looking at appropriate reference classes:
- **Wars of attrition after initial phases**: Once conflicts settle into attritional warfare (as this one has since 2022), frontlines typically stabilize with minimal territorial changes. Base rate: 5-10% for significant expansion.
- **Urban warfare success rates**: Russia previously failed to capture several of these same cities in 2022 with its pre-war army. Capturing major urban centers against entrenched defenders is extremely difficult. Base rate: <5% for capturing two major cities.
- **Late-war breakthroughs**: While some historical conflicts see breakthroughs after stalemates, these typically require overwhelming superiority or opponent collapse. Base rate: 10-15%.

Given the extremely high bar for resolution (capturing TWO major cities while maintaining ALL current positions), I'll use a conservative prior of **7%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The war has been characterized by attritional warfare with slow, incremental changes for years
- Both sides have established extensive defensive fortifications
- Urban warfare remains extremely costly and difficult

**Key differences:**
- The resolution criteria are unusually demanding, requiring both offensive success (capturing two cities) AND defensive success (holding all current positions)
- The timeframe is extremely short (50 days) for the scale of territorial change required
- The battlefield has unprecedented transparency due to satellites and drones, making surprise offensives nearly impossible
- Ukraine continues to receive significant Western support, unlike many historical cases of late-war collapse

These differences generally make the scenario less likely than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Pattern of attritional warfare with minimal territorial change**
- P(E|H): If Russia were to significantly expand territory, we would still expect to see the established pattern of slow, grinding warfare until very recently. Likelihood: Moderate (0.5)
- P(E|~H): If Russia will not significantly expand territory, we would expect exactly the pattern we've seen. Likelihood: Very High (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56 (evidence against expansion)

**Evidence 2: Continued Western support for Ukraine**
- P(E|H): If Russia were to expand significantly, we might expect to see Western support faltering. Likelihood: Low (0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Russia will not expand significantly, continued Western support would be expected. Likelihood: High (0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.38 (evidence against expansion)

**Evidence 3: Russian defensive posture in key areas**
- P(E|H): If Russia were planning major offensive operations, we might see less focus on defensive fortifications. Likelihood: Moderate (0.5)
- P(E|~H): If Russia is not planning major expansion, defensive fortifications would be expected. Likelihood: High (0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.8 = 0.63 (evidence against expansion)

**Evidence 4: Russian superior shell production and manpower**
- P(E|H): If Russia were to expand significantly, we would expect to see these advantages. Likelihood: High (0.8)
- P(E|~H): If Russia will not expand, we might still see these advantages but they'd be insufficient. Likelihood: Moderate (0.6)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.6 = 1.33 (evidence for expansion)

**Evidence 5: No signs of massive force concentration needed for urban assaults**
- P(E|H): If Russia were to capture two major cities, we would expect to see large force buildups. Likelihood: Very Low (0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Russia will not expand significantly, we wouldn't expect to see such buildups. Likelihood: Very High (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (strong evidence against expansion)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 7% (odds of 0.075:1)

First update (pattern of attritional warfare):
- Posterior odds = 0.075 × 0.56 = 0.042
- Posterior probability = 0.042/(1+0.042) = 4.0%

Second update (Western support):
- Posterior odds = 0.042 × 0.38 = 0.016
- Posterior probability = 0.016/(1+0.016) = 1.6%

Third update (Russian defensive posture):
- Posterior odds = 0.016 × 0.63 = 0.010
- Posterior probability = 0.010/(1+0.010) = 1.0%

Fourth update (Russian production advantages):
- Posterior odds = 0.010 × 1.33 = 0.013
- Posterior probability = 0.013/(1+0.013) = 1.3%

Fifth update (No signs of force concentration):
- Posterior odds = 0.013 × 0.11 = 0.0014
- Posterior probability = 0.0014/(1+0.0014) = 0.14%

This extremely low probability (0.14%) seems too confident given inherent uncertainties. Let me reconsider.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Russia's capacity for surprise. While difficult, they could potentially mass forces quickly.
- The research report may have incomplete information about current Russian military preparations.
- I might be overestimating Ukrainian resilience or Western resolve.
- "Black swan" events could dramatically change the situation (e.g., sudden Ukrainian political crisis).

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Russia could launch a massive, unexpected offensive targeting vulnerable sectors.
- Ukraine could face a sudden collapse in morale or logistics.
- A political settlement might result in territorial concessions.

**Adjustments needed:**
- The extremely low probability (0.14%) seems overconfident given the inherent uncertainties of warfare.
- While the evidence strongly suggests the scenario is unlikely, I should account for unknown unknowns and the possibility of rapid changes.
- The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 9.3%, suggesting I may be missing something.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my estimate upward to account for uncertainty, but still maintain a low probability given the extremely demanding resolution criteria and short timeframe.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and accounting for uncertainty, I assess there is approximately a 3% chance that Russia will have significantly expanded its controlled territory in Ukraine on January 1, 2026, as defined by the resolution criteria.

This reflects:
- The extremely high bar for resolution (capturing two major cities while holding all current positions)
- The very short timeframe (50 days)
- The established pattern of slow, attritional warfare
- The absence of visible preparations for major offensive operations
- Continued Western support for Ukraine
- The inherent difficulty of urban warfare against prepared defenders

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class:** The reference class is major strategic offensives in mature wars of attrition, specifically those aiming to capture multiple large, fortified urban centers.
- **Reasoning:** After the initial mobile phase of the war in 2022, the conflict settled into a war of attrition with heavily fortified lines, similar to the Iran-Iraq War or the Western Front in WWI. In such conflicts, successful strategic breakthroughs that result in the capture of several major cities are exceptionally rare. They typically require either a complete collapse of the defending army or the attacking force achieving overwhelming technological, numerical, or tactical superiority.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the immense difficulty of capturing even one major city in modern warfare, let alone two, a low base rate is appropriate. The research brief suggests 5-10% for any "significant expansion." The specific criteria of this question (two major cities from a specific list, plus holding all current key points) are far more demanding. Therefore, I will select a conservative prior at the low end of this range.
- **Prior Probability:** P(H) = 5%. This translates to prior odds of 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current conflict fits the reference class of a grinding war of attrition with high force densities and extensive fortifications.
- **Differences:** The current situation in Ukraine presents even greater obstacles to an attacker than typical historical examples:
    - **Unprecedented ISR:** The battlefield is transparent due to ubiquitous satellite and drone surveillance, making it nearly impossible to secretly amass the 100,000+ troops required for such an offensive. This denies the attacker the crucial element of surprise.
    - **Extreme Fortifications:** The front lines and the approaches to major cities have been fortified for years, channeled by minefields, and are covered by long-range precision artillery. This makes rapid advances far more difficult than in past conflicts.
    - **Sustained External Support:** Ukraine is not fighting alone; it is being supplied by a coalition of the world's most powerful economies. This provides a significant backstop against the kind of logistical or materiel collapse that often precedes a defensive failure.
    - **High Resolution Bar:** The question requires a conjunctive outcome: Russia must capture *two* major cities AND not lose any of its own key hubs (like Tokmak). This is statistically much harder than achieving a single objective.
- **Conclusion:** These differences suggest that the probability of success is likely even lower than the 5% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The resolution date is January 1, 2026, which is less than two months from the current date of November 10, 2025. This short timeframe is a critical piece of context.

- **Evidence 1: Lack of Observable Force Buildup.** (Strongly Decreases Probability)
    - To launch an offensive capable of taking two major cities by January 1st, a massive concentration of troops and equipment would need to be visible *now* in staging areas. The research brief and public (OSINT) sources indicate no such buildup exists.
    - P(E | H): The probability of seeing no force buildup, if Russia were about to achieve this goal, is extremely low.
    - P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing no force buildup, if Russia is not about to achieve this goal, is extremely high.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very small (<< 1). This is the most powerful piece of evidence against a "Yes" resolution.

- **Evidence 2: Continued Western Aid to Ukraine.** (Moderately Decreases Probability)
    - The research brief notes a new $45 billion US aid package was secured in October 2025 for 2026.
    - This aid makes a sudden collapse of the Ukrainian military—the most plausible pathway to a rapid Russian advance—significantly less likely. It ensures Ukraine can maintain a robust defense through the resolution period.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1.

- **Evidence 3: Attritional Nature of Recent Russian Gains.** (Decreases Probability)
    - Recent Russian advances (e.g., near Pokrovsk) are described as "incremental" and have come at a very high cost. This operational style is inconsistent with a force preparing for a rapid, deep breakthrough. It shows Russia's current capabilities are suited for grinding advances, not strategic envelopments.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1.

- **Evidence 4: Russian Defensive Posture in Key Areas.** (Decreases Probability)
    - Reports from July 2025 noted Russia establishing layered defenses around Tokmak. This indicates a strategic priority of *holding* existing territory, not concentrating all available resources for a massive new offensive.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Starting Point:** Prior odds of 1:19 (5% probability).
- **Update Step:** The most significant evidence is the lack of a visible force buildup. An offensive of this magnitude cannot be hidden. The absence of evidence is strong evidence of absence. Let's apply a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/10 for this single factor.
    - Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    - Posterior Odds = (1/19) × (1/10) = 1/190
    - Posterior Probability = 1 / (1 + 190) ≈ 0.5%
- **Summary:** The other pieces of evidence (Western aid, attritional combat) further reinforce this conclusion, pushing the probability even lower. The combined evidence overwhelmingly suggests that Russia is neither preparing for nor capable of achieving the resolution's objectives in the given timeframe. The posterior probability is extremely low, likely in the 1-2% range after accounting for all factors.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Main Counterargument:** The primary way I could be wrong is if the Ukrainian army is far more brittle than it appears and is on the verge of a sudden, cascading collapse. In this scenario, Russia could advance rapidly against disintegrating resistance.
- **Rebuttal:** While Ukrainian manpower is a known challenge, a full-scale collapse in the next 52 days is a tail risk, not a central scenario, especially with renewed aid flowing. Even in a collapse scenario, capturing the city centers of two major, prepared cities is a monumental task that would face resistance from remaining units and partisans. The dual requirement of taking two cities while also holding Tokmak makes this outcome highly improbable even under these "best-case" conditions for Russia.
- **Why is the community at 9.3%?** This forecast may be stale and not fully updated for the extremely short remaining time. It might also be overweighting the general narrative of Russian initiative without scrutinizing the specific and extremely demanding resolution criteria. A 9.3% probability for an event in less than two months that requires a military feat not seen in this war since the opening days seems miscalibrated.

### 6. Final Forecast
The resolution requires a military outcome of extraordinary scale within an extremely short timeframe (~52 days). The primary evidence—the complete lack of a necessary force buildup—is almost dispositive on its own. Other factors, such as continued Western aid and the attritional nature of the front, further reduce the already low probability. The only plausible, albeit remote, path to a "Yes" is a sudden and total collapse of the Ukrainian front. I assess the probability of such a collapse leading to this specific outcome by January 1, 2026, as a tail risk. My analysis points to a probability of around 1-2%. I will set my forecast at the higher end of this to account for unknown unknowns.

Final: 2%
