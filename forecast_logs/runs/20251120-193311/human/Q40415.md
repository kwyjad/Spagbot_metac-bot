### Reference class & base rates
1.  **MP Departures (Resignation/Floor Crossing) per Parliament:** In a typical four-year Canadian federal parliament (338 MPs), there are approximately 8-12 mid-term departures (resignations, floor-crossings, or moving to independent). This yields a rate of 2-3 departures per year. For a ~1.5-month period (Nov 17 - Dec 31), this translates to a naive base rate of **~25-40%** for at least one such event occurring. *Limitation: This rate assumes events are independent and uniformly distributed over time, which is incorrect; they often cluster around political crises or opportunities.*
2.  **Floor Crossings in Minority Parliaments:** Floor crossings are rarer than resignations but are more likely during minority governments where the balance of power is delicate. Since 2000, there have been approximately 10 floor crossings at the federal level. In the 10 years of minority government during that period, the rate is slightly elevated, but a single crossing remains a rare event. The base rate for a floor crossing in a given 1.5-month period during a minority government is likely low, perhaps **~5-10%**. *Limitation: This class is small and doesn't capture the intensity of the current situation where a majority is within reach.*
3.  **Contagion Events (Departures following a Departure):** Political departures can create momentum. The most relevant reference class may be the probability of a second departure within 1-2 months of a first, politically charged one. Historically (e.g., the formation of the Bloc Québécois or the Reform Party), defections have occurred in clusters. In these "hot" periods, the probability of a follow-on event is substantially higher than the random baseline. A ballpark estimate for a subsequent event in a 6-week window following a contentious floor-crossing could be **~40-60%**. *Limitation: These are rare, highly contextual events, making the reference class very small and heterogeneous.*

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** Jeneroux resigns after alleged pressure from Conservative Party — ↑ — Signals intense internal conflict and high stakes; the party's "consequences" threat may backfire on other wavering MPs, making resignation a more palatable option than defection.
*   **2025-11-05** d'Entremont crosses floor to Liberals, citing Poilievre's leadership — ↑ — Establishes a credible pathway for other moderate Conservatives, breaks the "taboo" of defection, and puts the Liberal government on the cusp of a majority, intensifying their recruitment efforts.
*   **2025-11-04** Liberal government tables its 2025 budget — ↑ — Creates a major confidence vote deadline. This forces the issue and provides the Liberals with a powerful narrative ("stability") and leverage to entice potential defectors to cross before a potential election is triggered.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The primary driver. The Liberals are two seats from a stable majority, which would allow them to govern without concessions for the remainder of their term. They have immense incentive to offer significant rewards (e.g., cabinet posts, committee chairships, policy influence, future appointments) to potential defectors.
2.  **Conservative Caucus Internal Friction (Large ↑):** The explicit mention of disagreement with Poilievre's leadership by d'Entremont, and Jeneroux's mysterious departure, suggests a real ideological or stylistic rift. This provides a strong "push" factor for other moderate or disgruntled Conservative MPs.
3.  **Political Momentum & Contagion (Moderate ↑):** D'Entremont's move provides "political cover" for others considering the same. It normalizes the action and demonstrates that it's a viable option, potentially creating a small cascade.
4.  **Conservative Party Counter-Pressure (Moderate ↓):** The Conservative leadership and whip are now on high alert. They will be exerting maximum pressure (threats of deselection, loss of party resources, peer pressure) to enforce discipline and prevent further departures. The "consequences" mentioned to Jeneroux are an example of this.
5.  **Individual MP Calculus (Small ↑/↓):** An MP's decision will depend on their personal re-election chances, post-political career ambitions, and genuine policy disagreements. An MP in a swing riding who feels the Conservative brand is becoming toxic locally may be more inclined to jump.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Stakes are Exceptionally High:** Unlike a typical mid-term resignation, these potential moves could fundamentally alter the balance of power, shifting Canada from a minority to a majority government. This elevates incentives for all actors far beyond the norm.
*   **Active and Targeted Recruitment:** This is not a random event. The Liberal government is almost certainly actively identifying and courting specific, receptive Conservative MPs. The base rate assumes random, individual decisions.
*   **A "Live" Crisis:** The two departures within days of each other have created a "blood in the water" scenario. The political environment is highly unstable and focused on this specific issue, unlike a generic 6-week period in the middle of a stable parliament.
*   **Specific Leadership Flashpoint:** The conflict is not abstract; it is explicitly tied to the leadership of Pierre Poilievre. This provides a clear, singular "push" factor that may resonate with a specific faction within the Conservative caucus (e.g., Red Tories/moderates).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the "Contagion Events" reference class seems most appropriate, suggesting a starting point around **40-50%** with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=5) due to the small sample size of analogous situations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The prize of a majority government provides the Liberals with maximum incentive to poach, a factor not fully captured even in the "contagion" base rate.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The budget vote creates a hard deadline and a clear political justification ("stability") for an MP to make a move.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The explicit link to Poilievre's leadership suggests a systemic, rather than idiosyncratic, reason for discontent that could apply to multiple MPs.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Conservative counter-pressure will be intense and may successfully lock down the caucus, especially after being caught off guard twice.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests this situation is more acute than historical precedents. The upward pressures, driven by the prize of a majority, appear to outweigh the party-discipline counter-pressures. The posterior should move **significantly upward** from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Media reports or rumors (e.g., from outlets like CBC, Globe and Mail) about other "unhappy" or "wavering" Conservative MPs.
    *   A Conservative MP from a traditionally moderate or Liberal-leaning riding publicly criticizing party policy or leadership.
    *   Unusual voting behavior from a Conservative MP (e.g., abstaining or voting with the government on a procedural motion).
    *   The Prime Minister's Office clearing its schedule or the PM holding unscheduled private meetings.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A strong, unified public statement of loyalty to Poilievre signed by the entire remaining Conservative caucus.
    *   The Conservative whip announcing new, stricter caucus discipline measures.
    *   The Liberal government beginning serious negotiations with the NDP or Bloc for budget support, signaling they have given up on poaching.
    *   Prominent journalists reporting that the "well is dry" and no other MPs are considering a move.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opacity of Negotiations:** Any discussions about floor-crossing are happening in extreme secrecy. The public will likely have no warning before an announcement is made.
*   **Short Timeframe Volatility:** The ~45-day resolution window means the outcome is highly sensitive to a single individual's decision. This is not a process that will average out over time.
*   **Misinformation Risk:** Both parties have an incentive to plant rumors. The Liberals might leak names to create chaos, while the Conservatives might do so to smoke out and pressure waverers.
*   **Resolution Criteria Breadth:** The question resolves "Yes" for a resignation, floor-crossing, *or* becoming an independent. Resignation for personal/health reasons, while less likely in this context, would still trigger a "Yes" resolution and is difficult to predict.
*   **Fictional Scenario Dynamics:** The analysis is based on real-world political dynamics, but the specific personalities and pressures of this fictional 2025 scenario are not fully known.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for an MP departure in a short period is moderate, but this situation is exceptional. The powerful incentive for the Liberals to secure a majority by poaching from a seemingly fractured Conservative caucus makes another departure before year-end significantly more likely than the historical average.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the "Contagion Events" reference class, which estimates a 40-60% probability of a subsequent political departure within a 6-week window following a contentious event. This is appropriate given the recent floor-crossing and resignation, suggesting a heightened likelihood of further departures.
   - Initial prior: 50% (midpoint of the 40-60% range).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government with recent defections, aligning with the base case of contagion events.
   - Differences: The stakes are higher due to the potential shift to a majority government, and there is active recruitment by the Liberals, which is not typical in the base case. These differences suggest a higher probability than the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Liberal Government's Quest for a Majority (Large ↑):** The incentive for the Liberals to secure a majority is strong, increasing the likelihood of further defections.
   - **Conservative Caucus Internal Friction (Large ↑):** Discontent with leadership provides a push factor for potential defectors.
   - **Political Momentum & Contagion (Moderate ↑):** Recent events create a conducive environment for further departures.
   - **Conservative Party Counter-Pressure (Moderate ↓):** Efforts to enforce discipline may reduce the likelihood of defections.
   - Overall likelihood ratio suggests an increase in probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1 (50% probability translates to 1:1 odds).
   - Likelihood ratio: Given the strong incentives and recent events, we estimate a likelihood ratio of approximately 2:1 in favor of a departure occurring.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1 × 2 = 2.
   - Posterior probability = 2 / (1 + 2) = 2/3 ≈ 66.7%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis may overestimate the likelihood if Conservative countermeasures are more effective than anticipated.
   - Alternative scenario: Conservative unity and effective discipline could prevent further defections.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slight reduction to account for potential overestimation of Liberal influence and Conservative disunity.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Adjusted final probability: 65%.

Final: 65%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to determine the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning in the period from November 20, 2025 to December 31, 2025 (approximately 41 days).

The most appropriate reference class is the "Contagion Events" base rate - the probability of additional departures following recent politically charged departures. According to the research, this base rate is approximately 40-60% for a 6-week window following a contentious floor-crossing.

I'll select a prior of **50%** (middle of the range) with low confidence (equivalent n≈5) due to the small sample size of truly analogous situations.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We're in a minority government situation where floor crossings have historically been more common
- We're examining a short timeframe (41 days) similar to the 6-week window in the reference class
- We've already seen two departures (d'Entremont crossing the floor and Jeneroux resigning) creating the "contagion" effect

**Key differences:**
- The stakes are exceptionally high - just two more Conservative MPs defecting would give the Liberals a majority government
- The Liberal government has unprecedented incentive to actively recruit Conservative MPs
- The explicit criticism of Poilievre's leadership suggests a systemic rather than idiosyncratic issue
- The Conservative Party is now on high alert and actively working to prevent further departures
- The budget vote creates a hard deadline and clear political justification for potential defectors

These differences, particularly the high stakes and active recruitment, suggest the probability should be higher than the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Liberal government is two seats away from a majority**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If another MP will defect/resign, the Liberal proximity to majority is likely a key driver
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if no one else defects, this situation still exists
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (strong increase in probability)

**Evidence 2: Two MPs have already left the Conservative Party within days of each other**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If another MP will defect, recent departures likely created momentum
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - These events happened regardless of future defections
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3 (moderate increase in probability)

**Evidence 3: Conservative Party threatened "consequences" to Jeneroux**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - If another MP will defect, this heavy-handed approach might backfire
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This approach might effectively prevent further defections
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (moderate decrease in probability)

**Evidence 4: d'Entremont explicitly cited disagreement with Poilievre's leadership**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If another MP will defect, ideological differences with leadership is a likely cause
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This could be an isolated case
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (moderate increase in probability)

**Evidence 5: Budget vote creating a deadline and political justification**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If another MP will defect, the budget vote provides perfect timing
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Without this pressure point, defections are less likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (strong increase in probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 50:50 (1:1), I'll update based on the evidence:

Posterior odds = 1 × 1.8 × 1.3 × 0.75 × 1.6 × 2.0
Posterior odds = 5.616

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability = 5.616 / (1 + 5.616) = 0.849 or about **85%**

This seems quite high, so let me check my reasoning. The key factors pushing this probability up are:
- The extremely high stakes (Liberal majority within reach)
- The demonstrated pathway (two recent departures)
- The explicit leadership disagreement creating a systemic issue
- The budget vote creating a perfect political moment

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Overestimating the "contagion" effect**: The two departures might be isolated incidents rather than the start of a trend. Perhaps these were the only two MPs with serious grievances.

2. **Underestimating Conservative counter-measures**: The Conservative leadership is now fully aware of the threat and will be taking extraordinary measures to prevent further defections.

3. **Timing considerations**: With Christmas and year-end approaching, MPs might delay any major decisions until after the holidays.

4. **Selection bias in historical examples**: The "contagion" reference class might be biased toward remembering clusters of defections while forgetting isolated cases.

5. **Overconfidence in the 41-day window**: The probability of a defection over 41 days should be lower than over a longer period, and I may not be discounting enough for the short timeframe.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability downward. The evidence still points to an increased likelihood compared to the base rate, but perhaps not as dramatically as my initial calculation suggested.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and potential blind spots in my reasoning, I believe the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026 is:

Final: 75%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks about the probability of an MP departure (resignation, floor-crossing, or becoming independent) within a specific 44-day period (Nov 18 - Dec 31, 2025).

A general base rate for MP departures is 2-3 per year in a 338-seat parliament. This translates to a ~25-40% chance of at least one departure in a random 1.5-month period.

However, this situation is not random. It follows two closely-timed, politically-charged departures (a floor-crossing and a resignation under pressure). A more appropriate reference class is the probability of a "contagion" event—a subsequent departure shortly after an initial one. Historically, defections and resignations can occur in clusters during periods of political instability. For this reference class, the probability of a follow-on event within 1-2 months is substantially higher.

I will select a prior based on this "contagion" reference class, setting the initial probability at **50%**. This reflects a coin-flip chance that the initial instability will lead to another departure in the short term.
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:1

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to past "contagion" events as it involves internal party dissent and high political drama. However, it differs in several crucial ways that amplify the probability:

*   **Exceptionally High Stakes:** The Liberal government is on the verge of securing a majority. This is a rare and powerful incentive, motivating them to actively recruit and offer significant rewards to potential defectors. This is a much stronger "pull" factor than in typical historical cases.
*   **Specific, Factional "Push" Factor:** The departures are explicitly linked to disagreements with the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre. This suggests a potential factional rift (e.g., between moderates and the party's current direction) rather than an idiosyncratic issue with one or two MPs, making it more likely that others share the sentiment.
*   **Hard Deadline:** The upcoming budget vote acts as a forcing function. It provides a politically defensible moment for an MP to act, framing their decision around "providing stability" and avoiding an election.

These factors suggest the current situation is more volatile and has stronger directional forces at play than the average historical contagion event.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that another MP defects or resigns before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: A majority government is at stake.** The Liberals have an overwhelming incentive to poach MPs. This makes it much more likely they are actively pursuing leads and making generous offers. The likelihood of getting another departure is much higher when the governing party is dedicating significant resources to making it happen. This evidence strongly increases the probability (P(E|H) >> P(E|~H)).
*   **Evidence 2: The Jeneroux resignation.** The report that MP Jeneroux resigned after being pressured by his party over talks with the Liberals is key. It confirms two things: 1) The Liberals are in active talks with multiple Conservative MPs, not just the one who already crossed. 2) The Conservative party's disciplinary tools (threats of "consequences") may be backfiring, leading to resignations (which still resolve the question as "Yes") instead of renewed loyalty. This evidence moderately increases the probability.
*   **Evidence 3: Conservative Party Counter-Pressure.** The Conservative leadership is now on high alert and will be exerting maximum pressure to maintain caucus discipline. This is the primary force working against another departure. It may successfully intimidate other wavering MPs into staying put. This evidence decreases the probability.

Overall, the evidence for "push" and "pull" factors (the prize of a majority, internal dissent, active poaching) appears stronger and more concrete than the countervailing force of party discipline, whose effectiveness is unproven and may even be counterproductive.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a conceptual update from the 50% prior.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:1 (or 50%)
*   **Evidence:** The combination of a massive "pull" from the Liberals (majority prize) and a confirmed "push" from within the Conservative caucus (leadership dissent, as seen with d'Entremont and Jeneroux) represents a powerful set of forces. The Conservative counter-pressure is the main mitigating factor.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence makes the hypothesis (H) significantly more likely. I estimate the combined likelihood ratio of the evidence to be approximately 3.0. This means the current situation is about three times more likely to produce another departure than a generic "contagion" scenario.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 1:1 × 3.0 = 3:1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** A 3:1 odds corresponds to a probability of 3 / (3 + 1) = **75%**.

This posterior reflects a strong belief that another departure will occur, driven by the exceptional political circumstances.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 75% is high and could be overconfident. The primary reason it might be wrong is that I am underestimating the power of party discipline. The Conservative caucus, having lost two members, might now rally together against a common enemy (the poaching Liberals). The "blood in the water" could lead to a "circling the wagons" effect that solidifies the caucus for the near future. Any secret negotiations are opaque, and it's possible the Liberals have already approached all willing MPs and the well is now dry.

An alternative forecast of 45% might argue that the two departures were the only ones willing to act, and the Conservative crackdown will now be ruthlessly effective, making the probability slightly *less* than the 50% contagion base rate.

However, I maintain that the incentives for the Liberals are too high for them to stop trying, and the Jeneroux affair confirms other MPs are at least willing to listen. The broadness of the resolution criteria (any MP resigning for any reason) also provides a small but real floor to the probability. Therefore, I will stick with my 75% forecast, which acknowledges the alternative scenario is plausible (a 1-in-4 chance) but considers the evidence for another departure to be compelling.

### Final Forecast
The situation is highly volatile. The base rate for a departure in a "hot" political crisis is already significant (~50%). Layering on the immense incentive of a majority government for the Liberals and confirmed factional discontent within the Conservatives pushes the probability much higher. While Conservative party discipline will now be at maximum, the forces pushing for another departure appear stronger.

Final: 75%
