### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Rapid Saturation of Major AI Benchmarks (e.g., MMLU):** New, comprehensive benchmarks often see rapid progress once targeted by leading AI labs. MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) saw SOTA performance jump from ~44% (Gopher) to 86.4% (GPT-4) in under two years, and then to over 90% in the following year. This class suggests a large leap is possible, potentially doubling or tripling the current score within a 12-18 month period.
    *   **Base Rate:** A new frontier model could plausibly achieve a score between **60% and 85%** within a year of the benchmark's release, assuming it becomes a priority target.
    *   **Limitations:** HLE is explicitly designed to be harder and more multi-modal than MMLU, potentially slowing progress.

2.  **Progress on "Grand Challenge" Reasoning Benchmarks (e.g., MATH):** More specialized and difficult reasoning benchmarks show slower, more incremental progress. The MATH dataset saw SOTA improve from ~50% (GPT-4) to ~60-70% with advanced prompting and verification techniques over the subsequent 1-2 years. Progress is steady but not explosive.
    *   **Base Rate:** An annual improvement of **15-25 percentage points** on a difficult, reasoning-heavy benchmark. Applying this to the current 26.6% score over ~9 months suggests a year-end score in the **40% to 50%** range.
    *   **Limitations:** This class may understate the impact of a major new architectural release (e.g., a true GPT-5) which could cause a step-change rather than incremental improvement.

3.  **Initial Year Performance on Novel Benchmarks:** The first year of a new, difficult benchmark often establishes a baseline and sees one major jump as the first "next-generation" model is tested on it. The initial HLE score of 26.6% is this baseline. The next data point will likely be a large leap.
    *   **Base Rate:** The first major model release targeting a new benchmark often produces a score **2.0x to 2.5x** the initial baseline. This implies a potential score of **53% to 67%**.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a heuristic based on a small number of past instances and is highly sensitive to the capability jump of the next model.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-16** The AGI Revolution article highlights shrinking AGI timelines from leaders at OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind. (↑) — Matters because it signals intense competitive pressure and resource allocation to achieve breakthrough performance, making a major capability leap more likely.
*   **2025-08-22** A (hypothetical) Google DeepMind technical blog post details "multimodal fusion" techniques, showing SOTA on several video and image understanding tasks. (↑) — Matters because HLE is a multimodal benchmark; advances in this specific area directly address a key bottleneck for improving HLE scores.
*   **2025-07-10** Anthropic's (hypothetical) Claude 4 model is released. While showing improved safety and long-context reasoning, it only achieves 31% on HLE. (↓) — Matters because it suggests that scaling and refinement of current architectures may only yield incremental gains on this difficult benchmark.
*   **2025-06-05** The HLE creators publish a follow-up analysis, noting that current models fail most on questions requiring multi-step, cross-disciplinary reasoning. (↔) — Matters because it clarifies the specific challenge, suggesting that progress depends on architectural innovation in reasoning, not just scaling.
*   **2025-04-01** Analysis of 8,590 predictions shows entrepreneurs are more bullish on AGI timelines (2026-2035) than academics. (↑) — Matters because the key labs are run by these entrepreneurs, and their optimistic beliefs drive aggressive investment and research roadmaps.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Scaling of Compute and Data:** The primary driver of capability improvements over the last 5 years. A new model trained on significantly more data and compute than the one that scored 26.6% is almost certain to perform better. (Size: Large)
2.  **Architectural Innovations:** A move beyond the standard Transformer architecture or significant improvements in handling multimodality could unlock a step-change in performance, especially on HLE's image-based questions. (Size: Large)
3.  **Advanced Post-Training Enhancements:** The current 26.6% score is from "OpenAI's Deep Research," implying it's not a base model score. More sophisticated techniques like process supervision, automated prompt engineering, and tool use could significantly boost a powerful base model's score. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Competitive Dynamics:** The race between OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and others for benchmark leadership is fierce. With HLE positioned as a "final exam," labs are highly motivated to invest resources to claim the top spot. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Benchmark Contamination / "Teaching to the Test":** As HLE becomes more prominent, its contents (or similar problems) may inadvertently leak into training data, artificially inflating scores without reflecting true generalization. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Designed Difficulty:** Unlike benchmarks that emerged organically, HLE was explicitly designed by AI safety researchers to be difficult for current models and test the frontiers of knowledge, potentially making the "rapid saturation" reference class less applicable.
*   **Multimodality as a Core Challenge:** HLE's integration of images is not an afterthought. This is a known weakness of many current models, and progress may be gated by specific architectural improvements in this area, not just general scaling.
*   **Frontier Scientific Knowledge:** The exam tests cutting-edge knowledge. This content may be sparse in standard web scrapes used for training, requiring more advanced data curation or reasoning from first principles.
*   **Intense, Mature Competition:** The level of capital and talent focused on beating SOTA is arguably at an all-time high. The race is not between academic labs but between multi-billion dollar corporations, accelerating timelines compared to the early days of MMLU.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **60%** with a wide distribution seems appropriate, anchored by the "Rapid Benchmark Saturation" and "Initial Year Performance" reference classes (n≈10). This reflects a belief in a significant jump from a next-gen model.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The intense, well-funded competitive race and bullish timelines from key leaders strongly suggest a major model release is imminent and aimed at breakthrough performance.
    *   (↓ Moderate) HLE's designed difficulty, multimodality, and focus on frontier knowledge are significant headwinds compared to past text-only benchmarks like MMLU.
    *   (↓ Small) The hypothetical Claude 4 result (31%) suggests incremental architectural improvements may not be enough for a massive leap, pointing to the need for a true next-gen model.
    *   (↑ Small) Recent (hypothetical) technical progress in multimodal fusion directly addresses a key weakness tested by HLE.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests a slight downward revision from the optimistic prior. The difficulty of the benchmark tempers expectations, but the overwhelming force of competition for a major release keeps the forecast high. The posterior should shift slightly lower, perhaps to a median around **52-58%**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcements or credible leaks of a new flagship model (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 2.0) from a major lab.
    *   ArXiv pre-prints demonstrating novel reasoning or multimodal architectures that show step-change performance on related difficult benchmarks.
    *   A major lab explicitly mentioning HLE as a key evaluation metric in a technical report.
    *   Sudden, large updates to the official HLE leaderboard.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Major lab announcements that focus on efficiency, safety, or productization rather than frontier capabilities.
    *   Technical blog posts from key players highlighting persistent challenges in multimodal reasoning or scientific problem-solving.
    *   The end of the year approaching with no major model releases announced.
    *   A new SOTA on the leaderboard that is only an incremental improvement (e.g., 30-35%).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Benchmark Integrity:** The risk of test set contamination is high for a high-profile benchmark. A high score may not reflect true generalized capability.
*   **Opacity of Labs:** The "Deep Research" score is not from a publicly available model. We lack details on the methods used, and future results may also come from private models with limited transparency.
*   **Definition of "Human Assistance":** The resolution criteria exclude "human assistance," but the line can be blurry. Complex, human-designed prompting chains or verification schemes could be considered a grey area.
*   **Capability Overhang:** A lab may already possess a model capable of a high score but has not yet published results for strategic reasons. The score could jump unexpectedly at any time before the deadline.
*   **Binary Outcome Risk:** The final score will likely come from one of just 2-3 major model releases. The forecast is thus highly sensitive to the specific (and unknown) capabilities of these few models, rather than an average trend.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast hinges on a single question: will a major AI lab release a true next-generation model before 2026? If so, reference classes suggest a score of 50-70% is plausible, but HLE's specific design as a difficult, multimodal "final exam" provides significant headwinds, pulling expectations down.

To forecast the best score by an AI on the full Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The rapid saturation of AI benchmarks suggests a potential score between 60% and 85% within a year of the benchmark's release. However, given HLE's designed difficulty and multimodality, a more conservative base rate centered around 60% is appropriate.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** A mean of 60% with a wide variance to account for uncertainty in rapid AI advancements and the benchmark's difficulty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Like previous benchmarks, HLE is a target for major AI labs, suggesting potential rapid progress.
- **Differences:** HLE's explicit design for difficulty and multimodality may slow progress compared to previous benchmarks like MMLU.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Positive Evidence:**
  - Intense competition and resource allocation by major AI labs (↑ Large).
  - Recent advances in multimodal fusion techniques (↑ Small).
- **Negative Evidence:**
  - HLE's designed difficulty and multimodality (↓ Moderate).
  - Incremental gains from current architectures, as seen with Claude 4 (↓ Small).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 60%.
- **Evidence Impact:** The positive evidence of competitive dynamics and recent technical advances is tempered by the benchmark's difficulty.
- **Posterior Mean:** Adjusted slightly downward to a median around 52-58%, reflecting the tempered optimism due to HLE's challenges.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected architectural breakthroughs or strategic releases by labs.
- **Tail Risks:** A major model release could lead to a sudden score jump; however, the benchmark's difficulty remains a significant barrier.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative forecast might center around 45-55%, but the competitive race and recent advances justify a slightly higher range.

### 6. Final Percentiles

# Forecasting the Best AI Score on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use three reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **AI Benchmark Saturation Rates**: Major benchmarks like MMLU saw rapid progress from ~44% to >90% in about 2-3 years. ImageNet went from ~75% to >90% in a similar timeframe. 

2. **Progress on Difficult Reasoning Benchmarks**: For challenging benchmarks like MATH, progress has been slower but still significant - from ~30% to ~60-70% over 1-2 years.

3. **Current HLE Performance**: The current SOTA is 26.6% from OpenAI's Deep Research (as of the background information).

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around **55%** with a standard deviation of about 15 percentage points. This reflects the expectation of significant improvement from the current 26.6%, but acknowledges the exceptional difficulty of HLE as a benchmark explicitly designed to be challenging.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes:**
- Like other benchmarks, HLE will likely see focused effort from major AI labs
- The competitive dynamics driving rapid progress on other benchmarks remain in place
- The timeframe (until end of 2025) allows for 1-2 major model generations

**Key differences:**
- HLE is explicitly designed to be more difficult than previous benchmarks
- It's multimodal, requiring integration of visual and textual reasoning
- It tests frontier scientific knowledge that may be sparse in training data
- It requires cross-disciplinary reasoning, a known weakness of current models

These differences suggest a more conservative expectation compared to the rapid saturation seen in earlier benchmarks.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher scores:**
1. **Competitive pressure**: The hypothetical "AGI Revolution" article and entrepreneur timeline predictions suggest intense competition and resource allocation to achieve breakthrough performance. (Likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher scores)

2. **Multimodal progress**: The hypothetical Google DeepMind "multimodal fusion" techniques directly address a key bottleneck for HLE. (Likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring higher scores)

3. **Historical benchmark saturation**: Previous benchmarks have seen rapid progress once they become targets. (Likelihood ratio ~1.8:1 favoring higher scores)

**Evidence for lower scores:**
1. **Claude 4's hypothetical 31% score**: This suggests incremental improvements may yield only modest gains. (Likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring lower scores)

2. **HLE's designed difficulty**: The benchmark was explicitly created to be challenging for current models. (Likelihood ratio ~1.3:1 favoring lower scores)

3. **Multi-step reasoning requirements**: The hypothetical analysis noting models fail on cross-disciplinary reasoning suggests a fundamental capability gap. (Likelihood ratio ~1.4:1 favoring lower scores)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 55% with SD of 15 percentage points:

First update on competitive pressure and multimodal progress:
- Combined likelihood ratio of ~3:1 favoring higher scores
- This shifts the distribution upward to approximately 60% with slightly reduced uncertainty

Second update on Claude 4's modest gains and HLE's designed difficulty:
- Combined likelihood ratio of ~2:1 favoring lower scores
- This pulls the distribution back down to approximately 54% 

The posterior distribution is now centered around 54% with a standard deviation of about 13 percentage points, reflecting slightly increased confidence but still substantial uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Benchmark contamination**: HLE questions could leak into training data, artificially inflating scores.
2. **Capability overhang**: A lab may already have a model capable of much higher scores but hasn't published results.
3. **Architectural breakthroughs**: A fundamental innovation could cause a step-change in performance beyond what incremental improvements suggest.
4. **Diminishing returns**: The final 10-20% of questions may be disproportionately difficult, creating a ceiling effect.

**Alternative forecast**: A more optimistic view might place the median at 70%, arguing that a true next-generation model (e.g., GPT-5) would represent a step-change in capabilities. The counterargument is that HLE was specifically designed to test the limits of scaling current architectures.

**Tail risks**: There's a non-trivial chance (~10%) that no major architectural breakthrough occurs before 2026, limiting scores to incremental improvements in the 35-40% range. Conversely, there's a similar chance (~10%) of a breakthrough enabling scores above 75%.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these tail risks.

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the performance of new AI models on novel, difficult benchmarks within the first year of the benchmark's release. Reference classes like MMLU and others show that once a benchmark becomes a target for top labs, a significant performance jump from the initial baseline is common. For instance, the "Initial Year Performance" reference class suggests a 2.0x to 2.5x improvement over the baseline. Given the current baseline of 26.6% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), this base rate implies a potential score in the 53% to 67% range. I will therefore center my prior distribution around a median of **60%**, with a wide spread to account for the high uncertainty of a new benchmark, ranging from ~30% to ~85%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case in two critical ways:
*   **Designed Difficulty:** HLE was explicitly designed to be very difficult for current models, with a focus on multimodality and frontier scientific knowledge. This is a significant headwind compared to text-only benchmarks like MMLU and suggests that progress might be slower than the base rate indicates.
*   **Short Timeframe:** The question resolves at the end of 2025. With the current date being October 11, 2025, there are less than three months remaining. This is a very short window for a major new model to be released, benchmarked, and have its results published. The base rate of a "first year" jump is less applicable when we are in the final 10 weeks of that year. This dramatically increases the probability of a much smaller, or even zero, improvement over the current SOTA.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report:
*   **(↓ Strong) Hypothetical Claude 4 score of 31% (July 2025):** This is the most significant piece of evidence. It provides a concrete (though hypothetical) data point showing that a next-generation model from a top-tier lab might only achieve a small, incremental gain. This strongly pulls the forecast down from the optimistic prior and suggests HLE is highly resistant to current scaling approaches.
*   **(↑ Moderate) Intense Competition & Bullish Timelines:** The reports on aggressive AGI timelines from industry leaders (OpenAI, DeepMind) and high investment levels indicate immense pressure to deliver a breakthrough model. This increases the probability of a major model release before the year's end, aimed at achieving a step-change in performance. This acts as a counterweight to the Claude 4 data point.
*   **(↑ Small) Advances in Multimodality:** The hypothetical DeepMind post on "multimodal fusion" directly addresses a key weakness HLE is designed to test. This makes a higher score more plausible *if* a new model incorporating such techniques is released in time.
*   **(↓ Small) Short Timeframe:** With less than 3 months to go, the likelihood of a major model release and publication cycle completing before the deadline decreases. This favors scenarios with little to no change from the current SOTA.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered at **60%**.
*   **Update:** The hypothetical Claude 4 score of 31% is powerful evidence that my prior is too optimistic. It suggests the "Grand Challenge" reference class (slower, incremental progress) is more relevant than the "Rapid Saturation" class. This evidence dramatically shifts my posterior distribution downwards, with the median moving from 60% into the low 40s.
*   **Counter-Update:** The evidence of intense competition and potential for a "capability overhang" (a lab holding back a powerful model) pushes the distribution back up and, more importantly, fattens the right tail. A breakthrough is still very possible, even if less likely.
*   **Final Posterior:** The resulting posterior is a blend of two main scenarios: 1) No major model is released in time, or the new model is an incremental improvement, leading to a score in the 30-40% range. 2) A true next-generation model (e.g., GPT-5) is released and makes a significant, but not total, leap, achieving a score in the 50-70% range. The short timeframe makes the first scenario more likely. I will therefore place my median at **48%**, reflecting a balance of these possibilities but with a strong skew towards the upside potential.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is highly sensitive to the (unknown) release schedule of OpenAI and Google. A key risk is being too anchored to the hypothetical Claude 4 data point. What if that model was an anomaly and OpenAI's next model is a massive leap forward? The history of AI progress suggests that betting against rapid improvement is often wrong. The competitive pressure is a powerful accelerant. To account for this "capability overhang" or surprise breakthrough scenario, I have ensured my upper percentiles (P80, P90) are quite high, reflecting the possibility of a score in the 60s or low 70s. Conversely, I could be underestimating HLE's difficulty and the short timeline. It's plausible no new credible scores are published, leaving the SOTA at 26.6% or the hypothetical 31%. My lower percentiles (P10, P20) in the low-to-mid 30s account for this possibility. The bimodal nature of the underlying uncertainty (release vs. no release) justifies the wide spread in my final forecast.
