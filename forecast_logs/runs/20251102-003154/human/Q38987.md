### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical precedent for a new presidential administration, particularly one from an opposing party, retaining or repealing the Executive Orders (EOs) of its predecessor?
    *   What are Donald Trump's stated positions and the ideological underpinnings of his likely advisors (e.g., Project 2025) regarding AI regulation and Biden's EO 14110 specifically?
    *   What are the countervailing pressures that might lead a Trump administration to *keep* these specific reporting requirements, even if the rest of the EO is repealed (e.g., national security, industry lobbying)?
    *   What do the provided (hypothetical) sources from 2024 and 2025 indicate has already occurred in this timeline regarding AI policy under a second Trump administration?
    *   How do the specific resolution criteria (three distinct reporting requirements for models >10^26 FLOPs) interact with the likely policy changes? Is a partial retention possible that would still trigger a "No" resolution?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `"presidential executive order repeal by successor"`
    *   `"Trump administration executive orders reversed by Biden"`
    *   `"Donald Trump statements AI regulation executive order"`
    *   `"Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership AI policy"`
    *   `"national security risks dual-use foundation models"`
    *   `"Defense Production Act AI reporting requirements"`
    *   `"US AI industry lobbying regulation"`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The base rate for a new president repealing a predecessor's signature EOs is very high, especially in cases of party turnover. Trump's own statements and the detailed plans from Project 2025 explicitly target Biden's AI EO for repeal.
    *   The primary driver for repeal is a strong deregulatory ideology, a desire to "unleash" American innovation to compete with China, and opposition to perceived "censorship" or "bias" controls.
    *   The main countervailing force is the national security establishment. The reporting requirements are rooted in the Defense Production Act and target "dual-use" models with potential for catastrophic misuse (CBRN, cyberattacks). This is a powerful argument for retention that might appeal to a security-focused administration.
    *   The provided hypothetical sources are crucial. They establish a timeline of events: post-election (Nov 2024) sources correctly predicted a repeal. Mid-2025 sources describe the *replacement* policy: an "AI Action Plan" and new EOs focused on deregulation, competition, and infrastructure.
    *   Critically, the summaries of the new Trump AI Action Plan do *not* mention the continuation of the specific reporting requirements from EO 14110. Their absence in a detailed rollout of a new framework is strong evidence of their cancellation. The resolution criteria are strict; any replacement with slightly different rules would resolve as "No."

4.  **Drafting the Brief:**
    *   The final brief will be structured according to the required format, integrating the synthesized findings. The analysis will conclude that the combination of stated intent, ideological alignment, and the described replacement policy makes it highly probable that the specific reporting requirements are no longer in place.

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Presidential Reversal of Predecessor's Executive Orders:** New presidents, especially from the opposing party, frequently and rapidly reverse the signature executive orders of their predecessors. Trump reversed many of Obama's EOs, and Biden reversed many of Trump's on his first day in office. **Base rate for repeal of a major, partisan EO: 70-90%.** This is the most relevant class, as the AI EO is a signature Biden initiative.
2.  **Regulation of Emerging Dual-Use Technologies:** Technologies with significant national security implications (e.g., nuclear materials, advanced cryptography, biotech) tend to attract durable, often bipartisan, regulatory oversight. Once in place, such regulations are often modified rather than entirely eliminated. **Base rate for complete elimination of national security-motivated reporting: 20-40%.** This class provides the main counterargument to the first.
3.  **Trump Administration's "Day One" Promises:** During his first term and subsequent campaigns, Donald Trump has often made explicit promises about actions to be taken "on day one." While not all were executed literally on the first day, the follow-through rate on core campaign promises, particularly those involving deregulation and reversing opponent's policies, is high. **Base rate for follow-through on a specific deregulatory "Day One" promise: 60-80%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-11-14** Multiple policy analyses (Brookings, Mintz) published post-election predict a new Trump administration will repeal Biden's AI EO to foster innovation and focus on competition with China. (↓) — Matters because it establishes the consensus expert expectation immediately following the election.
*   **2024-07-23** A civil rights analysis of Project 2025 notes the plan explicitly calls for rescinding Biden's AI EO and the AI Bill of Rights. (↓) — Matters because it confirms the ideological blueprint for a Trump administration is hostile to the existing regulations.
*   **2025-07-23** The Trump White House releases its "AI Action Plan" and President Trump signs three related EOs, as reported by multiple outlets (CSET, Mayer Brown). (↓) — Matters because this is the official replacement policy. Its stated focus is on deregulation, competition, and infrastructure, not safety reporting.
*   **2025-07-28** A consumer finance analysis of the new AI Action Plan highlights its focus on deregulation, investment, and prioritizing open-source models. (↓) — Matters because the details of the new plan are inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the Biden-era reporting requirements.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Prerogative & Campaign Promises:** The President can reverse a prior EO with a new one. Trump explicitly promised to "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one." This is a direct, powerful driver. (Size: Large ↓)
2.  **Deregulatory Ideology (Project 2025):** The intellectual and policy infrastructure for a Trump administration (Heritage Foundation, etc.) is strongly committed to deregulation to spur economic growth and competition. The provided sources confirm Project 2025 targets this EO. (Size: Large ↓)
3.  **National Security Concerns:** The reporting requirements are justified under the Defense Production Act and target "dual-use" models that could pose serious security risks (e.g., CBRN weapons, cyberattacks). The national security establishment could successfully argue to retain these specific, narrow requirements even if the rest of the EO is scrapped. (Size: Moderate ↑)
4.  **Focus on China Competition:** The Trump administration's stated goal is to "win the AI race." This is primarily framed as an economic and technological competition, where regulations are seen as a handicap. This driver strongly favors deregulation over safety-oriented reporting. (Size: Large ↓)
5.  **Industry Lobbying:** The AI industry is split. While some smaller players and open-source advocates favor deregulation, larger incumbents (like those who made voluntary commitments to the Biden White House) may not strongly oppose reporting requirements that could act as a barrier to new competitors. However, the overall industry tilt is likely against mandatory government reporting. (Size: Small ↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit National Security Justification:** Unlike many environmental or social policy EOs, this one is explicitly tied to the Defense Production Act and dual-use national security risks, making it potentially "stickier" than a typical partisan EO.
*   **High Technical Specificity:** The resolution criteria are tied to a specific compute threshold (10^26 FLOPs) and three precise reporting requirements. This makes it less likely to be accidentally retained; its removal or retention would be a deliberate choice.
*   **Novelty and Bipartisan Concern:** AI is a new and rapidly evolving policy area. While the approach is partisan, concerns about AI risks are bipartisan, which could create cross-pressures to retain some guardrails, unlike more established partisan battlegrounds.
*   **Existence of a Detailed Replacement Plan:** The provided sources describe a comprehensive "AI Action Plan" being released in July 2025. This is not just a simple repeal, but a full replacement, making it less likely that pieces of the old framework were kept.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior from the reference class of repealing a predecessor's major EO, suggesting a low probability of survival. A prior of **25% YES** (equivalent n=4) seems plausible, acknowledging the countervailing national security arguments.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Trump's explicit "day one" promise to cancel the EO.
    *   (↓ Large) The Project 2025 plan explicitly targets the EO for rescission.
    *   (↓ Large) The July 2025 rollout of a new "AI Action Plan" focused on deregulation and competition, with no mention of retaining the old reporting rules.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The national security rationale (Defense Production Act, dual-use models) provides the only significant pressure to retain the rules.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative. The explicit promise to repeal has been followed by a detailed replacement plan that appears to have omitted the specific reporting requirements. The posterior should move sharply downward from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A statement from the Commerce or Defense Department clarifying that reporting requirements under the DPA remain in effect for national security purposes.
    *   Leaks or reports suggesting a fierce internal debate where the national security council (NSC) successfully advocated for keeping the reporting rules.
    *   Major AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) issuing statements that imply they are still complying with federal reporting requirements.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   An official White House or Commerce Department statement explicitly confirming the rescission of all reporting requirements from EO 14110.
    *   AI companies publicly stating they are no longer subject to the reporting requirements.
    *   The text of Trump's new AI Executive Order (hypothetically EO 14179) being published and containing a section that explicitly revokes EO 14110 in its entirety.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Quiet Retention:** The requirements could be retained but moved into a different, less public directive or regulation, potentially administered by the Department of Defense or the Intelligence Community. This might still satisfy the resolution criteria.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The new administration could have implemented *similar* but not *identical* reporting rules. The resolution criteria are a strict AND-conjunction of three specific points. Any modification would likely cause this to resolve "No."
*   **Information Gaps:** The provided sources are summaries. The full text of the new "AI Action Plan" or the new EOs might contain an annex or a subsection that quietly preserves the reporting requirements, which was missed in the high-level reporting.
*   **Scenario Validity:** This analysis is heavily dependent on the provided hypothetical sources from 2024-2025 being an accurate representation of events in this timeline.

**Final Research Summary:**
Donald Trump's explicit promise to repeal Biden's AI EO, backed by the Project 2025 platform, appears to have been executed via a new "AI Action Plan" in July 2025. This new plan'

To forecast the probability of whether AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place in the US at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for Repeal of Predecessor's EO:** Historically, new presidents, especially from an opposing party, frequently reverse their predecessor's executive orders. The base rate for repealing a major partisan EO is approximately 70-90%. Given that Trump's campaign explicitly targets Biden's AI EO for repeal, this base rate is highly relevant.
- **Base Rate for Retention Due to National Security:** Regulations with national security implications tend to be more durable. The base rate for complete elimination of such reporting requirements is 20-40%.
- **Base Rate for Trump's "Day One" Promises:** Trump's follow-through on specific deregulatory promises is high, with a base rate of 60-80%.

Given these considerations, a reasonable initial prior probability that the reporting requirements will remain in place is around 25%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The situation aligns with the historical pattern of a new president from an opposing party reversing predecessor's EOs, especially when explicitly promised during the campaign.
- **Difference:** The EO in question is tied to national security concerns, which could make it more resistant to repeal compared to other partisan EOs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Trump's Promise to Repeal:** Trump's explicit promise to cancel the EO on day one strongly suggests a high likelihood of repeal. This evidence decreases the probability of the requirements remaining.
- **Project 2025's Deregulatory Focus:** The Project 2025 plan explicitly targets the EO for rescission, further decreasing the probability.
- **Release of AI Action Plan:** The new AI Action Plan focuses on deregulation and competition, with no mention of retaining the old reporting rules, further decreasing the probability.
- **National Security Concerns:** The reporting requirements' basis in national security provides some countervailing pressure to retain them, slightly increasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** 25% (based on the base rate for retention due to national security concerns).
- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - Trump's promise and Project 2025 plan: Strong evidence for repeal (Likelihood ratio < 1).
  - National security concerns: Moderate evidence for retention (Likelihood ratio > 1).

Given the overwhelming evidence for repeal, the posterior probability should be adjusted downward significantly from the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of quiet retention or modification of the requirements that still satisfy the resolution criteria.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where national security concerns lead to retention of similar but not identical requirements could affect the outcome.
- **Rebuttals:** The explicit deregulatory focus and lack of mention of reporting requirements in the new plan strongly suggest repeal.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the strong evidence for repeal and the structured Bayesian update, the final probability that the AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place is low.

Final: 10%

# Probability Assessment: Will AI Foundation Model Reporting Requirements Remain Under Trump?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to assess whether Trump, if elected in 2024, would maintain Biden's AI foundation model reporting requirements through the end of 2025.

The most relevant base rate is the frequency with which incoming presidents from opposing parties retain their predecessor's executive orders. This is typically low, especially for high-profile, partisan EOs.

**Prior probability: 25%**

Justification:
- New presidents, especially from opposing parties, typically reverse signature executive orders of predecessors (70-90% reversal rate)
- Trump specifically reversed many Obama EOs in his first term, and Biden reversed many Trump EOs
- However, national security-related regulations tend to be more durable (20-40% elimination rate)
- The AI reporting requirements are justified under the Defense Production Act with national security implications

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a signature Biden administration policy initiative
- It represents a regulatory approach that typically faces opposition from Republican administrations
- Trump has explicitly promised to cancel this specific EO

**Key differences:**
- The AI reporting requirements have an explicit national security justification (Defense Production Act)
- The requirements target "dual-use" models with potential for catastrophic misuse (CBRN, cyberattacks)
- AI regulation is a newer policy area with some bipartisan concerns about safety
- The resolution criteria are highly specific (three distinct reporting requirements for models >10^26 FLOPs)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit campaign promise**
- Trump stated: "When I'm reelected, I will cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one."
- P(E|H): ~0.3 (If requirements remain, there's a moderate chance Trump would still make this statement for political reasons)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (If requirements will be eliminated, this statement is highly likely)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33 (Strong evidence against retention)

**Evidence 2: Project 2025 explicitly targets Biden's AI EO**
- The policy blueprint for a Trump administration specifically calls for rescinding Biden's AI EO
- P(E|H): ~0.4 (If requirements remain, there's still a decent chance Project 2025 would target the broader EO)
- P(E|~H): ~0.95 (If requirements will be eliminated, Project 2025 would almost certainly target the EO)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.42 (Moderate evidence against retention)

**Evidence 3: National security justification**
- The reporting requirements are justified under the Defense Production Act for national security reasons
- P(E|H): ~0.9 (If requirements remain, they would almost certainly have this justification)
- P(E|~H): ~0.6 (Even if requirements are eliminated, they would still have had this justification)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5 (Weak evidence for retention)

**Evidence 4: Trump's "AI Action Plan" in July 2025**
- The research report indicates Trump released a new AI plan focused on deregulation, competition, and infrastructure
- P(E|H): ~0.3 (If requirements remain, it's unlikely a new plan would omit mentioning them)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (If requirements are eliminated, a new deregulatory plan is highly likely)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33 (Strong evidence against retention)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 25:75 (0.33)

Update with Evidence 1 (Trump's promise):
- Posterior odds = 0.33 × 0.33 = 0.11
- Posterior probability = 0.11 / (1 + 0.11) ≈ 10%

Update with Evidence 2 (Project 2025):
- Posterior odds = 0.11 × 0.42 = 0.046
- Posterior probability = 0.046 / (1 + 0.046) ≈ 4.4%

Update with Evidence 3 (National security justification):
- Posterior odds = 0.046 × 1.5 = 0.069
- Posterior probability = 0.069 / (1 + 0.069) ≈ 6.5%

Update with Evidence 4 (New AI Action Plan):
- Posterior odds = 0.069 × 0.33 = 0.023
- Posterior probability = 0.023 / (1 + 0.023) ≈ 2.2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the influence of the national security establishment in a Trump administration
- The reporting requirements could be retained but moved to a different directive or agency
- The new AI Action Plan might preserve elements of the reporting requirements without explicitly mentioning them
- Industry lobbying from established AI companies might favor keeping some barriers to entry

**Alternative scenario:**
The most plausible alternative is that the national security establishment convinces Trump to retain the reporting requirements specifically for dual-use models with CBRN or cyberattack capabilities, while eliminating other aspects of Biden's EO. This could be framed as protecting America from foreign threats rather than as regulation.

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability slightly upward. The national security argument is the strongest case for retention, and I may have underweighted it. However, the explicit campaign promise and the detailed replacement plan without mention of reporting requirements remain powerful counterevidence.

Adjusted probability: 5%

## 6. Final Forecast

The evidence strongly suggests that Trump would eliminate the AI foundation model reporting requirements if elected. His explicit campaign promise, the Project 2025 blueprint, and the described replacement "AI Action Plan" all point toward elimination. While national security concerns provide some counterweight, they appear insufficient to overcome the strong deregulatory ideology and explicit promises.

Final: 5%

```md

Here is my probabilistic reasoning for the forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is the frequency with which a new US president from an opposing party reverses the signature Executive Orders (EOs) of their predecessor. This happens very frequently. For example, President Biden rescinded many of Trump's EOs on his first day in office, just as Trump had done with many of Obama's. A conservative estimate for the repeal of a major, partisan EO is around 80%.

This implies a base rate of the requirements *remaining* at around 20%. However, this specific EO is justified under the Defense Production Act for national security reasons (preventing misuse of AI for CBRN weapons, cyberattacks, etc.). Regulations tied to national security tend to be "stickier" than those related to domestic or economic policy. This powerful counter-argument suggests we should adjust the initial prior upwards.

Let's set the prior probability P(H) that the requirements will remain in place at **30%**. This balances the high likelihood of political reversal with the significant weight of the national security justification.
*   Prior P(H) = 30% (Requirements remain)
*   Prior Odds = 0.30 / 0.70 ≈ 0.43

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation fits the base case of a party turnover in the White House, with a new president ideologically opposed to the previous administration's regulatory approach. The AI EO is a signature Biden initiative, making it a prime target.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Explicit Promise:** Donald Trump has not just expressed a general deregulatory stance; he has specifically and publicly promised to "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one." This makes repeal more likely than for a generic EO.
    *   **Detailed Replacement Plan:** The provided research describes a comprehensive replacement policy ("AI Action Plan") being implemented in July 2025. This indicates a deliberate "repeal and replace" action, not just a simple repeal or neglect.
    *   **Strict Resolution Criteria:** The question requires three specific reporting rules to remain in place *exactly* as defined. A new administration is highly likely to modify or "rebrand" any retained regulations, which would cause a "No" resolution. This "brittleness" of the criteria strongly disfavors a "Yes" outcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Trump's explicit "day one" promise to cancel the EO.**
    *   P(E | H): The probability of this promise if the rules remain is low. It would require a significant reversal.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of this promise if the rules are removed is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1, significantly decreasing the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Project 2025's plan explicitly targets the EO for rescission.**
    *   P(E | H): The probability that the administration's policy blueprint calls for repeal, yet the rules survive, is very low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability that the blueprint aligns with the eventual action of repeal is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1, further decreasing the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The (hypothetical) July 2025 rollout of a new "AI Action Plan" focused on deregulation, competition, and infrastructure, with no mention of retaining the old reporting rules.**
    *   P(E | H): The probability of this new plan being the public face of the administration's policy while the old, contradictory rules are quietly kept is extremely low. The absence of any mention of their retention in multiple summaries is strong evidence of their absence.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is exactly the type of replacement policy one would expect if the old rules were rescinded.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly less than 1. This is the most powerful piece of evidence.

*   **Evidence 4: The national security justification (Defense Production Act, dual-use models).**
    *   P(E | H): The probability of this strong justification existing if the rules are kept is high. This is the primary reason they would be kept.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of this justification existing even if the rules are removed is moderate. The administration could simply decide the economic benefits of deregulation outweigh the risks.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This is the only piece of evidence that increases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with a **30% prior**, the evidence overwhelmingly points toward repeal.

1.  **Prior:** 30% (Odds ≈ 0.43)
2.  **Update 1 (Trump's Promise & Project 2025):** The explicit, targeted intent to repeal from both the candidate and his policy advisors is powerful. This should dramatically lower the probability, moving it from 30% down to perhaps 10%.
3.  **Update 2 (New AI Action Plan):** The description of the replacement policy is the strongest evidence. It confirms that action was taken, and the new framework's focus on deregulation is antithetical to the old rules. The fact that multiple summaries of this new plan omit any mention of the old reporting requirements makes their survival extremely unlikely. This evidence should push the probability from 10% down into the low single digits, perhaps 2-3%.
4.  **Update 3 (Countervailing Factors):** The national security argument and the possibility of "quiet retention" (where the rules are kept but moved to a different directive) provide the main argument for a "Yes". This prevents the probability from going to near-zero. The strictness of the resolution criteria, however, works against this; any modification during a "quiet retention" would still lead to a "No".

Combining these factors, the posterior probability lands in the low single digits. The immense political and ideological momentum for repeal, confirmed by the description of the replacement policy, is very difficult to overcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is very low. What could make it wrong?

1.  **Quiet Retention:** The most plausible path to a "Yes" is that Trump publicly repeals EO 14110 for a political win, while the national security apparatus persuades him to quietly re-implement the *exact same* reporting requirements under a different authority (e.g., a Commerce Department rule or DoD directive). The provided summaries of the "AI Action Plan" might have missed this nuance.
2.  **Black Swan Event:** A major AI-related security disaster between the election and late 2025 could make AI deregulation politically impossible, forcing the administration to retain all existing guardrails.
3.  **Industry Lobbying:** Large AI labs might successfully lobby to keep the rules, viewing them as a competitive moat against new entrants.

While these scenarios are possible, they run contrary to the administration's stated goals and ideology. The "quiet retention" scenario is the most plausible, but it would have to replicate the rules *perfectly* to meet the resolution criteria. Given these considerations, a small probability is warranted, but it should remain very low.

### 6. Final Forecast

The combination of an extremely high base rate for the repeal of a predecessor's EOs, an explicit promise from Trump to do so, a detailed policy plan (Project 2025) calling for it, and descriptions of a replacement policy that is inconsistent with the old rules provides overwhelming evidence for a "No" resolution. The strictness of the resolution criteria further lowers the probability of a "Yes". The only significant counterforce is the national security argument, which creates a small but non-zero chance of retention. My final probability reflects this small chance.

Final: 5%
