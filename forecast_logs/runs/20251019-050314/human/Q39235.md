### Reference class & base rates
1.  **DRC Ebola Outbreaks, Post-Vaccine Era (2018-2025):** This class includes all 7 known outbreaks in the DRC since the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine became widely available for outbreak response. This is the most relevant class as it reflects modern response capabilities.
    *   **Data:** 7 outbreaks. Deaths: 2280 (Kivu), 55 (Equateur 2020), 6 (N. Kivu 2021), 5 (Equateur 2022), 1 (N. Kivu 2022), 1 (Uganda 2022, linked to DRC), and the current 15+ (Kasai 2025).
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is extremely skewed. The median number of deaths is ~6. The mean is ~336. This bimodality (one catastrophic event, many small ones) is the key feature. The base rate suggests an ~85% chance of an outbreak being contained with <60 deaths, but a ~15% chance of a major crisis with >2000 deaths.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the current technological and political reality of Ebola response in the DRC. Its primary limitation is the small sample size and the overwhelming influence of a single outlier (Kivu).

2.  **Small, Contained DRC Outbreaks (2020-2022):** This class isolates the 4 outbreaks that occurred after the massive Kivu epidemic was brought under control and before the current one. It represents the "new normal" of rapid response.
    *   **Data:** 4 outbreaks. Total deaths: 55, 6, 5, 1.
    *   **Base Rate:** Median deaths: 5.5. Mean deaths: 16.75. The range is very tight (1-55 deaths).
    *   **Reasoning:** This class reflects the expected outcome when the system works as intended: rapid detection, effective ring vaccination, and community cooperation. It is a useful baseline for a "successful containment" scenario. Its limitation is that it excludes the possibility of systemic failure, which is always a risk.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province, DRC. — **↑** — The start of the event. The location is new compared to recent outbreaks in Equateur and North Kivu.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — **↑** — A high number of deaths so early (3 days post-declaration) suggests significant transmission occurred before the official alert, a key risk factor for a larger outbreak.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed of Response & Ring Vaccination:** The single most important factor. Rapid deployment of vaccines to contacts and contacts-of-contacts can halt transmission chains. The effectiveness of this mechanism is a primary determinant of the final scale. (Large impact)
2.  **Community Trust and Acceptance:** Mistrust of health workers and government officials can lead to hiding cases, avoiding contact tracing, and violence against response teams, as seen in the Kivu 2018-20 epidemic. (Large impact)
3.  **Geographic Location & Population Density:** Outbreaks in dense, highly-connected urban areas or regions with major transport hubs are harder to contain than those in remote, rural villages. Kasaï Province has several medium-sized cities. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Security and Political Stability:** Active conflict severely hampers all aspects of an outbreak response, from logistics to contact tracer safety. While Kasaï is not currently an active warzone like Kivu was, it has a history of instability. (Moderate to Large impact)
5.  **Health System Capacity:** The local ability to detect, isolate, and treat patients is crucial. A weak local system increases reliance on a slower international response, allowing the virus to spread further initially. (Moderate impact)
6.  **Cross-border Spread:** The resolution criteria include deaths in other countries linked to this outbreak. Proximity to and traffic across porous borders (e.g., with Angola) could expand the outbreak's scope. (Small to Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Rapid Initial Scale:** The report of 15 deaths just three days after the official declaration is significantly higher than the starting point of the small, contained outbreaks in the 2020-2022 period. This suggests the index case occurred weeks earlier and that initial transmission chains are already well-established.
*   **Novel Location (Kasaï):** Recent outbreaks have been in Equateur and North Kivu, where response teams have recent experience and established relationships. Kasaï is a new front. While not an active conflict zone on the scale of Kivu (2018-20), the region experienced significant violence from 2016-2019, which may have degraded infrastructure and left a legacy of community mistrust.
*   **Established Response System:** Unlike the start of the Kivu epidemic, the DRC, WHO, and partners now have a well-oiled machine for Ebola response, including stockpiled vaccines (rVSV-ZEBOV), proven therapeutics (e.g., Inmazeb, Ebanga), and experienced personnel. This is a major advantage over the pre-2018 era and even the early Kivu response.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026, less than four months from the outbreak's declaration. This short window means that a very long, drawn-out epidemic like Kivu (2 years) is impossible within the resolution timeframe. The final number will be determined by how quickly the initial surge is controlled.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the "Post-Vaccine Era" reference class, heavily skewed towards a low death toll (<60) but with a very long tail to account for a Kivu-like scenario. This could be modeled as a mixture distribution, with ~85% weight on a Gamma(k≈2, θ≈10) and ~15% on a distribution centered in the thousands. Equivalent n of ~7 outbreaks.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** 15 deaths reported almost immediately. This strongly weighs against the "small, contained outbreak" scenario (Ref Class 2) and suggests the outbreak has had a significant head start.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** Location in Kasaï. The lack of recent response experience and history of conflict introduces uncertainty and risk compared to recent outbreaks in Equateur/Kivu.
    *   **↓ Large:** Existence of a mature, rapid-response system with vaccines and therapeutics. This is a powerful brake on exponential growth and dramatically lowers the probability of the "catastrophic tail" scenario.
    *   **↓ Small:** Short time horizon to resolution (<3 months remaining). This truncates the worst-case scenarios, as an epidemic of thousands takes longer than this to unfold.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the posterior away from the median of the "small outbreaks" class (5-10 deaths). The initial spread is a significant negative update. However, the powerful modern response capabilities cap the upside risk. The posterior should shift significantly upward from the low-tens into the low-to-mid hundreds (e.g., 75-250 deaths), while the probability of a >1000 death event should be revised downwards from the base rate due to the response system and short timeline.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in major provincial cities (e.g., Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi).
    *   Any confirmed case exported to another DRC province or a neighboring country (especially Angola).
    *   Reports of violence against healthcare workers or response teams.
    *   Weekly case growth rate remaining positive two weeks from now (i.e., after Oct 2025).
    *   Genetic sequencing showing a particularly transmissible or novel variant.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   WHO/DRC MoH reports of high ring vaccination coverage (>80%) around known cases.
    *   A consistent week-over-week decline in the number of new confirmed cases.
    *   No new cases reported outside the initial health zone for 14 consecutive days.
    *   Reports of strong community leader engagement and cooperation with response teams.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Reliability:** Official figures from the DRC Ministère de la Santé can be delayed or revised. The true number of cases/deaths may be higher than reported due to limited surveillance.
*   **Definitional Risk:** The resolution specifies deaths "attributed to" the outbreak. This can be ambiguous, especially for suspected cases that are never confirmed by a lab.
*   **Political Instability:** The DRC is politically volatile. A separate political or security crisis could erupt, diverting resources and attention away from the Ebola response, dramatically changing the outlook.
*   **Short Horizon Variance:** Forecasting a precise number over a short, dynamic period is highly uncertain. The outcome is sensitive to a few key events in the next 2-4 weeks (e.g., a single superspreader event).
*   **Concurrent Crises:** The global health system could be strained by other events, slowing the deployment of international support to the DRC.

**Final Research Summary:** The outbreak's rapid start with 15 deaths makes a very low final toll (<50) unlikely. However, a robust and experienced international response system with vaccines should prevent a catastrophic repeat of the 2018-20 Kivu epidemic, suggesting a final death toll most likely in the low-to-mid hundreds by the end of 2025.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class:** DRC Ebola Outbreaks, Post-Vaccine Era (2018-2025).
   - **Reasoning:** This class reflects the current technological and political reality of Ebola response in the DRC, including the availability of vaccines and therapeutics.
   - **Base Rate:** Median deaths ~6, Mean deaths ~336, with a bimodal distribution indicating a high likelihood of containment but a non-negligible risk of a major outbreak.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, where the response system is established, and vaccines are available.
   - **Differences:** The rapid initial spread with 15 deaths reported quickly suggests a more significant initial transmission than typical for small, contained outbreaks.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **↑ Large:** 15 deaths reported almost immediately suggest a significant head start for the virus.
   - **↑ Moderate:** The location in Kasaï, a new area for recent outbreaks, introduces uncertainty.
   - **↓ Large:** The existence of a mature response system with vaccines and therapeutics reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic scenario.
   - **↓ Small:** The short time horizon to resolution limits the potential for a very large outbreak.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Skewed towards low deaths with a long tail for catastrophic events.
   - **Evidence Impact:** The rapid initial spread increases the likelihood of a larger outbreak, but the strong response system caps the upside risk.
   - **Posterior Shift:** The distribution shifts upward from the low-tens into the low-to-mid hundreds, with reduced probability for >1000 deaths.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of underestimating the impact of initial rapid spread and geographic challenges.
   - **Tail Risks:** A political or security crisis could divert resources, increasing the risk of a larger outbreak.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where the outbreak is contained quickly due to effective vaccination and community cooperation, resulting in fewer deaths.
   - **Adjustment:** Ensure the forecast accounts for both the rapid initial spread and the strong response system.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - **Calibrated Percentiles:** Reflect the updated posterior distribution with consideration for tail risks and response capabilities.

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference distributions to inform my prior:

**Primary Reference Class**: Post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2018-2025)
- 7 outbreaks with death tolls: 2280, 55, 6, 5, 1, 1, and 15+ (current)
- Highly skewed distribution with median ≈ 6 deaths, mean ≈ 336 deaths
- This captures the bimodal nature of modern Ebola outbreaks: most are quickly contained (<60 deaths), but occasionally one becomes catastrophic (>2000 deaths)

**Secondary Reference Class**: Recent contained DRC outbreaks (2020-2022)
- 4 outbreaks with death tolls: 55, 6, 5, 1
- Median ≈ 5.5 deaths, mean ≈ 16.75 deaths
- Represents the "successful containment" scenario with modern response systems

For my prior, I'll use a mixture distribution that gives 85% weight to small outbreaks (5-60 deaths) and 15% weight to potentially large outbreaks (hundreds to low thousands), with a median around 20 deaths and a long right tail.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class**:
- Same disease (Ebola virus) with similar transmission mechanisms
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure challenges
- Same international response framework with vaccine availability

**Key differences**:
- **Higher initial death count**: 15 deaths reported just 3 days after declaration suggests significant pre-detection spread, unlike most recent small outbreaks
- **Novel location**: Kasaï Province lacks recent Ebola response experience compared to Equateur/Kivu regions
- **Short time horizon**: Resolution by January 2026 gives only ~3.5 months for the outbreak to unfold, limiting the potential for a multi-year epidemic like Kivu
- **Improved response systems**: More mature response capabilities exist now compared to 2018, including stockpiled vaccines and established protocols

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward**:
- 15 deaths already reported by September 7th suggests significant undetected transmission before official declaration. This makes the likelihood of a small outbreak (<50 deaths) approximately 0.3× as likely as in the base rate.
- Novel location (Kasaï) without recent Ebola response experience increases uncertainty and risk of delayed containment, making larger outbreaks about 1.5× more likely than the base rate.
- 32 cases reported immediately suggests multiple transmission chains already established, making medium-sized outbreaks (100-500 deaths) about 2× more likely than in the base rate.

**Evidence pushing forecast downward**:
- Mature international response system with vaccines and therapeutics makes catastrophic outcomes (>1000 deaths) about 0.5× as likely as in the base rate.
- Short time horizon (resolution by January 2026) physically limits how large the outbreak can grow, making very large death tolls (>2000) about 0.3× as likely as in the base rate.
- No reported spread to major cities or across borders yet, keeping the likelihood of small-to-medium outcomes (50-200 deaths) consistent with the base rate.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 20 deaths (median) but with a long tail:
- The 15 deaths already reported shifts the distribution significantly upward
- P(deaths < 50 | 15 deaths in first report) ≈ 0.3 × P(deaths < 50 | prior)
- P(deaths 100-500 | 32 cases in first report) ≈ 2 × P(deaths 100-500 | prior)
- P(deaths > 1000 | modern response systems) ≈ 0.5 × P(deaths > 1000 | prior)

This updating process shifts my posterior distribution to have:
- A median around 150-200 deaths (up from 20)
- Reduced probability mass in the <50 deaths range
- Increased probability in the 100-500 deaths range
- Slightly reduced probability in the extreme tail (>1000)

The posterior distribution is still right-skewed but less bimodal than the prior, with most of the probability mass now in the 50-500 deaths range.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the effectiveness of modern response systems. The Kivu outbreak (2280 deaths) occurred in an active conflict zone, which Kasaï is not.
- I might be overreacting to the initial 15 deaths. Early reports are often revised, and the true count could be lower.
- The short time horizon could limit the death toll more severely than I've accounted for.

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Rapid containment scenario**: If international response is deployed immediately with high community acceptance, deaths could plateau at 30-50 total.
- **Urban spread scenario**: If cases reach major cities like Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi, we could see 500+ deaths despite the short timeline.
- **Cross-border scenario**: Spread to Angola could significantly increase the death toll and complicate containment efforts.

**Adjustments**:
- I'll widen my uncertainty bands to account for these scenarios
- I'll slightly reduce my upper percentiles (P80, P90) to account for the time constraint
- I'll ensure my P10 is above the current death toll (15)

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the set of all Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the post-vaccine era, from 2018 to the present. This reference class includes 7 outbreaks and is the most relevant because it reflects the modern reality of Ebola response, which includes the availability of the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and established international response protocols.

This distribution is extremely bimodal and right-skewed:
*   **Data Points (Deaths):** 2280 (Kivu 2018-20), 55 (Equateur 2020), 6 (N. Kivu 2021), 5 (Equateur 2022), 1 (N. Kivu 2022), 1 (Uganda 2022, linked), and the current 15+.
*   **Median:** ~6 deaths.
*   **Mean:** ~336 deaths.
*   **Interpretation:** This prior suggests there is a high probability (~85%) of an outbreak being small and contained (<60 deaths), but a small but significant probability (~15%) of it becoming a catastrophic event with thousands of deaths. This bimodal shape—either small or huge—is the key feature of my prior distribution.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, a country with extensive (if challenging) experience with Ebola. The response will involve the same key actors (DRC MoH, WHO, etc.) and the same technological tools (vaccines, therapeutics) that characterize the post-2018 reference class.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Rapid Initial Scale:** The report of 32 cases and 15 deaths just three days after the official declaration is a major negative indicator. It strongly suggests the virus was spreading undetected for several weeks, allowing multiple transmission chains to become established. This is a significant departure from the smaller outbreaks in the reference class, which were typically detected earlier in their lifecycle.
    2.  **Novel Location:** Recent outbreaks were in Equateur and North Kivu, where response teams had recent experience and established community contacts. The current outbreak is in Kasaï Province. While not an active conflict zone like Kivu was, its history of instability and lack of recent Ebola response experience are risk factors for delays and community mistrust.
    3.  **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves on January 1, 2026, less than four months after the outbreak's declaration. This is a critical difference. The catastrophic Kivu outbreak took two years to accumulate its death toll. A four-month window makes a multi-thousand death toll extremely unlikely, effectively truncating the upper tail of the base rate distribution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1.  **Evidence: 15 deaths by Sep 7.** This is a strong update upwards. It makes the "small, contained" scenario (final toll < 50) much less likely. An outbreak that has already reached this scale before being fully addressed is far more likely to end up in the hundreds than in the dozens. This evidence significantly shifts probability mass from the <50 range to the 100-500 range.
2.  **Evidence: Location in Kasaï.** This is a moderate update upwards. The lack of recent experience and potential for mistrust increases the probability of response failures compared to a repeat outbreak in a more familiar province like Equateur.
3.  **Evidence: Mature Response System (Vaccines/Therapeutics).** This is a very strong update downwards, specifically targeting the extreme upper tail of the prior. The existence of a well-oiled response mechanism with vaccine stockpiles acts as a powerful brake on exponential growth. This dramatically lowers the probability of a Kivu-scale (>2000 deaths) disaster.
4.  **Evidence: Short Time Horizon (<4 months).** This is also a strong update downwards on the upper tail. Ebola epidemics take time to kill thousands. This short window makes a final toll above 1000 deaths almost impossible, and a toll above 500 highly improbable.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A bimodal distribution with most mass on a very low number (<60) and a small amount of mass on a very high number (>2000).
*   **Update:**
    1.  The initial evidence of 15 deaths immediately pushes the distribution's center of mass upwards. The 85% chance of a small outbreak is revised down sharply. The outbreak has already surpassed the median of the reference class.
    2.  The combination of a mature response system and the short time horizon acts to "crush" the long upper tail of the prior. The ~15% chance of a Kivu-like event is revised down to a near-zero probability for the given timeframe.
*   **Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution is no longer bimodal. It is a unimodal, right-skewed distribution. The initial bad news has pushed the median up from ~6 into the low hundreds. The constraints on the upside have pulled the mean down from ~336. The new distribution is centered on a scenario of a serious, difficult-to-control outbreak, significantly worse than the small outbreaks of 2020-2022, but not a national catastrophe on the scale of Kivu. My median estimate is now around 120 deaths.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast could be wrong in two main ways:
1.  **Overly Optimistic (Too Low):** I might be overestimating the effectiveness of the response system in a new context. The Kasaï region experienced the Kamuina Nsapu rebellion from 2016-2019, which could have created deep-seated mistrust of authorities. If response teams are met with resistance, as they were in Kivu, ring vaccination could fail and the outbreak could spiral much faster than anticipated, potentially reaching 400-500 deaths even within the short timeframe.
2.  **Overly Pessimistic (Too High):** I might be overreacting to the high initial numbers. It's possible that these cases are all concentrated in a single, easily isolated cluster. The modern response system, once fully deployed, might be so effective that it contains the outbreak with surprising speed, keeping the final death toll below 100. The 2020 Equateur outbreak reached 130 cases and 55 deaths before being stopped, which could be a model for this scenario.

My final distribution attempts to balance these risks. The median of 120 reflects the seriousness of the initial spread, while the wide P10-P90 range (45 to 400) acknowledges both the potential for a surprisingly effective containment and the significant risk of a much larger crisis driven by operational failures.
