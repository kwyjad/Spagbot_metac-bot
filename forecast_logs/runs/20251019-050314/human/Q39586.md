### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: Virginia Gubernatorial Election Analysis:**
    *   What is the historical base rate for the party of the sitting U.S. President winning the Virginia governorship? How strong is this "opposite party" trend?
    *   What are the profiles of the candidates, Abigail Spanberger (D) and Winsome Earle-Sears (R)? Do their specific characteristics suggest a potential break from the historical trend?
    *   What is the current political landscape in Virginia, and what does the (limited) available polling suggest?

*   **Q2: New Jersey Gubernatorial Election Analysis:**
    *   What is the historical base rate for Democrats winning the New Jersey governorship in the modern era? How competitive have these races been?
    *   What are the profiles of the candidates, Mikie Sherrill (D) and Jack Ciattarelli (R)? How does Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 affect the calculus for 2025?
    *   What does recent polling and other electoral data (e.g., 2023 legislative elections) indicate about the state of the race?

*   **Q3: National Context and Interdependencies:**
    *   What is the likely national political environment in November 2025? (This requires an assumption about the 2024 presidential election outcome).
    *   How does the national environment (e.g., presidential approval, key national issues) typically influence these off-year gubernatorial races?
    *   Are the outcomes of the two races correlated, or are they driven by independent, state-specific factors?

**2. Proposed Search Queries (Internal & External):**

*   **Q1 (VA):**
    *   `"Virginia gubernatorial election results by year"`
    *   `"Virginia governor election vs presidential party"`
    *   `"Abigail Spanberger political positions"` and `"Winsome Earle-Sears political positions"`
    *   `"2025 Virginia governor poll"` (to confirm the background claim and check for new data)
    *   `"Virginia political trends 2022 2024"`

*   **Q2 (NJ):**
    *   `"New Jersey gubernatorial election results by year"`
    *   `"Jack Ciattarelli 2021 election performance analysis"`
    *   `"Mikie Sherrill congressional district results"`
    *   `"2025 New Jersey governor poll Emerson Quinnipiac FDU"` (to analyze the provided sources)
    *   `"New Jersey legislative election results 2023"`

*   **Q3 (National):**
    *   `"off-year election trends gubernatorial"`
    *   `"presidential approval rating impact on midterm governor races"`
    *   `"political forecast 2025 national environment"`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Virginia:** The "opposite party" trend is the single most dominant factor. Since 1977, the party holding the White House has lost the Virginia governorship in 11 of 12 elections. Assuming a Democratic president was elected in 2024 (as implied by the prompt's framing), this creates a massive headwind for Spanberger. Her profile as a moderate former CIA officer who has won competitive congressional races is a strong counterpoint, but bucking a trend this powerful is a high bar. The background mentions favorable polling for her, but the provided sources lack any specific VA polls, making this claim unsubstantiated within the provided data.
*   **New Jersey:** The state has a strong Democratic lean, but gubernatorial races are often competitive. Republicans won in 2009 and 2013. Ciattarelli's 3-point loss in 2021 demonstrates his viability as a candidate and a potentially durable GOP coalition. However, the provided 2025 polling, while mixed, shows a slight but consistent lead for Sherrill on average (Quinnipiac: D+6, FDU: D+7, Emerson: Tie). The 2023 legislative results, where Democrats held and expanded their majority, also suggest underlying party strength.
*   **National Context:** The election occurs in the first off-year of a new presidential term. This is typically a challenging environment for the President's party. A low presidential approval rating would be a significant drag on both Democratic candidates, while a high one might help Sherrill and give Spanberger a fighting chance to break the Virginia trend.
*   **Combined Outcome:** The evidence points towards two very different races. The Virginia race is defined by a powerful historical trend favoring the GOP. The New Jersey race is defined by state-level partisan lean and current polling, which favor the Democrats. A split decision appears to be the most likely scenario.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

### **Research Brief: 2025 VA & NJ Gubernatorial Elections**

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia "President's Party" Curse:** Since the 1977 election, the party holding the U.S. Presidency has lost the Virginia gubernatorial election in 11 out of 12 contests. The only exception was in 2013 (Democrat Terry McAuliffe winning under President Obama). Assuming a Democrat wins the 2024 presidential election, this reference class gives Democrats a base rate of **~8% (1/12)**. This is a powerful, historically consistent pattern.
*   **New Jersey Modern Gubernatorial Races:** In the six gubernatorial elections since 2001, Democrats have won four times (2001, 2005, 2017, 2021) and Republicans twice (2009, 2013). This suggests a Democratic base rate of **~67% (4/6)**. However, the 2021 race was decided by only 3.2 points and the 2009 race by 4.3 points, indicating these contests are often competitive despite the state's blue lean.
*   **Combined Off-Year Outcomes:** In the last three cycles with both races on the ballot (2013, 2017, 2021), the outcome has been a split decision twice (2013: D-VA, R-NJ; 2021: R-VA, D-NJ) and a Democratic sweep once (2017). A split decision is a common outcome.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-17] Obama endorses Sherrill (NJ) — ↑ for "Only NJ" / "Both" — High-profile endorsement helps consolidate the Democratic base and drive turnout in a competitive race.
*   [2025-10-15] Quinnipiac & FDU polls show Sherrill with 6-7 point lead (NJ) — ↑ for "Only NJ" / "Both" — Two polls from reputable sources showing a consistent, albeit not commanding, lead for the Democrat late in the race.
*   [2025-09-25] Emerson poll shows Sherrill-Ciattarelli tied (NJ) — ↓ for "Only NJ" / "Both" — Indicates the New Jersey race remains highly competitive and a Democratic win is not assured.
*   [2025-06-18] Spanberger (VA) emphasizes ex-CIA bio — ↔ — Standard campaign messaging. Matters for candidate quality assessment but doesn't shift probabilities on its own without polling data.
*   [2023-11-08] Democrats retain and expand NJ legislative majority — ↑ for "Only NJ" / "Both" — Suggests underlying Democratic party strength and organizational capacity in the state, countering the narrative of a 2021-style GOP surge.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **National Political Environment:** The approval rating of the sitting U.S. President will be a primary driver. A low rating creates a strong headwind for the President's party. (Size: Large)
*   **Virginia's "Anti-White House" Electorate:** A behavioral pattern where Virginia voters use the off-year gubernatorial election to register dissatisfaction with the party in power nationally.

To forecast the outcomes of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections for the Democrats, we'll apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections**: Historically, a split decision is common in off-year elections with both states voting. However, Democrats have won both races in some cycles, such as 2017. Given the historical context and current polling, a base rate of around 20% seems reasonable.
  
- **Only Virginia**: The historical trend in Virginia strongly favors the party opposite the sitting U.S. President. Assuming a Democratic president, the base rate for Democrats winning is low, around 8% (1/12 based on historical trends).

- **Only New Jersey**: Democrats have a stronger base rate in New Jersey, winning 4 out of the last 6 gubernatorial races. Given current polling showing a slight Democratic lead, a base rate of around 60% is reasonable.

- **Neither election**: Considering the historical trend in Virginia and the competitiveness in New Jersey, the base rate for this scenario is around 12%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Both elections**: Current polling shows Democrats leading in both states, but Virginia's historical trend is a significant barrier. The situation is similar to 2017, but the historical trend in Virginia makes this less likely.

- **Only Virginia**: This scenario is less likely due to the strong historical trend against the President's party in Virginia.

- **Only New Jersey**: This aligns well with historical trends and current polling, making it a plausible scenario.

- **Neither election**: While possible, the current polling in New Jersey makes this less likely than a split decision.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia**: Spanberger is up in the polls, but the historical trend is a strong counterpoint. The likelihood of Democrats winning given the historical trend is low.

- **New Jersey**: Polls show Sherrill leading, and Democrats have a strong organizational presence. The likelihood of a Democratic win is higher here.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Only New Jersey**: Starting with a base rate of 60%, the consistent polling lead for Sherrill increases this probability. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 1.2 (slight lead), the posterior probability increases to around 72%.

- **Both elections**: Starting with a base rate of 20%, the polling lead in Virginia slightly increases this probability, but the historical trend limits the increase. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 1.1, the posterior probability is around 22%.

- **Only Virginia**: Starting with a base rate of 8%, the historical trend strongly limits any increase. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 0.9, the posterior probability is around 7%.

- **Neither election**: Starting with a base rate of 12%, the polling in New Jersey decreases this probability. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 0.8, the posterior probability is around 10%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The historical trend in Virginia is strong, but polling should not be ignored. Adjust probabilities slightly to account for potential polling errors or shifts in voter sentiment.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the impact of national events or shifts in voter turnout, especially in New Jersey. Adjust probabilities to reflect these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- Both elections: 22%
- Only Virginia: 7%
- Only New Jersey: 72%
- Neither election: 10%

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 22%  
Only Virginia: 7%  
Only New Jersey: 61%  
Neither election: 10%  

(Note: Adjusted "Only New Jersey" to ensure total sums to 100%.)

# Analysis of 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical base rate: Since 1977, the party opposite the White House has won the Virginia governorship in 11 of 12 elections (92%).
- Assuming a Democratic president in 2024-2025, this gives Republicans a ~92% chance and Democrats ~8%.
- This is an extremely strong historical pattern that has persisted across different eras and candidates.

**New Jersey:**
- Historical base rate: Democrats have won 4 of the last 6 gubernatorial elections (67%).
- New Jersey is generally considered a blue state in national elections, though gubernatorial races are more competitive.
- The 2021 race was very close (3.2 point margin), showing Republican competitiveness.

**Combined outcomes:**
- Both Democratic: ~5% (8% × 67%)
- Only Virginia Democratic: ~3% (8% × 33%)
- Only New Jersey Democratic: ~62% (92% × 67%)
- Neither Democratic: ~30% (92% × 33%)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Virginia's pattern of electing governors from the opposite party of the White House remains structurally intact.
- New Jersey continues to lean Democratic but remains competitive in statewide races.
- Both races are occurring in an off-year election, which typically has lower turnout.

**Differences from base case:**
- Candidate quality: Spanberger (VA-D) is a moderate former CIA officer who has won competitive congressional races, potentially stronger than typical Democratic candidates.
- Polling: Current polling shows Spanberger leading in Virginia, which contradicts the historical pattern.
- In New Jersey, Ciattarelli (R) nearly won in 2021 and has maintained name recognition and campaign infrastructure.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia evidence:**
- The background mentions Spanberger is "up in the polls" but specific polling data isn't provided.
- P(Polls favor Spanberger | Dems win VA) = High (~90%)
- P(Polls favor Spanberger | Dems lose VA) = Low (~20%)
- The historical "opposite party" pattern is extremely strong, suggesting:
- P(Historical pattern continues | Dems lose VA) = High (~90%)
- P(Historical pattern continues | Dems win VA) = Low (~10%)

**New Jersey evidence:**
- Multiple polls show Sherrill leading (Quinnipiac: D+6, FDU: D+7, Emerson: Tie)
- P(These poll results | Dems win NJ) = Moderate-High (~75%)
- P(These poll results | Dems lose NJ) = Low (~25%)
- Democrats retained and expanded their legislative majority in 2023
- P(Dem legislative success | Dems win NJ) = Moderate (~65%)
- P(Dem legislative success | Dems lose NJ) = Moderate (~45%)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia update:**
Starting with prior of 8% for Democratic win based on historical pattern.

For polling evidence:
- Likelihood ratio = P(Polls favor Spanberger | Dems win VA) / P(Polls favor Spanberger | Dems lose VA)
- Likelihood ratio = 90% / 20% = 4.5
- Prior odds = 8% / 92% = 0.087
- Posterior odds = 0.087 × 4.5 = 0.39
- Posterior probability = 0.39 / (1 + 0.39) = 28%

This suggests polling evidence increases Democratic chances in Virginia from 8% to 28%, but the historical pattern still favors Republicans.

**New Jersey update:**
Starting with prior of 67% for Democratic win.

For polling evidence:
- Likelihood ratio = P(These poll results | Dems win NJ) / P(These poll results | Dems lose NJ)
- Likelihood ratio = 75% / 25% = 3
- Prior odds = 67% / 33% = 2.03
- Posterior odds = 2.03 × 3 = 6.09
- Posterior probability = 6.09 / (1 + 6.09) = 86%

This suggests polling evidence increases Democratic chances in New Jersey from 67% to 86%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- We don't have specific Virginia polling data, only a general statement that Spanberger is "up in the polls."
- The historical Virginia pattern could be weakening as the state has trended more Democratic in recent years.
- National environment in 2025 could be unusually favorable/unfavorable to one party.
- Candidate-specific factors might matter more than historical patterns.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- If the 2024 presidential election produces a Republican president, the Virginia historical pattern would favor Democrats.
- A major scandal or unexpected event could dramatically shift either race.
- Turnout patterns in off-year elections can be unpredictable and decisive.

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce confidence in the New Jersey outcome given Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance.
- Slightly increase Virginia Democratic chances given Spanberger's candidate quality.

## 6. Final Normalization

After Bayesian updating and red team considerations:
- Both Democratic: 28% × 80% = 22.4%
- Only Virginia Democratic: 28% × 20% = 5.6%
- Only New Jersey Democratic: 72% × 80% = 57.6%
- Neither Democratic: 72% × 20% = 14.4%

Normalizing to ensure sum is 100%:
- Both Democratic: 22.4% → 22%
- Only Virginia Democratic: 5.6% → 6%
- Only New Jersey Democratic: 57.6% → 58%
- Neither Democratic: 14.4% → 14%

## 7. Output Format

Both elections: 22%
Only Virginia: 6%
Only New Jersey: 58%
Neither election: 14%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

First, I will analyze each race independently to establish a prior probability of a Democratic win.

*   **Virginia:** The dominant feature of Virginia gubernatorial elections is the "President's Party Curse." Since 1977, the party holding the White House has lost the Virginia governorship in 11 of 12 contests. The prompt assumes a Democrat is in the White House. This provides a very strong reference class.
    *   **Prior P(Democrat wins VA):** 1/12 ≈ 8%. This is a strong prior against the Democrats.

*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey is a reliably Democratic state (Cook PVI D+6). In the last six gubernatorial elections (since 2001), Democrats have won four times.
    *   **Prior P(Democrat wins NJ):** 4/6 ≈ 67%. This is a moderately strong prior in favor of the Democrats.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Virginia:** The current case is very similar to the base rate scenario—an off-year election acting as a referendum on the president. A key difference is the Democratic candidate, Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer with a record of winning in competitive districts. Her strength as a candidate may allow her to outperform the base rate. However, the 2021 election, where a strong Democratic candidate (Terry McAuliffe) lost, confirmed the trend's modern-day power.
*   **New Jersey:** The base case is a Democrat-favored race. The key difference is the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, who is not a generic Republican. He significantly overperformed in 2021, losing by only 3.2 points. His proven ability to compete makes this race tighter than the base rate suggests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the priors for each race based on the evidence.

*   **Virginia:**
    *   **Evidence:** Abigail Spanberger's strong candidate profile.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** A strong, moderate candidate is more likely to break the historical trend than a generic one. This evidence pushes the probability of a Democratic win up from the very low 8% base rate.
    *   **Update:** I will update the probability of a Democratic win in Virginia from a stark 8% to a more plausible but still underdog **25%**. This acknowledges Spanberger's strength while still heavily respecting the powerful historical trend. So, P(D win VA) = 25%.

*   **New Jersey:**
    *   **Evidence 1:** Jack Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance. This is evidence that the race is more competitive than the base rate suggests, pushing the probability down from 67%.
    *   **Evidence 2:** Recent polling (average D+4 lead) and strong Democratic performance in the 2023 legislative elections. This is evidence of underlying Democratic strength, pushing the probability back up.
    *   **Update:** These factors largely balance out. Ciattarelli's strength is countered by Sherrill's polling lead and the state's fundamentals. I will slightly downgrade the Democratic chances from the 67% base rate to account for Ciattarelli's proven competitiveness and the potential for an unfavorable national environment. I assess the probability of a Democratic win in New Jersey at **60%**. So, P(D win NJ) = 60%.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Now I will combine the individual race probabilities to find the probabilities for the four options. Initially, I will assume independence.

*   P(D win VA) = 0.25
*   P(D win NJ) = 0.60

*   **P(Both elections):** P(D win VA) * P(D win NJ) = 0.25 * 0.60 = 15%
*   **P(Only Virginia):** P(D win VA) * P(R win NJ) = 0.25 * 0.40 = 10%
*   **P(Only New Jersey):** P(R win VA) * P(D win NJ) = 0.75 * 0.60 = 45%
*   **P(Neither election):** P(R win VA) * P(R win NJ) = 0.75 * 0.40 = 30%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

The initial calculation assumes the races are independent, which is incorrect. Both are influenced by the national political environment (e.g., the President's approval rating). A bad environment for Democrats will hurt both candidates, while a good one will help both. This correlation increases the likelihood of the "sweep" outcomes (Both, Neither) and decreases the likelihood of the "split" outcomes (Only VA, Only NJ).

Historically, the president's party faces headwinds in these elections. Therefore, a pro-Republican national environment is more likely than a pro-Democratic one. This suggests the "Neither" outcome is more probable than the "Both" outcome.

I will model this by assuming a 60% chance of a pro-GOP environment and a 40% chance of a neutral/pro-Democrat environment, and then average the results.

*   **If Pro-GOP Env (60% chance):** P(D win VA) drops to ~10%, P(D win NJ) drops to ~40%. This yields P(Neither) = 54%.
*   **If Pro-DEM Env (40% chance):** P(D win VA) rises to ~40%, P(D win NJ) rises to ~80%. This yields P(Only NJ) = 48%, P(Both) = 32%.

Weighting these scenarios (0.6 * Pro-GOP outcomes + 0.4 * Pro-DEM outcomes) gives a more robust forecast:
*   **Both:** (0.6 * 4%) + (0.4 * 32%) ≈ 15%
*   **Only Virginia:** (0.6 * 6%) + (0.4 * 8%) ≈ 7%
*   **Only New Jersey:** (0.6 * 36%) + (0.4 * 48%) ≈ 41%
*   **Neither:** (0.6 * 54%) + (0.4 * 12%) ≈ 37%

This distribution correctly identifies "Only New Jersey" as the most likely outcome (as it follows both the VA trend and the NJ partisan lean), but makes "Neither" a very close second, reflecting the high probability of a difficult national environment for the president's party.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities from the scenario model sum to 100% (15 + 7 + 41 + 37 = 100). The final forecast is based on this adjusted distribution.

Both elections: 15%
Only Virginia: 7%
Only New Jersey: 41%
Neither election: 37%
