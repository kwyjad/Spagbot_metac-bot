### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Cases with Unanimous Lower Court Rulings on Statutory Interpretation:** When multiple lower courts, particularly circuit courts, have ruled unanimously on the same side of a statutory question, the Supreme Court often affirms that judgment. In this scenario, two different appellate paths (*V.O.S.* in the Federal Circuit, *Learning Resources* in the D.C. Circuit, though not yet ruled upon) and their respective lower courts have all found the tariffs unlawful, albeit for slightly different reasons.
    *   **Base Rate:** The Supreme Court affirms the lower court judgment in such cases roughly 65-75% of the time. This class suggests a high probability of an "Unlawful" ruling.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a case of first impression with immense political and economic stakes, which can make it an outlier. The 7-4 split in the Federal Circuit, while a clear majority, was not unanimous, slightly weakening this base rate.

2.  **Major Questions Doctrine Cases:** This doctrine holds that for issues of vast economic and political significance, an executive agency (or the President) must have clear, explicit authorization from Congress to act. The unilateral imposition of tariffs on nearly all U.S. imports fits this description perfectly. In recent major cases where this doctrine was invoked (*West Virginia v. EPA*, the vaccine mandate case *NFIB v. OSHA*), the executive branch lost.
    *   **Base Rate:** In the Roberts Court era, when the Major Questions Doctrine is central to a case, the government's assertion of authority has been struck down over 80% of the time. This strongly favors an "Unlawful" ruling.
    *   **Limitations:** The doctrine is still evolving, and its application to presidential action under a national security statute like IEEPA (as opposed to a domestic regulatory agency) is less established, though the logic applies forcefully.

3.  **Supreme Court Cases on Presidential Power vs. Congressional Authority:** Cases that pit a broad assertion of presidential power against a core constitutional power of Congress (like the power to tax and regulate commerce) often result in the Court siding with Congress, especially when the President's statutory authority is ambiguous. See *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*.
    *   **Base Rate:** When the President acts in a "zone of twilight" where authority is concurrent or uncertain, and particularly when the action seems to contradict the will or usurp the primary role of Congress, the President's action is invalidated more than 60% of the time.
    *   **Limitations:** IEEPA grants broad, explicit emergency powers, potentially moving this out of the "twilight" zone for some justices, though the unprecedented *use* of that power for tariffs remains the key issue.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms tariffs are unlawful (7-4 vote) ↓ — A major appellate court confirmed the core legal argument against the tariffs, creating a strong presumption for the Supreme Court to affirm.
*   **2025-09-03** Government petitions for Supreme Court review ↓ — While expected, this action officially places the fate of the tariffs in the hands of a Court skeptical of executive overreach.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari on an expedited schedule ↓ — The Court's urgency signals it sees this as a major question of separation of powers, a framework that strongly disfavors the government's position.
*   **2025-10-06** Cato Institute commentary argues against tariffs ↓ — Reflects the broad consensus among libertarian-conservative legal thinkers (influential with the Court's majority) that this is executive overreach.
*   **2025-10-16** Report that Trump may attend oral arguments (Neutral/Slight ↓) — Political pressure tactic that is unlikely to sway the justices and may backfire by being perceived as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (Large ↓):** The Court's conservative majority has consistently used this doctrine to curb executive authority on major policy issues not explicitly authorized by Congress. Imposing a 27% average tariff is a textbook "major question."
2.  **Textualism/Statutory Interpretation (Large ↓):** The core legal question is whether IEEPA's authority to "regulate... any... importation" includes the power to impose tariffs (a tax). Textualists on the Court are likely to distinguish between "regulating" and "taxing," with the latter being a core power of Congress under Article I.
3.  **Separation of Powers (Large ↓):** The case presents a stark conflict between Article II (Executive) and Article I (Legislative) powers. The Court's majority is highly sensitive to perceived executive encroachment on legislative prerogatives, especially the power of the purse and commerce.
4.  **National Security Deference (Moderate ↑):** The government's strongest argument is that the President deserves broad deference when acting under a national security statute like IEEPA. Some justices may be wary of second-guessing a presidential declaration of a national emergency. However, the link between trade deficits and a "national emergency" is tenuous, weakening this argument.
5.  **Potential for a "Mixed Ruling" (Small ↑ for "Mixed"):** The Court could distinguish between the "trafficking tariffs" (arguably more connected to a traditional national security threat) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (purely economic). This would allow them to curb the broadest power grab while giving some deference to the President on the narrower issue.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** No prior president has used IEEPA to impose broad tariffs. This lack of historical precedent removes a key justification the executive branch often uses to defend its actions.
*   **Economic Magnitude:** The scale of the tariffs is enormous, transforming U.S. trade policy. This raises the stakes far beyond a typical statutory interpretation case and makes the application of the Major Questions Doctrine almost certain.
*   **Consolidated, Expedited Review:** The Court is hearing two cases with slightly different lower court reasonings simultaneously and on a fast track. This signals the Court's intent to issue a definitive and swift ruling on the central question of IEEPA's scope.
*   **Current Supreme Court Composition:** The current 6-3 conservative majority is arguably the most skeptical of broad executive/administrative power in modern history, making it a particularly unfavorable environment for the government's novel legal theory.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a reference class of major executive power cases reviewed by the Roberts Court, suggesting a ~70% probability that the President's actions will be deemed unlawful. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓↓) The facts are a perfect fit for the Major Questions Doctrine, which has been a powerful tool for the current Court's majority to strike down executive action. (Large)
    *   (↓↓) The textualist argument distinguishing "regulation" from "taxation" is strong and likely to appeal to at least 5-6 justices. (Large)
    *   (↓) The unified front of lower court rulings against the tariffs, even with differing reasoning, creates a strong current against the government's position. (Moderate)
    *   (↑) The government's invocation of national security and emergency powers provides its only plausible path to victory, which might sway 1-2 justices concerned with limiting judicial oversight in this area. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces and amplifies the prior. The posterior probability for "Tariffs unlawful" should increase significantly, likely into the 85-95% range. The probability for "Mixed ruling" is small but non-zero, while "Tariffs lawful" appears extremely unlikely.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   Oral argument questions (Nov 5) from conservative justices (e.g., Kavanaugh, Roberts) focusing on the breadth of IEEPA's text and the President's foreign affairs power.
    *   Government counsel effectively articulating a limiting principle for when IEEPA *cannot* be used, addressing justices' fears of unchecked power.
    *   Prominent national security officials (former or current) filing amicus briefs supporting the President's authority.
    *   Leaks from Court deliberations suggesting Chief Justice Roberts is seeking a narrow, mixed ruling to avoid a sweeping rebuke of the President.

*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful):**
    *   Oral argument questions from a majority of justices centered on the Major Questions Doctrine, separation of powers, and the word "tax."
    *   Justices Gorsuch or Barrett pressing the government on the historical understanding of IEEPA and the distinction between regulation and taxation.
    *   Government counsel failing to provide a coherent answer on the limits of their proposed IEEPA power.
    *   A broad coalition of business and free-market groups filing amicus briefs opposing the tariffs on legal (not just policy) grounds.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **"Mixed Ruling" Possibility:** The primary uncertainty is not between lawful/unlawful, but between a complete rebuke ("Unlawful") and a partial one ("Mixed"). The trafficking tariffs have a slightly more plausible link to a national emergency than the reciprocal tariffs, creating a potential path for the Court to split its decision.
*   **Judicial Personalities:** While legal doctrines are key, the intense political environment and the specific personality of the President could lead to unpredictable judicial alignments or unusually forceful opinions.
*   **Remedy vs. Merits:** The Court could rule the tariffs unlawful but disagree on the proper remedy (e.g., the scope of an injunction), which could complicate the resolution but would still fall under "Unlawful" or "Mixed."
*   **"Other Ruling" Definition:** The resolution criteria for "Other ruling" are specific (e.g., GVR, mootness). While unlikely given the expedited grant, a sudden policy reversal by the administration could render the

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs Unlawful:** The base rate for the Supreme Court affirming lower court rulings on statutory interpretation, especially when multiple lower courts have ruled similarly, is approximately 65-75%. Given the unanimous direction of lower court rulings against the tariffs, this base rate is applicable.
  
- **Tariffs Lawful:** Historically, the Supreme Court has been less likely to uphold executive actions that are challenged on statutory grounds, especially under the Major Questions Doctrine. The base rate for the Court ruling in favor of executive power in such cases is lower, around 20-30%.

- **Mixed Ruling:** While less common, the possibility of a mixed ruling exists if the Court distinguishes between different types of tariffs (e.g., trafficking vs. reciprocal). The base rate for mixed rulings in complex statutory cases might be around 10-15%.

- **Other Ruling:** This includes procedural outcomes like dismissals or remands without a merits decision. The base rate for such outcomes in high-profile cases is relatively low, around 5-10%.

- **No 2025 Ruling:** Given the expedited schedule and the Court's agreement to hear the case, the likelihood of no ruling by the end of 2025 is very low, perhaps 1-5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The current case involves statutory interpretation with multiple lower court rulings against the executive action, aligning well with the base rate scenario for "Tariffs Unlawful."

- **Differences:** The case involves unprecedented use of IEEPA for tariffs, which introduces significant political and economic stakes, potentially making it an outlier.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Major Questions Doctrine:** The likelihood of the Court ruling "Tariffs Unlawful" is high given the doctrine's application in recent cases (P(E | H) is high).

- **Textualism/Statutory Interpretation:** The argument that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs is strong, increasing the likelihood of an "Unlawful" ruling.

- **Separation of Powers:** The Court's sensitivity to executive overreach supports an "Unlawful" ruling.

- **National Security Deference:** This provides some likelihood for a "Lawful" ruling, but the tenuous link between tariffs and national security weakens this argument.

- **Potential for Mixed Ruling:** The Court might differentiate between types of tariffs, slightly increasing the likelihood of a "Mixed" ruling.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior for "Tariffs Unlawful":** 70%
- **Likelihoods:** Strong evidence from the Major Questions Doctrine and statutory interpretation increases this probability.
- **Posterior for "Tariffs Unlawful":** Approximately 85-90%

- **Prior for "Tariffs Lawful":** 20%
- **Likelihoods:** Weak evidence from national security deference slightly increases this probability.
- **Posterior for "Tariffs Lawful":** Approximately 5-10%

- **Prior for "Mixed Ruling":** 10%
- **Likelihoods:** Some evidence for differentiation between tariffs slightly increases this probability.
- **Posterior for "Mixed Ruling":** Approximately 5-10%

- **Prior for "Other Ruling":** 5%
- **Likelihoods:** Low likelihood of procedural outcomes.
- **Posterior for "Other Ruling":** Approximately 3-5%

- **Prior for "No 2025 Ruling":** 1%
- **Likelihoods:** Very low likelihood given the expedited schedule.
- **Posterior for "No 2025 Ruling":** Approximately 1-2%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a mixed ruling or procedural outcome, though evidence strongly favors "Unlawful."
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden policy reversal or new evidence could shift probabilities, but current indicators are stable.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 7%  
Tariffs unlawful: 88%  
Mixed ruling: 4%  
Other ruling: 1%  
No 2025 ruling: 0%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 65%)**
- Supreme Court cases involving executive overreach into congressional powers (taxation, commerce) typically favor Congress
- Recent Major Questions Doctrine cases have consistently limited executive authority (80%+ success rate)
- When multiple lower courts rule against the executive on statutory interpretation, SCOTUS affirms ~70% of the time

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 20%)**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions on politically charged cases
- The case presents two distinct types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) that could be treated differently
- Roberts Court has shown preference for narrow, tailored rulings on executive power

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 10%)**
- National security deference occasionally leads to upholding executive actions
- IEEPA's text grants broad emergency powers that could be interpreted expansively
- Some precedent exists for deferring to the executive in foreign affairs

**Other ruling (Prior: 4%)**
- Procedural dismissals, remands without merits holdings, or fractured opinions with no majority are uncommon but possible
- The expedited review suggests the Court intends to reach the merits

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 1%)**
- The Court has already granted expedited review with arguments scheduled for November 2025
- The timeline allows ample time for a decision before year-end
- The economic urgency makes delay extremely unlikely

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other Major Questions Doctrine cases, this involves executive action with vast economic consequences
- Similar to *Youngstown* and other separation of powers cases where the President acts in a "zone of twilight"
- Follows pattern of consolidated cases with expedited review on issues of national importance

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariffs with no historical precedent
- Extraordinary economic magnitude affecting nearly all U.S. trade relationships
- Highly charged political context with the President potentially attending oral arguments
- Consolidated review of two different legal theories against the tariffs

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Both lower courts ruled the tariffs unlawful (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.2)
- Federal Circuit affirmed 7-4 that tariffs exceed IEEPA authority (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- The textualist argument distinguishing "regulation" from "taxation" aligns with the Court's majority approach (P(E|H) = 0.85, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- The Major Questions Doctrine applies perfectly to this case (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.2)

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- Distinction between trafficking tariffs (security-based) and reciprocal tariffs (economic) (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- Roberts Court's preference for narrow rulings that avoid sweeping precedents (P(E|H) = 0.6, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- Different legal reasoning in the two lower court decisions provides options for partial affirmance (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.4)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- IEEPA's broad language about regulating imports during emergencies (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.5)
- Traditional deference to the executive in national security matters (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible connection to a genuine emergency (P(E|H) = 0.6, P(E|~H) = 0.4)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update our prior for "Tariffs unlawful" based on the strongest evidence: the application of the Major Questions Doctrine.

Prior probability (Tariffs unlawful) = 65% = 0.65
Prior odds = 0.65 / 0.35 = 1.86

Likelihood ratio = P(MQD applies|Unlawful) / P(MQD applies|~Unlawful) = 0.9 / 0.2 = 4.5

Posterior odds = 1.86 × 4.5 = 8.37
Posterior probability = 8.37 / (1 + 8.37) = 0.89 or 89%

Further updating based on the Federal Circuit's 7-4 decision:
Likelihood ratio = P(7-4 decision|Unlawful) / P(7-4 decision|~Unlawful) = 0.8 / 0.3 = 2.67

New posterior odds = 8.37 × 2.67 = 22.35
New posterior probability = 22.35 / (1 + 22.35) = 0.96 or 96%

This seems too high given the uncertainties, so I'll adjust downward to account for other factors.

For "Mixed ruling," the distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs increases its probability:
Prior probability = 20%
The evidence of different tariff types and Roberts' preference for narrow rulings increases this to ~25-30%

For "Tariffs lawful," the national security deference argument is the strongest factor, but it's substantially weakened by the Major Questions Doctrine and the lower court rulings:
Prior probability = 10%
After considering the evidence, this decreases to ~5%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the Court's willingness to constrain executive power in national security contexts
- The political dynamics of a second Trump term could influence some justices
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a procedural resolution that avoids the merits

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could find that IEEPA does authorize tariffs but that the specific implementation exceeded statutory bounds
- The Court might distinguish between different types of tariffs based on their connection to genuine emergencies
- A fractured Court could produce multiple opinions with no clear majority reasoning

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce "Tariffs unlawful" from 96% to 75% to account for these uncertainties
- Increase "Mixed ruling" to 18% to reflect the plausible compromise position
- Maintain "Tariffs lawful" at 5% given the strong legal arguments against it
- Increase "Other ruling" to 2% to account for the possibility of a procedural resolution

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots:

Tariffs unlawful: 75%
Mixed ruling: 18% 
Tariffs lawful: 5%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 0%

Total: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs unlawful: 75%
Mixed ruling: 18%
Tariffs lawful: 5%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 0%
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information, following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use several reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

*   **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** The core of this case involves the executive branch claiming vast, transformative power based on an old, ambiguous statute. This is a textbook scenario for the Major Questions Doctrine. In recent years, the Roberts Court has consistently used this doctrine to strike down such assertions of executive authority (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*). In these cases, the government's position has been rejected over 80% of the time. This suggests a high prior probability for "Tariffs unlawful."
*   **Cases with Lower Court Agreement:** The background shows that the Court of International Trade, a U.S. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have all ruled the tariffs unlawful. When lower courts are in agreement on the outcome (even if for different reasons), the Supreme Court affirms more often than it reverses. A base rate for affirmation in such cases is roughly 65-75%. This also points toward "Tariffs unlawful."
*   **Procedural Outcomes:** For cases granted on an expedited schedule, the Court has signaled its intent to provide a swift, decisive ruling on the merits. This means the base rate for procedural dismissals ("Other ruling") or delays past the immediate time frame ("No 2025 ruling") is very low, likely under 10% combined.

Combining these, my initial prior distribution for the merits outcomes is heavily skewed toward "Unlawful." A starting point could be: **Unlawful (75%)**, **Mixed (15%)**, **Lawful (10%)**. The procedural outcomes start at a combined 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case fits the MQD and lower-court-agreement reference classes very well. The economic and political stakes are enormous, and the legal question centers on whether Congress implicitly granted the President a power (to tax via tariffs) that it holds explicitly under Article I of the Constitution.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is that the authority is claimed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a statute concerning national security and foreign affairs. Courts typically grant the President greater deference in this domain than in domestic regulation. This is the government's strongest argument and the main reason this case is not an open-and-shut application of the MQD, slightly increasing the chances of a "Lawful" or "Mixed" ruling compared to the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence For "Unlawful":**
    *   **The Major Questions Doctrine:** The current 6-3 conservative majority has championed this doctrine. The sheer scale of imposing tariffs on most U.S. trade partners is a quintessential "major question." P(This legal theory being central | Tariffs Unlawful) is very high. P(This theory being central | Tariffs Lawful) is very low, as a "Lawful" ruling would require the Court to ignore or distinguish its own recent, landmark precedents. This is the strongest evidence.
    *   **Textualism:** The government's case requires reading IEEPA's power to "regulate... importation" as including the power to impose tariffs, which are functionally taxes. For textualist justices (the majority of the Court), the power to tax is a distinct legislative power under Article I, not a subset of the power to regulate. This textual argument strongly favors an "Unlawful" ruling.
    *   **Lower Court Rulings:** The fact that three courts, including a specialized appellate court (the Federal Circuit), have found the tariffs unlawful creates a strong legal and intellectual current against the government's position.

*   **Evidence Against "Unlawful" (i.e., for "Lawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   **National Security Deference:** The government's invocation of a "national emergency" under IEEPA is its most potent argument. Some justices may be hesitant to second-guess the President's judgment in this area.
    *   **Plausibility of a "Mixed" Ruling:** The case consolidates challenges to two different sets of tariffs. The "trafficking tariffs" (on Mexico, Canada, China) are tied to a more traditional national security threat (drug cartels) than the "reciprocal tariffs" (tied to trade deficits). This provides a clear path for the Court to split its decision: it could strike down the economically-motivated reciprocal tariffs under the MQD while upholding the trafficking tariffs out of deference to the President's emergency powers. This makes a "Mixed ruling" a significant possibility.
    *   **Expedited Schedule:** The Court's decision to hear the case quickly strongly suggests it intends to issue a merits ruling before the end of the year. This lowers the probability of "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Prior:** P(Unlawful) ≈ 70%, P(Mixed) ≈ 15%, P(Lawful) ≈ 5%, with procedural outcomes at 10%.
2.  **Update on Expedited Schedule:** The Court's urgency makes a procedural punt or delay less likely. I will reduce the probability of "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling" and shift that mass to the merits outcomes. Let's move their combined probability down to ~7%.
3.  **Update on Strength of MQD/Textualism:** This evidence is extremely powerful and points overwhelmingly toward the tariffs being struck down. It significantly increases the posterior probability of "Unlawful" and decreases "Lawful." The odds of Unlawful vs. Lawful should be very high.
4.  **Update on Plausibility of "Mixed" Ruling:** The clean distinction between the two types of tariffs makes a split decision a very tempting "off-ramp" for the Court, allowing it to curb the most extreme power grab while still showing some deference. This increases the probability of "Mixed" relative to a complete government victory ("Lawful").

After weighing these factors, the evidence strongly reinforces the prior that the tariffs are unlawful in whole or in part. The main uncertainty is between a complete rejection ("Unlawful") and a partial one ("Mixed"). A complete victory for the government ("Lawful") appears highly improbable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis is heavily reliant on the current Supreme Court's jurisprudential trends (MQD, textualism, skepticism of the administrative state). Could the Court surprise? Yes. The national security context is a major wild card. A majority could decide that the plain text of IEEPA is so broad that, despite the economic consequences, their hands are tied and they must defer to the executive. This would lead to a "Lawful" ruling. While I view this as unlikely (3% chance), it is the most direct path to my forecast being wrong. The most significant alternative scenario is the "Mixed ruling," which I have assigned a substantial 20% probability. This outcome would still represent a major legal defeat for the administration's broadest claims but would be a more nuanced result than a complete invalidation. I believe my probabilities adequately account for this key alternative.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are adjusted to sum to 100%, reflecting the relative likelihood of each outcome after considering all evidence.

*   **Tariffs unlawful (70%):** This is the most likely outcome. The Court strikes down both the reciprocal and trafficking tariffs, likely using the Major Questions Doctrine and a textualist reading of IEEPA.
*   **Mixed ruling (20%):** This is the most significant alternative. The Court strikes down the reciprocal tariffs but upholds the trafficking tariffs, drawing a line between economic protectionism and more traditional national security threats.
*   **No 2025 ruling (5%):** Despite the expedited schedule, the complexity and contentiousness of the case could delay the opinion until early 2026.
*   **Tariffs lawful (3%):** A small but non-zero chance that the Court fully defers to the President's authority under IEEPA's broad language.
*   **Other ruling (2%):** A very small chance of a procedural resolution like dismissal, given the Court's clear intent to decide the merits.
