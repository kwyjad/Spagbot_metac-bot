### Reference class & base rates
*   **Inaugural Orbital Booster Landing Attempts:** This is a tight but low-N reference class. SpaceX failed its first several sea-based landing attempts for the Falcon 9. This class suggests a low probability of success on any given early attempt. **Base Rate: 10-20% success.** This is derived from observing the initial struggles of the only other company to achieve this feat. Its limitation is the sample size of one (SpaceX).
*   **Second Orbital Booster Landing Attempt (Post-Failure):** This is the most specific reference class. After a failure, a company has data to correct the issue, which should increase the probability of success relative to the first attempt. SpaceX's success rate improved markedly after its initial failures. **Base Rate: 30-50% success.** This rate is higher than the inaugural attempt rate, reflecting learning, but remains well below that of a mature system. The primary limitation is that it's still almost entirely based on SpaceX's development path.
*   **Inaugural Flights of New Large Rockets:** This class focuses on the "launch before 2026" component. Historically, new heavy-lift launch vehicles face significant delays, even after a first flight. The Space Shuttle, Ariane 5, and Falcon Heavy all had multi-month or year-plus gaps between their first and second flights. **Base Rate: 40-60% chance of a second flight occurring within 12 months of the first.** New Glenn's first flight was in January 2025, so a launch by December 2025 fits this window.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** Booster "Never Tell Me The Odds" rolled out to Launch Complex 36. — ↑ — This is a critical pre-launch milestone, indicating hardware is ready and ground operations are proceeding toward a near-term launch attempt.
*   **2025-10-08** Multiple sources confirm launch is in preparation for NASA's ESCAPADE Mars mission. — ↑ — A planetary mission has a fixed, non-negotiable launch window. This creates strong external pressure to launch within the prescribed timeframe (i.e., before year-end).
*   **2025-08-14** Report notes previous delays (from spring to late summer) and leadership changes. — ↓ — Highlights the program's historical schedule instability, suggesting that further slips from the current November target are plausible.
*   **2025-01-16** New Glenn's first flight successfully reached orbit but the booster was lost. — ↔ — A mixed signal. It proved the fundamental viability of the rocket's ascent but also provided the first data point for landing failure, confirming the difficulty of the task.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Learning from NG-1 Failure:** (Large) The single most important driver. If Blue Origin correctly identified the root cause of the first booster's loss and implemented an effective fix, the probability of success increases dramatically. The company's secrecy makes this a key uncertainty.
*   **Suborbital Landing Experience:** (Moderate) Blue Origin has successfully landed its suborbital New Shepard booster over 20 times. While orbital reentry is a much harsher environment (higher velocity, thermal loads), this provides deep institutional experience in guidance, navigation, control (GNC), and engine relight for vertical landings.
*   **ESCAPADE Mars Launch Window:** (Moderate) The mission has a planetary launch window that closes in late 2025. Missing this window means a two-year delay for the customer (NASA). This provides a powerful incentive to avoid schedule slips into 2026.
*   **Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" Philosophy:** (Mixed) The company's "step-by-step, ferociously" motto implies a cautious, test-heavy approach. This could increase the chance of a successful landing *if they launch*, but it also increases the chance they will delay the launch into 2026 if any pre-flight anomaly is detected.
*   **Hardware Readiness:** (Large) The booster for the second flight is built and has been transported to the launch pad. This physically de-risks the schedule, as long lead-time manufacturing is complete.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extensive Suborbital Precedent:** Unlike SpaceX, which developed its landing capability entirely on the orbital Falcon 9, Blue Origin has a mature and highly successful suborbital landing program (New Shepard). This provides a unique and extensive data set for vehicle control in the terminal landing phase.
*   **Patient Capital:** Blue Origin is funded by Jeff Bezos's personal fortune, insulating it from the commercial and investor pressures that might force a company to fly before it is fully ready. This supports their cautious culture and could lead to a higher probability of success per attempt.
*   **Engine Technology:** New Glenn uses methalox (Methane/LOX) BE-4 engines, which have different relight characteristics and potential for soot-related issues compared to the RP-1 (kerosene) Merlin engines in the Falcon 9 reference class. This introduces technical novelty.
*   **External Schedule Driver:** The hard deadline of the ESCAPADE Mars mission is a powerful, external forcing function that is not always present for a second test flight, pushing against the company's innate tendency for caution-driven delays.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the "Second Orbital Booster Landing Attempt" reference class. A prior of **~40% on the condition of a launch attempt**, with low confidence (equivalent n≈5) due to the small reference class. The prior for the launch *happening* in 2025 could be ~70%, based on hardware readiness and the Mars window.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Blue Origin's extensive, successful suborbital landing experience with New Shepard is a major positive differentiator not present in the reference class.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The hard deadline imposed by the ESCAPADE Mars launch window strongly counteracts the potential for internal, caution-driven delays.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The booster is physically at the launch pad, a major de-risking milestone for the launch schedule.
    *   ↓ (Small): The company's history of delays and cautious culture remains a salient risk factor for a slip past the deadline.
    *   ? (Large but unknown): The effectiveness of the fix for the NG-1 landing failure is the largest variable, but we must assume the company believes it is resolved to proceed with a launch attempt.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to an upward revision. The unique positive differentiators (suborbital experience, Mars window) appear to outweigh the historical risks of delay. The posterior should move moderately upwards from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcement of a firm launch date in November.
    *   Successful completion of a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR).
    *   Successful static fire test of the booster on the pad.
    *   NASA issues a "cleared for launch" statement for the ESCAPADE payload.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Booster is rolled back from the launch pad to the integration facility.
    *   Announced slip of the launch target to late December.
    *   Scrubbed static fire or WDR attempt without a quick resolution.
    *   Public statements from Blue Origin or NASA mentioning a new technical issue.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously private. The true cause of the first landing failure and the details of the corrective actions are not public, representing the single largest source of uncertainty.
*   **Binary Outcome Complexity:** The question requires two events to occur (launch in 2025 AND successful landing). A failure in either part resolves the question to No. Forecasters must model this dependency.
*   **Defining "Successful Landing":** The resolution criteria are simple, but edge cases like a hard landing that damages the booster but leaves it upright ("mission success, but vehicle lost") could create ambiguity. Assume it means landing intact and upright on the droneship.
*   **Weather and Range Availability:** Even with a ready rocket, launches from Florida in the late fall can be subject to delays from weather or a crowded Eastern Range schedule, which could push the attempt into 2026.

**Final Research Summary:** The launch is very likely to be attempted in 2025 due to hardware readiness and the firm Mars launch window. The landing's success is the key uncertainty, but Blue Origin's extensive suborbital landing experience provides a strong, positive differentiator from the base rate of early orbital landing failures.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the "Second Orbital Booster Landing Attempt (Post-Failure)" with a success rate of 30-50%. This is chosen because Blue Origin is attempting a second landing after a previous failure, similar to SpaceX's early attempts.
   - Initial prior: 40% probability of success on the condition of a launch attempt.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both Blue Origin and SpaceX faced early challenges with orbital booster landings. Blue Origin's cautious approach mirrors the learning curve seen in SpaceX's early attempts.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience and a hard deadline due to the ESCAPADE Mars mission, which are not typical in the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Suborbital Experience**: Blue Origin's successful suborbital landings increase the likelihood of success (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
   - **ESCAPADE Mars Launch Window**: The fixed deadline increases the likelihood of a 2025 launch (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
   - **Booster Readiness**: The booster at the launch pad increases the likelihood of a timely launch (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
   - **Historical Delays**: Blue Origin's cautious culture slightly decreases the likelihood of a 2025 launch (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 0.4 / 0.6 = 0.67
   - Likelihood ratio: Suborbital experience and Mars window provide strong positive evidence, while historical delays provide slight negative evidence. Overall, the likelihood ratio is >1.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.67 × 1.5 = 1.005
   - Posterior probability = 1.005 / (1 + 1.005) ≈ 50%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The reliance on suborbital experience may overestimate the success probability due to differences in orbital reentry conditions.
   - Alternative scenario: A technical issue could delay the launch into 2026, reducing the probability of a successful 2025 landing.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unforeseen technical challenges and adjust the probability slightly downward.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the evidence and potential risks, the final probability of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launching before 2026 and successfully landing is 45%.

Final: 45%

# Probability Assessment: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider two components: (1) the probability of launch before 2026, and (2) the probability of successful landing, conditional on launch.

The most appropriate reference class is "Second Orbital Booster Landing Attempt (Post-Failure)" since this is Blue Origin's second attempt after a failed first landing. Looking at historical precedent (primarily from SpaceX):

- SpaceX failed several early landing attempts before achieving success
- Companies typically learn significantly from first failures
- The base rate for successful second landing attempts is approximately 30-50%

For the launch timing component, the reference class "Inaugural Flights of New Large Rockets" suggests a 40-60% chance of a second flight occurring within 12 months of the first.

**Initial prior**: 40% chance of both launching before 2026 AND successfully landing.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like SpaceX's early attempts, this is an early-stage orbital booster landing attempt
- The physics and engineering challenges of orbital-class booster recovery remain similar
- Both companies have strong technical teams and significant resources

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard (20+ successful landings)
- The ESCAPADE Mars mission provides a hard external deadline that SpaceX didn't have for early attempts
- Blue Origin's culture is more cautious than SpaceX's "fail fast" approach
- The booster is already at the launch pad (as of October 8, 2025), indicating high hardware readiness
- Blue Origin uses different engine technology (BE-4 methalox engines vs. SpaceX's RP-1 Merlins)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence: Hardware readiness (booster at launch pad)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If they will launch and land successfully, the booster would definitely be at the pad by now
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even if they won't succeed, they might still roll out the hardware
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.58 (positive evidence)

**Evidence: ESCAPADE Mars mission launch window**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - A successful mission would align with this critical window
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.7) - Even with failure, they would still try to hit this window
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.29 (positive evidence)

**Evidence: Extensive suborbital landing experience**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Success would leverage this experience
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This experience exists regardless of outcome
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.19 (positive evidence)

**Evidence: Previous launch delays and cautious culture**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even with success, some caution is expected
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If they fail, excessive caution would be a likely factor
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (negative evidence)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 40:60 (0.67:1)

First update (Hardware readiness):
Posterior odds = 0.67 × 1.58 = 1.06
Posterior probability = 1.06/(1+1.06) = 51.5%

Second update (Mars mission window):
Posterior odds = 1.06 × 1.29 = 1.37
Posterior probability = 1.37/(1+1.37) = 57.8%

Third update (Suborbital experience):
Posterior odds = 1.37 × 1.19 = 1.63
Posterior probability = 1.63/(1+1.63) = 62.0%

Fourth update (Cautious culture):
Posterior odds = 1.63 × 0.75 = 1.22
Posterior probability = 1.22/(1+1.22) = 55.0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the transferability of suborbital landing experience to orbital conditions
- The timeline is tight - any technical issues discovered during pre-launch testing could push into 2026
- Weather in Florida during late fall/early winter can cause launch delays
- Blue Origin's secretive nature means we don't know if they've truly resolved the first landing failure

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The booster launches but experiences a similar failure mode to the first attempt (30% probability)
- Pre-launch testing reveals issues that delay launch to 2026 (25% probability)
- Weather or range conflicts push the launch into January 2026 (15% probability)

**Adjustments:**
Given the tight timeline (only about 2 months left in 2025) and the dual requirement (both launch AND successful landing), I should adjust my probability slightly downward to account for these risks.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" has approximately a 52% chance of both launching before 2026 AND successfully landing.

The strongest positive factors are the hardware readiness, the Mars mission window creating urgency, and Blue Origin's extensive suborbital landing experience. The main negative factors are the tight remaining timeline in 2025 and Blue Origin's cautious culture that could lead to delays if any issues are discovered.

Final: 52%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

The question is a conjunction of two events: (A) the launch happens before 2026, and (B) the booster landing is successful. It's best to establish priors for each component.

*   **P(A): Launch before 2026.** The reference class is the time between the first and second flights of new heavy-lift rockets. This period is often long due to data analysis and modifications. The research report suggests a base rate of 40-60% for a second flight occurring within 12 months of the first. The first New Glenn flight was in January 2025, so a launch before the end of 2025 fits this window. I will select a prior of **50%** for the launch occurring in 2025.

*   **P(B|A): Successful landing, given a launch occurs.** The most relevant reference class is the success rate of second attempts at orbital booster landings after a first-attempt failure. This is a very small reference class, dominated by SpaceX's early Falcon 9 attempts. The research report suggests a base rate of 30-50%, reflecting the value of data gathered from the first failure. I will select a prior of **40%** for the landing success, conditional on a launch attempt.

*   **Combined Prior P(H):** The prior probability of the combined event is P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.50 * 0.40 = **20%**.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

*   **Similarities:** Like the base case (primarily SpaceX's Falcon 9), New Glenn is a large, partially reusable rocket attempting a difficult propulsive landing on a sea platform. The program has also followed a typical pattern of developmental delays.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **External Deadline:** Unlike a typical second test flight, this mission carries NASA's ESCAPADE Mars probe, which has a non-negotiable planetary launch window closing in late 2025. This creates immense pressure to avoid schedule slips.
    *   **Suborbital Experience:** Blue Origin has successfully landed its suborbital New Shepard booster over 20 times. This provides deep institutional knowledge of guidance, control, and engine relight for vertical landings, a significant advantage not present in the SpaceX base case.
    *   **Company Culture:** Blue Origin's cautious "Gradatim Ferociter" philosophy contrasts with SpaceX's rapid iteration. This could increase the probability of success for any given attempt but also makes them more likely to delay a launch if any issues are found.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

I will update the probabilities for the two sub-events based on the specific evidence.

*   **For the Launch Timing (P(A)):**
    *   **Evidence (Strongly Increases Probability):** The hard deadline of the ESCAPADE Mars launch window. Missing this window means a two-year delay for a key NASA mission. This is a powerful forcing function against delays. P(Mars Mission | Launch in 2025) >> P(Mars Mission | Launch in 2026).
    *   **Evidence (Increases Probability):** The booster has been rolled out to the launch pad (as of Oct 8, 2025). This is a major physical milestone indicating that the hardware is ready and launch preparations are in their final stages.
    *   **Evidence (Decreases Probability):** The program has a history of significant delays. This historical data suggests that further slips are plausible.
    *   **Net Effect:** The recent, specific evidence of the hard deadline and hardware readiness strongly outweighs the historical tendency for delays. I will significantly update the probability of a 2025 launch upwards.

*   **For the Landing Success (P(B|A)):**
    *   **Evidence (Strongly Increases Probability):** Blue Origin's extensive and successful New Shepard suborbital landing program. While orbital reentry is a much harder problem, the experience in the terminal landing phase (GNC, engine control, landing legs) is highly relevant and a major positive differentiator from the base case.
    *   **Evidence (Increases Probability):** Learning from the NG-1 landing failure. A cautious company like Blue Origin is unlikely to attempt a second landing without high confidence that they have identified and fixed the root cause of the first failure.
    *   **Net Effect:** The unique suborbital landing experience provides a strong reason to believe Blue Origin's chances are better than the base rate derived purely from SpaceX's early attempts.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**

*   **Updating P(Launch before 2026):** The prior was 50% (1:1 odds). The powerful evidence of the Mars window and the booster being on the pad dramatically increases the likelihood of a 2025 launch. I'll update this probability to **80%**, which still accounts for a 1-in-5 chance of a slip into 2026 due to weather, a late-stage technical issue, or range availability.

*   **Updating P(Successful Landing | Launch):** The prior was 40% (2:3 odds). The New Shepard experience is a significant positive factor not present in the reference class. It suggests a higher mastery of the terminal landing phase. This justifies moving the probability up from the prior. However, orbital reentry remains immensely challenging, as proven by the first failure. A modest update is warranted. I will update the conditional probability of a successful landing to **50%**. This represents a coin-flip chance, acknowledging both Blue Origin's unique expertise and the profound difficulty of the task.

*   **Calculating Final Posterior:**
    *   P(H) = P(Launch before 2026) × P(Successful Landing | Launch)
    *   P(H) = 0.80 × 0.50 = 0.40

The resulting posterior probability is 40%.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

I might be overconfident in the 80% launch probability; new heavy-lift rockets are notoriously prone to last-minute delays, and even a hard deadline can be missed if a serious technical issue arises. I could also be underestimating the difficulty of the landing; SpaceX, the only company to succeed, had many early failures. The 50% landing probability might be too optimistic, and the New Shepard experience may not translate as well as assumed to the high-energy orbital environment. However, the combination of a hard external deadline and unique internal expertise makes this situation meaningfully different from the historical base rates. The 40% forecast feels like a balanced assessment of these competing factors, acknowledging a significant chance of success while respecting the high probability of failure in either the schedule or the technical execution.

**6. Final Forecast**

The final forecast is the product of the updated probabilities for the two necessary conditions: a launch occurring before 2026 (which is likely due to the Mars mission deadline) and the landing being successful (which is a major but plausible challenge given Blue Origin's unique suborbital experience).

Final: 40%
