### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent La Niña Winters (2020-2022):** This is the most direct reference class. During the three consecutive La Niña events, the peak daily global surface air temperature anomalies in Nov/Dec were lower than in surrounding neutral or El Niño years.
    *   **Base Rate:** The peak daily anomaly during Nov/Dec of these years ranged from approximately **+1.25°C to +1.45°C** above the 1991-2020 baseline.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class isolates the effect of La Niña conditions. However, it must be adjusted upwards to account for ~0.06-0.08°C of background warming that has occurred since 2021-2022.
2.  **All Recent Winters (2020-2024):** This class captures the modern climate regime, including the influence of both La Niña and the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño.
    *   **Base Rate:** The peak daily anomaly during Nov/Dec in this period ranged from approximately **+1.25°C to +1.95°C**. The upper end is dominated by the record-breaking heat of late 2023.
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides a broader view of recent variability. The current situation (emerging La Niña) will likely fall in the lower-to-mid part of this range, as the extreme heat of the 2023 El Niño is not present.
3.  **Years with a transition from Neutral/El Niño to La Niña:** This class focuses on the dynamic of a cooling Pacific. Examples include 2010, 2016, and 2020.
    *   **Base Rate:** The peak anomaly in these transitional Nov/Dec periods is highly variable but tends to be cooler than the preceding months, yet warmer than an established La Niña winter. A ballpark range, adjusted for today's baseline, would be **+1.30°C to +1.60°C**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This captures the thermal inertia of the climate system. The full cooling impact of La Niña is often delayed by several months, so a transitional winter is typically warmer than a mature La Niña winter.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-09** La Niña conditions officially declared by NOAA. — ↓ — Confirms the presence of the primary short-term global cooling mechanism for the forecast period.
*   **2025-10-09** Current La Niña anticipated to be "weak". — ↑ — A weak event will exert less downward pressure on global temperatures than a moderate or strong one.
*   **2025-10-10** September 2025 reported as third warmest on record. — ↑ — Shows significant underlying warmth in the climate system, even as La Niña conditions were emerging.
*   **2025-09-11** CPC forecasts 71% chance of La Niña for Oct-Dec 2025. — ↓ — High confidence in the persistence of the cooling mechanism through the resolution period.
*   **2025-07/08** Global temperature anomalies "stagnated" relative to records. — ↓ — The extreme record-breaking heat of 2023-2024 has subsided, indicating a shift away from peak warming conditions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ENSO State (Large):** The El Niño-Southern Oscillation is the dominant driver of inter-annual climate variability. The current La Niña state exerts a strong cooling influence by bringing cooler, deep ocean water to the surface in the equatorial Pacific.
2.  **Long-Term Anthropogenic Warming Trend (Large):** The accumulation of greenhouse gases creates a persistent, non-negotiable warming baseline. This trend adds approximately +0.2°C per decade, ensuring that any modern La Niña event will be significantly warmer than those of previous decades.
3.  **Global Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) outside the Pacific (Moderate):** As noted in 2024 reports, SSTs in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans have been at record highs. If this warmth persists, it will significantly counteract the cooling from the Pacific La Niña, boosting the global average.
4.  **Thermal Inertia (Moderate):** The planet absorbed an immense amount of heat during the 2023-2024 El Niño. This "stored" heat in the oceans is released slowly, meaning the atmosphere will cool more gradually than the Pacific Ocean itself.
5.  **Stratospheric Water Vapor from Hunga Tonga (Small):** The 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption injected a large amount of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. While its warming effect is diminishing, it likely still contributes a small positive forcing to the global temperature anomaly.
6.  **Weather-Related Variability (Small):** The final resolution is the *highest daily* temperature, not a monthly average. A specific large-scale weather pattern (e.g., a "heat dome" over a large landmass) could cause a short-term spike in the global average.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Baseline Warmth:** The planet is emerging from the hottest 12-month period on record (mid-2023 to mid-2024). The starting point for any cooling is exceptionally high, unlike previous transitions to La Niña.
*   **Weak La Niña:** Forecasts consistently call for a weak La Niña event. This contrasts with the stronger events that produce more significant global cooling and would be expected in a "classic" La Niña reference class. The cooling effect will be muted.
*   **Anomalous Non-Pacific Ocean Heat:** The record-breaking warmth in the Atlantic and other ocean basins is a key feature of the current climate state. This provides a powerful warming counterbalance that was less pronounced during the 2020-2022 La Niña period.
*   **Lingering Stratospheric Forcing:** The small but positive warming effect from the Hunga Tonga water vapor injection was not a factor in any prior La Niña reference class years.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on an adjusted La Niña reference class seems appropriate. Start with a distribution centered around **1.50°C**, reflecting a 2021/2022 peak (~1.4°C) plus an adjustment for background warming. Equivalent n=10.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) La Niña is confirmed and expected to persist. (Large)
    *   (↑) The La Niña is forecast to be weak. (Moderate, as it dampens the large downward pressure)
    *   (↑) SSTs outside the Pacific remain anomalously high. (Moderate)
    *   (↑) The system is cooling from an unprecedented peak (high thermal inertia). (Small-to-Moderate)
    *   (↑) Lingering positive forcing from Hunga Tonga. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The large downward pressure from the presence of La Niña is significantly counteracted by its weakness and the persistent warmth in other parts of the climate system. The posterior should move slightly upwards from the prior, to a value higher than a simple trend-adjusted La Niña year. A shift to the **1.55°C to 1.65°C** range is warranted.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) values staying in the weak range (-0.5°C to -0.9°C) rather than strengthening.
    *   Copernicus monthly reports for October showing continued record or near-record warmth in the North Atlantic.
    *   Lower-than-average global snow and ice extent for the season, reducing planetary albedo.
    *   Forecasts for the La Niña to transition back to neutral earlier than expected (e.g., in Jan-Feb 2026).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   ONI values dropping below -1.0°C, indicating a strengthening, moderate La Niña.
    *   A significant and sustained drop in North Atlantic SST anomalies.
    *   Emergence of a persistent negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, leading to colder Northern Hemisphere land temperatures.
    *   An unexpected tropical volcanic eruption with significant stratospheric SO2 injection (highly unlikely).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The resolution is the single highest *daily* value, which is more volatile and susceptible to short-term weather patterns than the monthly average. The peak will be higher than the monthly mean.
*   **Lag in Atmospheric Response:** The maximum cooling effect of a La Niña on global *air* temperatures typically lags the oceanic signal by 2-4 months. The full impact may not be realized by December 2025.
*   **Model Forecast Uncertainty:** While models agree on a weak La Niña, its precise evolution and strength are uncertain. A slight change in intensity could have a noticeable impact on the final temperature.
*   **Dataset Specifics:** The resolution depends solely on the Copernicus (ERA5) dataset. While highly respected, its reanalysis methodology can produce slightly different values than other global datasets (e.g., from NOAA or NASA).

Final Research Summary: The forecast must balance the clear cooling pressure from a newly emerged La Niña against countervailing factors, including its predicted weakness, exceptionally high temperatures in other ocean basins, and the planet's overall high thermal inertia. The result will likely be a peak anomaly significantly warmer than the 2020-2022 La Niña period but clearly below the record-shattering El Niño-driven peaks of late 2023.

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** We start with the reference class of recent La Niña winters (2020-2022), where peak anomalies ranged from +1.25°C to +1.45°C. Adjusting for background warming since then, we center our prior around +1.50°C.
- **Reasoning:** This captures the cooling influence of La Niña while accounting for the ongoing anthropogenic warming trend.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a La Niña event, similar to the reference years.
- **Differences:** The current La Niña is weak, and there is significant warmth in non-Pacific ocean basins, which was less pronounced in the reference years. This suggests a higher anomaly than the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **La Niña Confirmation:** Confirms cooling influence (↓).
- **Weak La Niña:** Reduces the cooling effect (↑).
- **High SSTs outside Pacific:** Counteracts La Niña cooling (↑).
- **Thermal Inertia:** Slows cooling from previous El Niño (↑).
- **Hunga Tonga Forcing:** Adds slight warming (↑).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at +1.50°C.
- **Evidence Impact:** The weak La Niña and high SSTs outside the Pacific push the forecast upwards.
- **Posterior Shift:** Adjust the prior upwards to reflect these factors, centering around +1.60°C.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a stronger-than-expected La Niña or unexpected cooling events.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where La Niña strengthens could lower the anomaly, but current forecasts suggest this is unlikely.
- **Adjustment:** Ensure the forecast accounts for potential tail risks by slightly widening the distribution.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **P10:** 1.45°C
- **P20:** 1.50°C
- **P40:** 1.55°C
- **P60:** 1.60°C
- **P80:** 1.65°C
- **P90:** 1.70°C

These percentiles reflect a balance between the cooling influence of La Niña and the countervailing warming factors, with an emphasis on the likelihood of a higher anomaly due to the weak La Niña and high SSTs outside the Pacific.

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a combination of reference classes to establish my prior:

**Primary Reference Class: Recent La Niña Winters (2020-2022)**
- During the last La Niña events, peak daily temperature anomalies in Nov/Dec ranged from approximately +1.25°C to +1.45°C
- This directly captures the effect of La Niña conditions on global temperatures
- Adjusting for background warming (+0.06-0.08°C since 2021-2022), this gives a range of +1.31°C to +1.53°C

**Secondary Reference Class: Years with Transition to La Niña**
- Years like 2010, 2016, and 2020 that transitioned from Neutral/El Niño to La Niña
- Peak anomalies in these transitional periods tend to be cooler than preceding months but warmer than established La Niña winters
- Adjusted for today's baseline: +1.30°C to +1.60°C

Based on these reference classes, I'll set my prior distribution with a median of **1.45°C** and a standard deviation of approximately 0.15°C, reflecting the uncertainty in the strength of the La Niña effect.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- We have a confirmed La Niña event expected to persist through the end of 2025
- The seasonal pattern of temperature evolution should follow similar dynamics to previous La Niña events
- The underlying warming trend continues to operate as in previous years

**Key differences:**
- The current La Niña is anticipated to be "weak" rather than moderate or strong
- We're coming off an exceptionally warm period (2023-2024 El Niño), with significant thermal inertia
- Ocean temperatures outside the Pacific (especially Atlantic) remain anomalously warm
- The background warming trend continues to push temperatures higher each year

These differences suggest the temperature anomaly will likely be higher than a typical La Niña winter from the reference period.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- NOAA officially declared La Niña conditions on October 9, 2025 (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood of lower values)
- La Niña conditions are expected to persist through the end of 2025 with 71% confidence (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood of lower values)
- Global temperature anomalies have "stagnated" in late 2025 relative to records (weak evidence, ~1.2x likelihood of lower values)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- The current La Niña is anticipated to be "weak" (moderate evidence, ~1.7x likelihood of higher values)
- September 2025 was the third warmest on record despite emerging La Niña (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood of higher values)
- Exceptional warmth in non-Pacific ocean basins continues (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood of higher values)
- Background warming trend adds ~0.02°C per year (weak but certain evidence, ~1.1x likelihood of higher values)
- Lingering stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga eruption (very weak evidence, ~1.05x likelihood of higher values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 1.45°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - La Niña presence:**
- Prior: centered at 1.45°C
- Evidence: Confirmed La Niña (downward pressure)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x for lower values
- Intermediate posterior: shifts downward to ~1.40°C

**Second update - La Niña strength:**
- Intermediate posterior: centered at 1.40°C
- Evidence: La Niña is weak (upward pressure)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.7x for higher values
- Intermediate posterior: shifts upward to ~1.48°C

**Third update - Recent temperature data:**
- Intermediate posterior: centered at 1.48°C
- Evidence: September 2025 was third warmest on record + exceptional non-Pacific ocean warmth
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x for higher values
- Posterior: shifts upward to ~1.55°C

The posterior distribution has:
- Shifted its central tendency upward from the prior (1.45°C → 1.55°C)
- Slightly narrowed in variance due to multiple pieces of consistent evidence
- Developed a slight positive skew due to the potential for short-term weather events to create temperature spikes

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the cooling effect of La Niña if it strengthens more rapidly than expected
- I could be overestimating the persistence of warmth in non-Pacific ocean basins
- The daily peak temperature is more volatile than monthly averages, creating potential for higher spikes
- I might be underestimating the impact of random weather variability on daily peak temperatures

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would center around 1.40°C, arguing that:
- La Niña's cooling effect will be stronger than I've estimated
- The exceptional warmth of 2023-2024 will dissipate more quickly
- Atlantic warmth will moderate by late 2025

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The weakness of the La Niña and the thermal inertia of the climate system make a rapid cooling unlikely
- The persistent warmth in the Atlantic has been remarkably stubborn throughout 2024-2025
- The background warming trend continues to push the baseline higher

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for the volatility of daily peaks and the uncertainty in La Niña's evolution, while maintaining my central estimate.

This forecast balances the cooling pressure from a newly emerged La Niña against several significant warming factors.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is the peak daily global surface air temperature anomaly during the Nov/Dec periods of the most recent La Niña years (2020-2022). This isolates the effect of the dominant short-term climate driver.

*   **Base Rate Data:** During Nov/Dec of 2020-2022, the peak daily anomaly ranged from approximately +1.25°C to +1.45°C relative to the 1991-2020 baseline.
*   **Adjustment for Trend:** Acknowledging the underlying anthropogenic warming trend of ~0.02°C/year, we must add ~0.08°C to account for the four years between the midpoint of that period (2021) and 2025.
*   **Prior Distribution:** This creates a trend-adjusted prior distribution centered around **1.50°C**, with a range of roughly 1.35°C to 1.55°C. This represents our expectation for a "typical" modern La Niña.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case in several critical ways that suggest a warmer outcome:

*   **La Niña Strength:** The current La Niña is officially forecast to be "weak." The 2020-2022 events were stronger, exerting more cooling pressure. A weak event implies a smaller downward deviation from the warming trend.
*   **Antecedent Conditions:** The planet is cooling from the hottest 12-month period ever recorded (mid-2023 to mid-2024). This creates immense thermal inertia, as the oceans slowly release this stored heat, keeping atmospheric temperatures elevated.
*   **Non-Pacific Ocean Warmth:** Sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans have been at record highs. This provides a powerful, independent warming influence that counteracts the cooling in the equatorial Pacific.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **(↓) La Niña is Confirmed:** This is the primary evidence supporting a cooler outcome than in 2023-2024 and forms the basis of our prior selection.
*   **(↑) Forecast for a Weak La Niña:** This is a crucial update. It significantly weakens the primary cooling mechanism, making outcomes above the prior mean of 1.50°C much more likely.
*   **(↑) Record Warmth Persists Elsewhere:** The fact that September 2025 was the third warmest on record, even as La Niña was emerging, demonstrates the strength of the other warming factors (thermal inertia, other ocean basins). This evidence strongly pushes the distribution upwards and makes very low outcomes (<1.45°C) less probable.
*   **(↓) Cooling Trend from 2023 Peak:** The chart clearly shows 2025 temperatures have "stagnated" and are well below the 2023 El Niño-driven peak. This makes a repeat of the ~1.95°C record extremely unlikely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at **1.50°C** (a trend-adjusted "typical" La Niña).
*   **Update:** The evidence—a weak La Niña, high thermal inertia, and record non-Pacific warmth—collectively provides a strong upward revision. The weakness of the La Niña shifts the mean upwards from the prior, perhaps to ~1.60°C. The additional warming factors push it further to a new central estimate of **~1.63°C**.
*   **Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution is centered significantly higher than the prior. It is also positively skewed, reflecting that the unprecedented background warmth creates a greater potential for a surprisingly high outcome than for a surprisingly low one.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The main risk to this forecast is underestimating the cooling power of the La Niña, even a weak one. An alternative scenario is that the Atlantic Ocean cools faster than expected and the La Niña strengthens to a moderate event. This would drive the peak anomaly down towards the prior, possibly below 1.50°C.

However, this alternative view seems less likely. It discounts the sheer scale of the heat stored in the climate system and the consistent expert forecasts for a weak event. The September 2025 data point serves as a strong rebuttal, showing that the system's current baseline is exceptionally high. My distribution accounts for this downside risk with a P10 of 1.49°C, but the balance of evidence points towards a warmer outcome. The positive skew of my final distribution reflects that a high-side surprise is more plausible than a low-side one.
