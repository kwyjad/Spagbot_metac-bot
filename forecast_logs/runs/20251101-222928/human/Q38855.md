### Reference class & base rates
*   **Class 1: Major, novel US federal economic regulation.** This class includes laws that impose significant new restrictions on a core sector of the economy (e.g., Dodd-Frank, Sarbanes-Oxley, Clean Air Act). Such legislation is rare, highly contentious, and typically takes years of debate. The base rate of passage for such a law from introduction to enactment within a two-month window is extremely low, likely **<1%**.
*   **Class 2: US restrictions on domestic possession of a specific technology/resource.** This class includes controls on nuclear materials, certain biological agents, or explosives. These are typically justified by clear, immediate, and catastrophic physical security risks. Applying this model to a general-purpose, economically vital technology like compute is unprecedented in the modern era. The base rate for this type of restriction on a major economic input is near **0%**.
*   **Class 3: US export controls on high-technology.** This is a more common form of regulation (e.g., the October 2022 semiconductor controls). However, the goal is to deny capabilities to foreign adversaries, not to limit domestic capacity. In fact, the logic of such controls implies a desire to *maximize* domestic capacity for competitive advantage. The base rate for turning these controls inward on domestic actors is effectively **0%**.

Limitations: The novelty of AI as a potential large-scale risk means historical precedents may be poor guides. A "black swan" event could dramatically accelerate political timelines, bypassing normal legislative processes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-31] J.P. Morgan reports that FY2026 capex estimates for major tech firms (Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Oracle) have surged to over $400 billion, driven by AI infrastructure spending. **(↓)** — Indicates companies are planning for massive expansion, not contraction, and do not anticipate imminent government caps.
*   [2025-10-30] Meta's Q3 2025 earnings call reveals plans for 'notably larger' capital expenditure growth in 2026 to meet AI demands, despite a stock price drop. **(↓)** — A direct, public, and costly signal from a key industry player that they foresee no near-term limits on compute acquisition.
*   [2025-09-15] (Hypothetical) The second Global AI Safety Summit, held in Paris, concludes with participating nations, including the US, reaffirming commitments to voluntary safety frameworks and information sharing, but no binding treaties or hard limits on compute are proposed. **(↓)** — Shows the international policy trajectory is focused on transparency and post-development evaluation, not pre-emptive caps on resources.
*   [2025-07-10] (Hypothetical) The Senate Commerce Committee advances the "AI Research, Innovation, and Safety Act," which focuses on establishing standards for model evaluation, red-teaming, and liability, but contains no provisions for compute capacity limits. **(↓)** — Demonstrates that the legislative focus of relevant committees is on alternative regulatory mechanisms, making a sudden pivot to compute caps highly unlikely.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Economic Competitiveness & National Security (↓, Large):** The dominant narrative in Washington is that the US is in an "AI race" with China. Policymakers view domestic compute proliferation as a strategic asset to maintain a technological lead, making restrictions counter-intuitive and politically difficult.
*   **Legislative Inertia (↓, Large):** The US legislative process is notoriously slow and subject to gridlock. Passing a novel, complex, and economically significant piece of legislation in the less than two months remaining before the deadline is nearly impossible without a universally recognized crisis.
*   **Industry Lobbying (↓, Moderate):** The tech industry possesses immense financial and political power. It would lobby fiercely against any measure that directly curtails its primary means of production and innovation, framing it as a threat to American jobs and leadership.
*   **Catastrophic AI Incident (↑, Small):** A public, undeniable, and large-scale disaster directly attributable to an advanced AI model (e.g., a major cyberattack, critical infrastructure failure, or mass disinformation event) is the most plausible driver for emergency action. However, the probability of such an event occurring and being immediately legislated against within the timeframe is low.
*   **Executive Action via Emergency Powers (↑, Small):** The President could potentially use emergency powers (e.g., via an Executive Order citing national security) to impose restrictions, bypassing Congress. This is the most viable, albeit still unlikely, path to a "YES" resolution. It would be legally contentious and politically explosive.
*   **Focus on Alternative Regulations (↓, Moderate):** The policy community is coalescing around other regulatory ideas: mandatory audits, pre-deployment certification, liability frameworks, and watermarking. These are seen as more targeted and less economically damaging than blunt compute caps, diverting political energy away from the latter.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dual-Use Nature:** Unlike nuclear material, whose primary use is for weapons or power, compute is a fundamentally general-purpose technology driving a huge swath of the modern economy. Restricting it has far broader and more severe economic consequences.
*   **Abstract & Speculative Harms:** The primary risks motivating compute caps (e.g., uncontrollable superintelligence) are speculative and not widely understood by the public or policymakers, unlike the concrete dangers of explosives or bioweapons. This makes it harder to build political consensus for drastic action.
*   **Unprecedented Speed:** The pace of AI development is faster than any previous technological wave. This could theoretically shorten policy reaction times (argument for ↑), but in practice, it makes it harder for slow-moving government to define, measure, and regulate the target effectively.
*   **Economic Centrality:** The companies building the largest compute clusters are also the drivers of US stock market performance and economic growth. The political will to directly cap their growth is exceptionally low, especially absent a crisis.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior, around 2-5%, is appropriate, reflecting the extreme rarity of such direct economic interventions, the lack of precedent, and the exceptionally short time horizon. (Equivalent n of ~20-50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓, Large) Forward-looking corporate capex plans show a massive, multi-hundred-billion-dollar bet on an unrestricted compute environment.
    *   (↓, Moderate) The current legislative and international policy discourse is focused on alternative, "softer" regulations, not hard caps.
    *   (↓, Moderate) The powerful "competition with China" narrative provides a strong political barrier to any self-imposed limitations.
    *   (↑, Small) The *only* plausible path to YES is a low-probability black swan event triggering non-standard emergency executive action.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence strongly reinforces the low prior. The posterior should be revised downwards, likely to the 1-2% range, reflecting that only a true "bolt from the blue" crisis could cause this to happen.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A high-level, credible warning from intelligence agencies about AI-enabled national security threats (e.g., breaking encryption) being leaked to the press.
    *   The White House convening an emergency summit with Congressional leadership and AI lab CEOs following a major AI-related incident.
    *   Leaked drafts of an Executive Order or emergency legislation that includes specific compute thresholds (e.g., measured in petaflops).
    *   Sudden, unexplained halts in the construction of major new data centers.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Major tech companies (NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Amazon) announcing even larger, record-breaking capex plans for 2026.
    *   The President signing an AI-focused bill or Executive Order that deals only with transparency, reporting, and evaluation standards.
    *   Key senators or committee chairs publicly dismissing the idea of compute caps as "unworkable" or "anti-competitive."
    *   The end of the current legislative session with no relevant bill having been introduced.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Risk:** This forecast is highly vulnerable to a sudden, paradigm-shifting event. A catastrophic AI failure could make politically impossible things possible overnight.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on "restrictions on the total amount of compute capacity." A law imposing onerous reporting or security requirements *above* a certain threshold could be interpreted as a restriction, even if not an outright cap.
*   **Executive Action:** The primary uncertainty lies in the potential for the executive branch to act unilaterally. This bypasses all the standard models of legislative inertia and is much harder to predict.
*   **Classified Information:** The most potent driver for a "YES" outcome—a national security threat—would likely develop out of public view within the intelligence community, offering no leading indicators.
*   **Time Horizon:** With less than two months to resolution, the probability of any standard legislative process completing is functionally zero. The forecast is almost entirely a bet on the probability of an emergency action.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability is extremely low. The combination of a powerful pro-innovation/anti-China political consensus, massive industry investment predicated on unrestricted growth, and extreme legislative inertia creates overwhelming momentum against the passage of such a radical policy in the next two months.

To forecast the probability of the US placing restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major, novel US federal economic regulation (Class 1) is extremely low, likely <1%, due to the rarity and contentious nature of such legislation. For restrictions on domestic possession of a specific technology/resource (Class 2), the base rate is near 0% because such restrictions are unprecedented for a general-purpose technology like compute. Export controls (Class 3) are more common but focus on foreign adversaries, not domestic limits, with a base rate effectively at 0% for turning inward. Given these considerations, a prior probability of around 2% is reasonable, reflecting the extreme rarity and lack of precedent for such restrictions.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the base case in that there is no historical precedent for restricting compute capacity domestically. It differs in the rapid development of AI and the speculative risks associated with it, which could theoretically prompt novel regulatory responses. However, the economic centrality of compute and the political narrative of AI competition with China make restrictions unlikely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Corporate Capex Plans (↓, Large):** Companies are planning massive expansions, indicating no anticipation of restrictions. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
   - **Legislative Focus (↓, Moderate):** Current legislative efforts focus on alternative regulations, not compute caps, decreasing the probability.
   - **Political Narrative (↓, Moderate):** The AI race with China narrative discourages self-imposed limitations, decreasing the probability.
   - **Black Swan Event (↑, Small):** A catastrophic AI incident could prompt emergency action, slightly increasing the probability.
   - **Executive Action (↑, Small):** The possibility of executive action via emergency powers exists but is unlikely, slightly increasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 2%, the strong evidence against restrictions (corporate plans, legislative focus, political narrative) significantly outweighs the small likelihood of a black swan event or executive action. Thus, the posterior probability should be revised downward to around 1%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The forecast could be vulnerable to underestimating the impact of a sudden AI-related crisis. However, the short time frame and current political and economic context make such a shift unlikely. An alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher probability if one assumes a higher likelihood of executive action, but this remains speculative.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the analysis, the final forecast is a 1% probability that the US will place restrictions on compute capacity before 2026.

Final: 1%

# Will the US place restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of the US implementing compute capacity restrictions before 2026 (within the next 2 months).

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Major novel US federal economic regulations on emerging technologies
- US restrictions on domestic possession of specific technologies/resources
- Emergency technology regulations implemented in short timeframes

Looking at historical precedents, the US has rarely imposed direct quantitative limits on productive economic resources in peacetime. Even during crises, such regulations typically take years to develop and implement. Given the extremely short timeframe (2 months), the novelty of the regulation type, and the economic significance, I'll set a very low prior.

**Prior probability: 3%**

This reflects the extreme rarity of such direct economic interventions in the US regulatory system, especially with such a compressed timeline.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other regulated technologies (nuclear materials, certain chemicals), AI compute could potentially pose security risks
- The US has precedent for regulating strategically important technologies (export controls)
- There is growing concern about AI safety among policymakers

**Key differences:**
- Unlike nuclear materials or biological agents, compute is a general-purpose technology driving broad economic growth
- The harms motivating compute caps are largely speculative and future-oriented, not immediate and concrete
- The companies building large compute clusters are central to US economic competitiveness
- The US is in a perceived "AI race" with China, making self-imposed limitations politically difficult
- The extremely short timeframe (2 months) makes standard legislative processes virtually impossible

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Corporate capital expenditure plans**
- Meta and other tech giants are publicly announcing "notably larger" capital expenditure growth for 2026
- J.P. Morgan reports FY2026 capex estimates for major tech firms have surged to over $400 billion for AI infrastructure
- Likelihood ratio: These companies would be extremely unlikely to make such massive, public financial commitments if they anticipated imminent government restrictions. P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Current policy focus**
- Current AI policy discussions focus on transparency, evaluation standards, and liability frameworks
- No major compute restriction bills have been introduced in Congress
- Likelihood ratio: If restrictions were imminent, we would expect to see draft legislation or executive orders in circulation. P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: National security and competitiveness narrative**
- The dominant political narrative frames AI development as critical for national security and economic competitiveness with China
- Likelihood ratio: This narrative directly contradicts the logic of domestic compute restrictions. P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Timeframe constraints**
- Less than 2 months remain before the resolution date
- Standard legislative processes typically take many months or years
- Likelihood ratio: The compressed timeline makes normal legislative action virtually impossible. P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 0.1/0.95 = 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3% (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32):

**Update on corporate capex plans:**
- Prior odds: 0.031 (3:97)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 0.11 = 0.0034 (0.34:99.66)
- Posterior probability: 0.0034/(1+0.0034) ≈ 0.34%

**Update on current policy focus:**
- Prior odds: 0.0034 (0.34:99.66)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.0034 × 0.25 = 0.00085 (0.085:99.915)
- Posterior probability: 0.00085/(1+0.00085) ≈ 0.085%

**Update on national security narrative:**
- Prior odds: 0.00085 (0.085:99.915)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.00085 × 0.33 = 0.00028 (0.028:99.972)
- Posterior probability: 0.00028/(1+0.00028) ≈ 0.028%

**Update on timeframe constraints:**
- Prior odds: 0.00028 (0.028:99.972)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.00028 × 0.11 = 0.000031 (0.0031:99.9969)
- Posterior probability: 0.000031/(1+0.000031) ≈ 0.0031%

This extremely low probability (0.0031%) seems unreasonably low, as it doesn't adequately account for black swan events or emergency executive actions.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of emergency executive action bypassing normal legislative processes
- A catastrophic AI-related incident could dramatically accelerate political timelines
- Classified intelligence about AI risks could be driving policy behind the scenes
- The definition of "restrictions" could be interpreted broadly to include regulations that indirectly limit compute

**Alternative scenarios:**
- An AI system causes a major cybersecurity incident, prompting emergency executive action
- Intelligence agencies discover a critical vulnerability that could be exploited by advanced AI systems
- The President issues an Executive Order citing national security concerns that includes compute thresholds

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability upward to account for these low-probability but plausible scenarios. The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 1.5%, which suggests my calculation may be too low.

I'll adjust my final forecast to 1%, which still reflects the extremely low likelihood but acknowledges the non-zero possibility of emergency action or black swan events.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the passage of a novel, significant, and economically restrictive federal regulation within a very short time frame (approximately two months). I will consider two reference classes:
1.  **Major, Contentious US Legislation:** Landmark laws like the Affordable Care Act or Dodd-Frank take years of debate, not weeks. The probability of a completely new and controversial law being introduced and passed within a two-month window, especially over a holiday period, is exceedingly low. A base rate from this class would be well under 1%.
2.  **Restrictions on Domestic Possession of Technology:** The US has restricted domestic access to things like nuclear materials or specific biological agents. However, these are typically justified by clear, immediate, and catastrophic physical security risks. Compute is a general-purpose technology central to the modern economy, and the primary risks cited for restricting it (e.g., AGI) are speculative. Applying this type of restriction to a core economic input is unprecedented.

Given the extreme rarity of such rapid legislative action on a complex new issue, I will set a conservative prior probability. I'll start with a **prior of 2% (P(H) = 0.02)**. This is low, reflecting the high bar for passage, but slightly higher than a pure historical base rate to account for the unprecedented speed of AI development, which could theoretically accelerate policy responses. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** Like other major economic regulations, this would face immense industry lobbying, political gridlock, and partisan disagreement. The technical complexity would also slow down the legislative process.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **National Security Framing (Decreases Probability):** The dominant narrative in Washington is the "AI race" with China. This creates a powerful incentive to *accelerate* domestic compute development, not restrict it. This is a strong force against the proposed regulation.
    *   **Nature of Harm (Decreases Probability):** Unlike the 2008 financial crisis or a clear environmental disaster, the harms motivating compute caps are largely speculative and not widely understood by the public or policymakers, making it difficult to build the political consensus needed for such a drastic measure.
    *   **Economic Centrality (Decreases Probability):** Compute is a foundational resource for America's most valuable companies and a key driver of economic growth. Restricting it would have far broader and more immediate negative economic consequences than most historical regulations.

The differences from the base case overwhelmingly suggest that this specific type of regulation is even less likely than a typical major bill.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The research report provides several recent and highly relevant pieces of evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Corporate Capital Expenditure (Capex) Plans.** J.P. Morgan and Meta's Q3 2025 earnings calls indicate that major tech companies are planning record-breaking investments (hundreds of billions of dollars) in AI infrastructure for 2026.
    *   **P(E | H):** The likelihood of companies publicly committing to massive future spending if they anticipated imminent government restrictions is extremely low.
    *   **P(E | ~H):** The likelihood of these announcements if no restrictions were expected is very high; it is the rational course of action in a competitive market.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H))**: This is very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Current Policy Trajectory.** Recent (hypothetical) international summits and domestic legislation focus on "softer" regulations like voluntary frameworks, model evaluation, and liability, not hard compute caps.
    *   **P(E | H):** If the US were about to impose hard caps, the preceding policy discourse would likely have shifted in that direction. It has not.
    *   **P(E | ~H):** This focus on alternative regulations is exactly what we would expect if hard caps were considered politically unviable.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: This is small (< 1). This evidence also **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Plausible Causal Path.** The only identified plausible path to a "YES" resolution is a catastrophic AI incident that triggers an emergency Executive Order, bypassing the normal legislative process. All other major drivers (economic competition, legislative inertia, industry lobbying) point strongly to "NO". This frames the "YES" outcome as a low-probability black swan event.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds**: 1:49 (2% probability).
*   **Update Step**: The evidence from corporate capex plans is a powerful signal. Let's assign a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/5 to this evidence (i.e., these announcements are 5 times more likely if no restrictions are coming).
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/49) × (1/5) = 1/245.
    *   Posterior Probability = 1 / (1 + 245) ≈ 0.4%.
*   The other evidence (policy trajectory) pushes this even lower. The combined evidence strongly refutes the initial, already low, prior. The updated probability should be very low, primarily representing the small chance of the black swan scenario. A probability in the 0.5% to 1.5% range seems appropriate after this update.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis concludes the probability is very low. What could I be missing?
*   **The Black Swan:** My forecast is essentially a bet against a major, paradigm-shifting AI disaster in the next two months. Such events are by definition hard to predict, and I could be underestimating their likelihood.
*   **Classified Information:** The strongest trigger for an emergency action would be a national security threat known only to the government. If intelligence agencies discovered a critical AI-enabled vulnerability (e.g., one that breaks encryption), the executive branch could act swiftly and without public warning.
*   **Ambiguous Resolution:** The term "restrictions" is broad. It might not mean a hard cap, but rather onerous reporting, registration, or security requirements above a certain compute threshold. Such a "softer" restriction is more plausible to be enacted via an Executive Order than an outright ban, though still very unlikely in the timeframe.

The most plausible path to a "YES" is a severe event (public or classified) leading to an emergency Executive Order. Let's estimate this probability: P(YES) ≈ P(Trigger Event) × P(This Specific Policy Response | Event). I estimate a ~10% chance of a trigger event in the next two months and a ~10% chance that this specific, drastic policy is the chosen response. This yields a 1% probability (0.10 * 0.10 = 0.01). This aligns with the Manifold market (1.5%) and the research report's summary (1-2% range).

### 6. Final Forecast
The combination of an extremely short two-month timeframe, powerful economic and national security incentives against domestic restrictions, and a legislative process characterized by inertia makes this event highly improbable. The public evidence from corporate investment plans strongly reinforces this conclusion. The only viable path to a "YES" is a low-probability "black swan" event triggering an emergency executive action. A 1% probability appropriately captures this tail risk without overstating it.

Final: 1%
