### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Politically-motivated credential revocations in the first Trump administration (2017–2021):** This is the most relevant reference class. During this four-year period, there were several high-profile, politically-motivated revocations or suspensions of credentials for individual reporters (e.g., Jim Acosta of CNN, Kaitlan Collins of CNN, Brian Karem of Playboy). While the background notes "dozens" had passes revoked, many of these were for not meeting attendance requirements, a more bureaucratic culling. The key is the politically-motivated act. The question requires action against reporters from at least *two* outlets. While individual actions were taken, a coordinated action against two outlets in a single event was not a feature of the first term. **Base Rate:** Low. Perhaps a 10-15% chance of an event meeting this specific criteria (≥2 reporters, ≥2 outlets) occurring in any given year of the first administration.
2.  **Major actions by new presidential administrations to control media access (first year):** New administrations often seek to change the rules of engagement with the press. This can range from changing briefing formats to altering access rules. However, revoking credentials of established outlets is an extreme and rare step. Most administrations, even contentious ones, do not resort to this. **Base Rate:** Very low, <5% chance in the first year for a typical administration.
3.  **Credential denials by the 2024 Trump campaign:** During the campaign, access was denied to reporters from numerous outlets (e.g., The Washington Post, MSNBC, Politico) for specific events. This is a strong precedent for behavior but differs from revoking formal White House credentials, which implies a more permanent and official status. **Base Rate:** High for event-specific denials, but this class doesn't directly map to formal WH credential revocation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-19** White House issues a statement titled "ABC 'News' Is Fake News," directly attacking the network's credibility and listing grievances. **(↑↑)** This is a direct, high-level, and recent signal of extreme hostility towards a specific major media outlet, providing a potential predicate for action.
*   **2025-03-25** Cyber Defense Magazine reports on sophisticated foreign disinformation campaigns during the 2024 election. **(↑)** Reinforces the administration's narrative that the information space is a battleground, providing justification for cracking down on outlets deemed "disinformation."
*   **2025-01-31** The Metaculus question opens, indicating this is a plausible and anticipated scenario for a second Trump administration. **(↑)** Reflects expert and public belief that such an action is a real possibility, not a black swan event.
*   **2024-11-05** The Trump campaign denies credentials to many journalists for its election night event. **(↑)** Demonstrates a recent and continued willingness to use access as a tool to punish or exclude outlets deemed unfriendly.
*   **2024-08-15** Brennan Center reports on Project 2025's goal to dismantle efforts to stop disinformation and retaliate against media. **(↑↑)** This is not just rhetoric, but a pre-formulated strategic plan to be more aggressive and systematic in confronting the media than in the first term.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Retaliation for specific reporting (Large):** The most likely trigger. A story or line of questioning perceived as unfair, false, or damaging could provoke a swift, punitive revocation to "punish" the outlet and reporter. The recent attack on ABC News suggests they are a prime target.
2.  **Narrative control and chilling effect (Large):** Revoking credentials from two outlets, especially prominent ones, sends a powerful message to the entire press corps to soften critical coverage, effectively "chilling" aggressive reporting.
3.  **Executing the Project 2025 agenda (Moderate):** The administration may feel a mandate to act on its stated plans to fundamentally alter the relationship with the press. This would be a proactive, strategic move rather than a reactive, emotional one.
4.  **Rallying the political base (Moderate):** Actions against the "fake news media" are highly popular with the president's core supporters and can serve as a useful distraction from other, less favorable news cycles.
5.  **Legal and institutional pushback (Moderate, ↓):** Outlets and the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) would likely mount a legal challenge, citing First and Fifth Amendment rights. Precedent from the *Sherrill v. Knight* and the Acosta/CNN lawsuit requires due process, which could slow or deter the action.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Systematic vs. Ad Hoc:** The first term's actions were often reactive and seemingly impulsive. The current context is shaped by Project 2025, which provides a strategic and ideological framework for a more systematic and pre-planned confrontation with the media.
*   **Experienced Actors:** The administration is no longer new to Washington. They have four years of experience, understand the legal precedents (like the Acosta lawsuit), and are likely better prepared to justify their actions, however thinly.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in ~5 weeks. This is a key difference. An action must be imminent. This is not about the probability over a full year, but about whether a trigger event will occur *specifically* before January 1, 2026.
*   **Explicit and Recent Threats:** The Nov 19, 2025, statement against ABC News is a direct and unambiguous signal of intent. This level of specific, public targeting of a major network is a significant escalation compared to the general "enemy of the people" rhetoric that characterized the start of the first term.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the base rate from the first Trump term. The chance of an event meeting this specific criteria (≥2 reporters from ≥2 outlets) in a given year was low, maybe 15%. For a ~5-week period, the prior should be very low, perhaps 2-3% (15% / 10 periods of ~5 weeks). Let's call the prior weak, with an equivalent n of ~20.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The Nov 19 WH statement explicitly targeting ABC News. This provides a named target and a potential casus belli, dramatically increasing the short-term probability.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** The existence of Project 2025's playbook suggests a lower threshold for action and a more prepared administration, making such a move more likely than in the first term.
    *   **↑ Small:** The pattern of denying campaign access shows a continued disposition, but is weaker evidence for revoking formal WH credentials.
    *   **↓ Moderate:** The extremely short time horizon. Such actions often require a specific trigger. Without a clear, imminent trigger, the default is inaction.
    *   **↓ Small:** Legal precedent from the Acosta case requires the White House to provide due process, potentially complicating a quick, multi-outlet revocation.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the recent, direct threat against ABC, provides a strong upward update that largely overwhelms the low prior set by the short timeframe. The posterior should move significantly higher.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The White House Press Secretary or other officials name-checking a second media outlet or specific reporters in a hostile manner.
    *   A particularly contentious news story published by a major outlet (e.g., ABC, CNN, WaPo) that elicits a furious response from the President.
    *   Announcement of new, more restrictive "rules of conduct" for the White House press corps.
    *   A heated, personal exchange between the President/Press Secretary and multiple reporters during a press conference.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The White House becomes consumed by a different major policy or political issue, shifting focus away from the media.
    *   Statements from the WHCA or legal challenges that appear to make the administration pause.
    *   A period of several weeks with no significant anti-media rhetoric from the administration.
    *   The President granting exclusive interviews to outlets he typically criticizes, suggesting a temporary change in strategy.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Precision:** The resolution requires revoking credentials of *reporters* from at least *two* different outlets. Revoking one reporter's pass, or two from the same outlet, would not trigger a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Revocation vs. Other Sanctions:** The action must be a "revocation" of credentials (e.g., the hard pass). Denying access to a specific briefing, event, or Air Force One trip does not count.
*   **Short Timeframe Volatility:** Predicting an event within a ~5-week window is highly uncertain. The probability is sensitive to daily events; a single inflammatory news report could act as a trigger.
*   **Source Reliability:** Resolution depends on "credible sources." The White House might announce it, but if it's immediately stayed by a court, the exact resolution could depend on Metaculus's interpretation of whether the revocation was effective.
*   **Hypothetical Evidence:** The provided source "ABC 'News' Is Fake News" is dated in the future and is the strongest piece of evidence. This brief assumes it is a factual event within the scenario.

**Final Research Summary:**
The administration's established hostility towards the press, combined with a strategic playbook (Project 2025) and a recent, direct threat against a specific outlet (ABC News), significantly elevates the probability of this event occurring, despite the very short time horizon. The primary uncertainty is not one of intent, but of timing and finding a suitable pretext before the deadline.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the politically-motivated credential revocations during the first Trump administration (2017–2021). During this period, there were several high-profile revocations, but not a coordinated action against two outlets simultaneously. The base rate for such an event occurring in any given year was estimated at 10-15%. Given the short timeframe of ~5 weeks, the prior probability should be adjusted to a very low level, around 2-3%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current administration has shown a willingness to deny access to reporters, similar to the first term. The recent statement against ABC News indicates a continuation of hostile rhetoric.
   - Differences: The presence of Project 2025 suggests a more systematic approach to media relations, potentially increasing the likelihood of coordinated actions. The short timeframe is a significant constraint, as such actions typically require a specific trigger.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Nov 19, 2025, statement against ABC News**: This is a strong indicator of potential action, significantly increasing the likelihood of revocation (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - **Project 2025's agenda**: Suggests a strategic framework for media confrontation, moderately increasing the likelihood (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - **Campaign denial of credentials**: Shows a pattern of behavior but is weaker evidence for formal revocation (Likelihood ratio slightly > 1).
   - **Legal and institutional pushback**: Could deter or delay action, decreasing the likelihood (Likelihood ratio < 1).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 2-3% translates to odds of approximately 1:49.
   - Likelihood ratio: The strong evidence from the Nov 19 statement and Project 2025 increases the odds significantly. Assuming a combined likelihood ratio of around 3, the posterior odds become approximately 3:49.
   - Posterior probability: (3/49) / (1 + 3/49) ≈ 5.8%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The short timeframe and legal challenges could prevent action, suggesting caution in overestimating the probability.
   - Alternative scenario: The administration might focus on other priorities, reducing the likelihood of revocation.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence but significant constraints, a slight downward adjustment is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and constraints, the final probability is adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood due to recent developments but tempered by the short timeframe and potential legal challenges.

Final: 6%

# Will the White House revoke the media credentials of reporters from two media outlets before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant historical data. The most appropriate reference class is the first Trump administration (2017-2021), where there were several instances of individual reporters having credentials revoked or suspended.

During the first Trump administration:
- Individual reporters had credentials revoked (Jim Acosta of CNN, Brian Karem of Playboy)
- The White House attempted a broader culling of press passes in 2019
- However, there wasn't a coordinated action against multiple reporters from at least two different outlets simultaneously

Given that the question requires:
1. Formal revocation (not just denial of access to specific events)
2. Affecting reporters from at least two different outlets
3. Occurring within approximately 5 weeks (from now until January 1, 2026)

**Prior probability:** 15% annually for the first Trump term, which translates to roughly 1.5% for a 5-week period.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Same administration leadership with established hostility toward mainstream media
- Legal precedent from the first term (Acosta case) still applies
- Similar rhetoric about "fake news" continues

**Key differences:**
- The administration now has experience and likely understands the legal boundaries better
- Project 2025 provides a strategic framework for more systematic confrontation with media
- The November 19, 2025 statement directly targeting ABC News represents a significant escalation
- The administration may feel emboldened after winning a second term
- The extremely short timeframe (5 weeks) limits the probability of action

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: White House statement "ABC 'News' Is Fake News" (November 19, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If credentials will be revoked, we would expect to see this kind of direct attack first
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even without planning to revoke credentials, such statements occur
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This significantly increases the probability, as it identifies a specific target and establishes a potential justification

**Evidence 2: Project 2025's media strategy**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A strategic plan to confront media would precede credential revocations
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Such plans exist regardless of whether this specific action occurs
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This moderately increases the probability, showing intent and preparation

**Evidence 3: Campaign denial of credentials (November 2024)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.7) - Past behavior of denying access is consistent with future credential revocation
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.5) - Campaign behavior doesn't always translate to White House actions
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This slightly increases the probability, demonstrating willingness to restrict access

**Evidence 4: Short timeframe (5 weeks)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If revocation occurs, it would need to happen quickly
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Most 5-week periods pass without such actions
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.22
- This significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.015/(1-0.015) ≈ 0.0152

Update with Evidence 1 (ABC News statement):
- Posterior odds = 0.0152 × 3.0 ≈ 0.0456
- Posterior probability = 0.0456/(1+0.0456) ≈ 0.044 or 4.4%

Update with Evidence 2 (Project 2025):
- Posterior odds = 0.0456 × 1.6 ≈ 0.073
- Posterior probability = 0.073/(1+0.073) ≈ 0.068 or 6.8%

Update with Evidence 3 (Campaign credential denial):
- Posterior odds = 0.073 × 1.4 ≈ 0.102
- Posterior probability = 0.102/(1+0.102) ≈ 0.093 or 9.3%

Update with Evidence 4 (Short timeframe):
- Posterior odds = 0.102 × 0.22 ≈ 0.022
- Posterior probability = 0.022/(1+0.022) ≈ 0.022 or 2.2%

However, I need to consider that the ABC News statement is very recent (5 days ago) and represents a significant escalation that may be a direct precursor to action. This suggests the short timeframe may be less of a constraint than initially calculated.

Adjusting for this consideration:
- Revised posterior probability: ~15%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating how quickly the administration can act when motivated
- The ABC News statement could be part of a coordinated plan to target multiple outlets in sequence
- Legal challenges might not deter immediate action even if they eventually succeed
- The administration might be planning a broader media access restructuring that would affect multiple outlets

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The administration might use different mechanisms to restrict access without formally "revoking credentials"
- A major breaking news story in the next few weeks could trigger immediate retaliation
- The administration might wait until after January 1 for strategic reasons

**Counterarguments:**
- The administration may be focused on other priorities in its early days
- Legal precedent from the Acosta case requires due process
- Revoking credentials creates unnecessary legal battles the administration might prefer to avoid

After considering these factors, I believe my estimate of 15% is reasonable but should be adjusted slightly upward to account for the recent escalation against ABC News and the possibility of rapid action.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, particularly the recent direct attack on ABC News, the strategic framework of Project 2025, and the administration's established pattern of restricting media access, balanced against the short timeframe and legal constraints, I arrive at a final probability of 20%.

Final: 20%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is the revocation of White House media credentials for reporters from at least two different outlets before January 1, 2026. The most relevant reference class is the first Trump administration (2017-2021).

During that four-year term, there were several high-profile, politically-motivated revocations or suspensions of credentials for individual reporters (e.g., Jim Acosta of CNN). However, a coordinated action against reporters from two or more different outlets did not occur. The research report suggests a base rate of 10-15% for such an event happening in any given year of that administration.

The question covers a very short timeframe: from November 24, 2025, to January 1, 2026, which is approximately 5 weeks, or about 1/10th of a year. A simple linear scaling of the annual base rate (15% / 10) would suggest a prior probability of 1.5%. To be conservative and account for the fact that such actions are not uniformly distributed, I will set the initial prior probability slightly higher.

*   **Prior P(H):** 3%
*   **Prior Odds:** 3:97 or approximately 1:32

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case of the first Trump administration in several key ways:

*   **Similarities:** The President and his general animosity towards media outlets he deems "fake news" remain constant. The political environment is similarly polarized.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Systematic Planning:** The existence of "Project 2025," as mentioned in the research report, provides a strategic framework for a more organized and aggressive confrontation with the media. This suggests actions are more likely to be pre-planned and systematic rather than purely reactive and ad-hoc as they sometimes appeared in the first term.
    *   **Experience:** The administration is no longer new. It has four years of experience, including navigating the legal challenges that followed the revocation of Jim Acosta's press pass. This experience may make them better prepared and less hesitant to act again.
    *   **Specific, Recent Threats:** The hypothetical White House statement from November 19, 2025, titled "ABC 'News' Is Fake News," represents a significant escalation. It moves beyond general rhetoric to officially and publicly target a specific major news network, providing a clear potential target and a predicate for action.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence provided in the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Project 2025's agenda to retaliate against media.**
    *   This evidence suggests a higher-than-baseline intent to act. If the White House were to revoke credentials (H), it's very likely this would be consistent with a pre-existing plan like Project 2025 (P(E|H) is high). If they don't revoke credentials (~H), it could be for other reasons, but the plan's existence still makes the general environment more hostile.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)):** Moderately greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: (Hypothetical) Nov 19, 2025, White House statement targeting ABC News.**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It is recent, specific, and official.
    *   P(E|H): If the administration were planning to revoke credentials from two outlets in the next five weeks, it is extremely likely that such an action would be preceded by this exact type of public justification against at least one of the targets. P(E|H) is very high.
    *   P(E|~H): If the administration were *not* planning to revoke credentials, would they still issue such a statement? It's possible, as pure rhetoric to rally the base. However, such a direct official attack creates an expectation of follow-up action. Failing to act could be perceived as weakness. Therefore, issuing the statement is less likely in a world with no planned action. P(E|~H) is moderate to low.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)):** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence provides a named target and a recent casus belli, dramatically increasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a conceptual update based on the evidence.

*   **Initial State:** The prior odds are very low (1:32 or ~3%) due to the short timeframe and the high bar of the event (≥2 outlets).
*   **Update with Evidence:** The evidence of a systematic plan (Project 2025) and, most importantly, the direct and recent threat against ABC News, fundamentally changes the situation. The question is no longer "Would they ever do this?" but rather "Will they follow through on this recent threat, and will they include a second outlet, within the next five weeks?"
*   **Posterior Calculation Sketch:**
    *   Prior Odds: 1:32
    *   Combined Likelihood Ratio: The statement against ABC is a very strong signal (LR perhaps 4-5x), and Project 2025 adds to this (LR perhaps 1.5-2x). The combined LR is substantial, let's estimate it at around 7.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × LR = (1:32) × 7 = 7:32
    *   Posterior Probability = 7 / (7 + 32) = 7 / 39 ≈ 18%

This calculation feels a bit mechanical. Let's reason it through differently. The Nov 19 statement makes action against ABC highly plausible. The main uncertainties are (a) the short timeline and (b) the inclusion of a second outlet. Given the administration's style and the goal of a broad chilling effect, bundling a second perennial target like CNN or The Washington Post seems strategically plausible. The primary constraint is inertia and the holiday season. The statement, however, creates momentum for action. I believe the probability is higher than 18%. The statement is such a strong signal of imminent intent that it should overcome much of the low prior. I will adjust my estimate upward from the mechanical calculation.

*   **Summarized Posterior:** The evidence strongly suggests a high level of intent. The probability is significantly elevated from the base rate but remains below 50% due to the very short timeframe and the possibility that the threat is just rhetoric or that action is delayed. I assess the probability to be in the 30-40% range.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Argument for a Lower Forecast (<20%):** I may be over-reading the Nov 19 statement. It could be performative rhetoric with no planned follow-up, a common pattern. The legal and political costs of such an unprecedented move against two major outlets are immense, and the short, holiday-disrupted timeframe makes concerted government action difficult. Inertia is a powerful force.
*   **Argument for a Higher Forecast (>50%):** I may be underestimating the administration's commitment to its agenda. The statement against ABC could be the final public justification before a pre-planned action. In this view, the action is already decided, and the only uncertainty is the exact day it occurs. Finding a pretext to add a second outlet would be trivial.
*   **Conclusion:** My forecast of 35% attempts to balance these competing views. It acknowledges that the specific, recent threat makes the event a very real possibility (far more than the base rate suggests) but respects the significant practical hurdles to executing such a controversial action in the next five weeks.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for this specific event (revocation of credentials for ≥2 outlets) in a short timeframe is very low. However, the evidence provided, particularly the hypothetical November 19th White House statement explicitly targeting ABC News, is a powerful signal of specific and immediate intent. This, combined with the strategic framework of Project 2025, substantially increases the probability. The primary limiting factors are the very short time until the end of the year and the possibility that the statement is merely rhetoric. Balancing the strong evidence of intent against these constraints leads to my final forecast.

Final: 35%
