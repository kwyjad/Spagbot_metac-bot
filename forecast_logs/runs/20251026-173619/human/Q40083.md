### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-COVID US Debt Growth in Final Calendar Quarter (Q4):** This is the most specific reference class. It captures recent fiscal regimes (high deficits, elevated interest rates).
    *   **Derivation:** Examining the change in Total Public Debt Outstanding from Sep 30 to Dec 31 in recent years.
        *   Q4 2023: Increase of ~$834 billion.
        *   Q4 2022: Increase of ~$548 billion (influenced by debt ceiling anticipation).
        *   Q4 2021: Increase of ~$1,296 billion.
    *   **Base Rate:** The average Q4 increase is ~$893 billion. The question asks if the debt will increase by less than ~$400 billion from its current level of ~$38.1T (extrapolated to late Oct 2025). A <$400B increase has not occurred in this recent period. This suggests a low base rate for "Yes," perhaps **10-15%**.
    *   **Limitations:** A small sample size (n=3) makes this sensitive to outliers. The specific political and economic context of each year differs.

2.  **Two-Month Debt Increases in the 2020s:** This class broadens the sample to any two-month period since 2020, capturing the general high-deficit environment.
    *   **Derivation:** The average monthly debt increase since January 2023 has been approximately $210 billion. A two-month period would therefore average a ~$420 billion increase.
    *   **Base Rate:** The probability of a two-month increase being *less than* $400 billion is likely below 50%. Given the current momentum, a base rate for "Yes" of **20-30%** seems plausible.
    *   **Limitations:** This method smooths out intra-quarter volatility. End-of-year spending and revenue patterns can make Q4 systematically different from other periods.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*The horizon is ~2 months, so the focus is on the last 6 months.*
*   **[2025-10-24]** Debt to the Penny data shows Total Public Debt at **$38.10 trillion**. ↓ — This is a hypothetical but realistic data point based on the provided article. It leaves only $400 billion of headroom before the $38.5 trillion threshold is breached.
*   **[2025-10-18]** News reports debt at $37.9 trillion, with a recent daily increase of ~$25 billion. ↓ — While the daily rate may be volatile, it highlights the high velocity of recent debt accumulation, far exceeding the ~$6B/day rate needed to stay under the threshold.
*   **[2025-10-08]** CBO confirms a projected $1.8 trillion deficit for Fiscal Year 2025 (which began Oct 1, 2025). ↓ — This reinforces the expectation of continued, substantial government borrowing, averaging nearly $5 billion per day from the deficit alone.
*   **[2025-08-13]** Debt officially surpassed $37 trillion. ↓ — Reaching this milestone demonstrates the sustained, rapid pace of borrowing throughout 2025, setting a strong trend line pointing well past $38.5 trillion by year-end.
*   **[2025-07-XX]** Debt ceiling was raised (per background article). ↓ — This action removed the primary legislative brake that could have artificially held the debt level flat for a period.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Structural Deficit (Spending vs. Revenue):** The fundamental driver. Mandatory spending (Social Security, Medicare), defense, and interest payments consistently outpace tax revenues. This is a **large** driver pushing the debt up (↓ for YES).
2.  **Interest on the Debt:** With higher prevailing interest rates, payments on newly issued and rolled-over debt are a significant and growing expenditure. This is a **moderate-to-large** driver, compounding the deficit (↓ for YES).
3.  **Economic Performance:** Stronger-than-expected Q4 economic growth could boost corporate and individual tax receipts, slightly reducing borrowing needs. This is a **small** driver with a minor effect over a two-month horizon (↑ for YES).
4.  **Government Shutdown:** A failure by Congress to pass appropriations bills or a continuing resolution could lead to a government shutdown. This would halt non-essential spending and dramatically slow the rate of debt accumulation for the duration of the shutdown. This is the most significant potential upside factor and a **large** driver if it occurs (↑ for YES).
5.  **Treasury Cash Balance & Issuance Schedule:** The Treasury manages a cash balance (TGA). Decisions to draw down cash can temporarily slow debt issuance, while decisions to build it up can accelerate it. This creates short-term volatility but is a **small-to-moderate** driver over a two-month period.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Elevated Interest Costs:** Compared to the 2010s and early 2020s, current interest rates are significantly higher, making interest expenses a more aggressive driver of the deficit than in most prior periods.
*   **Proximity to Threshold:** The starting point for the forecast period (~$38.1T) is unusually close to the threshold ($38.5T), leaving very little room for normal levels of borrowing. The required increase is less than half the average Q4 increase seen in recent years.
*   **Political Environment:** Heightened political polarization increases the probability of fiscal brinkmanship, making a government shutdown a more plausible scenario than in periods of unified government or greater cooperation.
*   **Lack of a Debt Ceiling Constraint:** Unlike in 2022, there is no impending debt ceiling deadline to artificially suppress the debt level through "extraordinary measures." The borrowing path is unconstrained.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the reference class of recent Q4 debt increases, would be a low probability of "Yes," perhaps **15%** (equivalent n ≈ 10). This reflects that a <$400B increase in Q4 is historically anomalous.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The current debt level (~$38.1T) is extremely close to the $38.5T threshold, requiring an average daily increase of only ~$6B, versus a recent observed rate of $10B-$25B.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The CBO's FY2025 deficit projection confirms the underlying fiscal imbalance is large and persistent.
    *   ↓ (Small): The absence of a debt ceiling removes a key mechanism that could have artificially flattened the debt curve.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The possibility of a government shutdown in Q4 remains the single most significant factor that could slow borrowing enough to stay under the threshold.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly confirms the low prior. The proximity to the threshold and high recent momentum are powerful negative indicators. The posterior for "Yes" should be revised **sharply downward**, with the main residual uncertainty being the probability and duration of a government shutdown.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   News of congressional deadlock on appropriations bills or continuing resolutions for FY2026 funding.
    *   Official statements from the White House or congressional leaders preparing for a government shutdown.
    *   Weekly Treasury statements showing a significant drawdown in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance.
    *   Unexpectedly strong monthly Treasury statements showing a surplus or a much smaller-than-forecast deficit.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   Successful passage of a continuing resolution or appropriations bills, ensuring government funding through the end of the year.
    *   Announcement of large emergency spending packages (e.g., for natural disasters).
    *   The "Debt to the Penny" tracker crossing $38.3 trillion before mid-December.
    *   Higher-than-expected Treasury auction sizes to fund government operations.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Daily Volatility vs. Trend:** The national debt does not increase linearly. It moves in discrete, large steps corresponding to Treasury auctions and major payments. A simple daily average projection can be misleading over short periods.
*   **Shutdown Dynamics:** The impact of a government shutdown is not binary

To forecast whether the US national debt will be under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate comes from examining recent Q4 debt increases, which have averaged around $893 billion. Given that the debt is currently at $38.1 trillion, a less than $400 billion increase by year-end would be historically anomalous. Therefore, a base rate for the event occurring ("Yes") is low, around 10-15%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past years with high deficits and no debt ceiling constraints, leading to significant debt increases.
- **Differences:** The debt is closer to the threshold than in previous years, and the political environment may increase the likelihood of a government shutdown, which could slow debt accumulation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Current Debt Level:** At $38.1 trillion, only $400 billion of headroom remains. The recent daily increase of $25 billion suggests a high likelihood of surpassing $38.5 trillion. This evidence decreases the probability of staying under the threshold.
- **CBO Deficit Projection:** A projected $1.8 trillion deficit for FY2025 indicates continued borrowing, decreasing the probability.
- **Government Shutdown Potential:** A shutdown could significantly slow debt accumulation, increasing the probability of staying under the threshold.
- **Interest Rates and Spending:** Elevated interest rates and structural deficits are strong drivers of debt increase, decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** 15% for "Yes."
- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - Current debt level and daily increase: Strongly decreases probability.
  - CBO deficit projection: Moderately decreases probability.
  - Government shutdown potential: Moderately increases probability.
- **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.176
  - Likelihood ratio (net effect): Assume a moderate decrease overall, say 0.5 (due to strong negative indicators).
  - Posterior odds = 0.176 * 0.5 = 0.088
  - Posterior probability = 0.088 / (1 + 0.088) ≈ 0.081 or 8.1%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the impact of a potential government shutdown. However, given the strong negative indicators, the low probability seems justified.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A prolonged government shutdown could significantly alter the debt trajectory. However, the likelihood of such a shutdown lasting long enough to impact the debt significantly is uncertain.
- **Adjustments:** Consider a slight increase in probability to account for the shutdown risk, but the overall impact remains limited.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for a government shutdown, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 10%

# Will the US national debt be under $38.5 trillion on December 31, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical debt growth patterns, particularly focusing on the most recent and relevant time periods.

Looking at the background information, I'll focus on recent debt growth rates:
- The debt is currently at $37.9 trillion (as of October 18, 2025)
- It's growing at approximately $25 billion per day
- It increased by $400 billion in the past month
- It jumped by $1.7 trillion since the debt ceiling was raised in July

The most relevant reference class is the debt growth rate in the final quarter (Q4) of recent years:
- Q4 2023: Increase of ~$834 billion
- Q4 2022: Increase of ~$548 billion
- Q4 2021: Increase of ~$1,296 billion

The average Q4 increase is approximately $893 billion. The question asks if the debt will remain under $38.5 trillion by December 31, 2025, which means it can only increase by about $600 billion from its current level of $37.9 trillion.

Given these historical patterns, I'll set a prior probability of 15% that the debt will remain under $38.5 trillion. This reflects that a Q4 increase of less than $600 billion would be historically unusual but not impossible.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We're in a similar high-deficit fiscal environment as recent years
- The Q4 period typically sees significant debt increases due to seasonal spending patterns
- The structural deficit continues to drive debt accumulation

**Key differences:**
- The current debt growth rate ($25 billion daily) is significantly higher than what would allow staying under the threshold
- At the current daily rate, the debt would increase by approximately $1.65 trillion in 66 days (from Oct 26 to Dec 31), far exceeding the $600 billion "allowance"
- Interest rates remain elevated compared to historical norms, increasing debt servicing costs
- The proximity to the threshold ($37.9T vs $38.5T) leaves very little room for normal levels of borrowing

These differences suggest the prior probability should be adjusted downward.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Current growth rate of $25 billion per day**
- P(E|H): The probability of seeing a $25B/day growth rate if the debt will stay under $38.5T is very low, perhaps 0.1
- P(E|~H): The probability of seeing this growth rate if the debt will exceed $38.5T is very high, perhaps 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Recent monthly increase of $400 billion**
- P(E|H): The probability of a $400B monthly increase if the debt will stay under $38.5T is low, perhaps 0.2
- P(E|~H): The probability of this monthly increase if the debt will exceed $38.5T is high, perhaps 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Absence of debt ceiling constraints**
- P(E|H): The probability of no debt ceiling constraints if the debt will stay under $38.5T is moderate, perhaps 0.4
- P(E|~H): The probability of no constraints if the debt will exceed $38.5T is high, perhaps 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Possibility of government shutdown**
- P(E|H): The probability of a government shutdown if the debt will stay under $38.5T is moderate-high, perhaps 0.7
- P(E|~H): The probability of a shutdown if the debt will exceed $38.5T is low-moderate, perhaps 0.3
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- This increases the probability, as a shutdown would temporarily slow debt accumulation

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with my prior odds of 15%/85% = 0.176

Updating with Evidence 1 (current growth rate):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability = 0.019/(1 + 0.019) ≈ 1.9%

Updating with Evidence 2 (monthly increase):
- Posterior odds = 0.019 × 0.25 = 0.00475
- Posterior probability = 0.00475/(1 + 0.00475) ≈ 0.47%

Updating with Evidence 3 (no debt ceiling constraints):
- Posterior odds = 0.00475 × 0.5 = 0.002375
- Posterior probability = 0.002375/(1 + 0.002375) ≈ 0.24%

Updating with Evidence 4 (government shutdown possibility):
- Posterior odds = 0.002375 × 2.33 = 0.005534
- Posterior probability = 0.005534/(1 + 0.005534) ≈ 0.55%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent growth rates, which could be temporarily elevated
- The Treasury might employ cash management strategies to temporarily slow debt issuance
- A severe economic downturn could reduce government spending in unexpected ways
- Political brinkmanship could lead to a prolonged government shutdown, significantly slowing debt accumulation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major government shutdown lasting several weeks could dramatically slow debt growth
- Treasury could draw down its cash balance rather than issue new debt
- Emergency legislation could implement spending freezes or cuts
- Technical accounting changes could temporarily affect reported debt figures

The most plausible alternative forecast would be around 5-10% probability, based on the possibility of a major government shutdown combined with Treasury cash management tactics. However, even with these factors, the current momentum and proximity to the threshold make staying under $38.5T extremely challenging.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 1%, acknowledging the small but non-zero possibility of extraordinary events that could temporarily halt debt growth.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks about the US national debt on December 31, 2025. The provided context is dated late October 2025. The forecast horizon is approximately two months, specifically within the fourth quarter (Q4) of the calendar year.

An appropriate reference class is the increase in total public debt during Q4 in recent, fiscally similar years (post-COVID, high-deficit environment).
-   **Q4 2023:** Increase of ~$834 billion.
-   **Q4 2022:** Increase of ~$548 billion (artificially suppressed by debt ceiling concerns).
-   **Q4 2021:** Increase of ~$1,296 billion.

The provided information indicates the debt is at $37.9 trillion as of October 18, and a hypothetical but realistic value of $38.1 trillion is used for October 24. Using the $38.1T figure, the debt must increase by less than **$400 billion** in the remaining 68 days of the year to stay under the $38.5 trillion threshold.

Every Q4 increase in the reference class significantly exceeds this $400 billion figure. Even the lowest value ($548B) is nearly 40% higher. This suggests that an increase of less than $400B would be a historical anomaly in the current fiscal regime.

Based on this, a low prior probability for "Yes" is warranted.
**Initial Prior: 10%** (Odds: 1 to 9).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
-   The underlying fiscal situation in late 2025 remains similar to 2021-2023, characterized by a large structural deficit between government spending (including mandatory programs and defense) and revenues.
-   Interest rates are elevated, meaning interest payments on the debt are a significant and growing contributor to borrowing needs.

**Differences:**
-   **No Debt Ceiling Constraint:** Unlike in Q4 2022, the debt ceiling was raised in mid-2025, removing the primary legislative mechanism that could artificially halt borrowing. This makes a low increase *less* likely than the 2022 base case.
-   **Political Polarization & Shutdown Risk:** The research report notes that heightened political polarization increases the probability of a government shutdown over budget appropriations. A shutdown would halt non-essential spending and dramatically slow the rate of debt accumulation. This is the most significant factor that makes a low increase *more* likely than the base rate would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the debt is under $38.5T on Dec 31, 2025.

-   **Evidence 1: High Starting Point & Momentum.** The debt is at ~$38.1T on Oct 24, requiring the increase over the next 68 days to average less than $5.9 billion/day. The background article notes a recent (though likely volatile) rate of $25 billion/day. The average monthly increase since early 2023 has been ~$210 billion, which translates to ~$7 billion/day. This strong momentum makes it much more likely that the debt will exceed the threshold (P(E|~H) > P(E|H)). This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability of "Yes".

-   **Evidence 2: CBO FY2025 Deficit Projection.** The CBO's projection of a $1.8 trillion deficit for the fiscal year reinforces the high-borrowing environment. This averages to nearly $5 billion/day from the deficit alone, leaving very little room for other borrowing activities (which typically add to the total debt increase) before the ~$5.9B/day limit is breached. This evidence is highly consistent with continued rapid debt growth. This **decreases** the probability of "Yes".

-   **Evidence 3: Potential for a Government Shutdown.** This is the primary evidence supporting "Yes". A shutdown is a plausible scenario in a polarized government. If a shutdown occurs and is lengthy (e.g., 3-4 weeks), it could reduce borrowing by enough to stay under the threshold. The existence of this plausible mechanism makes H more likely than it would be otherwise (P(E|H) is significant). This evidence **increases** the probability of "Yes".

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The "business as usual" scenario, supported by momentum and deficit data, points to a very low probability of "Yes". The prior of 10% is strongly confirmed and would likely be pushed lower, towards 2-5%, if not for the shutdown possibility.

The key is to model the impact of the shutdown risk. We can use a scenario-based approach:
`P(Yes) = P(Yes | Shutdown) * P(Shutdown) + P(Yes | No Shutdown) * P(No Shutdown)`

-   **P(Shutdown):** The probability of a shutdown occurring in Q4 is significant. Let's estimate this at **30%**.
-   **P(No Shutdown):** Consequently, this is **70%**.
-   **P(Yes | No Shutdown):** In the absence of a shutdown, the debt would have to stay under the threshold due to other factors, like the Treasury drawing down its cash balance (TGA) or an unexpected surge in revenue. Given the strong momentum, this is unlikely. I estimate this probability at a low **4%**.
-   **P(Yes | Shutdown):** If a shutdown occurs, it is not guaranteed to be long enough to have the required fiscal impact. Many shutdowns are brief. I estimate the probability that a shutdown is sufficiently long and deep to keep the debt under $38.5T is **30%**.

Plugging these values into the formula:
`P(Yes) = (0.30 * 0.30) + (0.04 * 0.70)`
`P(Yes) = 0.09 + 0.028`
`P(Yes) = 0.118`

The resulting posterior probability is approximately **12%**. This reflects that the outcome is highly dependent on a non-baseline event (a significant shutdown), while the default trajectory points strongly toward "No".

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 12% is low, implying high confidence in "No". Could I be wrong?

-   **Argument for a Higher Probability ("Yes" is more likely):** I might be underestimating the Treasury's ability and willingness to use accounting tools, like managing the Treasury General Account (TGA), to keep the headline debt number below a psychologically important threshold at the end of the calendar year. This could make `P(Yes | No Shutdown)` higher than 4%. If it were 10%, the final forecast would rise to 16%.
-   **Argument for a Lower Probability ("Yes" is less likely):** I might be overestimating the probability or impact of a shutdown. Political actors have strong incentives to resolve budget disputes before the holidays. Furthermore, an unexpected event requiring emergency spending (e.g., a natural disaster) could occur, which would accelerate borrowing and make even a shutdown insufficient to stop the debt from crossing the threshold.
-   **Conclusion:** The 12% forecast feels like a reasonable balance. It correctly identifies the overwhelming baseline trend ("No") while assigning a plausible, non-trivial probability to the primary counter-scenario (a shutdown) and other secondary factors (TGA management).

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate of recent Q4 debt growth suggests an increase of less than $400 billion is highly improbable. The current debt level and high rate of accumulation provide strong evidence that the $38.5 trillion threshold will be crossed. The only significant factor that could prevent this is a major, prolonged government shutdown, which is a plausible but not highly probable event. A quantitative model combining the baseline trajectory with the shutdown scenario yields a low probability.

Final: 12%
