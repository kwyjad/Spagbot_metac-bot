### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern Capital Relocations (Post-1950):** Globally, the act of announcing a new capital is rare. Since 1950, roughly 10-15 countries have successfully initiated and announced a capital move (e.g., Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Indonesia). This suggests a base rate of approximately 0.2 announcements per year across ~200 countries, or a ~0.1% chance for any given country in a given year. The process from announcement to completion is multi-decadal.
2.  **Capital Relocations Debated but Not Announced:** A more relevant class includes countries that have seriously and publicly debated moving their capital due to environmental or congestion pressures but have not made a formal announcement. This includes past discussions in Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. The conversion rate from "serious public debate" to "formal announcement" is low, perhaps 1 in 5 (~20%) over a multi-year period, due to immense costs and political inertia.
3.  **Major Iranian State Projects:** Iran has a history of announcing ambitious, large-scale infrastructure and strategic projects. Many are subject to significant delays, revision, or quiet abandonment due to economic sanctions, internal political struggles, and technical challenges. The base rate of such a mega-project being formally announced and specified within a month of a president reviving the idea is very low, likely less than 5%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-02** Pezeshkian's statements are widely reported, framing the move as a "mandate" and "no longer optional." — ↑ — Elevates the issue to the highest executive level, increasing its political salience significantly.
*   **2025-11 (late)** President Pezeshkian tells officials that a past proposal to relocate the capital failed due to budget issues, but is now unavoidable. — ↑ — Signals presidential will and acknowledges the primary historical obstacle (cost), suggesting he may have a plan to address it.
*   **2025-10** A study published in *Science Advances* highlights the extreme rate of land subsidence (35cm/year) and irreversible aquifer collapse in Iran's central plateau. — ↑ — Provides fresh, high-profile scientific backing for the urgency of the crisis, giving political cover for drastic action.
*   **2025-06 to 2025-12** No public reports of the Majlis (parliament) forming a special committee, allocating a budget, or the Supreme Leader's office endorsing a specific relocation plan. — ↓ — The absence of concrete bureaucratic and political steps required for such a monumental decision suggests the President's words have not yet translated into action.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Ecological Imperative (Large ↑):** The water crisis and land subsidence in Tehran are existential threats. This is not a matter of prestige but of long-term viability, creating powerful, non-political pressure for a solution.
2.  **Presidential Willpower (Moderate ↑):** President Pezeshkian, a reformist, may see this as a legacy-defining project and a way to demonstrate competence. His strong, repeated statements create momentum.
3.  **Economic & Budgetary Constraints (Large ↓):** Iran's economy is heavily strained by international sanctions and internal mismanagement. The cost of building a new capital is estimated in the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, a sum that is almost certainly unavailable. This was the reason past attempts failed.
4.  **Political Inertia & Factionalism (Large ↓):** Such a move would face immense opposition from Tehran's established elites, businesses, and bureaucracy. Hardline factions may block the initiative to deny a reformist president a major victory. The Supreme Leader's approval is essential and not guaranteed.
5.  **Logistical & Planning Complexity (Large ↓):** Choosing a site, planning infrastructure, and managing the transition is a multi-year, if not multi-decade, undertaking. Making a credible, specific announcement by Jan 3, 2026, requires that significant preparatory work has already been completed, for which there is no evidence.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Severity of the Driver:** Unlike many historical capital moves driven by political compromise (e.g., Canberra) or development goals (e.g., Brasilia), Iran's situation is driven by an acute, potentially irreversible ecological collapse. This urgency is a key difference.
*   **Extreme Economic Constraints:** Compared to other recent examples like Indonesia or Egypt, which are also moving their capitals, Iran operates under severe international sanctions, limiting its access to capital, technology, and international expertise.
*   **Concentrated Political Power:** The Iranian system concentrates ultimate authority in the Supreme Leader. Unlike a more diffuse parliamentary system, a single decision from Ayatollah Khamenei could, in theory, accelerate the process dramatically, bypassing typical legislative hurdles.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question's deadline of Jan 3, 2026 (~1 month away) is the most critical differentiating factor. Capital relocation announcements typically follow years of feasibility studies, site selection commissions, and political consensus-building. A rushed announcement in one month would be highly abnormal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior, informed by the base rate of such rare and complex state decisions. A prior of ~5% seems appropriate, reflecting that while the topic is active, the barriers are immense. (Equivalent n ≈ 20).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Recent, forceful presidential rhetoric has put the issue firmly on the national agenda.
    *   ↑ (Small): New scientific data reinforces the extreme urgency of the underlying crisis.
    *   ↓ (Large): The 1-month timeline is exceptionally short for a decision of this magnitude, requiring a pre-existing, secret consensus and plan.
    *   ↓ (Large): The absence of any reported bureaucratic or legislative action (committees, budgets, site surveys) is strong evidence against an imminent announcement.
    *   ↓ (Large): Overwhelming economic and political constraints that killed past efforts remain firmly in place.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The lack of concrete preparatory steps and the immense, unchanged structural barriers vastly outweigh the recent increase in presidential rhetoric, especially on this compressed timeline. The posterior should be revised significantly lower than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An official statement of support or directive from the Supreme Leader's office.
    *   The Majlis announcing the formation of a "Capital Relocation Commission."
    *   Leaked reports of specific candidate cities being surveyed by government engineers.
    *   Inclusion of a preliminary budget line for "capital planning" in an emergency government spending bill.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Statements from other senior officials (e.g., the Speaker of Parliament, head of the IRGC) dismissing the idea as impractical or "a long-term vision."
    *   The President's office "walking back" the comments, clarifying it's an exploratory idea.
    *   Continued public silence on the topic from all government bodies besides the President.
    *   The emergence of a different, more immediate national crisis (e.g., security, economic) that consumes all political attention.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **"Official Announcement" Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria hinge on an "official announcement" of a "specific location." A vague presidential decree to *begin* the process of finding a location would not resolve as Yes.
*   **Opacity of the Regime:** Decision-making in Iran is opaque. A sudden decision could be made behind closed doors by a small group of elites and announced with little warning, though this is unlikely for a project requiring such broad buy-in.
*   **Symbolic Politics:** The announcement could be a political feint or a symbolic gesture to show the government is addressing problems, with no real intention of immediate follow-through.
*   **Pezeshkian's Political Capital:** As a reformist president, Pezeshkian's ability to enact his agenda is limited by hardline opposition in other state institutions. His statements may reflect his ambition more than his actual power.

**Final Research Summary:**
President Pezeshkian has forcefully revived the capital relocation debate in response to a critical ecological crisis. However, the monumental financial costs, deep-seated political opposition, and sheer logistical complexity make an official announcement of a specific new capital location within the next month highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for a country announcing a new capital is extremely low. Historically, since 1950, only about 10-15 countries have announced such moves, suggesting a base rate of approximately 0.1% per year for any given country. However, given Iran's specific context of ecological urgency and past discussions, a slightly higher prior of 5% is reasonable. This reflects the active debate and the president's recent statements, while acknowledging the significant barriers.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Iran, like other countries that have moved capitals, faces significant environmental and logistical challenges in its current capital.
- The discussion is driven by a pressing need, similar to other cases where capitals were moved due to strategic or environmental reasons.

**Differences:**
- Iran's economic constraints are more severe due to international sanctions, making funding a new capital more challenging.
- The timeline is exceptionally short, with only one month remaining, which is atypical for such announcements that usually follow extensive planning.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential Rhetoric (Moderate ↑):** The president's strong statements increase the likelihood of an announcement, but without concrete actions, this is limited.
- **Scientific Evidence (Small ↑):** The recent study on land subsidence adds urgency, slightly increasing the probability.
- **Short Timeline (Large ↓):** The lack of preparatory steps and the short timeframe significantly decrease the likelihood of an announcement.
- **Economic and Political Constraints (Large ↓):** The ongoing economic issues and political opposition are strong evidence against an imminent announcement.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 5%, we adjust based on the evidence:
- The positive evidence (presidential rhetoric and scientific urgency) is outweighed by the negative evidence (short timeline, economic and political constraints).
- The likelihood ratio for the negative evidence is much stronger, suggesting a downward adjustment.

Using a conceptual Bayesian update:
- Prior odds = 5% / 95% = 0.0526
- Likelihood ratio (negative evidence dominates) = 0.1 (hypothetical)
- Posterior odds = 0.0526 * 0.1 = 0.00526
- Posterior probability = 0.00526 / (1 + 0.00526) ≈ 0.52%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden political decision, but the structural barriers remain significant.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A sudden directive from the Supreme Leader could change the dynamics, but there's no current indication of this.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of preparatory actions and the short timeline are strong counterarguments to any optimistic scenario.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering all factors, the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, is very low. The structural and timeline constraints are significant barriers.

Final: 1%

# Will Iran announce a new capital location before January 3, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for Iran announcing a new capital location within approximately one month (from December 3, 2025 to January 3, 2026).

The most appropriate reference class is countries that have publicly discussed relocating their capitals due to severe environmental or infrastructure challenges. Looking at historical data:

- Capital relocations are extremely rare events globally (10-15 since 1950)
- The process from serious discussion to formal announcement typically takes years
- Countries that have publicly debated relocations (like Mexico, Japan, South Korea) have a roughly 20% conversion rate to actual announcements over multi-year periods
- Iran specifically has discussed capital relocation before without action

Given the extremely short timeframe (1 month), and the typical timeline for such major decisions (years), I'll set a low base rate of 5%. This reflects that while the issue is actively being discussed at the highest levels, the compressed timeline makes an imminent announcement highly unlikely.

**Prior probability: 5%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other countries considering relocation, Iran faces genuine environmental pressures (water scarcity, land subsidence)
- The president has publicly acknowledged the necessity, similar to early stages in other capital relocation processes
- Economic constraints that prevented earlier relocation attempts remain a significant factor

**Key differences:**
- The ecological crisis in Tehran appears more severe and urgent than many historical cases, with scientific evidence of irreversible aquifer collapse
- The timeline is extremely compressed (1 month) compared to typical capital relocation announcements which follow years of planning
- Iran's political system concentrates more power in fewer hands than many democracies, potentially enabling faster decision-making
- Iran faces unique economic constraints due to international sanctions that make financing such a massive project particularly challenging

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Presidential statements declaring relocation "no longer optional"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~90%) - If an announcement is imminent, we would expect exactly this kind of strong rhetoric
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~40%) - Even without an imminent announcement, such statements could be made to signal concern
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Absence of reported preparatory steps (committees, budgets, site surveys)**
- P(E|H): Very low (~10%) - If an announcement were coming within a month, we would expect to see evidence of concrete preparations
- P(E|~H): Very high (~90%) - If no announcement is coming soon, we would expect this absence of preparatory steps
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (strongly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Recent scientific study highlighting severity of the crisis**
- P(E|H): High (~80%) - Scientific urgency would support a rapid announcement
- P(E|~H): Also high (~70%) - This evidence would exist regardless of announcement timing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Historical failure to relocate due to budget constraints**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~50%) - Past failures don't preclude current success if conditions have changed
- P(E|~H): High (~80%) - Economic constraints remain and likely continue to be prohibitive
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63 (moderately decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (0.053), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on absence of preparatory steps:**
- Prior odds: 0.053
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.11 = 0.0058
- Posterior probability: 0.0058 ÷ (1 + 0.0058) ≈ 0.58%

**Update on presidential statements:**
- Prior odds: 0.0058
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.0058 × 2.25 = 0.013
- Posterior probability: 0.013 ÷ (1 + 0.013) ≈ 1.3%

**Update on historical budget constraints:**
- Prior odds: 0.013
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 0.013 × 0.63 = 0.0082
- Posterior probability: 0.0082 ÷ (1 + 0.0082) ≈ 0.81%

**Update on scientific study:**
- Prior odds: 0.0082
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14
- Posterior odds: 0.0082 × 1.14 = 0.0093
- Posterior probability: 0.0093 ÷ (1 + 0.0093) ≈ 0.92%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 0.92%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which authoritarian regimes can make major decisions when motivated
- There could be behind-the-scenes preparations not visible to outside observers
- The ecological crisis might be even more dire than publicly reported, forcing immediate action

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could make a symbolic announcement to appease public concern without full implementation plans
- The Supreme Leader could unexpectedly prioritize this issue for religious or nationalistic reasons
- A pre-existing plan from previous administrations could be rapidly revived

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might place the probability at 5-10%, arguing that:
1. The president wouldn't make such strong statements without some confidence in near-term action
2. Iran's political system can move quickly when elite consensus exists
3. The ecological crisis creates genuine urgency

However, this view still struggles with the extremely short timeline and the absence of visible preparatory steps that would normally precede such a momentous announcement.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of hidden preparations or unexpected political developments, but the fundamental constraints remain overwhelming.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a formal state announcement of a new capital city location. This is a rare event. I will consider two reference classes to establish a prior probability.

*   **Reference Class 1: Global Capital Relocations.** Since 1950, approximately 10-15 countries have announced a capital move. This is a rate of about 0.2 announcements per year across roughly 200 countries. The probability for any given country in a given month is extremely low, on the order of 0.01%.
*   **Reference Class 2: Countries with Active Debates.** A more relevant class includes countries where moving the capital is a serious, high-level public debate. The research report suggests a conversion rate from "serious debate" to "formal announcement" of perhaps 20% over a multi-year period (e.g., 5 years). This implies a monthly probability of around 0.33% (20% / 60 months).
*   **Reference Class 3: Major Iranian State Projects.** The report notes that such projects, even after being championed by the president, have a low rate of being formally announced within a short timeframe. A base rate of <5% for an announcement within a month of a presidential push is suggested.

Given that Iran is now firmly in the "active debate" stage, I will select a prior that is higher than the global average but still low, reflecting the immense difficulty of such projects. I will start with a prior probability of **P(H) = 3%**. This acknowledges the seriousness of the discussion while respecting the historical rarity and difficulty of the action. In odds, this is approximately 1-to-32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The situation in Iran mirrors the base case of a "nation debating a capital move" due to significant push factors (overcrowding, environmental stress). It also fits the pattern of a major state project facing predictable hurdles like cost and political inertia.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Urgency (Pro):** The primary driver is not prestige or political compromise, but an acute and potentially irreversible ecological crisis (land subsidence and water depletion). This creates a much stronger impetus for action than in many historical cases.
    *   **Timeline (Con):** The forecast period is extremely short—just one month. Capital relocations are multi-decade endeavors, and the announcement of a specific site typically follows years of feasibility studies and political negotiation. A one-month turnaround from renewed presidential rhetoric to a formal announcement would be exceptionally fast.
    *   **Economic Constraints (Con):** Iran's economy is severely hampered by international sanctions, making the multi-billion dollar cost of a new capital a near-insurmountable obstacle. This is a more severe constraint than faced by other recent examples like Indonesia or Egypt.

The extremely short timeline is the most critical differentiating factor and strongly suggests the probability should be adjusted downwards from the prior.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Iran announces a new capital location before January 3, 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's forceful statements ("no longer optional").**
    *   This evidence is more likely if an announcement is imminent (P(E|H) is high) than if it is not (P(E|~H) is moderate, as it could be political posturing).
    *   Likelihood Ratio: > 1 (Increases probability). The President's strong will makes the event more plausible than the base rate alone would suggest.

*   **Evidence 2: Absence of public preparatory steps (no special committees, budget allocations, or site surveys reported).**
    *   This evidence is highly unlikely if a credible announcement of a *specific location* is just a month away (P(E|H) is very low). Such a massive undertaking would require visible bureaucratic and logistical groundwork.
    *   This evidence is very likely if no announcement is imminent (P(E|~H) is very high).
    *   Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Strongly decreases probability). This is the most powerful piece of evidence against the hypothesis.

*   **Evidence 3: Severe economic constraints and political factionalism.**
    *   These are standing conditions. Their existence makes any expensive, divisive project less likely. While the President's statements are new, these powerful constraints have not changed.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: < 1 (Decreases probability). These factors killed past attempts and remain the largest barriers to action.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I begin with a prior of 3% (odds of ~1:32).

1.  **Update for Presidential Rhetoric:** The President's strong push (LR > 1) might double the odds, moving the probability to around 6%. This accounts for the increased political momentum.
2.  **Update for Lack of Preparation:** This is the crucial step. The absence of any visible groundwork is strong evidence against an announcement being ready. A likelihood ratio of ~0.1 (or lower) is appropriate, meaning this observation is 10 times more likely if no announcement is coming.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR_total ≈ (1:32) × 2 (for rhetoric) × 0.1 (for lack of prep) = 0.2:32 = 1:160.
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 1 / (1 + 160) ≈ 0.6%.

The evidence, particularly the lack of observable progress combined with the short timeline, overwhelmingly pushes the initial probability down to a very low value.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (Why I might be wrong):** The primary counterargument is the opacity of the Iranian regime. A decision could have been made in secret by a small circle of elites around the Supreme Leader, with all preparatory work classified. President Pezeshkian's statements could be the first step in a pre-planned, surprise rollout. In this scenario, the lack of public evidence is not meaningful. The announcement could also be largely symbolic—naming a location to "show action" without a concrete budget or timeline, which is an easier political lift.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, keeping a project of this magnitude (requiring surveys, engineering plans, and inter-agency coordination) completely secret is extremely difficult. Furthermore, a symbolic announcement without broad consensus could easily backfire on the President.
*   **Adjustment:** The "secret plan" scenario represents a tail risk. My calculated probability of <1% reflects the public evidence. To account for the non-zero chance of a surprise from an opaque system, I will adjust the final forecast slightly upward. A 2% forecast acknowledges this possibility while still classifying the event as highly unlikely.

### 6. Final Forecast
The proposition of Iran announcing a new capital is now a serious topic of discussion, driven by a genuine ecological crisis and presidential will. However, the one-month timeline is exceptionally aggressive for a decision of this magnitude. The immense and unchanged financial and political barriers, combined with a total lack of observable preparatory action (committees, budgets, site selection), provide strong evidence against an announcement being imminent. While the opacity of the Iranian regime allows for a small chance of a surprise, the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests this will not happen in the next month.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event draws from the reference class of countries seriously debating capital relocations due to environmental pressures but not yet announcing them formally. The research indicates that the conversion rate from "serious public debate" to "formal announcement" is low, around 20% over a multi-year period (e.g., cases like Mexico or South Korea where debates fizzled without action). However, adjusting for Iran's history of ambitious state projects that often face delays or abandonment (base rate <5% for announcement within a month of revival), and the global rarity of capital moves (0.1% per country per year), a conservative prior of 5% seems fitting. This reflects the infrequency of such mega-decisions while acknowledging the active debate in Iran. In odds form: 5% probability = 1:19 odds (prior odds = 1/19 ≈ 0.0526).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case of debated-but-unannounced capital moves (e.g., Japan's discussions on relocating from Tokyo due to earthquake risks, or Mexico's congestion debates) in that there's high-level rhetoric about ecological unsustainability, scientific backing for urgency, and historical precedents for capital shifts in Iran itself (e.g., from Tabriz to Isfahan). However, it differs significantly in the extreme short timeline (only ~1 month until January 3, 2026), which is atypical—most announcements follow years of planning, not weeks. Iran's severe economic sanctions and political factionalism add unusual barriers, making rapid action less likely than in less constrained cases like Indonesia's recent capital move. These differences matter because they amplify inertia and reduce the feasibility of a quick, specific announcement, pushing the probability downward from the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential rhetoric (e.g., Pezeshkian's statements framing the move as "unavoidable")**: This is more likely if an announcement is imminent (P(E|H) ≈ 80%, as leaders often signal intent strongly before formal action) than if not (P(E|~H) ≈ 30%, as rhetoric can be symbolic without follow-through). Likelihood ratio ≈ 2.67, moderately increasing the probability.
- **Recent scientific study on aquifer collapse and subsidence**: More likely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 70%, providing justification for urgency) than ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 40%, as studies occur regardless but may not drive action). Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.75, slightly increasing the probability.
- **Absence of bureaucratic/legislative steps (no committees, budgets, or Supreme Leader endorsement)**: Much less likely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 10%, as preparation is essential for a credible announcement) than ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 90%, as inaction fits stalled debates). Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.11, strongly decreasing the probability.
- **Economic and political constraints (sanctions, factionalism, costs)**: Less likely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 20%, as these must be overcome for action) than ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 80%, as they explain non-action). Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.25, significantly decreasing the probability.
- **Short timeline (~1 month)**: Very unlikely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 5%, as complex decisions rarely happen this fast) than ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 95%, as short horizons favor inaction). Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.05, strongly decreasing the probability.

Overall, the evidence has a net downward pull due to the strong negative factors outweighing the positives.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 0.0526 (5% probability). I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio from the evidence: the upward factors (rhetoric and science) give a multiplicative LR of ~4.7 (2.67 × 1.75), but the downward factors (inaction, constraints, timeline) give a multiplicative LR of ~0.001375 (0.11 × 0.25 × 0.05), netting an overall LR ≈ 0.00646.

Posterior odds = Prior odds × LR ≈ 0.0526 × 0.00646 ≈ 0.00034.

Posterior probability = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds) ≈ 0.00034 / 1.00034 ≈ 0.034% (roughly 0.03%).

This update reflects a massive downward adjustment due to the overwhelming barriers and short timeline, but I've tempered it to avoid overconfidence— the result is very low, indicating high uncertainty in favor of no announcement, but not zero due to the opacity of Iranian decision-making.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the downward direction by underweighting the possibility of a sudden, top-down decision from the Supreme Leader, who could override inertia in a way parliamentary systems can't— this is a blind spot in comparing to base cases. Tail risks include a symbolic announcement to boost Pezeshkian's image amid crises, or unexpected international aid easing sanctions (though unlikely). An alternative forecast of ~10% might be plausible if one assumes the rhetoric signals hidden preparations, rebutted by the lack of any leaked indicators. To account for this, I'll nudge my estimate up slightly to incorporate more uncertainty, avoiding a near-zero that ignores regime opacity.

Final: 1%
