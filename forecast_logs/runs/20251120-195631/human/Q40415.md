### Reference class & base rates
1.  **MP Departures (Resignation/Defection) per Parliamentary Session:** In a typical 4-year Canadian Parliament with 338 MPs, there are approximately 5-10 departures (floor-crossings or resignations for non-electoral reasons). This yields a rough base rate of 1.25-2.5 departures per year. For the ~1.5-month resolution period (approx. 1/8th of a year), this suggests a **15-30%** chance of at least one event occurring in an average period of this length. *Limitation: This rate averages over periods of political calm and crisis, likely understating the probability during a period of acute instability.*
2.  **Floor Crossings in Minority Parliaments:** Historically, floor crossings are rare but are more plausible during unstable minority governments where the balance of power is delicate. Since 2000, there have been fewer than 10 major floor crossings. Events often cluster. The defection of a single MP significantly increases the short-term probability of another. A base rate derived from this class is difficult to quantify but suggests that once a crossing occurs, the situation is no longer "average."
3.  **Post-Election Opposition Instability:** It is not uncommon for a party that has lost an election to experience internal turmoil, leading to resignations or defections in the 6-12 months following the vote. The current situation fits this pattern, but the proximity to a majority for the governing party makes it an extreme case.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** Jeneroux resigns from CPC after reported pressure. (↑) — Matters because it confirms intense internal CPC pressure and suggests other MPs may be facing similar threats, potentially prompting preemptive resignations or defections.
*   **2025-11-05** d'Entremont crosses floor from Conservative to Liberal. (↑↑) — Matters because it breaks the dam, providing a proof-of-concept for other disaffected MPs and putting the Liberals just two seats from a majority, dramatically increasing incentives.
*   **2025-10-20** (Hypothetical date of election) Liberals win a minority. (↑) — Matters because it created the unstable political environment and a weak opposition, setting the stage for the current high-stakes maneuvering.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Government Incentives (Pull):** The Liberals are only two seats from a majority. They have an enormous incentive to offer significant rewards (e.g., cabinet positions, committee chairships, future appointments, key policy concessions) to potential defectors. (Size: Large)
2.  **Conservative Internal Dissent (Push):** D'Entremont's defection, citing leadership disagreements, and Jeneroux's pressured resignation suggest a faction of moderate ("Red Tory") MPs are deeply uncomfortable with Poilievre's leadership. This creates a pool of potential movers. (Size: Large)
3.  **Contagion and Momentum:** D'Entremont's move makes it psychologically and politically easier for a second or third MP to follow. The sense of a "sinking ship" or an escalating crisis can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Conservative Party Discipline (Countervailing):** The CPC leadership is now on high alert. The "consequences" threatened to Jeneroux show they will use immense pressure (e.g., threat of deselection, removal from committees, caucus expulsion) to prevent further departures. This is a powerful deterrent. (Size: Large)
5.  **Personal Calculation of MPs:** Individual MPs may be weighing their long-term career prospects, believing their chances of re-election are better under a different banner or that a private sector/appointed role is preferable to remaining in a hostile caucus. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Power:** Unlike most historical periods, the government is on the absolute cusp of a majority. This transforms the value of a single MP's defection from symbolic to decisive, amplifying incentives dramatically.
*   **Event Clustering:** The base rate assumes random, independent events. Here, we have two departures from the same party within 24 hours, indicating a systemic crisis, not a random occurrence. The probability is conditional on these recent, related events.
*   **Specificity of Cause:** The dissent is explicitly linked to the current opposition leader's specific style and ideology, suggesting a clear fault line within the caucus rather than a vague or one-off policy dispute.
*   **Acute Time Pressure:** The context is a high-stakes budget vote. This creates a focal point and a deadline for action, concentrating the political pressure into a short window, unlike the slow burn of a typical parliamentary session.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~25% seems plausible, derived from the base rate of MP departures in a given time frame (Reference Class 1), with a low equivalent 'n' as the context is highly specific.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Government is two seats from a majority, creating maximum incentive for poaching.
    *   (↑ Large) Two recent, back-to-back departures from the CPC signal a potential cascade and deep internal crisis.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Explicit ideological/leadership rift cited as the cause, identifying a specific at-risk faction.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Aggressive party discipline and threats from CPC leadership will deter some potential movers.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly positive and highly specific to the current crisis. The base rate is a poor guide. The posterior should move significantly upward, likely more than doubling the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Rumors in Ottawa media (e.g., The Hill Times, CBC Power & Politics) about other specific Conservative MPs being unhappy or in talks with Liberals.
    *   A Conservative MP unexpectedly missing key votes or being absent from caucus meetings.
    *   Public statements of support for d'Entremont from any sitting CPC MPs.
    *   Op-eds or anonymous quotes from "moderate" Conservatives criticizing the party's direction.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A well-attended, unified CPC caucus press conference where potential movers pledge loyalty.
    *   The Liberal government signaling they will seek a compromise with another party (e.g., NDP, Bloc) to pass the budget, reducing the need for defectors.
    *   Pierre Poilievre makes a significant, public conciliatory gesture to the moderate wing of his party.
    *   The news cycle moves on to a different topic, reducing the sense of immediate crisis.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Private Motivations:** The ultimate decision rests on the personal calculations and psychology of a few individuals, which is fundamentally difficult to observe and predict.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most important negotiations are happening behind closed doors. The public view is limited and subject to strategic leaks and deception by all parties.
*   **Effectiveness of Coercion:** The "consequences" threatened by the CPC may be far more effective at enforcing discipline than is publicly apparent. The rebellion may have already been quashed.
*   **Resolution Window:** The timeframe is very short (ends Dec 31). An MP might be convinced to defect but may strategically wait until the New Year (e.g., after the holiday break) to announce, causing the question to resolve "No."
*   **Definition includes Resignation:** A "Yes" resolution could be triggered by a resignation due to an unrelated personal health issue or scandal, which is a random factor not captured by the political analysis.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate is low, but the current political context is exceptional; a severe internal crisis in the opposition combined with maximal incentives for the government makes another departure highly probable within the short resolution window.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for MP departures (resignations or defections) in a typical 4-year Canadian Parliament is approximately 5-10 events, translating to a 1.25-2.5 departures per year. For the ~1.5-month resolution period, this suggests a base rate of 15-30% for at least one event occurring.
   - Given the current political instability and recent events, this base rate likely understates the probability. However, it provides a starting point for our analysis.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically increases the likelihood of defections due to political instability.
   - Differences: The recent defections and resignations, coupled with the Liberal Party being just two seats short of a majority, create a unique and high-stakes environment that is not typical of the average parliamentary session.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Government Incentives (Pull):** The Liberals have strong incentives to secure a majority, increasing the likelihood of offering significant inducements to potential defectors. This evidence increases the probability.
   - **Conservative Internal Dissent (Push):** Recent defections and resignations suggest internal turmoil within the Conservative Party, increasing the likelihood of further departures. This evidence also increases the probability.
   - **Contagion and Momentum:** The recent floor crossing by d'Entremont may encourage others to follow, further increasing the probability.
   - **Conservative Party Discipline (Countervailing):** The CPC's aggressive measures to prevent further defections act as a deterrent, decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 25% based on the base rate, we consider the evidence:
     - The strong incentives for defections and recent events suggest a likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
     - Assuming a likelihood ratio of 3 (a rough estimate given the evidence), the posterior odds become 0.25 * 3 = 0.75.
     - Converting odds to probability: 0.75 / (1 + 0.75) = 0.43 or 43%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast may overestimate the probability if the CPC's deterrence measures are more effective than anticipated.
   - Alternative Scenarios: A sudden conciliatory move by the CPC or a strategic delay by potential defectors could lower the probability.
   - Adjustments: Considering these factors, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential overestimation is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, the final calibrated probability is:
   
Final: 40%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for MP defections or resignations in a short timeframe (Nov 20 - Dec 31, 2025, approximately 40 days).

From the research report, we have:
- In a typical 4-year Parliament with 338 MPs, there are approximately 5-10 departures
- This yields a base rate of 1.25-2.5 departures per year
- For a ~1.5-month period (about 1/8th of a year), this suggests a 15-30% chance

However, this is not a typical period. We've already seen two departures in quick succession (d'Entremont crossing the floor and Jeneroux resigning), indicating we're in an unusual political situation. The base rate should be adjusted to account for this clustering effect.

Given the unusual circumstances, I'll start with a prior of **30%** (the upper end of the typical range), recognizing that we're in an atypical situation that likely has a higher-than-normal probability of additional departures.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We're still dealing with the same institutional structure of Canadian Parliament
- MPs still face the same basic incentives and pressures that typically drive defections/resignations

**Key differences:**
- The Liberal government is just 2 seats away from a majority (170/338 seats currently)
- Two MPs have already left the Conservative Party in rapid succession (Nov 5-6)
- There's explicit ideological conflict within the Conservative Party
- The timing coincides with a high-stakes budget vote
- The Conservative leadership is actively threatening "consequences" to prevent defections

These differences significantly increase the likelihood of additional departures compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent clustering of departures**
- P(E|H): Very high. If another MP is going to defect/resign, it's very likely to happen in a cluster with recent events
- P(E|~H): Low. If no more MPs will defect/resign, then the recent events would be isolated
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly positive (>3:1)
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Liberal government near majority threshold**
- P(E|H): High. The Liberals have maximum incentive to poach MPs to secure a majority
- P(E|~H): Moderate. Even with incentives, most MPs remain loyal to their parties
- Likelihood ratio: Positive (approximately 2:1)
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Conservative Party internal dissent**
- P(E|H): High. Internal dissent is a prerequisite for defections
- P(E|~H): Moderate. Dissent can exist without leading to defections
- Likelihood ratio: Positive (approximately 2:1)
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Conservative leadership threats and discipline**
- P(E|H): Moderate. Threats can sometimes backfire and push MPs to defect
- P(E|~H): High. Party discipline is effective at preventing defections
- Likelihood ratio: Negative (approximately 1:2)
- This evidence decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 30% (odds of 3:7):

**Update on Evidence 1 (clustering):**
- Prior odds: 3:7 (0.3/0.7)
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1
- Posterior odds: 9:7
- Posterior probability: 9/(9+7) = 9/16 ≈ 56%

**Update on Evidence 2 (near majority):**
- Prior odds: 9:7
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1
- Posterior odds: 18:7
- Posterior probability: 18/(18+7) = 18/25 = 72%

**Update on Evidence 3 (internal dissent):**
- Prior odds: 18:7
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1
- Posterior odds: 36:7
- Posterior probability: 36/(36+7) = 36/43 ≈ 84%

**Update on Evidence 4 (party discipline):**
- Prior odds: 36:7
- Likelihood ratio: 1:2
- Posterior odds: 36:14
- Posterior probability: 36/(36+14) = 36/50 = 72%

After considering all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 72%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the clustering effect. Just because two MPs left doesn't mean more will follow
- The Conservative leadership may have already identified all potential defectors and neutralized the threat
- The short timeframe (40 days) limits the opportunity for defections, especially with holiday recess
- MPs might strategically wait until 2026 to make their moves
- I might be underestimating party loyalty even in difficult circumstances

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be around 40-50%, arguing that:
- The Conservative Party will successfully prevent further defections through intense pressure
- The two departures were the entire "at-risk" group, not the beginning of a larger trend
- The holiday period will reduce political activity and give time for tensions to cool

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The incentives for the Liberals to secure a majority are extremely strong
- The research indicates there are likely more "Red Tory" MPs uncomfortable with Poilievre's leadership
- The pressure tactics used by the Conservative leadership might push more MPs away

After this critical evaluation, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the short timeframe and potential effectiveness of Conservative Party discipline.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and the critical evaluation of my reasoning, I arrive at a final probability of 68%.

Final: 68%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is whether a Canadian MP will defect or resign in a specific 44-day period (Nov 18, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025). The research report provides a solid reference class: in a typical 4-year (48-month) Parliament, there are 5-10 departures. This gives a rate of 0.1 to 0.2 departures per month.

For our ~1.5-month window, the expected number of departures is 0.15 to 0.3. Using a Poisson approximation (P(≥1) = 1 - e^(-λ)), this translates to a probability of 14% to 26% that at least one MP departs in a *typical* 1.5-month period.

I will select a prior probability of **20%**. This represents the chance of such an event happening in the absence of the specific, acute political crisis we are currently witnessing.
Prior Odds: 0.20 / 0.80 = 1:4.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is profoundly different from the base case scenario from which the prior is derived.
*   **Similarity**: The fundamental event (an MP leaving their post or party) is a known, albeit infrequent, political occurrence.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Proximity to Power**: The Liberal government is just two seats from a majority. This is not a typical minority situation; it's a tipping point where a single MP's decision can fundamentally alter the balance of power for the entire parliamentary term. This dramatically increases the incentives for the government to encourage defections.
    *   **Event Clustering**: The base rate assumes random, independent events. We have just witnessed two departures from the same party in 24 hours, indicating a systemic crisis, not a random event. This suggests a contagion effect is in play.
    *   **Acute Crisis**: The departures are explicitly linked to a leadership crisis within the main opposition party. This is not a slow-burn disagreement but an acute, public schism.

These differences mean the base rate is likely a significant underestimate of the true probability.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that another MP will defect or resign before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1 (Pro-H): Extreme Government Incentive.** The Liberals are two seats from a majority. The incentive to offer cabinet posts, policy concessions, or other rewards to potential defectors is at its absolute maximum. This evidence is far more likely to be present if a defection is being engineered (P(E|H)) than if the political situation were stable (P(E|~H)). This is a strong update in favor of H.
*   **Evidence 2 (Pro-H): Opposition in Crisis.** The defection of d'Entremont and the forced resignation of Jeneroux demonstrate a deep, actionable rift within the Conservative party. This creates a pool of unhappy MPs who could be "pushed" out. This cluster of events is much more probable given that another departure is imminent (H) than if the crisis was limited to just those two individuals (~H).
*   **Evidence 3 (Anti-H): Strong Counter-Pressure.** The CPC leadership is now on high alert. The "consequences" threatened to Jeneroux show they will use powerful tools of party discipline to prevent further departures. This is a strong countervailing force that makes another departure less likely.
*   **Evidence 4 (Anti-H): Short Timeline.** The resolution window is only ~1.5 months and includes the parliamentary holiday recess (typically starting mid-December). This significantly shortens the effective time for high-stakes political negotiations, making it less likely a deal is struck and announced before the deadline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 20% (1:4 odds).

The evidence is powerful but conflicting. The "pull" of the Liberals and the "push" from the CPC crisis are immense positive drivers. The CPC's internal discipline and the short timeline are immense negative drivers.

Let's consider the combined likelihood ratio of the crisis situation (Evidence 1 & 2) versus the counter-forces (Evidence 3 & 4). The crisis makes a departure much more likely than the base rate. Let's estimate this gives us a likelihood ratio of 5.
*   Intermediate Odds = Prior Odds × LR_crisis = (1:4) × 5 = 5:4.
*   Intermediate Probability = 5 / (5+4) = 55.5%.

Now, we must account for the strong counter-evidence: party discipline and the short timeline. This evidence makes a departure less likely. How much less? It's a significant deterrent. It might halve the odds.
*   Posterior Odds = Intermediate Odds × LR_counter = (5:4) × 0.5 = 5:8.
*   Posterior Probability = 5 / (5+8) = 5 / 13 ≈ 38.5%.

This feels too low. The forces seem more balanced. Let's re-evaluate. The situation feels like a genuine toss-up between a successful Liberal poach/another resignation and a successful CPC lockdown. The sheer magnitude of the prize for the Liberals (a stable majority) suggests they will be relentless. This makes me believe the positive evidence slightly outweighs the negative evidence.

Let's try a more holistic update. The base rate of 20% is for a normal situation. This is a crisis. In a crisis, probabilities are much higher. The situation feels roughly balanced, perhaps slightly favoring another departure due to the momentum and the huge incentives. A probability just above 50% seems appropriate.

Let's adjust the likelihood ratio to reflect this balance. A combined LR of 4 seems more plausible.
*   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR_combined = (1:4) × 4 = 4:4 (or 1:1).
*   Posterior Probability = 1 / (1+1) = 50%.

This suggests a coin flip. Given the momentum and the fact that the dam has already broken, I will nudge this slightly higher.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is centered around 50-55%. The biggest reason this could be wrong is overestimating the crisis and underestimating party discipline. The CPC leadership may have already successfully "scared straight" any other waverers. The Jeneroux resignation, rather than being a sign of more to come, could have been the cathartic event that ends the rebellion. Furthermore, the holiday timeline is a major constraint. It's very plausible that any further action is deliberately postponed until January 2026, when Parliament returns, which would make the forecast resolve to "No".

Conversely, I might be underestimating the crisis. The public knows only a fraction of what is happening behind the scenes. There could be several MPs in active, advanced negotiations to leave, and an announcement is imminent. The two departures in 24 hours could be the first raindrops of a major storm.

Given these strong opposing scenarios, a forecast near the middle of the range is prudent. I feel the proactive incentives for the Liberals to secure a majority are a slightly stronger force than the reactive disciplinary measures of the CPC, justifying a probability slightly above 50%.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for an MP departure in this timeframe is low, around 20%. However, the current political context is exceptional. A severe internal crisis in the opposition party, combined with the maximum possible incentive for the governing party to encourage defections, dramatically increases the probability. These powerful drivers are countered by strong party discipline from the opposition and a very short resolution window that includes a holiday recess. Balancing these intense, opposing forces, the probability of another departure is slightly better than a coin toss.

Final: 55%
