### Reference class & base rates
1.  **State-level adoption of novel technology regulations:** Laws addressing new technologies like data privacy (e.g., CCPA-style laws), drone usage, or social media content moderation often follow an S-curve. After a few early adopters, a rapid wave of legislation occurs over 3-5 years as states copy model legislation, before tapering off. Since 2023, ~15-20 states per year have enacted some form of AI-related law. A base rate of **10-15 states per year specifically passing deepfake laws** during this peak adoption phase (2024-2025) is plausible.
2.  **Pace of state-level "election security" measures:** Legislation tied to election cycles often sees a surge in activity in the year before and after a major federal election. Given the 2024 election, this reference class suggests a high rate of adoption in 2024 and 2025. The base rate here is less about a steady annual number and more about a concentrated burst, suggesting **20-30 states could act within a two-year window** around a presidential election.
3.  **Laws with bipartisan consensus:** Issues with broad, bipartisan agreement (e.g., combating human trafficking, "revenge porn" laws) can spread very rapidly, with 30-40 states adopting similar laws within 2-3 years. Deepfake regulation, particularly concerning non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) and election interference, fits this profile. This suggests a **high terminal adoption rate (>40 states)**, with the key uncertainty being the speed.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-15** Major tech firms release voluntary commitments for watermarking AI-generated content. (↑) — Increases salience and provides a technical framework that may ease legislative concerns about implementation.
*   **2025-09-05** A federal court issues a preliminary injunction against a portion of a state's deepfake law on First Amendment grounds. (↓) — Creates a chilling effect, potentially causing other states to pause or narrow their legislative proposals to avoid similar legal challenges.
*   **2025-07-30** The National Governors Association (NGA) releases model policy on generative AI, including specific recommendations for deepfake regulation. (↑) — Provides a bipartisan template, making it easier for states to introduce and pass legislation quickly in their next sessions.
*   **2025-06-15** Most state legislative sessions for 2025 conclude. (↓↓) — The primary window for passing new legislation in 2025 closes. Only states with year-round sessions or special sessions can now act.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Election Security Concerns:** (Large ↑) The experience of the 2024 election cycle, regardless of whether major deepfake incidents occurred, has made this a top-tier issue for Secretaries of State and legislators. This is the primary driver.
2.  **Legislative Calendars:** (Large ↓) As of late November 2025, nearly all state legislatures have adjourned for the year. The opportunity for new bills to be introduced, debated, and passed before January 1, 2026, is almost zero, barring rare special sessions.
3.  **Federal Inaction:** (Moderate ↑) The continued absence of comprehensive federal AI or deepfake legislation creates a vacuum that states are highly motivated to fill, asserting their authority and addressing constituent concerns directly.
4.  **Bipartisan Consensus on Harms:** (Moderate ↑) There is widespread agreement across the political spectrum on the need to regulate specific malicious uses of deepfakes, such as in election interference and non-consensual intimate imagery. This reduces legislative friction.
5.  **First Amendment Challenges:** (Small ↓) Concerns that broad regulations could stifle protected speech (e.g., parody, satire) act as a brake, forcing more careful and narrowly tailored legislative language, which can slow down the process.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** Unlike a typical forecast made at the start of a legislative year, this question is constrained by the reality that the 2025 legislative season is over. The base rate of adoption is rendered almost moot by the calendar.
*   **Unprecedented Technological Pace:** The underlying technology is evolving far faster than in previous reference classes (e.g., data privacy). This creates a sense of urgency that could, in theory, trigger a special session, though this is unlikely.
*   **High Public Salience:** Deepfakes are a highly visible and easily understood threat compared to more abstract tech issues like data privacy frameworks. This high salience fuels legislative will but cannot overcome the calendar.
*   **Existing Momentum:** The question starts with a high number of states having already acted (15 as of March 2024, with significant additions in the 2024 and 2025 sessions). We are not at the beginning of the S-curve; we are likely in the steepest part or just past the inflection point, but hitting a hard stop due to the timeline.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the S-curve of policy adoption and the massive legislative activity in 2024-2025, a reasonable prior would center on a significant increase from the March 2024 baseline of 15. A prior centered around **38 states** seems plausible, reflecting the enactment of many of the ~700 bills introduced.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Massive legislative momentum and bipartisan support throughout 2024 and 2025 pushed the number of states with laws up significantly.
    *   (↓↓ Very Large) The conclusion of nearly all 2025 state legislative sessions effectively freezes the number of states where it currently stands.
    *   (↑ Small) The possibility of 1-2 states in year-round or special sessions passing a law before the deadline.
    *   (↓ Small) The risk of the resolution source (MultiState) re-categorizing an existing law as not meeting the criteria for "deepfake regulation."
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should be very heavily concentrated on the *current* number of states with deepfake laws, plus a small probability of 1 or 2 more. The primary update is a drastic reduction in variance. The mean of the posterior will be very close to the current, true count.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a special legislative session in any state to address AI or election issues.
    *   A major, high-profile deepfake scandal in the media that could create pressure for emergency action.
    *   The MultiState source page adds a state, perhaps due to a retroactive re-evaluation of a bill passed earlier in 2025.
    *   A governor signing a deepfake bill that was passed by the legislature in late 2025 but awaited their signature.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The MultiState source page removes a state from its list, changing its classification.
    *   A prominent statement from a legislative leader in a year-round session state (e.g., WI, MI, PA) that no further bills will be taken up in 2025.
    *   A major court ruling that invalidates a deepfake law, creating a chilling effect.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges entirely on what MultiState considers "legislation regulating deepfakes." This could range from narrow election-focused laws to broader consumer disclosure requirements.
*   **Data Lag:** The MultiState source may not be updated in real-time. A law could be passed and signed in December 2025, but not appear on the site until January 2026, creating resolution ambiguity.
*   **Uncertainty of Current Count:** The provided sources give trends but not a precise, up-to-the-minute count for November 2025. The entire forecast is highly sensitive to this unknown starting

To forecast the number of US states that will pass legislation regulating deepfakes before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate:** The base rate is informed by the adoption patterns of state-level technology regulations, particularly those with bipartisan support and high public salience. Historically, laws addressing new technologies follow an S-curve, with rapid adoption after early movers. Given the context, a base rate of 10-15 states per year during peak adoption phases is plausible. However, considering the specific context of deepfake laws and the election security angle, a more aggressive base rate of 20-30 states over two years is justified. The mean of this base rate is approximately 25 states, with a variance reflecting the uncertainty in adoption speed.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The current situation aligns with the base case in terms of high public salience and bipartisan support, which typically drive rapid legislative adoption.

**Differences:** The legislative calendar constraint is a significant deviation from the base case, as most state sessions have concluded for 2025. This limits the potential for additional states to pass legislation before 2026, effectively freezing the number of states at the current count, with only minor adjustments possible.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Legislative Momentum (↑):** The significant legislative activity in 2024-2025 suggests a high likelihood of many states having already passed laws.
- **Session Conclusion (↓↓):** The end of legislative sessions in 2025 drastically reduces the likelihood of additional states passing laws.
- **Special Sessions (↑):** A small chance exists for states with year-round or special sessions to pass laws, but this is limited.
- **First Amendment Challenges (↓):** Legal challenges could slow down or prevent the passage of new laws.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

**Prior:** Centered around 38 states, reflecting the expected increase from the 15 states as of March 2024.

**Evidence Impact:** The conclusion of legislative sessions is a dominant factor, heavily concentrating the posterior around the current number of states with laws. The possibility of 1-2 additional states passing laws is minor but present.

**Posterior Mean:** The mean shifts slightly upwards from the current count, but the variance is significantly reduced due to the legislative calendar constraint.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

**Overconfidence Check:** The primary risk is underestimating the potential for special sessions or reclassification of existing laws. However, given the strong evidence of session conclusions, the forecast should remain conservative.

**Alternative Scenarios:** A major deepfake incident could prompt emergency sessions, but this remains unlikely given the timeline.

**Adjustment:** The forecast accounts for minor tail risks but remains centered on the current legislative count.

### 6. Final Percentiles

Given the analysis, the forecast is heavily concentrated around the current number of states with deepfake laws, with a small chance of 1-2 additional states passing legislation.

# Forecast: US States Passing Deepfake Legislation Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the state-level adoption of technology regulations that address novel threats, particularly those with bipartisan concern. Based on the research report:

- As of March 2024, 15 states had passed deepfake legislation
- The adoption pattern follows an S-curve with rapid adoption during peak phase
- For issues with bipartisan consensus, 30-40 states typically adopt similar laws within 2-3 years

Given these patterns and the specific timeline (March 2024 to January 2026), my prior distribution centers around 38 states, with a standard deviation of approximately 5 states. This reflects the expected rapid adoption during 2024-2025 legislative sessions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Deepfake regulation has bipartisan support like other widely-adopted state laws
- The technology poses clear, understandable threats (election integrity, non-consensual imagery)
- Federal inaction creates a vacuum for state legislation

**Key differences:**
- Time constraint: We're forecasting in late November 2025, when most 2025 legislative sessions have concluded
- Technological urgency: The pace of AI development creates stronger motivation than typical tech issues
- High starting point: We began with 15 states already having legislation in March 2024
- Legal challenges: First Amendment concerns may have slowed some legislation

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing count higher:**
- Bipartisan consensus on harms (moderate ↑): Both parties agree on the need to regulate malicious deepfakes
- Federal inaction (moderate ↑): Absence of federal legislation motivates states to fill the gap
- NGA model policy (July 2025) (strong ↑): Provided template legislation making it easier for states to act
- Tech firm watermarking commitments (October 2025) (weak ↑): Increased salience and provided technical framework

**Evidence pushing count lower:**
- Legislative calendars (very strong ↓): Almost all state legislatures have adjourned for 2025
- Court injunction (September 2025) (moderate ↓): Created legal uncertainty that may have paused legislation
- First Amendment challenges (weak ↓): Constitutional concerns requiring more careful legislative drafting

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 38 states, I need to update based on the strongest evidence:

**Major update - Legislative calendars:** The fact that almost all 2025 legislative sessions have concluded by November 2025 drastically reduces uncertainty. This effectively freezes the count at whatever it currently is, with minimal chance of additional states passing legislation in the remaining month of 2025.

This shifts my distribution dramatically:
- Mean shifts from 38 to approximately the current count (which appears to be around 35-37 based on context)
- Variance decreases substantially, as there's little opportunity for change
- The distribution becomes right-skewed, with a small probability tail for 1-2 more states passing legislation in special sessions

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I don't have the exact current count as of November 2025, which creates significant uncertainty
- I may be underestimating the possibility of special legislative sessions in response to a major deepfake incident
- The definition of what constitutes "deepfake legislation" could vary between sources
- Some states may have passed legislation that hasn't yet been cataloged by tracking sources

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a more conservative estimate centered around 30 states, assuming slower adoption due to legal challenges and definitional issues. However, given the strong bipartisan support and the pattern of rapid adoption for similar issues, this seems less likely.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the analysis above, and particularly the time constraint with most 2025 legislative sessions concluded, I estimate the following percentiles:

P10: 34
P20: 35
P40: 36
P60: 37
P80: 38
P90: 39

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the adoption speed of novel, bipartisan-supported state-level legislation. The research report identifies several relevant reference classes:
*   **S-curve for new tech laws:** Suggests a peak adoption rate of 10-15 states per year.
*   **Election security measures:** Suggests a surge of 20-30 states in the two-year window around a presidential election (2024-2025).
*   **Laws with broad bipartisan consensus:** Can see 30-40 states adopt them within 2-3 years.

Starting from a baseline of 15 states in March 2024, these base rates suggest a rapid increase. A blend of these priors would anticipate a significant number of new states passing laws through 2024 and 2025. A prior distribution formed at the beginning of 2025 might have been centered around **38 states** (15 + ~23 new states over the period), with significant variance (e.g., a standard deviation of 5-7 states) to account for the unpredictable nature of legislative sessions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that deepfake regulation is a high-salience, bipartisan issue, which fuels rapid adoption. However, it is critically different in one overwhelming aspect: **timing**. The forecast is being made on November 28, 2025, for a resolution date of January 1, 2026. The vast majority of state legislative sessions for 2025 have already concluded. This means the primary mechanism for adding new states to the count is no longer available. The base rate of "states per year" is almost irrelevant for the remaining one-month period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence must be weighed against the prior established above.

*   **Evidence 1: Legislative Calendars (↓↓ Very Large Impact):** The research report states, "As of late November 2025, nearly all state legislatures have adjourned for the year." This is the single most important piece of information. It provides an extremely strong likelihood that the final number will be equal or very close to the *current* number of states with such laws. This evidence drastically collapses the variance of the forecast.
*   **Evidence 2: Current State Count (Anchor Point):** The background notes 15 states as of March 2024. The base rates suggest a rapid increase since then. Based on the high legislative activity described, a plausible current count for November 2025 would be in the low 40s. I will anchor my posterior on an estimated current count of **41 states**. This number is consistent with the high end of the prior distribution, reflecting the strong legislative momentum that occurred during 2024 and 2025.
*   **Evidence 3: Possibility of Late Additions (↑ Small Impact):** A few states have year-round sessions or could hold a special session. A governor could also sign a bill that was passed at the end of a session. This creates a small but non-zero chance of the count increasing by 1 or 2 before the deadline. This skews the distribution slightly to the right.
*   **Evidence 4: Definitional/Source Uncertainty (↕ Small Impact):** The research report highlights the risk of "Definitional Ambiguity" and "Data Lag" from the resolution source (MultiState). The source could re-categorize a state's law, removing it from the list, or retroactively add a state. This introduces variance in both directions, suggesting the final count could be slightly higher or lower than the true current number due to classification changes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A broad distribution centered around 38, representing an early-2025 forecast.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence of "legislative sessions are over" acts as an extremely strong filter. It makes outcomes far from the current count highly improbable. The likelihood function is sharply peaked at the current number of states.
*   **Posterior:** The prior is almost entirely superseded by this powerful evidence. The posterior becomes a very narrow distribution centered on my estimate of the current count (41). The mean of the posterior is ~41. The variance is drastically reduced, but not zero, to account for late additions and classification uncertainty. The distribution is slightly right-skewed due to the higher chance of a late addition versus a late removal.

My posterior distribution is centered at 41, but I assign a ~25% chance of a downward revision or error in my estimate (to 39-40) and a ~35% chance of an upward revision or late addition (to 42-43).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is highly dependent on my estimate of the *current* number of states, which is not explicitly given for November 2025 in the report. The report itself calls this out as a key caveat. My distribution must account for this uncertainty. If the true current number is actually 38 or 44, my forecast would be off. I have widened my P10-P90 range to reflect this uncertainty about the starting point, rather than just the uncertainty of what might happen in December. An alternative forecast might center on a lower number, like 38, if one believes the legislative momentum was less than I estimated. However, the bipartisan and election-security nature of the issue makes a large number of enactments in 2024-2025 more plausible. The main risk is overconfidence in the narrowness of the range, so I have expanded the tails to account for a multi-state reclassification by the source, which is a plausible scenario.
