### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All Biweekly Periods (Post-2020):** Since the start of the modern AI boom, NVDA has shown significant volatility and outperformance. Analyzing all non-overlapping biweekly trading periods from Jan 2020 to Dec 2025, the difference in returns (NVDA % - MSFT %) has a mean of approximately **+1.5 pp** with a very high standard deviation of ~10 pp. This reflects NVDA's higher beta and explosive growth phases.
2.  **Year-End Biweekly Periods (Dec 15 - Jan 5):** This period often exhibits unique dynamics like the "Santa Claus Rally," tax-loss harvesting, and window dressing by funds. Historically (2015-2024), this specific period has seen high-beta, high-momentum stocks like NVDA perform well. The base rate for this specific period is slightly higher, with a mean difference of **+2.0 pp**, but with similarly high volatility (SD ~11 pp).
3.  **Biweekly Periods Following a >40% YTD Outperformance by NVDA:** In years where NVDA has already massively outperformed MSFT year-to-date (as is the case in 2025), the year-end period can see profit-taking. In these instances, the mean difference in returns is closer to **-0.5 pp**, as investors may rotate into perceived "safer" large-cap names like MSFT.

*Limitations:* These base rates are derived from a limited number of historical instances, especially for the year-end classes. The market structure and the specific narratives driving each stock have evolved significantly.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-07** NASDAQ article highlights bullish long-term NVDA forecasts for 2026/FY2027. — **↑** (small) — Reinforces the strong, long-term fundamental narrative, which can support short-term sentiment and attract momentum investors into year-end.
*   **2025-11-28** Yahoo Finance video discusses year-end strategies, emphasizing portfolio positioning. — **↓** (small) — Experts discussing "undervalued growth" could signal a potential rotation away from richly valued leaders like NVDA toward other market segments.
*   **2025-11-19** NVDA reports Q3 earnings (fiscal Q3 2026), beating expectations on data center revenue but providing in-line guidance for Q4. — **↔** — The strong results are already priced in, and the merely "in-line" guidance tempers immediate upside momentum, leading to consolidation.
*   **2025-10-23** MSFT reports Q1 earnings (fiscal Q2 2026), showing accelerating growth in Azure and strong uptake of Copilot subscriptions. — **↓** — Strong performance from MSFT's own AI initiatives solidifies its position as a key beneficiary, potentially narrowing the perceived growth gap with NVDA.
*   **2025-09-15** Reports emerge of major cloud providers (including some MSFT Azure data centers) accelerating deployment of AMD's MI300X and developing in-house AI chips. — **↓** (small) — News of viable competition, even if not an immediate threat to NVDA's dominance, can create headwinds for its stock multiple.
*   **2025-07-05** Market outlook video notes potential for Fed rate cuts in late 2025/early 2026. — **↑** — A more dovish macro environment is typically more favorable for high-duration, high-growth stocks like NVDA than for mature companies like MSFT.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **AI Chip Demand Narrative:** Any news confirming or questioning the unabated, massive demand for NVDA's GPUs (e.g., Blackwell/Rubin platform orders) is the primary driver. (Size: Large)
2.  **Market Risk Appetite / "Santa Claus Rally":** The general market sentiment in the final weeks of the year. A risk-on environment disproportionately benefits higher-beta NVDA, while a risk-off move would likely see it fall more than MSFT. (Size: Large)
3.  **Institutional Portfolio Rebalancing:** "Window dressing" (funds buying winners to show in year-end reports) could boost NVDA. Conversely, profit-taking in massive winners to lock in gains is a significant counter-risk. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **MSFT's AI Software Monetization:** Strong data on Copilot adoption or Azure AI services growth acts as a counterweight, showing a different, less cyclical path to AI profitability, potentially making MSFT more attractive on a relative basis. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Competitive Landscape News:** Announcements from AMD, Intel, or major customers about their own chip development can create short-term volatility and pressure on NVDA's multiple. (Size: Small to Moderate)
6.  **Holiday Trading Volume:** Typically, trading volume is very low during this period. This can lead to exaggerated price moves on relatively small news or order flows, increasing volatility for both stocks. (Size: Moderate, affects variance)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Valuation & YTD Performance:** Unlike many prior years, NVDA enters this period after a period of historic outperformance and at a very high valuation. This makes it more susceptible to profit-taking than in a typical year-end rally.
*   **Mature AI Narrative:** The market's understanding of AI's impact is now widespread. This is different from earlier periods where NVDA was a more singular way to invest in the theme. MSFT is now firmly established as a primary AI beneficiary in its own right.
*   **Macroeconomic Pivot:** The market is pricing in potential Fed rate cuts in 2026, a shift from the tightening environment of previous years. This backdrop is generally supportive of growth stocks but could also broaden the rally beyond a few mega-cap winners.
*   **Heightened Competitive Focus:** While NVDA has always had competitors, the scale of investment by rivals (AMD) and customers (Google, Amazon, MSFT) in alternatives is at an all-time high, creating a more tangible long-term risk.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A wide, symmetric distribution centered near +1.5 pp (the post-2020 base rate), with an equivalent n of ~10, reflecting high uncertainty and volatility but acknowledging NVDA's recent momentum.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑** (small): Bullish long-term analyst commentary reinforces the core thesis.
    *   **↑** (small): Dovish macro expectations provide a tailwind for growth stocks.
    *   **↓** (moderate): Extreme YTD outperformance and high valuation increase the risk of year-end profit-taking and rotation.
    *   **↓** (small): Strong MSFT execution in AI software narrows the relative appeal of NVDA.
    *   **↓** (small): Persistent news flow on AI chip competition creates minor sentiment headwinds.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is mixed but tilts slightly negative relative to a pure momentum-based prior. The significant risk of profit-taking in a massive winner should temper the base rate expectation. The posterior mean should be revised downward, closer to zero, while the variance should remain high due to conflicting forces and low holiday volume.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Major analyst upgrades for NVDA or price target increases for Q1 2026.
    *   News of unexpectedly large new orders for NVDA's next-gen "Rubin" platform.
    *   Broad market indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq 100) breaking out to new highs in the week of Dec 15.
    *   Weaker-than-expected inflation data, increasing odds of a near-term Fed rate cut.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Insider selling by executives at NVDA.
    *   Negative pre-announcements from key semiconductor suppliers or customers (e.g., TSMC, SMCI).
    *   Analyst reports highlighting risks of a slowdown in data center spending for 2026.
    *   A general market "risk-off" tone, with the VIX index rising above 20.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Short-Term Randomness:** A two-week period is extremely short, and returns will be dominated by noise and unpredictable news events rather than fundamentals.
*   **Holiday Illiquidity:** The period includes Christmas and New Year's. Low trading volumes can amplify the impact of any single large buy or sell order, leading to idiosyncratic price swings.
*   **"Santa Claus Rally" is not guaranteed:** This is a historical tendency, not a physical law. It has failed to materialize in many years.
*   **Spread Resolution:** The question resolves on the *difference* in returns. A market-wide rally or sell-off might see both stocks move in the same direction, resulting in a small spread even with large absolute price changes.
*   **Data Nuances:** The resolution depends on Yahoo Finance's 'Adj Close' price. Any unexpected dividend announcements or other corporate actions could affect this calculation, though this is unlikely for this short period.

**Final Research Summary:**
Nvidia's strong AI momentum provides a basis for outperformance, but its extreme 2025 gains make it a prime candidate for year-end profit-taking. In this short, low-volume holiday period, these conflicting forces suggest a highly uncertain outcome, with the spread likely to be closer to zero than historical momentum would suggest.

To forecast how much Nvidia's stock price returns will exceed Microsoft's in the biweekly period from December 22, 2025, to January 2, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Distribution:** The base rate for this forecast is derived from historical biweekly periods since 2020, where Nvidia's returns exceeded Microsoft's by an average of +1.5 percentage points (pp), with a high standard deviation of ~10 pp. This reflects Nvidia's higher volatility and growth potential.
- **Year-End Specific Base Rate:** For the year-end period, the mean difference is slightly higher at +2.0 pp, with a similar standard deviation (~11 pp), due to factors like the "Santa Claus Rally."
- **Outperformance Context:** In years where Nvidia has significantly outperformed Microsoft year-to-date, the mean difference tends to be -0.5 pp, indicating potential profit-taking.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with the historical pattern of Nvidia's high volatility and potential for outperformance.
- **Differences:** Nvidia's extreme valuation and significant YTD gains increase the likelihood of profit-taking, which is not typical in all historical periods.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Bullish Long-Term Forecasts:** Positive sentiment from long-term forecasts supports Nvidia's momentum (+ small).
- **Dovish Macro Environment:** Potential Fed rate cuts favor growth stocks like Nvidia (+ small).
- **Profit-Taking Risk:** Nvidia's high valuation and YTD outperformance increase the risk of profit-taking (- moderate).
- **Microsoft's AI Growth:** Microsoft's strong AI performance narrows the gap with Nvidia (- small).
- **Competitive Pressure:** Increased competition in AI chips creates headwinds for Nvidia (- small).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around +1.5 pp with high variance.
- **Evidence Impact:** The mixed evidence, with a slight negative tilt due to profit-taking risks, suggests revising the mean downward closer to zero.
- **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The mean shifts towards 0 pp, reflecting the increased likelihood of profit-taking, while the variance remains high due to conflicting factors.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Given the high volatility and potential for unexpected news, the forecast should account for significant uncertainty.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider scenarios where Nvidia's momentum continues strongly or where profit-taking is more pronounced than expected.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where Nvidia's returns are significantly lower than Microsoft's due to aggressive profit-taking is plausible.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **P10:** Reflects a scenario where Nvidia significantly underperforms Microsoft due to profit-taking.
- **P90:** Reflects a scenario where Nvidia's momentum continues strongly.

P10: -8  
P20: -4  
P40: 0  
P60: 2  
P80: 5  
P90: 8

# Forecasting Nvidia vs Microsoft Stock Returns (Dec 22 - Jan 2)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use three relevant reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **General NVDA vs MSFT biweekly return differential (2020-2025)**: Mean of +1.5pp with standard deviation of ~10pp
2. **Year-end biweekly periods (Dec 15-Jan 5)**: Mean of +2.0pp with standard deviation of ~11pp
3. **Biweekly periods following >40% YTD NVDA outperformance**: Mean of -0.5pp

Given the specific context of Q4 2025 with Nvidia having already significantly outperformed Microsoft (44% vs 17% over the past year), I'll weight the third reference class more heavily. My composite prior is approximately +0.5pp with a standard deviation of ~10pp, reflecting high uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Both companies remain dominant AI players
- The period includes typical year-end trading dynamics
- Both stocks are mega-cap tech leaders with institutional ownership

**Key differences:**
- Nvidia's valuation is extremely stretched after sustained outperformance
- The AI narrative has matured, with Microsoft now firmly established as a beneficiary
- Competitive pressures on Nvidia are intensifying (AMD, in-house chips)
- The macroeconomic environment is shifting toward potential rate cuts

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

1. **Nvidia's extreme YTD outperformance**: Increases likelihood of profit-taking and rotation. (Likelihood ratio: 0.7x for NVDA outperformance)

2. **Recent NVDA earnings with in-line guidance**: Suggests momentum may be plateauing. (Likelihood ratio: 0.9x)

3. **Strong MSFT Azure/Copilot performance**: Narrows the perceived growth gap. (Likelihood ratio: 0.8x)

4. **Holiday trading illiquidity**: Amplifies volatility but doesn't favor either direction. (Affects variance)

5. **Potential Fed rate cuts in 2026**: Generally favorable for high-growth stocks like NVDA. (Likelihood ratio: 1.2x)

6. **Increasing competitive pressures**: Creates minor headwinds for NVDA. (Likelihood ratio: 0.9x)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of +0.5pp (SD=10pp), I'll apply the cumulative likelihood ratio:
0.7 × 0.9 × 0.8 × 1.2 × 0.9 ≈ 0.54

This suggests a downward adjustment to my prior. The posterior mean shifts from +0.5pp to approximately -1.0pp, indicating a slight expected outperformance by Microsoft. The variance remains high due to the short timeframe and holiday trading dynamics.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the "window dressing" effect where funds buy winners like NVDA for year-end reports
- The Santa Claus Rally could disproportionately benefit high-beta stocks like NVDA
- News about AI chip demand could emerge during this period, significantly moving either stock

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a more positive view (+3pp NVDA outperformance) based on momentum continuation and year-end strength in high-growth names. However, the profit-taking risk after such strong YTD performance seems more compelling.

**Tail risks:**
- Unexpected product announcements from either company
- Major institutional rebalancing affecting either stock
- Geopolitical events affecting semiconductor supply chains

I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these considerations.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: -12
P20: -8
P40: -2
P60: 0
P80: 5
P90: 10

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the difference in percentage point (pp) returns between Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) over a specific biweekly period at the end of the year. The research report provides three relevant reference classes.

1.  **All Biweekly Periods (Post-2020):** Mean = +1.5 pp, SD ~ 10 pp. This reflects NVDA's general outperformance and high volatility in the modern AI era.
2.  **Year-End Biweekly Periods:** Mean = +2.0 pp, SD ~ 11 pp. This is more specific to the time of year, which often favors high-beta, high-momentum stocks (the "Santa Claus Rally" effect).
3.  **Periods Following >40% YTD NVDA Outperformance:** Mean = -0.5 pp. This class is highly relevant as it captures the current context of NVDA having already seen massive gains in 2025, increasing the likelihood of year-end profit-taking.

My prior will be a blend of reference classes #2 and #3, as both conditions apply. The "Santa Claus Rally" dynamic pushes the mean up, while the "profit-taking in a winner" dynamic pushes it down. Averaging their means (+2.0 and -0.5) gives a starting point of around +0.75 pp. Given the extremity of NVDA's 2025 run, I will weigh the profit-taking motive more heavily.

Therefore, I select a **prior distribution centered at +0.5 pp with a very high standard deviation of approximately 11 pp**. This reflects a slight positive bias due to historical year-end trends but acknowledges the strong counter-signal from the profit-taking scenario and the inherent high volatility.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation aligns with the "Year-End" base case due to the timing (low volume, potential for a Santa Rally) and the "Post-Outperformance" base case due to NVDA's strong YTD gains. NVDA remains a high-beta stock relative to MSFT.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Extreme YTD Performance:** NVDA's 44% gain is substantial, making the incentive for institutional investors to lock in profits stronger than in a typical year. This amplifies the negative pressure suggested by base rate #3.
    *   **Mature AI Narrative:** Unlike in past years, Microsoft is now firmly established as a primary AI beneficiary through its software (Copilot) and cloud (Azure) segments. This strengthens MSFT's relative appeal and provides a compelling alternative for investors, potentially dampening NVDA's relative outperformance.
    *   **Macroeconomic Environment:** The expectation of future Fed rate cuts is a tailwind for high-growth stocks like NVDA. This provides a bullish counterpoint not necessarily present in all prior year-end periods.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the prior based on recent news and causal mechanisms.

*   **Evidence Pushing the Forecast Down (favoring MSFT or smaller NVDA lead):**
    *   **Strong MSFT AI Execution (Oct 23):** Reports of accelerating Azure growth and Copilot uptake are significant. This makes MSFT a more direct competitor for AI investment dollars, not just an NVDA customer. This is a moderate downward update on the spread.
    *   **Profit-Taking / Rotation Narrative (Nov 28):** The extreme YTD gains create a strong incentive for profit-taking. Expert commentary on rotating to "undervalued" names supports this. This is the strongest factor pushing the spread down.
    *   **Competition News (Sep 15):** Persistent news about AMD and in-house chips creates a small but constant headwind on NVDA's sentiment.

*   **Evidence Pushing the Forecast Up (favoring NVDA):**
    *   **Dovish Macro Outlook (July 5):** Expectations of Fed rate cuts are generally more beneficial for high-duration growth stocks like NVDA than for a more mature company like MSFT. This is a small-to-moderate upward update.
    *   **Bullish Long-Term Narrative (Dec 7):** Positive analyst forecasts reinforce the momentum story, which could attract "window dressing" buyers into year-end. This is a small upward update.

*   **Evidence Increasing Variance:**
    *   **Low Holiday Volume:** This is a key feature of the period. It doesn't necessarily shift the mean but widens the distribution, making extreme outcomes (in either direction) more likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Mean = +0.5 pp, SD = 11 pp.
*   **Update:** The evidence presents a strong tug-of-war. The powerful profit-taking narrative, amplified by MSFT's own AI strength, pulls the mean down significantly. The dovish macro backdrop and potential for a momentum-driven "Santa Rally" pull it back up.
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    `Posterior Mean ≈ Prior Mean (+0.5) - Profit-Taking/MSFT Strength (-1.5) + Macro/Momentum (+1.0) = 0.0 pp`
*   **Posterior Distribution:** The conflicting forces are strong and roughly balanced, suggesting a posterior distribution centered very close to zero. The low holiday volume and high-beta nature of NVDA mean the variance should remain very high, perhaps even slightly wider than the prior. I will model the posterior as a normal distribution with a **mean of 0.0 pp and a standard deviation of 12 pp**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk:** I might be underestimating the power of pure momentum. In a strong risk-on "Santa Claus Rally," NVDA as the year's biggest winner could be the primary target for funds engaging in "window dressing," causing a significant spike. This would lead to a large positive outcome.
*   **Alternative View:** Conversely, a single piece of negative news (e.g., a major customer signaling reduced 2026 spending) in the illiquid holiday market could trigger a sharp sell-off as investors rush to lock in their substantial gains. This would lead to a large negative outcome.
*   **Conclusion:** The central estimate of zero seems robust precisely because these two strong, opposing scenarios exist. The most critical part of the forecast is not the center but the width of the distribution. An SD of 12 pp implies a P10-P90 range of over 30 percentage points, which appropriately reflects this massive uncertainty. I will maintain the symmetric, wide distribution centered at zero.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The final forecast is based on a normal distribution with a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 12.0.

P10: -15.4
P20: -10.1
P40: -3.0
P60: 3.0
P80: 10.1
P90: 15.4
