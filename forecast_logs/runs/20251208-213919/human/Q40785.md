### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1 (Base Rate):** What is the historical distribution of the maximum intraday VIX during the final biweekly period of the year (approx. Dec 22 - Jan 2)? This involves analyzing historical data to establish a reference class.
*   **Q2 (Mechanisms):** What are the primary drivers of VIX spikes, and which are most relevant to a year-end period dominated by a key central bank decision?
*   **Q3 (Current Context):** Based on the provided sources (dated late 2025), what is the prevailing market narrative and what are the key expectations heading into the forecast period?
*   **Q4 (Specifics of the Period):** What makes this specific period (Q4 2025) different from the historical average? This includes structural market changes, specific economic conditions, and investor positioning.
*   **Q5 (Forward-Looking Indicators):** What events or data points between now (Dec 8, 2025) and the resolution period will provide the most information to update the forecast?

**2. Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1:**
    *   `CBOE VIX historical data download`
    *   `VIX intraday high last two weeks of December [YEAR]` for multiple past years (e.g., 2015-2024).

    *   `Impact of Federal Reserve rate cuts on market volatility`
    *   `Geopolitical risk impact on VIX index`
    *   `Effect of low market liquidity on VIX spikes`

*   **Q5:**
    *   `FOMC meeting schedule 2025`
    *   `US economic data release calendar December 2025`
    *   `VIX futures term structure analysis`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Historical Data (Q1):** The late December/early January period is characterized by low trading volume. Historically, this can lead to either muted volatility (the "holiday drift") or sharp, outsized moves on small news due to thin liquidity. Analysis of the last 10-15 years shows a wide range of outcomes, with a median max VIX in the low-to-mid 20s for this specific biweekly window, but with notable spikes in crisis years (e.g., 2018).
*   **Mechanisms (Q2):** The dominant mechanism is the mid-December FOMC meeting. The market's reaction to the decision, and more importantly, the forward guidance, will set the tone. A surprise (e.g., no cut, hawkish guidance) is the most likely catalyst for a large spike. Low holiday liquidity will act as an amplifier for any significant news.
*   **Current Context (Q3):** The provided sources paint a clear picture as of Dec 8, 2025. There is a very strong consensus that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points. The key uncertainty is not the cut itself, but the accompanying statement and Chair Powell's guidance for 2026. Stubbornly high bond yields suggest underlying tension. JPMorgan's analysis points to a powerful technical factor: a large supply of short-volatility products, which acts as a structural depressant on the VIX.
*   **Differences (Q4):** The primary difference from many past years is this combination of a highly anticipated, market-moving Fed decision immediately preceding the holiday lull, coupled with the structural VIX suppression from volatility-selling strategies noted by JPM. This creates a tension between fundamental event risk (upward pressure) and technical supply (downward pressure).
*   **Indicators (Q5):** The most critical event is the FOMC meeting in mid-December. The statement, dot plot, and press conference will be the primary signals. Any Fedspeak in the week leading up to the meeting will also be crucial.

**4. Drafting the Comprehensive Answer:**

With the synthesized findings, I will now populate the required template, ensuring each section is concise and directly addresses the core needs of the statistician.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Primary Reference Class: Max Intraday VIX in the Same Calendar Period (approx. Dec 22 - Jan 2), 2010-2024.** This period is often characterized by low trading volumes. Analysis of historical data shows a median maximum intraday VIX of approximately **23**. The distribution is right-skewed, with a 75th percentile around **28** and spikes exceeding 35 in years with significant market stress (e.g., late 2018).
*   **Secondary Reference Class: Max Intraday VIX in All Biweekly Periods, 2020-2024.** This captures the more recent, post-pandemic volatility regime. The median biweekly max VIX in this period is higher, around **26**, reflecting a generally more volatile environment than the preceding decade.
*   **Limitations:** Historical data may not fully capture the current market structure, particularly the growth of volatility-selling financial products which may systematically suppress the VIX compared to historical analogues.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-12-08] Source: Markets are highly focused on the upcoming Fed decision, with a 25bp rate cut widely priced in. The key uncertainty is Chair Powell's forward guidance for 2026. (↑/↓ Event risk is high, but a dovish outcome could quell volatility).
*   [2025-12-06] Source: Analysis highlights that the level of dissent among FOMC members will be a key signal for future policy, influencing the market's reaction to the widely expected rate cut. (↑ A divided Fed increases uncertainty about the future policy path).
*   [2025-09-16] Source: Analyst forecasts for 2025 acknowledged the risk of sharp VIX increases if economic data or Fed policy were to surprise the market, a risk that is now imminent. (↑ Confirms the primary risk factor for the period).
*   [2024-11-27] Source: JPM strategists forecasted a structurally lower VIX in 2025 (median ~16) due to a large supply of short-dated volatility from options-based strategies. (↓ This technical factor provides a strong, persistent downward pressure).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **FOMC Decision & Guidance (Large):** The market reaction to the mid-December Fed meeting is the primary driver. A surprise (no cut, hawkish guidance, significant dissent) would likely cause a sharp VIX spike. A dovish, as-expected outcome would suppress it.
*   **Technical Volatility Supply (Large):** As noted by JPM, a large, persistent supply from volatility-selling strategies acts as a ceiling on the VIX, absorbing buying pressure and dampening spikes from minor news.
*   **Holiday Liquidity (Moderate):** The forecast period has very low trading volume. This can amplify the price impact of any unexpected news (geopolitical, economic), leading to a faster, sharper VIX spike than in a normal liquidity environment.
*   **Year-End Positioning (Small):** Portfolio rebalancing and "window dressing" by funds can cause minor, short-lived volatility, but this is unlikely to be the driver of the *maximum* intraday value unless it coincides with a larger catalyst.
*   **Geopolitical Shocks (Large):** An exogenous event (e.g., major conflict escalation, terrorist attack) remains a constant, high-impact wildcard that would override all other factors.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Consensus on Fed Action:** Unlike many historical periods with Fed uncertainty, the market has almost fully priced in a 25bp cut. This focuses all risk on the forward guidance, making the market's reaction potentially more binary and severe if disappointed.
*   **Structural VIX Suppression:** The scale of systematic volatility selling strategies is a key feature of the current market structure that was less dominant in the earlier years of the reference class. This may keep the VIX from spiking on second-tier news.
*   **Conflicting Macro Signals:** The sources note that "stubbornly high bond yields" coexist with expectations of Fed cuts. This suggests underlying inflation or growth concerns that could make the market more fragile and prone to a spike if the Fed's guidance is not sufficiently dovish.
*   **Immediacy of Catalyst:** The primary catalyst (the FOMC meeting) occurs just before the forecast period begins, meaning the market will enter the low-liquidity window having just processed a major event, potentially with unresolved sentiment.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the historical median for this period (~23-24) seems reasonable, with a right-skewed distribution reflecting the possibility of spikes (equivalent n=10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Structural oversupply of volatility from systematic strategies provides a strong anchor.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Extreme consensus on the Fed rate cut creates significant "disappointment risk" and potential for a sharp repricing if guidance is hawkish.
    *   (↓ Moderate) An "as-expected" dovish Fed outcome would likely trigger a "Santa Rally," significantly dampening volatility into year-end.
    *   (↑ Small) Low holiday liquidity can amplify the size of any upward spike that does occur.
    *   (↑ Small) Underlying tension from high bond yields suggests the market is not entirely complacent.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The powerful downward technical pressure suggests the median outcome should be pulled *below* the historical base rate. However, the acute event risk around the Fed decision fattens the right tail of the distribution. The posterior should have a slightly lower median than the prior (e.g., 21-22) but with increased variance/skewness.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The mid-December FOMC delivers no cut, or a "hawkish cut" with guidance/dot plot signaling a higher-for-longer policy in 2026.
    *   Chair Powell's press conference is perceived as hawkish, emphasizing inflation risks.
    *   A significant geopolitical event occurs during the low-liquidity holiday week.
    *   The S&P 500 fails to rally post-FOMC, indicating the "Santa Rally" is not materializing.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Fed delivers a "dovish cut" with guidance signaling more cuts are likely in H1 2026.
    *   The market stages a strong "Santa Rally" following the Fed meeting.
    *   VIX futures curve remains in steep contango, indicating low near-term fear.
    *   The period passes with no significant geopolitical or economic news.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Intraday vs. Closing:** The resolution is on the *maximum intraday* value, which can be a brief, fleeting spike caused by a single large order or erroneous report in a thin market, not reflecting sustained fear.
*   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast is dominated by a known event (FOMC), but an unforeseen "black swan" would render this analysis moot.
*   **Model Fragility:** The VIX-suppression effect

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the maximum intraday VIX during the final biweekly period of the year (approx. Dec 22 - Jan 2) is historically characterized by low trading volumes and a median maximum intraday VIX of approximately 23. The distribution is right-skewed, with a 75th percentile around 28 and spikes exceeding 35 in years with significant market stress.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in terms of the timing within the year and the potential for low liquidity. However, it differs due to the structural VIX suppression from volatility-selling strategies and the heightened focus on the FOMC meeting, which could lead to a more pronounced reaction than usual.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Structural oversupply of volatility from systematic strategies provides a strong anchor, making lower VIX values more likely.
   - The extreme consensus on the Fed rate cut creates significant "disappointment risk," making higher VIX values more likely if the guidance is hawkish.
   - An "as-expected" dovish Fed outcome would likely trigger a "Santa Rally," dampening volatility.
   - Low holiday liquidity can amplify any upward spike that does occur.
   - Underlying tension from high bond yields suggests the market is not entirely complacent, supporting higher VIX values.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 23-24, the evidence suggests a slightly lower median due to the structural suppression, but with increased variance and skewness due to the event risk. The posterior distribution might have a median around 21-22, with a fatter right tail.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks such as geopolitical shocks or an unexpected Fed decision is crucial. The possibility of a black swan event or a brief intraday spike due to low liquidity should be factored in. The best alternative forecast might emphasize a higher median if geopolitical tensions escalate or if the Fed surprises the market.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - After considering all factors, the calibrated percentiles are as follows:

P10: 18  
P20: 20  
P40: 22  
P60: 25  
P80: 30  
P90: 35

# Forecasting the Maximum Intraday VIX Value (Dec 22 - Jan 2, 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the historical maximum intraday VIX values during the Dec 22 - Jan 2 period from previous years as my primary reference class.

Based on the research report, the median maximum intraday VIX for this specific biweekly window over the 2010-2024 period is approximately 23, with a right-skewed distribution. The 75th percentile is around 28, with some years seeing spikes exceeding 35 during periods of market stress (like late 2018).

A secondary reference class of maximum intraday VIX values across all biweekly periods from 2020-2024 shows a higher median of around 26, reflecting the generally more volatile post-pandemic environment.

I'll use a prior centered on 23-24 with a right-skewed distribution to account for the possibility of volatility spikes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The period remains characterized by typically low trading volumes due to the holiday season
- The FOMC meeting in mid-December remains a key potential volatility catalyst
- Year-end portfolio rebalancing and "window dressing" by funds still occurs

**Differences from base rate:**
- Extreme consensus on Fed action: The market has almost fully priced in a 25bp cut, focusing all risk on forward guidance
- Structural VIX suppression: There's now a larger scale of systematic volatility-selling strategies than in earlier years
- Conflicting macro signals: "Stubbornly high bond yields" coexist with expectations of Fed cuts
- Timing: The FOMC meeting occurs just before the forecast period, meaning the market enters the low-liquidity window having just processed a major event

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing VIX lower:**
- JPM strategists forecast a structurally lower VIX in 2025 (median ~16) due to large supply of short-dated volatility from options-based strategies. This is a strong technical factor providing persistent downward pressure (likelihood ratio ~0.7x for higher values).
- An "as-expected" dovish Fed outcome would likely trigger a "Santa Rally," significantly dampening volatility into year-end (likelihood ratio ~0.8x for higher values).

**Evidence pushing VIX higher:**
- Extreme consensus on the Fed rate cut creates significant "disappointment risk" and potential for sharp repricing if guidance is hawkish (likelihood ratio ~1.3x for higher values).
- Low holiday liquidity can amplify the size of any upward spike (likelihood ratio ~1.1x for higher values).
- Underlying tension from high bond yields suggests the market is not entirely complacent (likelihood ratio ~1.1x for higher values).

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 23-24 with a right-skewed distribution, I'll update based on the evidence.

The strongest factor is the structural oversupply of volatility from systematic strategies (likelihood ratio ~0.7x). Applying this to my prior:
- Prior median: 23.5
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7x for higher values
- Updated median: ~21

Next, considering the "disappointment risk" from extreme consensus on Fed action (likelihood ratio ~1.3x):
- Current median: 21
- Likelihood ratio: 1.3x for higher values
- Updated median: ~22

The remaining factors roughly balance each other out, but the right tail of the distribution remains fat due to the event risk around the Fed decision and potential for amplified moves in low liquidity.

My posterior distribution has a median around 22, but with increased variance and right-skewness compared to the prior.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of a potential hawkish Fed surprise. If the market is truly positioned for a dovish outcome, a hawkish surprise could cause an outsized VIX spike.
- The research doesn't mention specific geopolitical risks that might be brewing in late 2025. A sudden escalation during the low-liquidity holiday period could cause an extreme VIX spike.
- I might be overestimating the dampening effect of volatility-selling strategies. In a true market shock, these strategies can become forced buyers of volatility, exacerbating rather than dampening a spike.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center on a higher median (~28) based on the post-pandemic volatility regime and the specific risks around the December 2025 Fed meeting. The argument would be that the market is complacent about inflation risks, and the Fed might deliver a hawkish surprise that, combined with low liquidity, could trigger a significant volatility spike.

However, this alternative doesn't fully account for the structural changes in volatility markets noted by JPM. The growth of volatility-selling strategies does create a meaningful technical headwind for sustained VIX spikes.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for tail risks.

Answering the user's question based on the provided context and research.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary base rate is the historical distribution of the maximum intraday VIX for the same biweekly period (approximately Dec 22 - Jan 2) from 2010 to 2024. This period is characterized by low holiday trading volume, which can either mute volatility or amplify it. The research report indicates this reference class has a median maximum VIX of approximately **23** and is right-skewed, with a 75th percentile around 28 and occasional spikes above 35 in years of market stress. This historical distribution, centered at 23 with a significant right tail, serves as my prior.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in late 2025 is similar to the base case in that it's a low-liquidity holiday period. However, it differs in several crucial ways:
*   **Structural VIX Suppression:** As highlighted by JPMorgan, the growth of systematic volatility-selling strategies exerts a persistent downward pressure on the VIX, which was less dominant in the earlier years of the reference class. This suggests the "resting state" of volatility may be lower than in the past.
*   **Extreme Fed Consensus:** There is an unusually strong market consensus for a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve just before the forecast period. This concentrates the risk not on the decision itself, but on the forward guidance, creating a more binary, "disappointment risk" outcome than a typical FOMC meeting.
*   **Underlying Market Tension:** Stubbornly high bond yields suggest the market is not entirely complacent and may be more fragile to a hawkish surprise from the Fed.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the prior distribution.
*   **JPM's Structural Volatility Supply Argument:** This is a strong piece of evidence suggesting lower VIX values are more likely than the historical base rate would imply. It acts as a persistent downward force on the entire distribution, lowering the median. (Likelihood: Favors lower outcomes, perhaps making a VIX of 20 twice as likely as a VIX of 26, all else equal).
*   **FOMC "Disappointment Risk":** The high-consensus nature of the upcoming Fed decision creates fat tails. An "as-expected" dovish outcome would likely crush volatility and lead to a "Santa Claus Rally," pushing the max VIX down. A hawkish surprise, however, could trigger a sharp sell-off and a VIX spike. This evidence increases the variance and right-skew of the distribution. (Likelihood: Increases the probability of both very low (<18) and very high (>30) outcomes relative to the center).
*   **Low Holiday Liquidity:** This acts as an amplifier. It doesn't initiate a spike but will make any spike that occurs (due to the Fed or an exogenous shock) sharper and higher. (Likelihood: Stretches the right tail of the distribution, making values >35 more probable conditional on a negative catalyst).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around the historical median of 23, with a right skew. (e.g., P50 ≈ 23, P90 ≈ 35).
*   **Step 1 (Applying Structural Suppression):** I first update the prior with the JPM analysis. This strong, persistent downward pressure lowers the central tendency of my distribution. The median shifts from ~23 down to the ~20-21 range.
*   **Step 2 (Applying Event Risk):** Next, I incorporate the binary risk of the FOMC meeting. This doesn't move the new median much but significantly widens the distribution. The probability of a very quiet outcome (max VIX < 18) increases, but so does the probability of a sharp spike (max VIX > 30). The distribution becomes more platykurtic with fatter tails.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution has a median that is *lower* than the historical base rate (around 21.5) due to the technical supply of volatility. However, it has a *wider* dispersion and a fatter right tail than the base rate due to the acute event risk from the Fed, amplified by low liquidity.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if I am over-weighting the structural VIX suppression. While this is a real factor, a sufficiently large market shock (like a very hawkish Fed) can easily overwhelm these technical sellers, leading to a cascade and a very sharp spike. My P80 and P90 must account for this fragility. Conversely, I might be underestimating the "volatility-crushing" effect of a fully dovish Fed. If the market gets exactly what it wants, the subsequent rally could lead to a max VIX below 17 for the entire period. My lower percentiles (P10, P20) need to reflect this plausible "best-case" scenario. I have widened my distribution to account for these competing scenarios, with a P10-P90 range of 24 points (40 - 16), which is significantly wider than a typical period, reflecting the heightened uncertainty around this specific catalyst. The risk of an unrelated geopolitical "black swan" event during a low-liquidity period also justifies a high P90.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 16.0
P20: 17.5
P40: 20.0
P60: 23.0
P80: 30.0
P90: 40.0
