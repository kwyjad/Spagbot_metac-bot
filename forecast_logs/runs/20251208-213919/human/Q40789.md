### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Long-Term Historical (1997-Present):** The long-term median for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2) is approximately 4.80% (480 bps). The mean is higher (~5.30%) due to extreme right-skewness from crisis periods (e.g., >20% in 2008, >10% in 2020). This class suggests a wide potential range, but a central tendency significantly above current levels.
2.  **Non-Recessionary Expansion Periods:** Excluding NBER-defined recessions and their immediate aftermath, the median spread is lower, typically in the 3.50% to 4.50% range. This class is more relevant if the base case is continued economic expansion into early 2026.
3.  **Year-End Periods (December):** Historically, December shows no strong directional bias but can exhibit lower liquidity. In stable years, spreads often drift or tighten slightly. In years with underlying stress, thin trading can exacerbate widening moves. The median change in December is close to zero, but the variance is notable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-10** Citi strategist warns of equity downside risk, advising traders to monitor the HY spread for cooling risk appetite. (↑) — Highlights underlying market fragility despite low current spreads.
*   **2025-08-17** PlanQuant article notes the spread is at 2.89%, significantly below its long-term average, suggesting market complacency. (↓) — Establishes a very low baseline and strong recent downward momentum.
*   **2025-11-07** Bondfish article uses a hypothetical spread of 3.70% for September, indicating market discussion may be centered higher than the August lows. (↔) — Provides context on market thinking, suggesting the sub-3% level is seen as anomalous.
*   **2025-12-01** Trading Economics and GuruFocus data confirm the spread at 2.89% and the underlying index yield at 6.64%. (↓) — Confirms that the tight spread environment has persisted from August into early December.
*   **2025-12-04** Macrotrends reports the U.S. High Yield Index Yield has fallen slightly to 6.57%. (↓) — A falling component yield, assuming stable Treasury rates, implies continued strength and tight spreads.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Economic Growth Expectations:** Stronger growth or "soft landing" narratives lower default risk, tightening spreads. Conversely, recession fears are the primary driver of spread widening. (Size: Large)
2.  **Corporate Default Rates:** The most direct driver. A rise in actual or forecasted default rates will force spreads wider as investors demand more compensation for risk. (Size: Large)
3.  **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** A dovish pivot (rate cuts, QE) is supportive for credit and tightens spreads. A hawkish stance or unexpected tightening widens spreads by increasing borrowing costs and slowing the economy. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Market Sentiment & Risk Aversion:** Broader market sentiment, often measured by indicators like the VIX, directly impacts risk appetite. A "risk-off" move in equities often spills over, causing HY spreads to widen. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Market Technicals (Flows & Liquidity):** Strong inflows into high-yield bond funds can create demand that tightens spreads, independent of fundamentals. Year-end illiquidity can amplify the price impact of any news or flows. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Low Starting Point:** The current spread of 2.89% is in the lowest decile historically, far below the long-term median (~4.80%) and even the non-recessionary median (~4.00%). This suggests the market is pricing in a very benign outcome.
*   **Significant Intra-Year Volatility:** The spread surged to 4.45% in April 2025 on trade tension fears before collapsing to 2.89% by August. This suggests the current calm may be fragile and sentiment can shift rapidly.
*   **Divergence Between Spreads and Warnings:** While spreads are extremely tight (signaling low risk), sources from August (Citi) highlight analyst concerns about downside risk, indicating a potential disconnect between market pricing and underlying risk assessment.
*   **Year-End Illiquidity from a Low Base:** Entering the typically illiquid holiday season from a point of extreme complacency creates asymmetric risk. There is little room for spreads to tighten further, but significant room to widen on any negative catalyst.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the non-recessionary median of ~4.00% (400 bps) seems appropriate, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=5) to reflect the recent volatility and unusual starting point.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The powerful downward momentum through H2 2025 and the current reading of 2.89% is strong evidence for a persistent low-spread regime.
    *   (↓ Small) Recent data in early December shows yields remain low, reinforcing the current state.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The memory of the Q1 2025 spike to 4.45% and analyst warnings suggest the market is prone to rapid reversals and underlying risks are not fully extinguished.
    *   (↑ Small) The context of year-end illiquidity creates an upward skew in the risk profile; a small negative shock could have an outsized widening effect.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the posterior down from the historical prior. However, the fragility and asymmetric risk suggest the final value may drift slightly higher from the absolute low of 2.89%. The posterior should be centered significantly lower than the prior, likely in the 3.00% - 3.50% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any negative pre-announcements for Q4 earnings.
    *   A sharp spike in the VIX index above 20.
    *   Hawkish commentary from the final FOMC meeting of the year.
    *   Unexpected negative inflation or employment data releases.
    *   News of a significant corporate credit default or bankruptcy.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A dovish FOMC statement or forward guidance.
    *   Strong holiday retail sales numbers, boosting Q4 GDP estimates.
    *   Continued strong inflows into high-yield bond ETFs and mutual funds.
    *   Resolution of any lingering geopolitical or trade uncertainties.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Year-End Illiquidity:** The final two weeks of the year have very thin trading volumes, which can lead to price movements that are not fundamentally driven.
*   **Asymmetric Risk Profile:** From a starting point of 2.89%, the potential for spreads to widen is far greater than their potential to tighten further, creating a right-skewed distribution of possible outcomes.
*   **Data Lag:** The final daily value for the period might be subject to slight delays or revisions on the FRED platform.
*   **Narrative Whiplash:** As seen in 2025, the market narrative can shift from "recession fears" to "complacency" in just one quarter. A single news event could trigger another such shift.

**Final Research Summary:**
The high-yield spread enters the forecast period at a historically low 2.89%, reflecting strong recent momentum and a complacent market. While the path of least resistance is for spreads to remain near these tight levels, the year-end illiquidity and memory of significant volatility earlier in the year create asymmetric risks skewed towards a modest widening.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread for the biweekly period of December 22, 2025, to January 2, 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is selected from the non-recessionary expansion periods, with a median spread of 3.50% to 4.50%. This is appropriate given the current economic context of continued expansion and low spreads.
   - The mean of this base rate is approximately 4.00%, with a variance reflecting historical volatility in non-recessionary periods.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current economic environment is not in recession, aligning with the non-recessionary base rate.
   - Differences: The current spread of 2.89% is significantly below the base rate, indicating market complacency and a benign outlook not fully captured by historical non-recessionary periods.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The current spread of 2.89% and recent data showing continued low yields suggest a strong likelihood of maintaining low spreads (↓ Large).
   - Analyst warnings and historical volatility indicate potential for rapid spread widening (↑ Moderate).
   - Year-end illiquidity could exacerbate any negative news, skewing risks towards widening (↑ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 4.00%, the strong evidence of low spreads pulls the posterior downwards.
   - Considering the fragility and asymmetric risks, the posterior is adjusted to center around 3.25%, with a wider spread to account for potential volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence in low spreads is a risk; the market's current state of complacency could quickly reverse.
   - Tail risks include unexpected economic data or geopolitical events causing a sharp spread widening.
   - An alternative forecast might center around 3.50% if assuming a more significant market correction, but current evidence supports a lower center.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - The forecast reflects a central tendency around 3.25%, with consideration for potential spread widening due to year-end factors and market fragility.

P10: 2.90
P20: 3.00
P40: 3.15
P60: 3.35
P80: 3.60
P90: 3.85

# Forecast: ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (Dec 22 - Jan 2, 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of:
- Long-term historical median (~4.80%)
- Non-recessionary median (~4.00%)
- Recent levels (2.89% as of December 2025)

Given the current economic environment appears to be non-recessionary, I'll center my prior around 3.75%, which balances the long-term historical data with the recent trend toward tighter spreads. The standard deviation would be approximately 1.00%, reflecting the historical volatility but giving more weight to recent stability.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're in a non-recessionary period, similar to other periods of economic expansion
- Credit markets generally function normally with typical risk pricing mechanisms

**Differences from base rate:**
- Current spread (2.89%) is extremely low by historical standards (bottom decile)
- Year-end illiquidity will be a factor (Dec 22-Jan 2 is typically thin trading)
- Recent history shows high volatility (spike to 4.45% in April 2025 before collapsing)
- Starting from an unusually low base creates asymmetric risk (more room to widen than tighten)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for lower spreads:**
- Current level is already at 2.89%, showing strong downward momentum (strong evidence)
- Recent yield data from early December shows continued low yields (moderate evidence)
- No immediate signs of credit stress in recent reports (moderate evidence)

**Evidence for higher spreads:**
- Year-end illiquidity typically amplifies any market moves (moderate evidence)
- Citi strategist warning about equity downside risk suggests underlying fragility (weak evidence)
- The extremely low starting point creates natural mean reversion pressure (moderate evidence)
- Memory of Q1 2025 spike to 4.45% shows how quickly sentiment can shift (weak evidence)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 3.75% with σ ≈ 1.00%:

**First update - Current level and momentum:**
- The evidence of the current 2.89% level and persistent downward momentum is strong
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring lower values
- This shifts my distribution downward to approximately 3.20% with reduced σ ≈ 0.80%

**Second update - Year-end illiquidity:**
- Year-end illiquidity creates asymmetric risk from the low starting point
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring slightly higher values
- This shifts my distribution slightly upward to approximately 3.30% with σ ≈ 0.75%

**Final posterior:**
- Centered around 3.30%
- More compressed than the prior (σ ≈ 0.75%)
- Right-skewed due to asymmetric risk (more room to widen than tighten)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating mean reversion effects; spreads can remain at extreme levels longer than expected
- I might be underestimating the strength of the current downward trend
- Year-end effects could be minimal if no catalysts emerge

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Bullish scenario:** Continued strong risk appetite keeps spreads near current lows (2.85-2.95%)
- **Bearish scenario:** A negative catalyst during thin holiday trading triggers a sharp widening (3.75-4.25%)
- **Most likely alternative:** Spreads drift slightly higher on technical factors but remain well below historical averages (3.00-3.15%)

I should widen my distribution slightly to account for these scenarios, particularly extending the right tail to accommodate potential rapid widening events.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to be centered around 3.25% with a right skew:

P10: 2.90%
P20: 3.00%
P40: 3.15%
P60: 3.30%
P80: 3.55%
P90: 3.85%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS), a measure of credit risk. To establish a prior, I will use the "Non-Recessionary Expansion Periods" as the most relevant reference class. The provided research report indicates a median spread between 3.50% and 4.50% during these times. This class is appropriate because the current low spread (2.89%) suggests the market is not pricing in an imminent recession.

I will center my prior distribution on a median of **4.00% (400 basis points)**. This distribution is inherently right-skewed, as spreads have a soft floor but can rise dramatically during periods of stress. The variance of this prior is large, reflecting historical volatility, with a plausible interquartile range spanning from ~3.50% to ~5.00%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current environment, as priced by the market, resembles a stable economic expansion, which is the core assumption of the chosen base rate.
*   **Differences:** The most critical difference is the **extremely low starting point**. The current spread of 2.89% is in the lowest historical decile, far below the non-recessionary median of ~4.00%. This indicates a market sentiment that is significantly more optimistic than the historical average for "good times." Furthermore, the forecast horizon is very short (a few weeks), meaning the current state is a powerful anchor. The report also notes significant volatility earlier in the year (a spike to 4.45%), suggesting the current calm may be fragile.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on several key pieces of evidence:

1.  **Current Level (2.89%):** This is the strongest piece of evidence. High-frequency financial series like this exhibit strong autocorrelation. The value in a few weeks is highly likely to be near the current value, absent a major shock. This provides a powerful likelihood function centered far below my prior, pulling the entire posterior distribution downwards.
2.  **Recent Momentum (↓):** The trend from August to December has been one of tightening spreads. This momentum reinforces the signal from the current low level, suggesting the path of least resistance is for spreads to remain tight.
3.  **Asymmetric Risk & Illiquidity (↑):** The forecast is for the last two weeks of the year, a period of notoriously thin liquidity. From a very low starting point, the potential for spreads to widen on negative news is much greater than their potential to tighten further on positive news. This creates an asymmetric risk profile and suggests a right-skewed posterior distribution with a fatter upper tail.
4.  **Analyst Warnings & Past Volatility (↑):** The memory of the spike to 4.45% earlier in the year and analyst warnings about complacency serve as countervailing evidence. They suggest that underlying risks exist and a "snap-back" towards the historical mean is a non-trivial possibility. This evidence argues for increasing the variance of the posterior distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at a median of 4.00%.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to a distribution anchored near the current value of 2.89%.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution will be a blend of the strong anchor at 2.89% and the pull towards the higher historical mean. Given the short time horizon, the anchor dominates.
    *   **Mean/Median Shift:** The posterior median will shift dramatically downwards from the prior's 4.00% to a value just slightly above the current 2.89%. I estimate a slight upward drift due to mean-reversion pressure and the asymmetric risk profile. I will center my posterior distribution around a median of **3.05%**.
    *   **Variance and Skew:** The posterior will be right-skewed. The downside is limited, as spreads are already tight. The upside is significant, reflecting the risk of a sharp widening move in an illiquid market. The variance will be wider than a simple random walk would suggest, to account for the possibility of a sentiment shift.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily anchored on the current low spread. The primary risk is underestimating the probability of a sudden "risk-off" event before year-end. An unexpected geopolitical event, a credit shock, or hawkish central bank surprise could cause spreads to gap out, especially in a thin market. My P80 and P90 must account for this tail risk. A plausible bear case would see spreads revisit the year's earlier highs above 4.00%.

Conversely, a bull case would involve a quiet holiday season with continued positive economic data, allowing spreads to drift even tighter, perhaps to 2.80% or 2.75%. My P10 and P20 should reflect this possibility, though the room for further tightening is limited.

My final distribution places the median (P50) at 3.05%, a modest 16 basis point increase from the current level. The P10 is only 4 bps below the current level, while the P90 is 121 bps above it, explicitly modeling the asymmetric, right-skewed risk. This seems like a balanced representation of the competing forces.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 2.85
P20: 2.90
P40: 3.00
P60: 3.15
P80: 3.55
P90: 4.10
