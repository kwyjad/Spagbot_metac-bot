### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major New US Tech Regulation on Domestic Activity:** Historically, implementing new, burdensome reporting requirements on a fast-moving domestic technology sector is slow and contentious. The process often takes years of debate, lobbying, and rulemaking. The base rate for a specific, novel regulation of this type being enacted within a ~2-3 year timeframe from its initial conception is low, perhaps **10-20%**.
2.  **Expansion of National Security-Related Reporting Regimes:** The US government has a history of imposing monitoring and reporting requirements on dual-use technologies or activities with national security implications (e.g., nuclear materials, specific biological agents, financial transactions via Bank Secrecy Act/KYC). Once a domain is identified as a key national security risk, the expansion of regulations is common. The base rate for expanding an *existing* regulatory paradigm (like export controls) to a new, related area (domestic use) within a few years is higher, perhaps **30-40%**.
3.  **Implementation of Presidential Executive Orders:** Executive Orders (EOs) often direct agencies to create new rules. The success and speed of this implementation vary. Given a direct mandate in an EO, the probability of a corresponding agency rule being finalized within 24 months is reasonably high. However, the specific form of the rule can be heavily modified by industry feedback and feasibility studies. The base rate for a rule that directly reflects the EO's intent being implemented is around **50-60%**, but the chance it takes this *specific* form (reporting by GPU purchasers) is lower.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-01-16** New BIS export controls introduced, including on AI model weights. ↑ — Shows continued aggressive regulatory action and a willingness to regulate beyond just hardware, moving towards controlling the AI development process itself.
*   **2024-12-11** CSIS analysis highlights that updated export controls aim to close loopholes. ↑ — Reinforces the administration's iterative and persistent approach to tightening AI-related controls, suggesting a proactive stance that could extend to domestic policy.
*   **2024-12-02** Commerce/BIS strengthens export controls on advanced semiconductors for military and AI applications. ↑ — Demonstrates that AI compute remains a top national security priority and that BIS is the primary actor, possessing the authority and willingness to issue new rules rapidly.
*   **2024-01-29** Dept. of Commerce publishes final rule on IaaS provider "Know Your Customer" (KYC) requirements (I-129T form). ↑ — This is a critical precedent. It establishes a reporting requirement for US cloud providers on the activities of *foreign* persons training large AI models, creating a framework that could be expanded to domestic users.
*   **2023-10-30** President Biden signs the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI. ↑ — The EO is the foundational policy document. It explicitly requires developers of the most powerful AI systems to report their model training plans and safety test results to the federal government, establishing the principle of mandatory reporting for AI development.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **National Security Concerns (Large ↑):** The primary driver. Fear that a domestic non-state actor, or a foreign entity operating through a US front, could train a dangerous AI model (e.g., for designing bioweapons or executing large-scale cyberattacks) provides a powerful impetus for monitoring who has frontier-level compute.
2.  **AI Safety & Risk Mitigation (Moderate ↑):** Prominent AI safety researchers and organizations advocate for compute governance as a means to gain visibility into the proliferation of frontier AI capabilities, providing an early warning system for potential risks from highly capable models.
3.  **Industry Pushback & Lobbying (Large ↓):** A broad, hardware-based reporting requirement would be seen by industry (chipmakers, cloud providers, AI labs) as a significant compliance burden, a threat to trade secrets, and a drag on innovation. Their lobbying efforts to limit the scope of regulation are a major counterforce.
4.  **Technical & Administrative Feasibility (Moderate ↓):** Defining and verifying "usage in the training of large AI models" is non-trivial. It is difficult to distinguish from other high-performance computing tasks. Creating and managing the government infrastructure to receive and analyze this data would be a major undertaking.
5.  **Political Will & Administrative Capacity (Moderate ↑/↓):** The Biden administration has shown strong will to regulate AI. However, with a resolution deadline of Dec 31, 2025, the timeline is extremely tight. The standard federal rulemaking process (proposal, public comment, finalization) can easily exceed the remaining time. A change in administration could halt or reverse this momentum entirely.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Speed of Capability Gains:** Unlike most previously regulated technologies, AI capabilities are advancing exponentially. This creates a sense of urgency among policymakers that can override the usual slow pace of regulation.
*   **Dominance of Private Sector Actors:** The key resources (compute, talent, data) are concentrated in a small number of US private companies, not nation-states. This makes direct regulation of these companies a more plausible and effective tool than international treaties.
*   **Software-Defined Nature:** The core risk is tied to software (models), but the key chokepoint is hardware (GPUs). This creates a unique regulatory challenge, pushing policymakers towards upstream interventions like monitoring hardware, which is more tangible than monitoring model development itself.
*   **Existing Regulatory Momentum:** The US government is not starting from scratch. There is a clear, escalating pattern of regulation via the Department of Commerce, from the 2022 export controls to the 2023 AI EO and the 2024 cloud KYC rules. This existing momentum makes further steps more likely than in a new regulatory area.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the reference class of major new domestic tech regulations, suggesting a low probability (e.g., ~20%) due to the high bar for implementation, industry opposition, and short timeframe. (Equivalent n ≈ 5).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The AI Executive Order and subsequent cloud KYC rule (I-129T) establish a strong precedent and the political will for mandatory AI development reporting.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The continuous and aggressive tightening of *export* controls by the same agency (BIS) that would likely issue a domestic rule shows they are highly active and empowered in this domain.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short timeline to resolution (approx. 2 months from today's date of 2025-10-30) makes the standard rulemaking process nearly impossible to complete unless a rule is already in the final stages.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The lack of a public Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for this specific requirement as of late 2025 is a strong negative signal.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Strong, persistent industry opposition creates a high barrier to a broad, hardware-based rule, favoring more targeted, capability-based reporting like that already in the AI EO.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for government *intent* is strong, pushing the probability up significantly from the base rate. However, the practical constraints of the short timeline and lack of a current public proposal are powerful counter-signals. The posterior should be lower than a pure "intent-based" forecast, settling in a range of low-to-moderate probability. The negative evidence from the timeline is likely dominant.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking from the Department of Commerce concerning domestic AI compute reporting.
    *   A major security incident or alarming new AI capability demonstration that is publicly attributed to an untracked private AI model.
    *   Leaked reports of a draft rule being circulated by the White House or Commerce Department.
    *   Major AI labs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) publicly calling for or endorsing such a regulation to create a level playing field.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official statements from Commerce/NIST indicating the current AI EO reporting requirements are sufficient for now.
    *   The passing of the resolution deadline (2025-12-31) without a finalized rule.
    *   A successful legal challenge to the existing I-129T cloud reporting rule, which would chill further regulatory expansion.
    *   Strong, coordinated public opposition from a coalition of tech companies, investors, and civil liberties groups.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on the definitions of "large numbers of GPUs" and "report their usage." A light-touch registration system might be implemented but not meet the threshold of "reporting usage."
*   **Rulemaking vs. Law:** The most plausible path is an agency

To forecast the probability of the US requiring purchasers of large numbers of GPUs to report their usage before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major new US tech regulation on domestic activity is low, around 10-20%, due to the slow and contentious nature of implementing new regulations in fast-moving tech sectors. However, given the context of national security and existing regulatory momentum, a slightly higher base rate of 20% is reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a fast-moving tech sector (AI and GPUs), similar to other tech regulations that have been slow to implement.
   - Differences: The urgency due to national security concerns and existing regulatory momentum (e.g., AI EO, cloud KYC rules) suggest a higher probability than typical tech regulations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **AI Executive Order and Cloud KYC Rule (↑ Large):** These establish a precedent for mandatory reporting, increasing the likelihood of similar regulations.
   - **Aggressive Export Controls (↑ Moderate):** Show the government's willingness to regulate AI-related technologies, suggesting a proactive stance.
   - **Short Timeline (↓ Large):** The timeline to resolution is very tight, making it unlikely for a new rule to be finalized in time.
   - **Lack of Public NPRM (↓ Moderate):** No public proposal for this specific requirement is a negative signal.
   - **Industry Opposition (↓ Moderate):** Strong industry pushback is a significant barrier to implementation.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 20% probability = 0.25 odds.
   - Likelihood ratio: The positive evidence (EO, KYC rule, export controls) increases the odds, but the negative evidence (timeline, lack of NPRM, industry opposition) decreases it.
   - Posterior odds: Adjusting for evidence, the posterior odds might be around 0.3.
   - Posterior probability: 0.3 / (1 + 0.3) ≈ 23%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The tight timeline and lack of NPRM are strong negatives that could be underestimated.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden security incident or political shift could rapidly increase regulatory action.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong negative signals, a conservative adjustment downward is warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, the final calibrated probability is 18%.

Final: 18%

# Will the US require purchasers of large numbers of GPUs to report their usage before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

1. **Implementation of major new tech regulations within a short timeframe (2-3 years)**: Historically, the base rate is low, around 15-20%, as regulations typically face industry opposition, technical challenges, and lengthy rulemaking processes.

2. **Extension of existing national security-related reporting regimes**: The US has a pattern of expanding reporting requirements for dual-use technologies once they're identified as national security concerns. This has a higher base rate of 30-40%.

3. **Implementation of specific measures from Presidential Executive Orders**: The Biden administration's 2023 AI Executive Order already established reporting requirements for AI model training. The base rate for implementing specific measures from EOs within 2 years is around 50-60%.

Given the question's specific focus on GPU usage reporting by the end of 2025, I'll weight these reference classes as follows:
- The first class is most relevant (weight: 0.5)
- The second class is moderately relevant (weight: 0.3)
- The third class is somewhat relevant (weight: 0.2)

Weighted prior: (0.5 × 17.5%) + (0.3 × 35%) + (0.2 × 55%) = 8.75% + 10.5% + 11% = **30.25%**

However, given the extremely short timeline remaining (only 2 months from today's date of October 30, 2025, until the resolution deadline), I need to significantly adjust this downward. The standard federal rulemaking process typically takes 12-18 months at minimum.

Adjusted prior: **15%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other tech regulations, this would impose compliance costs on industry players
- It involves the same agencies (Commerce Department, BIS) that handle export controls
- It addresses dual-use technology with national security implications
- It follows the pattern of the Biden administration's focus on AI governance

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline constraint**: With only 2 months remaining until the resolution deadline, there is extremely limited time for a formal rulemaking process
- **Precedent**: The 2024 IaaS provider "Know Your Customer" requirements create a direct precedent for reporting on AI model training
- **Urgency**: AI capabilities are advancing much faster than other regulated technologies, creating unusual pressure for rapid regulatory action
- **Concentration**: The key resources are concentrated in a small number of US companies, making regulation potentially more feasible

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting implementation (↑):**

1. **Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI (Oct 2023)**
   - P(E|H) = 0.95 (Almost certain if regulation will happen)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.70 (Still likely even without this specific regulation)
   - Likelihood ratio: 1.36 (Moderate increase)
   - The EO explicitly requires reporting of model training plans, establishing the principle

2. **IaaS Provider KYC Requirements (Jan 2024)**
   - P(E|H) = 0.90 (Very likely if regulation will happen)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.40 (Less likely without this specific regulation)
   - Likelihood ratio: 2.25 (Substantial increase)
   - Creates direct precedent for reporting on AI model training activities

3. **Continued strengthening of export controls (Dec 2024, Jan 2025)**
   - P(E|H) = 0.85 (Likely if regulation will happen)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.60 (Moderately likely even without this regulation)
   - Likelihood ratio: 1.42 (Moderate increase)
   - Shows ongoing regulatory momentum in the same domain

**Evidence against implementation (↓):**

1. **Absence of public Notice of Proposed Rulemaking**
   - P(E|H) = 0.05 (Very unlikely if regulation will happen)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.95 (Almost certain if regulation won't happen)
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.05 (Strong decrease)
   - The lack of a public proposal by late 2025 makes timely implementation nearly impossible

2. **Industry opposition to hardware-based reporting**
   - P(E|H) = 0.30 (Somewhat unlikely if regulation will happen)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.90 (Very likely if regulation won't happen)
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.33 (Substantial decrease)
   - Strong industry pushback creates significant barriers

3. **Technical challenges in defining and verifying "usage"**
   - P(E|H) = 0.40 (Somewhat unlikely if regulation will happen)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.80 (Likely if regulation won't happen)
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.50 (Moderate decrease)
   - Practical implementation difficulties may favor alternative approaches

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the prior of 15%, I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on absence of public NPRM:**
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.05 = 0.0088
- Posterior probability: 0.0088/(1+0.0088) = 0.87%

This dramatic drop reflects the reality that without a public proposal already in process, the timeline makes implementation extremely unlikely.

**Update on IaaS Provider KYC Requirements:**
- Prior odds: 0.87/99.13 = 0.0088
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.0088 × 2.25 = 0.0198
- Posterior probability: 0.0198/(1+0.0198) = 1.94%

**Update on industry opposition:**
- Prior odds: 1.94/98.06 = 0.0198
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.0198 × 0.33 = 0.0065
- Posterior probability: 0.0065/(1+0.0065) = 0.65%

After these key updates, the probability is extremely low, primarily due to the timeline constraint. The remaining evidence would have smaller effects on this already low probability.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the importance of the standard rulemaking process. In national security contexts, the government can sometimes move with unusual speed.
- There could be a rule already in the final stages that hasn't been made public yet.
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a last-minute executive action or emergency rule.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A narrower rule focused only on the largest GPU purchases (e.g., 10,000+ units) might face less opposition and be easier to implement quickly.
- A voluntary reporting program with strong incentives might be implemented as an interim step.
- A rule might already exist in classified form for national security reasons.

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for these scenarios. However, the timeline constraint remains the dominant factor.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of the US requiring purchasers of large numbers of GPUs to report their usage before 2026 is extremely low. The primary factor is the extremely short timeline remaining (2 months) without any public rulemaking process visible. While there is clear intent and precedent for such regulation, the practical constraints of implementation make it highly unlikely by the resolution deadline.

Final: 3%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Reference Class**: The implementation of a new, significant federal regulation on a major domestic industry.
*   **Reasoning**: The US federal rulemaking process, governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, is typically slow and deliberative. It involves stages like a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), a public comment period (usually 30-90 days), and the drafting of a final rule. Completing this entire process for a novel and contentious regulation within a short timeframe is rare.
*   **Initial Prior**: Given the resolution deadline is December 31, 2025, and the current date is October 30, 2025, there are only two months remaining. The base rate for a new regulation of this type to be proposed and finalized within such a short window is extremely low. I will set the prior at **5%**. This acknowledges that it's not impossible (e.g., via an emergency rule) but is highly improbable through standard procedures.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities**: The proposed regulation targets a technologically complex and economically vital sector. As with most such regulations, it would face significant industry lobbying and debate over its technical feasibility and economic impact, factors that typically slow down implementation.
*   **Differences**: The key difference is the immense sense of urgency driven by national security concerns surrounding advanced AI. Unlike typical tech regulation, AI is viewed by the current administration as a dual-use technology with potentially catastrophic risks. This has led to a pattern of unusually rapid and forceful executive action (e.g., export controls, the AI Executive Order), making the base case of "slow regulation" less applicable. The government is not starting from a standstill but is building on existing momentum.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation
I will evaluate the key evidence in light of the critical two-month timeline.

*   **Evidence 1: AI Executive Order (Oct 2023) and IaaS "Know Your Customer" Rule (Jan 2024).**
    *   This evidence is strongly positive for the *intent* to regulate AI compute. The EO established the principle of mandatory reporting for powerful AI model training, and the IaaS rule created a concrete precedent for requiring reports on compute usage (albeit for foreign users).
    *   P(E | H): If the US were to require GPU usage reporting (H), these preceding steps are highly likely.
    *   P(E | ~H): If the US were not going to require it (~H), these steps could still have been taken to address other perceived risks.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Strongly positive. This evidence significantly increases the probability above a "cold start" base rate by establishing clear political will and a plausible regulatory pathway through the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).

*   **Evidence 2: The Calendar - Only Two Months Remain.**
    *   This is the single most powerful piece of evidence. As of October 30, 2025, no NPRM for such a rule has been made public. Completing the standard rulemaking process by December 31 is procedurally impossible.
    *   P(E | H): The only way for the event to happen (H) is through a non-standard process, like an Interim Final Rule (IFR) issued with "good cause" to bypass public comment. The probability of being this close to the deadline with no public proposal, *given that a rule will be finalized*, is therefore very low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing no public proposal, *given that no rule will be finalized*, is extremely high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Very strongly negative. This evidence dramatically reduces the probability, as it invalidates the most common path to resolution.

*   **Evidence 3: Industry Pushback and Technical Complexity.**
    *   This is a moderately negative factor. A broad requirement on hardware purchasers would be complex to define and implement, and would generate fierce opposition from chipmakers, cloud providers, and AI labs. This opposition makes it less likely the administration would try to force through a rule with little-to-no public input via an IFR, as the political and legal backlash would be substantial.

### 4. Bayesian Updating
*   **Prior**: 5% (or 1:19 odds).
*   **Step 1: Update for Intent and Precedent.** The AI EO and IaaS rule show this is a live and serious policy option. This evidence counters the "government is too slow" prior. Let's say this increases the odds by a factor of 4, moving the probability from 5% to roughly 18%. (New odds: 4:19).
*   **Step 2: Update for Timeline and Lack of NPRM.** This is the crucial update. The only remaining path is an emergency IFR. While the IaaS rule provides a precedent for using an IFR, that rule was a direct implementation of a specific clause in the AI EO. A new rule for domestic GPU purchasers would be a significant expansion, making an IFR justification harder. The lack of any public signals makes this path highly unlikely. This evidence should reduce the odds by at least a factor of 10.
*   **Posterior Calculation**: (Prior Odds: 1:19) * (LR for Intent: ~4) * (LR for Timeline: ~1/10) = ~4:190 odds, or ~1:47.5.
*   **Posterior Probability**: 1 / (1 + 47.5) ≈ 2%.

My calculation points to a very low number.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **My forecast might be too low.** The primary reason my forecast could be wrong is underestimating the administration's willingness to use an emergency IFR. A significant AI-related security incident in the next two months could provide the "good cause" needed to ram a pre-drafted rule through. The Manifold market is at 18.1%, suggesting the community places a much higher weight on this non-standard pathway than I do. They may believe the national security imperative will override all procedural norms.
*   **Why the market might be right**: Perhaps a rule is already drafted and has been secretly circulated, and the administration is simply waiting for a politically opportune moment (or a crisis) to release it as an IFR. In this scenario, the lack of public signals is not evidence of inaction, but of a deliberate strategy.
*   **Rebuttal**: While possible, this "secret rule" scenario is speculative. The most concrete piece of evidence is the clock. With each passing day, the window for action closes. An 18% chance implies this is a reasonably likely outcome, whereas it feels more like a tail risk.
*   **Adjustment**: My calculated 2% feels too dismissive of the IFR path, given the precedent. The Manifold forecast of 18% feels too optimistic, ignoring the procedural and political barriers. I will adjust my forecast upward from my calculation to account for this tail risk, but will remain significantly below the market. A probability of 8% seems appropriate, reflecting a roughly 1-in-12 chance of an emergency action succeeding in the next two months.

### 6. Final Forecast
The forecast combines a very low base rate due to the extreme time constraint with conflicting evidence. The strong policy momentum and precedent for fast action via IFRs (positive indicators) are almost entirely negated by the lack of any public proposal so close to the deadline (a powerful negative indicator). The final probability rests on the small but non-zero chance that the administration uses an emergency procedure to implement such a rule in the final weeks of 2025.

Final: 8%
