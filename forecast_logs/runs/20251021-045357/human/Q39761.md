### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Wartime States of Emergency:** Countries engaged in active, existential, conventional warfare on their own territory almost universally maintain states of emergency or martial law. The base rate for a country lifting such measures *while the invasion and active combat persist* is extremely low, likely <5%. This is because martial law provides the necessary legal framework for mobilization, resource allocation, and restricting certain rights for national security.
2.  **Ukraine's Own Precedent (2022-2025):** Since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine has had 16 opportunities to extend martial law. It has done so every single time. This creates a specific, highly relevant reference class where the base rate of extension, given the continuation of the war, is 100% (16 out of 16).
3.  **Post-Cold War Conflicts:** In major conflicts like the Yugoslav Wars or the Chechen Wars, emergency powers were maintained by the defending state until a ceasefire, peace agreement, or a decisive military conclusion was reached. Lifting them prematurely is rare. This suggests a base rate of extension >90% as long as high-intensity conflict continues.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-02-25** World Bank et al. release a new needs assessment. — ↑ — The staggering $524B reconstruction cost and a $9.96B funding gap for 2025 underscore the country's total focus on the war effort, making normal governance impossible.
*   **2025-02-26** Poll shows public divided on Zelenskyy's post-war future. — Neutral — While indicative of political friction under the surface, this concerns a *post-war* scenario and does not imply opposition to the current necessity of martial law.
*   **2025-05-29** Wilson Center assesses Zelenskyy's presidency. — ↑ — The analysis confirms his term continues *because* of martial law, legally linking the two. This reinforces the status quo until elections are possible.
*   **2025-10-20** Zelenskyy rejects territorial concessions after meeting with Trump. — ↑ — This is the most recent and significant data point. It signals a commitment to continued fighting, which is the primary justification for martial law.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **State of the War (Large):** This is the primary driver. As long as Russia occupies Ukrainian territory and active, large-scale combat operations continue, the *casus belli* for martial law remains firmly in place. The JHU analysis of a "war of attrition" confirms this state.
2.  **Constitutional and Legal Framework (Large):** The Ukrainian Constitution explicitly prohibits holding national elections under martial law. Lifting it before the war ends would trigger a constitutional crisis over holding elections in an insecure environment with millions of displaced voters and occupied territories. This creates a powerful incentive to maintain the status quo.
3.  **Parliamentary Procedure and Political Will (Moderate):** The Verkhovna Rada has routinely and overwhelmingly approved all 16 prior extensions. There is no evidence of a political bloc emerging that would oppose an extension while the war rages. The process is now a well-oiled, predictable legislative action.
4.  **Military Mobilization and Command (Moderate):** Martial law is the legal foundation for ongoing military mobilization, curfews, and the streamlined military command structure. Ending it would severely disrupt the war effort.
5.  **Prospects for a Ceasefire/Peace (Moderate):** A sudden, credible peace process or ceasefire agreement is the only plausible mechanism that could lead to martial law not being extended. Current indicators, especially Zelenskyy's recent statements, point away from this.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unbroken Precedent:** Unlike a generic country at war, Ukraine has a perfect and recent track record of 16 consecutive 90-day extensions, making the next one a continuation of a deeply ingrained routine.
*   **Constitutional Lock-in:** The specific constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law creates a stronger-than-usual link between the state of war and the legal status, as lifting it would force an immediate and intractable political question.
*   **Scale of Conflict:** This is not a low-intensity conflict or a limited border war. It is a full-scale war of attrition against a nuclear power, demanding total societal mobilization that only martial law can legally sustain.
*   **High International Scrutiny:** While wartime measures are standard, Ukraine's democratic aspirations and reliance on Western aid place its governance under a microscope. However, allies have accepted martial law as a necessary evil, removing a key source of potential pressure to lift it.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very high prior (e.g., ~98%) based on the reference class of nations in active, existential wars and Ukraine's own 16/16 record of extensions. The strength of this prior is high (equivalent n > 20).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The conflict remains a high-intensity war of attrition with no resolution in sight.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** President Zelenskyy's recent public rejection of concessions reinforces a "fight on" posture.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The legislative process for extension is routine and faces no significant political opposition.
    *   **↓ (Negligible):** The absence of any credible, imminent peace negotiations or ceasefire agreements.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence is entirely consistent with and reinforces the extremely strong prior. The posterior should move fractionally higher, very close to 100%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Formal submission of the martial law extension bill to the Verkhovna Rada (expected any day).
    *   Public statements by the President's office or military command on the necessity of continuing the measures.
    *   Reports of intensified fighting on the front lines.
    *   Any breakdown or failure of diplomatic back-channels.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A surprise joint announcement of a ceasefire by Ukraine and Russia.
    *   A sudden, public statement by a major ally (e.g., the US) calling for a transition away from martial law (highly unlikely).
    *   An unexpected vote against the extension in the Rada (a black swan event).
    *   A sudden, total collapse of the Russian front line, leading to a swift Ukrainian victory.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast assumes no sudden, paradigm-shifting events in the next ~15 days, such as a coup, a leader's incapacitation, or a sudden military collapse on either side.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Public information may not reflect secret negotiations. A peace deal could be announced with very little warning, though this is improbable.
*   **Procedural Delay:** While unlikely to change the outcome, a procedural snag in the Verkhovna Rada could theoretically delay the vote past the deadline, though this would likely be rectified quickly.
*   **Definitional Change:** Ukraine could theoretically replace "martial law" with a different legal framework (e.g., a "state of anti-terrorist operation") that serves the same purpose. This is a semantic risk but unlikely to alter the substantive reality.

**Final Research Summary:** The continuation of the full-scale war, combined with an unbroken 16-time precedent and a constitutional ban on elections during martial law, makes another extension almost certain. Recent statements from leadership have only hardened this expectation.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for extending martial law in a country engaged in active, existential warfare is extremely high. Ukraine has extended martial law 16 times since the Russian invasion began, making the base rate for extension 100% in this specific context. Additionally, historical precedents from other conflicts suggest a base rate of over 90% for maintaining emergency powers during active conflict. Therefore, I will use a base rate of 98% for this forecast.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Ukraine is still engaged in a high-intensity conflict with Russia, and martial law has been consistently extended every 90 days since the invasion began. The constitutional framework prohibits elections during martial law, reinforcing the need for its continuation.
   - Differences: There are no significant differences that would suggest a deviation from the established pattern of extending martial law. The political and military situation remains consistent with past extensions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **World Bank Needs Assessment (↑):** The high reconstruction costs and funding gaps emphasize the ongoing war effort, making it unlikely for martial law to be lifted. Likelihood ratio >1.
   - **Zelenskyy's Rejection of Concessions (↑):** Signals a commitment to continue fighting, reinforcing the need for martial law. Likelihood ratio >1.
   - **Routine Legislative Process (↑):** The Verkhovna Rada has consistently approved extensions, indicating no political opposition. Likelihood ratio >1.
   - **Absence of Peace Negotiations (↓):** No credible peace process is underway, making lifting martial law unlikely. Likelihood ratio <1 but negligible impact.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 98% / (100% - 98%) = 49
   - Given the evidence, the likelihood ratios are all >1, reinforcing the prior. The posterior odds remain very high.
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds) ≈ 99.5%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from assuming no black swan events. However, the evidence strongly supports the continuation of martial law.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden peace agreement could change the situation, but current indicators do not support this.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence and lack of credible counter-evidence, the forecast remains robust.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The probability of Ukraine extending martial law beyond November 5, 2025, is extremely high, given the ongoing conflict, historical precedent, and recent evidence.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Ukraine's own history of martial law extensions since the 2022 Russian invasion as the most relevant base rate.

- Ukraine has extended martial law 16 times out of 16 opportunities since February 2022
- This gives us a base rate of 100% for extensions during the ongoing war
- Converting to odds: 16:0, which mathematically approaches infinity but practically can be treated as extremely high odds (e.g., 100:1)

This base rate is particularly strong because:
- It's from the exact same country and conflict
- It covers a substantial time period (3+ years)
- It shows perfect consistency (16/16 extensions)
- The extensions have occurred under the same leadership and constitutional framework

**Prior probability: 99%** (representing extremely high but not absolute certainty)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental cause of martial law (Russian invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory) remains unchanged
- The same constitutional framework prohibiting elections during martial law is in place
- The same president (Zelenskyy) and largely the same parliament are in power
- The war continues as a high-intensity conflict with no imminent resolution

**Differences from base case:**
- The war has now lasted over 3.5 years, potentially creating "martial law fatigue"
- The approaching November 2025 deadline is further from the initial invasion than previous extensions
- International pressure for democratic processes might have increased over time

However, these differences appear minimal compared to the overwhelming similarity to the base case - the war continues with no resolution in sight, which has been the consistent driver of all previous extensions.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Zelenskyy's October 20, 2025 rejection of territorial concessions**
- P(E|H): Very high (~95%) - If martial law will be extended, we'd expect the president to maintain a firm stance on continuing the fight
- P(E|~H): Very low (~5%) - If martial law were to end, we'd expect signals of de-escalation or peace negotiations
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of extension
- This recent statement strongly indicates continued commitment to the war effort, which is the primary justification for martial law

**Evidence 2: Constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law**
- P(E|H): ~100% - This legal reality exists and would continue if martial law extends
- P(E|~H): ~100% - This legal reality would still exist even if martial law were not extended
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1 (neutral)
- While neutral as evidence, this creates a powerful structural incentive to maintain martial law, as lifting it would force immediate elections in wartime conditions

**Evidence 3: Ongoing war of attrition with no peace process**
- P(E|H): Very high (~95%) - Continued active warfare strongly supports continued martial law
- P(E|~H): Very low (~5%) - Ending martial law while active warfare continues would be highly unusual
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of extension
- The JHU analysis confirms the war remains a grinding conflict with no resolution in sight

**Evidence 4: $524B reconstruction needs assessment from February 2025**
- P(E|H): High (~80%) - Such massive damage is consistent with continuing emergency measures
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~30%) - The scale of damage could theoretically motivate a return to normal governance to better manage reconstruction
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7:1 in favor of extension
- The scale of destruction reinforces the extraordinary nature of the situation requiring extraordinary legal measures

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 99:1 (from 99% probability)

First update using Zelenskyy's recent rejection of concessions (LR = 19:1):
- Posterior odds = 99:1 × 19:1 = 1881:1
- Posterior probability = 1881/(1881+1) ≈ 99.95%

Second update using the ongoing war of attrition evidence (LR = 19:1):
- Posterior odds = 1881:1 × 19:1 = 35,739:1
- Posterior probability = 35,739/(35,739+1) ≈ 99.997%

Third update using reconstruction needs assessment (LR = 2.7:1):
- Posterior odds = 35,739:1 × 2.7:1 = 96,495:1
- Posterior probability = 96,495/(96,495+1) ≈ 99.999%

This mathematical result approaches certainty, but I should be cautious about overconfidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Secret peace negotiations: There could be back-channel talks not visible to the public
- Political calculations: Zelenskyy might see political advantage in ending martial law to hold elections
- International pressure: Western allies might privately be pushing for a return to electoral democracy
- Constitutional workarounds: Ukraine could theoretically create a different legal framework that serves similar functions but isn't called "martial law"

**Alternative scenario:**
The strongest alternative case would be a sudden breakthrough in peace negotiations, perhaps brokered by a third party, leading to a ceasefire agreement before November 5. This would remove the primary justification for martial law. However:
- No credible evidence suggests such negotiations are advanced
- Zelenskyy's October 20 statement explicitly rejected territorial concessions
- The logistical challenges of organizing elections immediately after lifting martial law would be enormous

**Adjustment for uncertainty:**
While the mathematical Bayesian update approaches 100%, I should acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in any prediction about geopolitical events. Black swan events are always possible, and the complex nature of war means unexpected developments can occur.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my final forecast slightly downward from the mathematical result to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 98%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own actions since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Martial law has been subject to renewal 16 times. On all 16 of those occasions, it has been extended. This creates a specific, empirical base rate of 16/16, or 100%.

A broader reference class would be "nations engaged in active, existential, conventional warfare on their own territory." In such cases, the government almost universally maintains a state of emergency or martial law to facilitate mobilization and national security. The base rate for lifting such measures while the conflict is ongoing is extremely low, likely less than 5%.

Combining these, the prior probability of Ukraine extending martial law, given the war continues, is extremely high. I will set a conservative starting prior of **98%**, which corresponds to prior odds of 49:1 in favor of extension. This high prior reflects the near-automatic nature of this decision under current circumstances.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is nearly identical to the 16 previous instances where martial law was extended. The core conditions remain unchanged:
- **Similarities:** Russia continues to occupy significant Ukrainian territory. Active, high-intensity combat operations are ongoing. There is no ceasefire or peace agreement in place. The Ukrainian constitution still prohibits elections under martial law, creating a strong incentive to maintain it to avoid a constitutional crisis.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the cumulative duration of the war, which could increase war fatigue. However, there is no evidence this fatigue has translated into political opposition to the necessity of martial law for the war effort. The situation today is not materially different from the situation 90 days ago when the last extension was approved.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis "Ukraine will extend martial law" and ~H be "Ukraine will not extend martial law."

*   **Evidence 1: The war continues as a "war of attrition" with no resolution in sight.**
    *   P(E | H): Very high (≈1). The continuation of the war is the primary justification for extending martial law.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very low. It is almost inconceivable that the government would choose to lift martial law while the war is still raging at this intensity. Doing so would cripple the military's ability to mobilize and operate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large, strongly supporting H. This evidence confirms the conditions for the base rate are still met.

*   **Evidence 2: President Zelenskyy's rejection of territorial concessions on October 20, 2025.**
    *   P(E | H): High. This public posture signals a commitment to continued fighting, which requires the legal framework of martial law.
    *   P(E | ~H): Low. A government preparing to end the war and lift martial law would be unlikely to make such a strong statement rejecting a diplomatic path just two weeks before the deadline.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Large, supporting H. This is the most recent and significant piece of evidence, and it points directly towards a continuation of the status quo.

*   **Evidence 3: The legislative process for extension is routine and faces no significant political opposition.**
    *   P(E | H): High. We expect this well-established, routine process to continue as before.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very low. For the extension to fail, a significant political bloc would have to suddenly emerge and vote against it, which is an event with no precedent or current indicators.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Large, supporting H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 98% (49:1 odds), I will update with the most recent piece of evidence: Zelenskyy's statement. This evidence makes the extension significantly more likely than not extending. Let's assign a conservative Likelihood Ratio of 5 (i.e., this statement is 5 times more likely if they plan to extend martial law than if they don't).

*   **Prior Odds:** 49:1
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** 5:1
*   **Posterior Odds:** 49 × 5 = 245:1
*   **Posterior Probability:** 245 / (245 + 1) = 99.59%

The evidence, which is entirely one-sided, pushes the already very high prior even closer to 100%. The result is a near-certainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if a "black swan" event occurs within the next 15 days.
*   **Alternative Scenario 1: A sudden, secret peace deal is announced.** This is the most plausible path to a "No" resolution. However, Zelenskyy's recent public statement makes this extremely unlikely. The logistics of implementing a ceasefire and demobilization would also likely require martial law to be extended for a transitional period anyway.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: A sudden military collapse of either side.** A complete Russian collapse might lead to a swift victory, but even then, martial law would likely be maintained to manage the transition. A Ukrainian collapse would make the question moot. The probability of such a decisive event in the next two weeks is minuscule.
*   **Alternative Scenario 3: A procedural failure in the Verkhovna Rada.** A political crisis or physical disruption could prevent the vote from happening before the November 5 deadline. This is a tail risk but is highly improbable given the unity on this specific issue.

These alternative scenarios are all extremely low-probability. A 1% chance of such a major, unforeseen event occurring in the next two weeks seems like a reasonable and perhaps even generous allocation of uncertainty.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate, established by 16 consecutive prior extensions, is nearly 100%. The current evidence, particularly the ongoing state of the war and recent leadership statements, strongly reinforces this base rate. The causal mechanisms—the legal necessity of martial law for the war effort and the constitutional lock-in regarding elections—are powerful and unchanged. The only paths to failure involve highly improbable "black swan" events. The updated probability is therefore extremely high.

Final: 99%
