### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Review of Major Executive Actions on Statutory Grounds:** This class includes cases where the President takes significant action of major economic or political importance, claiming authority from a broad congressional statute. In recent years, the Court has been skeptical of such claims. Examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), where the Court struck down executive actions using the "major questions doctrine."
    *   **Base Rate:** The Court strikes down or significantly curtails the executive action in roughly **60-70%** of these high-profile cases. This is derived from observing the trend of the current Court in reining in perceived executive overreach based on statutory interpretation.
2.  **Supreme Court Review Following Unanimous Lower Appellate Court Rulings:** This class includes cases where the Supreme Court reviews a decision on which multiple lower courts (or a key appellate court) have agreed on the outcome, even if for different reasons. While the Supreme Court often takes cases to reverse them, unanimity below creates a strong presumption.
    *   **Base Rate:** The Supreme Court affirms the lower court's judgment in approximately **60-65%** of such cases. The unanimity across different courts (*V.O.S.* and *Learning Resources*) strengthens the case against the tariffs.
3.  **Supreme Court Cases Involving Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** This class involves the Court assessing presidential actions taken under the justification of national security or foreign policy. Historically, the Court has shown significant deference to the executive in this domain (*Trump v. Hawaii*).
    *   **Base Rate:** The Court upholds the President's action in roughly **70-80%** of these cases. The government's entire argument rests on framing this as a national security issue where the President deserves maximum deference.

*Limitations:* The primary tension is between reference classes 1/2 and 3. The case sits at the intersection of statutory interpretation (where the Court is aggressive) and foreign affairs (where it is deferential). The unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariffs makes this a unique case with no perfect historical analogue.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms tariffs are unlawful (7-4 vote). **↓** (for Tariffs lawful) — A key appellate court, in a thorough decision, found the tariffs exceeded presidential authority, creating a strong legal headwind for the government's appeal.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari before judgment in one case and consolidates both on an expedited schedule. **↓** (for No 2025 ruling) — This action signals the Court's view of the issue's urgency and makes a decision before the end of 2025 highly probable.
*   **2025-10-20** Media reports frame the core legal question as "Are tariffs taxes?" **↓** (for Tariffs lawful) — This framing highlights the challengers' strongest argument: the Constitution explicitly grants the power to lay duties/taxes to Congress, not the President.
*   **2025-10-21** Amicus briefs from a wide range of business groups are filed, opposing the tariffs. **↓** (for Tariffs lawful) — Broad-based opposition from the business community signals significant economic disruption and may subtly influence the Court's view of the stakes.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (Large, ↓ Lawful):** The 6-3 conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming vast, transformative power without exceptionally clear authorization from Congress. The power to impose trillions in tariffs is arguably a "major question" that IEEPA does not explicitly grant.
2.  **Separation of Powers (Taxing Power) (Large, ↓ Lawful):** The challengers' argument that tariffs are taxes, and that the Constitution's Origination Clause gives Congress exclusive power to raise revenue, is constitutionally powerful and may appeal to originalist/textualist justices.
3.  **Textual Interpretation of IEEPA (Moderate, ↓ Lawful):** The Court will focus on whether the power to "regulate" transactions includes the power to impose tariffs (a form of tax). A textualist reading is likely to find that if Congress had meant to delegate its core tariff power, it would have used more specific language.
4.  **Deference to Executive on National Security (Moderate, ↑ Lawful):** The government's primary argument. The Court traditionally gives the President wide latitude in identifying and responding to foreign threats. If the Court accepts the premise that trade deficits and drug trafficking are national emergencies, it may defer to the President's chosen remedy.
5.  **Availability of a "Narrow" Ruling (Moderate, ↑ Mixed):** The Court has two distinct types of tariffs to evaluate (trafficking vs. reciprocal) and two different lower court rationales. This allows for a split decision, e.g., striking down the broad "reciprocal" tariffs while upholding the more targeted "trafficking" tariffs as more plausibly related to a national security threat.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** Unlike prior uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions, this is the first time it has been used to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire U.S. economy. This novelty weakens arguments based on historical precedent and strengthens the "major questions" challenge.
*   **Direct Conflict with a Core Congressional Power:** This is not just about regulatory authority; it directly implicates what is arguably Congress's most fundamental power: the power of the purse. This makes it a more significant separation-of-powers case than a typical administrative law dispute.
*   **Unanimity of Lower Court Outcomes:** Both the specialized Court of International Trade and a D.C. District Court, as well as the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, found the tariffs unlawful. This cross-court consensus against the government's position is a powerful signal.
*   **Expedited Supreme Court Schedule:** The decision to hear the case on an emergency basis underscores its national importance and makes a non-decision or punt ("Other ruling," "No 2025 ruling") extremely unlikely. The Court intends to provide a definitive answer, quickly.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the reference class of major executive actions being struck down. A plausible prior could be: P(Unlawful) = 60%, P(Mixed) = 20%, P(Lawful) = 15%, P(Other/No) = 5%. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs: **↓** Lawful (Large)
    *   Applicability of the Court's Major Questions Doctrine: **↓** Lawful (Large)
    *   Strength of the "tariffs are taxes" constitutional argument: **↓** Lawful (Large)
    *   Availability of a narrow path to invalidate only some tariffs: **↑** Mixed (Moderate)
    *   Expedited schedule making a non-ruling highly improbable: **↓** No 2025 ruling (Large)
    *   Government's reliance on national security deference: **↑** Lawful (Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces and amplifies the prior against the tariffs' lawfulness. The posterior probability for **Unlawful** should increase significantly, drawing probability mostly from **Lawful**. The probability of a **Mixed** ruling remains a key alternative, while **No 2025 ruling** becomes negligible.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting Tariffs Lawful or Mixed):**
    *   Questions during the November oral arguments from Justices Roberts, Kavanaugh, or Barrett focusing on the President's unique role in foreign affairs and national security.
    *   Government lawyers successfully framing the tariffs as a tool of foreign policy, not domestic taxation.
    *   Prominent national security officials filing amicus briefs in support of the government's position.
    *   Questions from the bench distinguishing between the "trafficking" and "reciprocal" tariffs, suggesting an appetite for a mixed ruling.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting Tariffs Unlawful):**
    *   Questions during oral arguments focusing on the textual meaning of "regulate" in IEEPA.
    *   Justices pressing the Solicitor General on the lack of a limiting principle for the President's claimed power.
    *   Repeated questions about Congress's constitutional power to lay duties and imposts.
    *   Skepticism from the

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Base rate of 20%. This is derived from the historical deference the Supreme Court has shown to presidential powers in foreign affairs and national security (70-80% in such cases), tempered by the skepticism shown in recent cases involving major executive actions (30-40%).
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Base rate of 50%. This reflects the trend of the Supreme Court striking down major executive actions on statutory grounds (60-70%) and the unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs (60-65%).

- **Mixed ruling**: Base rate of 20%. This accounts for the possibility of the Court issuing a split decision, given the distinct types of tariffs and rationales involved.

- **Other ruling**: Base rate of 5%. This covers the possibility of procedural outcomes like dismissal or remand without a merits decision, which is less likely given the expedited schedule.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Base rate of 5%. The expedited schedule and consolidation of cases make it unlikely that the Court will not issue a ruling by the end of 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves major executive action and statutory interpretation, similar to recent cases where the Court has been skeptical of executive overreach.

- **Differences**: The unprecedented scope of IEEPA use for broad tariffs and the direct conflict with Congress's power to impose taxes make this case unique. The unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs also strengthen the case for an unlawful ruling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unanimous lower court rulings**: Strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful. Likelihood of this evidence if tariffs are unlawful is high; low if tariffs are lawful.

- **Major Questions Doctrine**: Likely to be applied, reducing the probability of tariffs being lawful.

- **Constitutional argument (tariffs as taxes)**: Strong argument against the tariffs being lawful.

- **National security deference**: Increases the probability of tariffs being lawful but is less compelling given the broad scope of the tariffs.

- **Expedited schedule**: Decreases the probability of no ruling in 2025.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds = 50/50. Strong evidence from lower court rulings and major questions doctrine increases the odds significantly. Posterior probability increases to around 65%.

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds = 20/80. Evidence against lawfulness reduces the odds. Posterior probability decreases to around 10%.

- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds = 20/80. The possibility of a narrow ruling keeps this probability stable at around 20%.

- **Other ruling**: Prior odds = 5/95. Unlikely given the expedited schedule. Posterior probability remains around 5%.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds = 5/95. Unlikely given the expedited schedule. Posterior probability decreases to around 0%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of the Court being more deferential to the President due to national security arguments, which could increase the probability of a mixed ruling.

- Re-evaluate the strength of the constitutional argument and its appeal to the justices.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 65%  
Mixed ruling: 20%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 0%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant reference classes:

**For "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Supreme Court review of major executive actions claiming broad statutory authority: The Court has increasingly limited executive power in cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022) using the "major questions doctrine" - approximately 65% of such cases result in limiting executive power.
- Cases with unanimous lower court rulings against the government: When multiple lower courts agree on an outcome (as here with the Court of International Trade, DC District Court, and Federal Circuit), the Supreme Court affirms roughly 60-65% of the time.
- Prior: 60%

**For "Tariffs lawful":**
- Cases involving presidential power in foreign affairs/national security: Historically, the Court has shown deference to the executive in this domain (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*) - approximately 70-80% of such cases uphold presidential action.
- However, this is counterbalanced by the Court's recent skepticism of broad agency authority.
- Prior: 15%

**For "Mixed ruling":**
- Cases with multiple distinct issues that allow for splitting the difference: When the Court can find a middle path that partially satisfies both sides, it often takes it - approximately 20% of complex cases.
- Prior: 20%

**For "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling":**
- Given the expedited schedule and the Court's explicit decision to hear the case quickly, these outcomes are unlikely.
- Prior: 5% combined (3% Other, 2% No 2025 ruling)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This involves a classic tension between executive power and congressional authority
- The case presents statutory interpretation questions about the scope of delegated authority
- The Court has granted certiorari on an expedited basis, signaling its view of the case's importance

**Key differences:**
- The unprecedented scope of using IEEPA for broad-based tariffs rather than targeted sanctions
- Direct conflict with Congress's core constitutional power to lay duties and taxes
- Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs (both the Court of International Trade and DC District Court)
- The case sits at an unusual intersection of tax policy, trade policy, and national security

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Multiple lower courts ruled against the tariffs on different grounds (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- The Federal Circuit affirmed with a 7-4 majority that the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- The "major questions doctrine" suggests Congress would speak clearly if delegating such significant tariff power (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)
- Constitutional arguments that tariffs are taxes, which are Congress's exclusive domain (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- IEEPA explicitly grants the President power to regulate foreign commerce during emergencies (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)
- Courts traditionally defer to the executive on national security matters (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)
- The President declared formal national emergencies before imposing tariffs (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- The case involves two distinct types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) with different justifications (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)
- The Court could find the trafficking tariffs more plausibly related to national security than the reciprocal tariffs (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- Two different lower court rationales provide options for partial affirmance (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)

**Evidence against "No 2025 ruling" or "Other ruling":**
- The Court granted certiorari on an expedited schedule with argument in November 2025 (P(E|H) very low, P(E|~H) high)
- All parties agree on the urgency of resolving the issue (P(E|H) very low, P(E|~H) high)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the key evidence of unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs:

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 60%
- Prior odds: 60/40 = 1.5
- Likelihood ratio: ~3 (unanimous lower court rulings are about 3x more likely if the tariffs are truly unlawful)
- Posterior odds: 1.5 × 3 = 4.5
- Posterior probability: 4.5/(1+4.5) ≈ 82%

However, we need to adjust for the national security deference factor:
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7 (the national security framing somewhat reduces the likelihood of ruling against the President)
- Updated posterior odds: 4.5 × 0.7 = 3.15
- Updated posterior probability: 3.15/(1+3.15) ≈ 76%

For "Mixed ruling":
- The availability of a split decision between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs increases this probability from 20% to approximately 22%

For "Tariffs lawful":
- The strong textual and constitutional arguments against the tariffs decrease this probability from 15% to approximately 2%

For "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling":
- The expedited schedule and clear path to resolution decrease these probabilities to approximately 0% for "No 2025 ruling" and about 0% for "Other ruling"

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to the executive on national security matters
- The conservative majority might be more sympathetic to presidential power when exercised by a Republican president
- The Court could find a narrow textual basis in IEEPA to uphold some tariffs
- I might be overestimating the impact of the "major questions doctrine" in this context

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would give more weight to a mixed ruling (35-40%) and less to "Tariffs unlawful" (55-60%). This would recognize that the Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases and might distinguish between different types of tariffs.

**Adjustments:**
- I'll reduce "Tariffs unlawful" slightly to account for the possibility that the Court finds some statutory basis for at least some tariffs
- I'll increase "Mixed ruling" to reflect the Court's tendency to find middle ground in complex cases
- I'll maintain a small probability for "Tariffs lawful" to account for unexpected deference to executive authority

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots:

Tariffs unlawful: 70%
Mixed ruling: 28%
Tariffs lawful: 2%
Other ruling: 0%
No 2025 ruling: 0%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 70%
Mixed ruling: 28%
Tariffs lawful: 2%
Other ruling: 0%
No 2025 ruling: 0%
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

1.  **Major Executive Actions on Statutory Grounds:** This class involves the President using broad statutory authority for actions with major economic or political impact. The current Supreme Court has shown significant skepticism towards such actions, often invoking the "major questions doctrine." Recent examples like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) suggest a high probability of the Court striking down or limiting the executive action. This points to a base rate of **~65% for an "unlawful" or "mixed" outcome.**
2.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*). The government's entire case rests on framing the tariffs as a necessary response to a national emergency. This class suggests a high probability of the action being upheld, perhaps **~75% for a "lawful" outcome.**
3.  **Review of Unanimous Lower Court Rulings:** The Supreme Court affirms lower court judgments in a majority of cases, and this tendency is stronger when multiple lower courts have reached the same conclusion on the outcome. Here, the Court of International Trade, a D.C. District Court, and the Federal Circuit all found the tariffs unlawful. This suggests a base rate of **~60-65% for affirming the lower courts' judgment of "unlawful."**

**Reconciling Priors:** The case creates a direct conflict between the Court's skepticism of domestic executive overreach (Class 1 & 3) and its deference on national security (Class 2). However, the action in question—imposing tariffs—intrudes directly on Congress's core constitutional power to tax and regulate commerce. This makes the separation-of-powers concerns paramount, suggesting that Classes 1 and 3 are more predictive here than Class 2.

Therefore, I will set a prior that favors the challengers:
*   P(Tariffs unlawful): 55%
*   P(Mixed ruling): 15%
*   P(Tariffs lawful): 25%
*   P(Other ruling): 2.5%
*   P(No 2025 ruling): 2.5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case is unusual in several ways that strengthen the argument against the tariffs' lawfulness:

*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** Using IEEPA for broad, economy-wide tariffs is a novel application of the statute, which has historically been used for targeted sanctions. This novelty weakens the government's reliance on precedent and strengthens the "major questions" argument that Congress did not intend such a sweeping delegation of power.
*   **Direct Conflict with Taxing Power:** The challengers' argument that "tariffs are taxes" is constitutionally potent. The Constitution explicitly grants the power to "lay and collect... Duties" to Congress. This is a more direct challenge to legislative authority than in typical administrative law cases, making judicial intervention more likely.
*   **Consensus of Lower Courts:** The unanimity in outcome across three different courts (CIT, DDC, and the Federal Circuit) creates a strong presumption that the government's legal position is weak.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their impact on the probabilities.

*   **Evidence 1: The Major Questions Doctrine.** This doctrine, favored by the Court's conservative majority, holds that an executive agency cannot claim transformative power over a major aspect of the U.S. economy without exceptionally clear authorization from Congress.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* The likelihood of this doctrine being a central, dispositive factor is very high if "Tariffs unlawful" is the true state of the world (P(E|H)) and low if "Tariffs lawful" is true (P(E|~H)). This evidence strongly pushes probability away from "Lawful" and towards "Unlawful" and "Mixed."

*   **Evidence 2: Expedited Supreme Court Schedule.** The Court consolidated the cases and scheduled arguments for November 2025.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* This action makes a non-ruling in 2025 extremely unlikely. The probability of this evidence, given "No 2025 ruling," is near zero. This evidence collapses the probability of the "No 2025 ruling" option.

*   **Evidence 3: Availability of a "Narrow" Ruling.** The Court is reviewing two distinct sets of tariffs (trafficking-related and reciprocal-trade-related). This allows for a split decision.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* This feature of the case makes a "Mixed ruling" a very plausible outcome. A court seeking to avoid a sweeping judgment can strike down the broader "reciprocal" tariffs while upholding the more targeted "trafficking" tariffs as more closely related to national security. This increases the probability of "Mixed ruling" relative to the all-or-nothing options.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the prior based on the evidence.

*   **Initial Prior Odds (Unlawful vs. Lawful):** 55% / 25% = 2.2 to 1.
*   **Key Evidence:** The combination of the major questions doctrine's applicability, the powerful "tariffs are taxes" constitutional argument, and the unanimous lower court rulings. The combined likelihood ratio of this evidence strongly favors "Unlawful" over "Lawful," perhaps by a factor of 4:1 or more.
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 2.2 * 4 = 8.8 to 1.
    *   This implies the posterior probability of "Unlawful" should be roughly 8-9 times higher than "Lawful."
*   **Updating the Full Distribution:**
    1.  The probability for **"No 2025 ruling"** drops to near zero (~1%) due to the expedited schedule.
    2.  The probability for **"Other ruling"** also decreases as the Court seems intent on a merits decision (~2%).
    3.  The probability for **"Tariffs lawful"** decreases significantly, from 25% down to ~9%, reflecting the powerful statutory and constitutional arguments against it.
    4.  The remaining probability is distributed between **"Tariffs unlawful"** and **"Mixed ruling."** The strength of the arguments against the tariffs makes "Unlawful" the most likely single outcome. However, the availability of a compromise path for a centrist-minded Court makes "Mixed ruling" a very strong contender. I will increase its probability substantially.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily weighted against the tariffs being lawful. The strongest counterargument is the history of extreme judicial deference to the President on national security. A majority could decide that the President's declaration of an emergency is unreviewable and that IEEPA's broad language permits any economic response he deems necessary. The 7-4 split in the Federal Circuit (with two Democratic-appointed judges dissenting) shows the government's argument has some traction.

However, the current Court has prioritized reining in the administrative state and enforcing separation of powers above almost all else. This case presents a perfect opportunity to do so on an issue of immense economic importance that directly implicates Congress's core powers. The "Mixed ruling" option provides a perfect off-ramp, allowing the Court to curb the most extreme assertion of power (reciprocal tariffs) while still showing some deference on the more traditional national security issue (trafficking tariffs). I believe my updated forecast, which gives a significant 28% to this compromise outcome, adequately accounts for this possibility.

### 6. Final Normalization

After updating and red-teaming, I arrive at the following normalized probabilities:

*   **Tariffs unlawful:** The most likely outcome, as the tariffs face severe headwinds from both statutory interpretation (major questions doctrine) and constitutional principles (separation of powers).
*   **Mixed ruling:** A very plausible alternative, allowing the Court to strike a compromise by invalidating the broader tariffs while upholding the narrower ones.
*   **Tariffs lawful:** An unlikely outcome, but possible if the Court prioritizes national security deference above all else.
*   **Other/No ruling:** Extremely unlikely given the case's urgency and the expedited schedule.

The final probabilities sum to 100%.

### Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 9%
Tariffs unlawful: 60%
Mixed ruling: 28%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
