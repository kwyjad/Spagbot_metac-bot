### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections:** The standard process is for a regional group to endorse a single candidate. Publicly contested bids are uncommon but not unprecedented. For COP29, the Eastern European Group was deadlocked between Armenia and Azerbaijan until a last-minute deal saw Armenia withdraw its bid. In such cases, one candidate typically withdraws following diplomatic negotiations.
    *   *Base Rate:* A contested bid resolves in favor of one of the primary bidders (~85-90%). A deadlock forces a default to the backup location (~10-15%). This is an estimate based on the high premium placed on avoiding procedural failure in UN processes.
2.  **WEOG Hosting Precedents:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is diverse, comprising traditional Western European nations, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey. Past WEOG hosts have typically been major European economies (e.g., France, UK, Spain, Denmark).
    *   *Base Rate:* A major, high-income OECD nation with strong diplomatic ties within the bloc is the typical host (~90%). Turkey, as an OECD member but with a different geopolitical posture, represents a less common profile for a WEOG host. Australia fits the typical profile but is geographically distant.
3.  **Default to UNFCCC Headquarters:** The provision to host at the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany, exists specifically to prevent a procedural collapse if a regional group cannot achieve consensus. This is a rare outcome, as it is seen as a failure of diplomacy for the entire regional group.
    *   *Base Rate:* The probability of a default to Bonn in any given year is very low (<1%), but it becomes a significant possibility *conditional* on a known, protracted, and unresolved deadlock close to the decision deadline.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-26** Australia's PM is actively promoting the bid, framing it as the nation's largest-ever diplomatic summit. — ↑ Australia — Demonstrates sustained, high-level political investment, increasing the diplomatic cost of failure for Australia.
*   **2024-11-26** Reports confirm the Australia-Pacific bid is in "limbo" due to Turkey's persistent rival bid, creating a standoff. — ↓ Australia / ↑ Turkey & Germany — This is the central problem; the deadlock is not a new issue and has been entrenched for nearly a year.
*   **2024-10-15** South Australia officially promotes Adelaide as the host city, highlighting its world-leading renewable energy credentials. — ↑ Australia — Strengthens the technical and narrative credibility of Australia's bid, providing a concrete location and theme.
*   **2024-09-11** Analysis highlights the significance of the Australia-Pacific partnership, framing it as a major diplomatic opportunity. — ↑ Australia — The co-hosting model with climate-vulnerable nations is a unique and powerful narrative advantage.
*   **2024-09-09** South Australia's renewable energy achievements (75% in 2023, targeting 100% by 2027) receive international praise. — ↑ Australia — Lends significant credibility to the "climate leader" narrative essential for a successful COP host bid.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule (Large):** This is the dominant mechanism. The requirement for unanimity among 29 diverse countries gives any single nation or small bloc veto power. The standoff's persistence implies Turkey is either confident or has enough tacit support to prevent an Australian consensus.
2.  **Geopolitical Alliances & Horse-Trading (Moderate):** The decision is not made in a vacuum. It is likely tied to other diplomatic considerations. Australia can likely count on support from CANZUK nations and potentially the US. Turkey's leverage may come from its strategic importance to Europe and NATO, or from specific bilateral relationships.
3.  **Narrative Strength (Moderate):** Australia's co-hosting bid with Pacific Island nations is a powerful, climate-justice-oriented narrative that will appeal to many progressive WEOG members. It directly addresses the core purpose of the COP. Turkey's narrative is less clear from available sources but may center on bridging developed and developing nations.
4.  **Domestic Commitment & Credibility (Small-Moderate):** The significant political and financial investment from both the Australian federal and South Australian governments demonstrates seriousness. This makes withdrawing more costly and signals to other WEOG members that Australia has the capacity to host effectively.
5.  **Diplomatic Fatigue (Small):** If the deadlock persists, WEOG members may become frustrated and push for the default to Bonn simply to resolve the issue and avoid further internal friction.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Protracted Public Deadlock:** Unlike the COP29 case which was resolved relatively quickly, this standoff has been public and ongoing for at least a year. This suggests both sides have strong reasons not to back down, increasing the probability of a non-standard outcome (i.e., the default to Germany).
*   **Co-hosting with Non-Group Members:** Australia's proposal to co-host with Pacific nations is novel. While symbolically powerful, it may introduce logistical or procedural complexities that differ from a standard single-country bid.
*   **Geopolitical Complexity of WEOG:** The WEOG is arguably the most politically diverse UN regional group. The presence of the US, Canada, Israel, and Turkey alongside the EU bloc creates complex dynamics that are less prevalent in more homogenous groups, making consensus harder to achieve.
*   **Credible Default Option:** The existence of Bonn as a well-established, pre-determined alternative makes the "no consensus" outcome more plausible. It is not a collapse into chaos but an orderly, if diplomatically embarrassing, fallback.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of contested bids, a reasonable prior would favor the bid with the stronger public narrative and political backing. Prior: Australia 60%, Turkey 30%, Germany 9%, Other/Another Pacific Island Nation 1%. (Strength: equivalent n=10, reflecting moderate confidence in the initial assessment).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The year-long persistence of Turkey's bid, creating a firm deadlock, is the single most important piece of evidence. It directly challenges the base case that such contests resolve in favor of the frontrunner.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Australia's high-level political push and the strong, credible backing from South Australia with its world-class renewables story.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The unique and compelling narrative of co-hosting with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations.
    *   (↓ Small) The complete lack of public signals indicating any progress toward a compromise, which slightly increases the probability of the "diplomatic fatigue" mechanism leading to the Bonn default.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of a persistent, unbreakable deadlock is a powerful counterweight to Australia's strong bid. The posterior for Australia should be revised significantly downwards. The probabilities for Turkey and especially Germany should be revised upwards. The outcome is now closer to a toss-up between the three main options than the prior suggested.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of endorsement for Australia's bid from major WEOG players (e.g., Germany, France, Canada, UK, US).
    *   Reports of Turkey withdrawing its bid, possibly in exchange for a future COP or another diplomatic prize.
    *   A formal joint announcement from Australia and a coalition of Pacific Island nations detailing the co-hosting arrangement.
    *   Scheduling of a formal WEOG meeting to decide the host, which may signal a deal is imminent.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support for Turkey's bid from any WEOG member.
    *   Leaked reports from WEOG meetings describing the talks as "deadlocked" or "unproductive."
    *   Official statements from the UNFCCC or senior WEOG diplomats mentioning the possibility of hosting in Bonn.
    *   Any sign of wavering domestic support in Australia (e.g., budget cuts to the bid).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Backroom Diplomacy:** The final decision will be the result of closed-door negotiations. Public statements may be posturing, and the decisive factor could be a secret quid pro quo on an unrelated issue.
*   **Information Gaps:** There is little public information on the specific reasons for Turkey's persistence or which WEOG members might be tacitly supporting its bid to block Australia.
*   **Emergence of a Compromise Candidate:** If the Australia-Turkey deadlock is absolute, a "white knight" candidate from within WEOG could be proposed to break the impasse, though this is a low-probability event.
*   **Resolution Timing:** The decision is expected "before COP 30" (Nov 2025), but a last-minute deal during COP 30 itself is possible, as seen in previous host selections

To forecast which country will host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP 31) in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the likelihood of each option based on the given background and research report.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given Australia's strong diplomatic ties within the WEOG and its high-income status, it fits the typical profile of past WEOG hosts. The base rate for a major OECD nation hosting is ~90%, but considering the deadlock, we adjust this to 60% for Australia.
  
- **Turkey**: As a less typical WEOG host, Turkey's base rate is lower. However, its persistent bid and strategic importance suggest a base rate of 30%.

- **Germany**: The default to Bonn is rare but becomes significant if a deadlock persists. We assign a base rate of 9% for Germany.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is unlikely given the current bids and the WEOG's typical host profile. Base rate: 0.5%.

- **Other**: The emergence of a compromise candidate is possible but unlikely. Base rate: 0.5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The strong political and narrative backing aligns with the base case of a major OECD nation hosting. However, the deadlock with Turkey is a significant deviation.
  
- **Turkey**: The persistence of its bid and potential strategic alliances make it a more viable candidate than typical for a non-European WEOG member.

- **Germany**: The deadlock increases the plausibility of defaulting to Bonn, though it remains a fallback option.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: High-level political investment and the compelling narrative of co-hosting with Pacific nations increase the likelihood of Australia's bid succeeding. Likelihood ratio: 1.5.

- **Turkey**: The ongoing deadlock and lack of resolution suggest Turkey's bid is viable. Likelihood ratio: 1.2.

- **Germany**: The persistent deadlock slightly increases the likelihood of defaulting to Bonn. Likelihood ratio: 1.1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 60/40. Likelihood ratio = 1.5. Posterior odds = 90/40. Posterior probability = 90 / (90 + 40) = 69.2%.

- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 30/70. Likelihood ratio = 1.2. Posterior odds = 36/70. Posterior probability = 36 / (36 + 70) = 33.9%.

- **Germany**: Prior odds = 9/91. Likelihood ratio = 1.1. Posterior odds = 9.9/91. Posterior probability = 9.9 / (9.9 + 91) = 9.8%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The deadlock suggests a higher probability for Germany than initially considered. Adjust Germany's probability upwards slightly.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the possibility of a compromise candidate emerging, though unlikely.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

- Australia: 60%
- Turkey: 25%
- Germany: 14%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 0.5%
- Other: 0.5%

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 60%  
Turkey: 25%  
Germany: 14%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0.5%  
Other: 0.5%

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on historical patterns and the current context:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia is a major WEOG country with a formal bid, strong political backing, and a compelling narrative (co-hosting with Pacific nations). In contested bids, countries with strong diplomatic backing and compelling narratives often succeed.

**Turkey**: 30%
- Rationale: Turkey has formally submitted a bid and has persisted despite Australia's bid. As a WEOG member with strategic importance, it has significant diplomatic leverage.

**Germany**: 15%
- Rationale: Germany hosts the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn and is the default option if consensus fails. Historical precedent suggests deadlocks occasionally result in defaulting to the backup location (~10-15% of contested cases).

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 5%
- Rationale: While Australia proposes co-hosting with Pacific nations, the likelihood of a Pacific nation becoming the primary host is low given the WEOG rotation requirement.

**Other**: 5%
- Rationale: This accounts for the possibility of a compromise candidate emerging from WEOG or procedural complications.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The host selection follows the established UN regional rotation system
- The WEOG group is scheduled to host COP 31
- There are formal bids from countries within the designated regional group
- The decision requires consensus among group members

**Key differences:**
- The deadlock between Australia and Turkey has persisted unusually long (over a year)
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations is novel and creates a unique diplomatic dynamic
- The WEOG group is particularly diverse politically, making consensus more difficult
- Both primary bidders have strong reasons not to withdraw (high political investment)
- There is a credible, established default option (Bonn, Germany)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Australia:**
- High-level political commitment (Prime Minister actively promoting it as "largest-ever diplomatic summit")
  - P(E|H) = 0.9 (Very likely if Australia will host)
  - P(E|~H) = 0.3 (Less likely if Australia won't host, as political capital would be directed elsewhere)

- Concrete host city (Adelaide) with strong renewable credentials (75% renewable energy, targeting 100% by 2027)
  - P(E|H) = 0.8 (Expected if Australia will host)
  - P(E|~H) = 0.4 (Still possible as preparation even if bid fails)

- Unique co-hosting narrative with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations
  - P(E|H) = 0.9 (Strong narrative advantage if Australia will win)
  - P(E|~H) = 0.6 (Still a compelling story even if bid fails)

**Evidence for Turkey:**
- Persistent maintenance of rival bid creating year-long deadlock
  - P(E|H Turkey) = 0.9 (Expected if Turkey has strong backing)
  - P(E|~H Turkey) = 0.4 (Less likely if Turkey's position is weak)

**Evidence for Germany:**
- Protracted, unresolved deadlock between the two main bidders
  - P(E|H Germany) = 0.9 (Almost certain if Germany will host by default)
  - P(E|~H Germany) = 0.3 (Less likely if consensus will be reached)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the key evidence of the persistent deadlock:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: P(deadlock|Australia wins)/P(deadlock|Australia loses) = 0.4/0.7 = 0.57
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 0.57 = 0.47
- Posterior probability: 0.47/(1+0.47) = 32%

For Turkey:
- Prior probability: 30%
- Prior odds: 30/70 = 0.43
- Likelihood ratio: P(deadlock|Turkey wins)/P(deadlock|Turkey loses) = 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- Posterior odds: 0.43 × 1.6 = 0.69
- Posterior probability: 0.69/(1+0.69) = 41%

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.18
- Likelihood ratio: P(deadlock|Germany hosts)/P(deadlock|Germany doesn't host) = 0.9/0.5 = 1.8
- Posterior odds: 0.18 × 1.8 = 0.32
- Posterior probability: 0.32/(1+0.32) = 24%

Now let's update on Australia's strong political commitment and concrete host city preparations:

For Australia:
- Prior (from above): 32%
- Prior odds: 32/68 = 0.47
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.3 = 3
- Posterior odds: 0.47 × 3 = 1.41
- Posterior probability: 1.41/(1+1.41) = 58%

This seems too high given the persistent deadlock. Let me recalibrate by considering all evidence together.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the public information about Australia's bid, which naturally gets more English-language coverage
- I lack specific information about Turkey's diplomatic leverage within WEOG
- The timeline suggests the deadlock has persisted for a year with no resolution, which strongly suggests neither side is close to backing down
- The default to Germany becomes increasingly likely as the deadline approaches without progress

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could have secured quiet support from several WEOG members, making its position stronger than publicly apparent
- A compromise could emerge where Turkey withdraws in exchange for hosting a future COP or other diplomatic concession
- The co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations could introduce procedural complications that weaken Australia's bid

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should increase the probability for Germany given the unusual persistence of the deadlock
- I should slightly decrease Australia's probability to account for potential overconfidence in English-language sources
- I should maintain a significant probability for Turkey given its persistence

## 6. Final Normalization

Considering all evidence and red-teaming:

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 34% 
Germany: 22%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 3%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 34%
Germany: 22%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 3%
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the host of COP 31 in 2026.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The appropriate reference class is "contested bids for hosting a UN COP conference." In these situations, a regional group has multiple members bidding, and a consensus decision is required.

*   **Standard Resolution:** Typically, diplomatic negotiations lead to one candidate withdrawing in favor of the other. This was the case for COP29, where Armenia withdrew its bid, allowing Azerbaijan to be the consensus candidate for the Eastern European Group.
*   **Default/Failure:** If no consensus can be reached, a default option is activated. For COP hosting, this means the conference is held at the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany. This is a rare outcome, as it represents a diplomatic failure for the regional group.
*   **Prior Probabilities:** Based on this, a generic contested bid has a high chance of resolving in favor of one of the primary bidders and a lower chance of defaulting. A reasonable prior distribution would be:
    *   **Bidder 1 (e.g., Australia):** 45%
    *   **Bidder 2 (e.g., Turkey):** 40%
    *   **Default (Germany):** 13%
    *   **Other (New compromise candidate or other outcome):** 2%

This prior reflects that one of the bidders is likely to succeed, but there's a non-trivial risk of deadlock leading to the default option. Australia is given a slight edge based on its profile as a high-income OECD nation, a more typical host profile within the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) than Turkey.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation for COP 31 has several key differences from the base case:

*   **Protracted Deadlock:** The standoff between Australia and Turkey has been public and ongoing for at least a year. This is unusual; many disputes are resolved more quickly behind the scenes. This entrenchment suggests that the normal diplomatic pressures are not working, which significantly increases the probability of the default outcome (Germany).
*   **Group Complexity:** The WEOG is arguably the most politically diverse UN regional group, including the EU bloc, the US, Canada, Australia, Israel, and Turkey. This diversity makes achieving consensus inherently more difficult than in more homogenous groups.
*   **Novel Bid Structure:** Australia's proposal to co-host with non-WEOG Pacific Island nations is a unique feature. While a narrative strength, it could also introduce procedural complexities that some member states may use as a reason to object.

These differences suggest the base rate probability for the default option (Germany) is likely too low for this specific case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence FOR Australia:** Australia has a strong, public-facing bid. It has high-level political backing from its Prime Minister, a designated host city (Adelaide) with a credible climate story (world-leading renewable energy penetration), and a powerful narrative of partnership with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* This evidence is highly likely if Australia is to win (P(E|Australia wins) is high). It is less likely if Turkey or Germany is the final outcome (P(E|Turkey/Germany wins) is lower). This evidence pushes Australia's probability up, primarily at the expense of Turkey.

*   **Evidence AGAINST Australia (and FOR Turkey/Germany):** The single most important piece of evidence is the persistent, year-long deadlock. Turkey's refusal to withdraw, despite Australia's strong public bid, is a powerful signal.
    *   *Likelihood Assessment:* A protracted deadlock is a necessary precondition for the default to Germany (P(E|Germany wins) is very high). It is also highly consistent with Turkey having significant, non-public support or leverage within WEOG, allowing it to sustain its challenge (P(E|Turkey wins) is high). Conversely, this deadlock is strong evidence *against* Australia being a consensus candidate (P(E|Australia wins) is low). This evidence significantly lowers Australia's probability and raises the probabilities for both Turkey and Germany.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with the prior odds of Australia vs. (Turkey or Germany): 45 / (40+13) = 45/53 ≈ 0.85.

Now, we update with the key evidence: the **protracted deadlock**.
*   The likelihood ratio of this evidence is strongly against Australia. Let's estimate P(Deadlock|Australia wins) is low (say 0.2) and P(Deadlock|Australia does not win) is high (say 0.8). The likelihood ratio is 0.2/0.8 = 0.25.
*   **Posterior Odds (Australia):** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.85 × 0.25 ≈ 0.21.
*   **Posterior Probability (Australia):** 0.21 / (1 + 0.21) ≈ 17%.

This is a drastic reduction and may be too severe. A more qualitative approach is that the deadlock evidence acts as a great equalizer. It severely damages Australia's status as a clear frontrunner and elevates both Turkey (as a persistent and therefore credible challenger) and Germany (as the increasingly plausible default) to be strong contenders.

The evidence of Australia's strong bid still gives it an edge over Turkey, but the gap narrows considerably. The probability for Germany increases substantially from the base rate. The situation is now best viewed as a three-way contest with high uncertainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary risk is underestimating the power of the deadlock. The public strength of Australia's bid is easy to see, while the reasons for Turkey's persistence are opaque and likely rooted in closed-door diplomacy. It's possible that Turkey has already secured enough support to block Australia indefinitely, making a Turkish victory or a default to Germany more likely than an Australian one. I might be anchored on Australia as the "protagonist" of the story.

To counter this, I will ensure the probabilities for the three main options are relatively close, reflecting a genuine three-way race where the outcome is highly uncertain. I will keep Australia as the slight favorite due to the objective strengths of its bid, but I will assign significant probability mass to the other two main options to reflect the powerful negative signal of the ongoing stalemate. The "Another Pacific Island Nation" option is very unlikely as they are not WEOG members and cannot host independently under the current rules. "Other" remains a tail risk for a compromise candidate.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the reasoning, I will distribute the probabilities as follows, acknowledging Australia as the slight favorite but with a very high chance of failure due to the deadlock.

*   **Australia:** Has the strongest public bid, but the deadlock is a major obstacle.
*   **Turkey:** Persistence implies significant leverage or support that is not public. A very credible challenger.
*   **Germany:** The probability of this default option increases every day the deadlock continues. It is the path of least resistance for a divided group.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation / Other:** These remain low-probability tail risks.

This leads to the final distribution below.

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 32%
Germany: 28%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 1%
