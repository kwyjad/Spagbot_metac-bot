### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Longest Field Goal by Season (2015–2024):** This 10-year period captures the modern era of kicking specialization. The longest field goal made in each regular season ranged from 58 yards (2015) to 66 yards (2021). The median for this period is 61.5 yards. This class suggests a central tendency in the low 60s, but with significant variance and a clear upward trend in the latter half of the period.
2.  **Longest Field Goal by Season, "Modern Long-Ball Era" (2021–2024):** This class focuses on the most recent period where multiple 60+ yard kicks became more common, reflecting the current talent pool. The longest kicks were 66, 62, 61, and 61 yards. The average is 62.5 yards. This class is more relevant due to recency but suffers from a very small sample size (n=4).
3.  **All-Time Top 10 Longest Field Goals:** This class looks at the extreme tail of the distribution. Before 2021, only three kicks of 63+ yards had ever been made. Since the start of the 2021 season (and including the two hypothetical 2025 kicks), there have been four. This indicates a potential regime shift where such events are becoming more probable.

*Limitations:* All historical reference classes are compromised by the 2025 rule change regarding "kicking balls" (K-balls). This change creates a structural break from the past, suggesting historical data is a lower bound on the current possibilities.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-29 (hypothetical):** A 65-yard field goal is made in Week 4. — ↑ — This is the second-longest kick in NFL history and confirms that the potential for extreme distance shown in preseason is translating to the regular season.
*   **2025-09-15 (hypothetical):** A 64-yard field goal is made in Week 2. — ↑ — This matches the previous second-longest kick ever and provides the first official data point that the 2025 season is unusual, occurring exceptionally early in the year.
*   **2025-08-20 (hypothetical):** Jaguars rookie Cam Little makes a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. — ↑ — While not in the regular season, this serves as a powerful "proof of concept," demonstrating the new upper limit of what is physically possible under the new K-ball rules.
*   **2025-05-01 (hypothetical):** The NFL confirms the rule change allowing teams to practice with their designated K-balls all week. — ↑ — This is the primary causal driver for the expected increase in maximum field goal distance, allowing balls to be "broken in."

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **K-Ball Rule Change (Large ↑):** The ability to break in kicking balls is the most significant new driver. A slightly softer, more conditioned ball has a higher coefficient of restitution, meaning more of the kinetic energy from the kicker's foot is transferred to the ball, resulting in greater distance. This primarily affects the maximum possible distance, not necessarily accuracy on shorter kicks.
2.  **Kicker Specialization and Talent (Large ↑):** The talent pool of kickers is deeper and more specialized than ever. Athletes are training from a younger age with advanced coaching, leading to stronger legs and more efficient biomechanics. This is a secular trend that continues to push the boundaries.
3.  **Game Situation & Analytics (Moderate ↑):** Coaches are increasingly willing to attempt very long field goals at the end of a half or game. The expected value of a low-probability attempt is positive when the alternative is a Hail Mary pass or running out the clock. This creates more opportunities for record attempts.
4.  **Environmental Conditions (Small/Situational ↑):** Favorable conditions are necessary for a record attempt. This includes high altitude (e.g., Denver), warm and dry air (which is less dense), and a significant tailwind. These factors provide a situational boost to a kicker's maximum range.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Structural Rule Change:** The K-ball rule is a fundamental change to the equipment that does not exist in any of the historical reference class data. It creates a discontinuity, making direct historical comparisons unreliable.
*   **Unprecedented Early Season Results:** Having two of the top five longest field goals in history occur within the first four weeks of the season is a massive anomaly. Historically, long kicks are spread throughout the season; this concentration suggests a step-change in kicker capability in 2025.
*   **Demonstrated Upper Bound:** The 70-yard preseason field goal, while unofficial, provides a credible signal of the new physical ceiling for kickers. No prior season has begun with such a clear demonstration of a higher performance limit.
*   **Depth of Long-Range Talent:** The number of kickers who are considered a credible threat from 60+ yards (e.g., Justin Tucker, Brandon Aubrey, Jake Moody, Evan McPherson, Cam Little) appears to be at an all-time high.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2021-2024 "Modern Long-Ball Era" seems most appropriate. This would suggest a distribution centered around 63 yards, with a low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=4) to reflect the small sample size and high uncertainty, and a right tail extending to the record of 66 yards.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The K-ball rule change is a structural break suggesting the entire historical distribution should shift upwards.
    *   **↑ (Large):** A 65-yard make in the first month is exceptionally strong evidence that the new environment is producing outlier results.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The 70-yard preseason make provides a new anchor for the plausible upper bound of the distribution.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The 64-yard make reinforces the 65-yarder, reducing the probability that the latter was a complete fluke.
    *   **↔ (Neutral):** The observation that overall 50+ yard accuracy is flat vs. 2024 is not strong counter-evidence, as the K-ball mechanism likely affects the tail (max distance) more than the body (general accuracy from 50-59 yards).
*   **Net effect:** The posterior distribution should shift significantly upward. The median expectation should increase from ~63 to perhaps 65 or 66 yards. The right tail should be extended substantially, with non-trivial probability assigned to outcomes of 67, 68, and even 69 yards.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any field goal attempt of 65 yards or longer, even if missed.
    *   Public reports or videos of kickers hitting 70+ yard field goals in pre-game warmups.
    *   Games featuring elite kickers scheduled in Denver or in warm-weather locations with potential for wind.
    *   A close game involving a team with a top kicker reaching the opponent's 45-50 yard line with seconds left in a half.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   An injury to a premier long-distance kicker (e.g., Justin Tucker, Brandon Aubrey).
    *   A stretch of cold, wet, and windy weather across the league in November and December.
    *   An NFL Competition Committee statement expressing "concern" over the K-balls, potentially leading to stricter pre-game inspections.
    *   A lack of any further attempts over 62 yards for the next 4-6 weeks, suggesting the early season was an anomaly.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Small Number Statistics:** The event in question—a season's longest field goal—is a single data point drawn from the extreme tail of a distribution. It is inherently noisy and difficult to predict precisely.
*   **Opportunity Dependence:** A record cannot be broken without an attempt. The attempt depends entirely on rare game situations (end of half/game, correct field position, coach's willingness), which are stochastic.
*   **Conflating Max Distance with Accuracy:** The K-ball rule may add 2-4 yards to a kicker's maximum possible distance, but it doesn't guarantee they will make a kick from that range. The outcome of any single attempt remains highly uncertain.
*   **Measurement Precision:** The official distance is what matters. A kick that clears the crossbar by 10 yards from 65 yards out is still resolved as 65 yards, not the ~75 yards it "would have been good from."
*   **Early Season Fluke:** While unlikely given the mechanisms, it is possible the two long kicks in September were a statistical cluster and the rest of the season will see a regression to a more normal mean.

**Final Research Summary:** A significant rule change allowing kickers to "break in" footballs has created a new paradigm for long-distance attempts. This, combined with an ongoing secular trend of improving talent, is strongly supported by early 2025 season data, which has already seen two of the longest kicks in history, suggesting the all-time record of 66 yards is in jeopardy.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow a Bayesian approach, incorporating prior data and recent developments.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class:** The "Modern Long-Ball Era" (2021–2024) is the most relevant base rate, with an average longest field goal of 62.5 yards. This period reflects the current talent pool and recent trends in kicking.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean is 62.5 yards, with a variance reflecting the range from 61 to 66 yards.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation continues the trend of increasing field goal distances, with kickers becoming more specialized and talented.
   - **Differences:** The 2025 rule change allowing teams to practice with K-balls introduces a structural break, likely increasing the maximum possible distance.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **K-Ball Rule Change:** This is a significant factor, suggesting a shift upwards in the distribution of possible longest field goals.
   - **Early Season Results:** Two kicks of 64 and 65 yards within the first four weeks indicate a higher likelihood of longer kicks this season.
   - **Preseason 70-Yard Kick:** Demonstrates the new upper limit, suggesting a rightward extension of the distribution.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 63 yards.
   - **Evidence:** The K-ball rule and early season results shift the distribution upwards.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Likely around 65-66 yards, with a longer right tail extending to 70 yards.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of early season results being anomalies.
   - **Tail Risks:** Environmental conditions and game situations could lead to longer kicks.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A conservative estimate might center around 64 yards, but evidence strongly supports a higher forecast.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season are:

P10: 63  
P20: 64  
P40: 65  
P60: 66  
P80: 67  
P90: 68

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Longest field goal per NFL season from 2015-2024
- Range: 58-66 yards
- Median: 61.5 yards
- Mean: ~61 yards
- Standard deviation: ~2.5 yards

**Recent reference class (2021-2024)**: 
- Values: 66, 62, 61, 61 yards
- Mean: 62.5 yards
- This captures the recent upward trend in long-distance kicking

I'll use the 2021-2024 period as my primary prior since it better reflects current kicker capabilities, with a distribution centered around 62.5 yards but with significant uncertainty (standard deviation of ~2.5 yards).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Same fundamental task (kicking field goals)
- Same physical constraints (human leg strength, ball physics)
- Same game situations that create opportunities for long attempts

**Key differences**:
- **K-ball rule change**: Teams can now practice with game balls all week, allowing them to break in the balls
- **Early evidence of impact**: Two of the five longest kicks in NFL history (64 and 65 yards) already occurred in the first four weeks of 2025
- **Preseason demonstration**: A 70-yard field goal in preseason by Cam Little establishes a new upper bound on what's physically possible
- **Continued specialization**: The trend of kicker improvement appears to be accelerating

These differences strongly suggest the distribution should shift upward compared to historical data.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for longer kicks**:
- **K-ball rule change**: Physics suggests a broken-in ball travels farther. This likely adds 2-4 yards to maximum distance. (Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring longer kicks)
- **70-yard preseason kick**: Demonstrates the physical possibility of kicks well beyond the current record. (Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring longer kicks)
- **Two 64+ yard kicks in first four weeks**: Unprecedented early-season success from long distance. (Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 favoring longer kicks)

**Evidence against longer kicks**:
- **No improvement in 50+ yard accuracy**: Through week 4, kickers aren't making a higher percentage of 50+ yard kicks compared to 2024. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring shorter kicks)
- **Inspection of balls still occurs**: Pre-game inspections may limit how much balls can be broken in. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring shorter kicks)

**Net likelihood ratio**: Strongly favors longer kicks (~8:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 62.5 yards (from 2021-2024 data):

**First update - K-ball rule change**:
- Prior: Mean = 62.5 yards, SD = 2.5 yards
- Update: Shift mean upward by ~2 yards
- Intermediate posterior: Mean = 64.5 yards, SD = 2.5 yards

**Second update - Early season evidence (64 and 65 yard kicks)**:
- Intermediate posterior: Mean = 64.5 yards, SD = 2.5 yards
- Update: Shift mean upward by ~1 yard, slightly reduce uncertainty
- New posterior: Mean = 65.5 yards, SD = 2.3 yards

**Third update - Preseason 70-yarder**:
- New posterior: Mean = 65.5 yards, SD = 2.3 yards
- Update: Extend right tail, increase mean slightly
- Final posterior: Mean = 66 yards, SD = 2.3 yards, with extended right tail

This posterior distribution suggests the longest field goal is most likely to be around 66 yards, but with meaningful probability extending to 69-70 yards.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence**:
- I may be overweighting early-season results. Four weeks is a small sample.
- The preseason 70-yarder occurred under controlled conditions, not game pressure.
- Weather will deteriorate later in the season, making long kicks harder.

**Alternative scenarios**:
- The early long kicks could be statistical flukes rather than evidence of a new regime.
- Kickers might attempt more long kicks but miss them, leading to no new records.
- The NFL could issue mid-season guidance on ball preparation, limiting the advantage.

**Tail risks**:
- Upper tail: Perfect conditions in Denver (altitude) + strong tailwind + elite kicker could push beyond 70 yards.
- Lower tail: If no situations arise where coaches attempt 63+ yard kicks, we might see a longest kick in the low 60s.

After considering these factors, I'll slightly widen my uncertainty bands while maintaining the upward shift in the distribution.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the longest field goal made in each NFL regular season during the "Modern Long-Ball Era," from 2021 to 2024. This period reflects the current state of kicker talent and specialization, which has seen a notable increase in long-distance success.

*   **Reference Class:** Longest FG by season, 2021-2024.
*   **Data:** {66, 62, 61, 61} yards.
*   **Distribution:** This small sample gives a median of 61.5 yards and a mean of 62.5 yards. The distribution is centered in the low 60s, with an observed maximum of 66 yards (the current all-time record). This serves as a prior distribution for a "normal" season under recent conditions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base case due to a structural change.

*   **Similarity:** The underlying talent pool of kickers and the strategic incentives to attempt long field goals at the end of a half/game remain similar to the 2021-2024 period.
*   **Difference:** The primary difference is the new 2025 rule allowing teams to practice with their designated "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. This allows kickers to "break in" the balls, making them slightly softer and likely increasing their coefficient of restitution. This physical change should directly increase the maximum possible kicking distance, creating a discontinuity with all prior historical data. The early season results (two of the longest kicks in history) confirm this is not a theoretical change but one with a dramatic real-world impact.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several new pieces of evidence from 2025 must be incorporated, all of which strongly suggest a higher outcome.

*   **K-Ball Rule Change (Large Upward Pressure):** This is the core causal mechanism. By altering the physical properties of the game ball, it shifts the entire distribution of maximum kick distances upward. It makes outcomes higher than the previous record of 66 yards much more likely.
*   **70-Yard Preseason Field Goal (Strong Upward Pressure):** While not a regular-season kick, Cam Little's 70-yarder serves as a powerful proof-of-concept. It establishes a new, credible ceiling for what is physically possible under the new rules, significantly extending the plausible right tail of the distribution.
*   **65-Yard Regular Season Field Goal (Week 4) (Very Strong Upward Pressure):** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It establishes a hard floor for the final result; the longest field goal of 2025 will be *at least* 65 yards. It also confirms that the potential seen in the preseason is translating to official games.
*   **64-Yard Regular Season Field Goal (Week 2) (Moderate Upward Pressure):** This reinforces the 65-yard kick, demonstrating that such long kicks are not a one-off fluke but a repeatable feature of the 2025 season. The fact that two such kicks occurred in the first month is an exceptionally strong signal of a new regime.
*   **Flat 50+ Yard FG% vs. 2024 (Neutral/Slight Downward Pressure):** The report notes that overall accuracy from 50+ yards has not increased. This suggests the rule change may not have made all long kicks easier, but rather specifically extended the maximum possible range. It tempers expectations of a universal increase in kicking prowess but does not negate the evidence for a higher maximum distance.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 62.5 yards, with a tail extending to the record of 66 yards.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (K-ball rule, preseason 70-yarder, and especially the 64 and 65-yard regular season makes) is overwhelmingly more consistent with a world where the maximum field goal distance is significantly higher than the prior.
*   **Update Step:** The observation of a 65-yard field goal truncates the prior distribution. Any value below 65 now has zero probability. The posterior distribution must start at 65. Furthermore, with 13 weeks remaining in the season, there are numerous opportunities for this new benchmark to be surpassed. The evidence shifts the central tendency of my forecast from the low 60s to the mid-to-high 60s.
*   **Posterior:** The median of my posterior distribution is now around 66.5 yards, implying it is more likely than not that the all-time record of 66 yards will be broken this season. The right tail is now substantially extended, with a 69 or 70-yard field goal being plausible, though unlikely.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The two long kicks in the first four weeks were a statistical anomaly, perhaps aided by unusually favorable weather. Now that a high mark of 65 has been set, coaches may be less inclined to attempt even longer kicks, and the 65-yarder could stand as the season's longest.
*   **Rebuttal:** This seems unlikely. The K-ball rule provides a clear physical mechanism for the increase in distance. With many capable kickers and 13 weeks of games left (including games in domes or high-altitude Denver), the probability of at least one more ideal opportunity for a 66+ yard attempt is high. The incentive to try a long field goal at the end of a half has not changed.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Am I overweighting the 70-yard preseason kick? Perhaps. Preseason conditions are different. However, it serves as a useful anchor for the plausible maximum. My final percentiles still place a 70-yarder as a tail outcome (P(X>=70) < 10%), which seems appropriate. The main risk is underestimating the stochasticity of game situations, which are required for an attempt to even be made. My distribution reflects this by still assigning a ~30% chance that the longest kick will be 65 yards or less (i.e., the current 65-yarder stands).
