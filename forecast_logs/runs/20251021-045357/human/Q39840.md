### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent La Niña Years (2020-2022):** This is the most direct reference class. During the multi-year La Niña from 2020 to early 2023, global temperatures were suppressed relative to the long-term trend but remained high historically. The peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec of 2021 and 2022 were in the approximate range of **1.5°C to 1.7°C**. This class is useful because it reflects the same primary climate driver (La Niña) but is limited as the background warming trend has continued and other factors differ.
-   **Recent Strong El Niño Years (2023-2024):** This class provides a plausible upper bound. The powerful 2023-2024 El Niño, combined with background warming, pushed peak daily anomalies to unprecedented levels. The highest daily anomaly during Nov/Dec 2023 and early 2024 reached approximately **2.0°C to 2.1°C**. This class is less likely to be representative but is crucial for understanding the recent state of the climate system and the amount of heat it contains.
-   **All Years in the Past Decade (2015-2024):** This class captures the modern climate regime, including both El Niño and La Niña phases. The average peak daily anomaly for Nov/Dec in this period is likely around **1.6°C to 1.8°C**. This provides a broader baseline but may obscure the specific impact of the current La Niña state.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-10-20** ENSO report confirms La Niña is present and expected to persist through Northern Hemisphere winter. (↓) — Solidifies the primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period.
-   **2025-10-09** NOAA officially issues a La Niña Advisory, noting conditions are favored to persist through Dec 2025 - Feb 2026. (↓) — Official confirmation from a key agency, increasing confidence in the La Niña state.
-   **2025-09 (approx.)** As shown in the provided chart, 2025's temperature anomaly curve flattens and falls to 3rd warmest on record. (↓) — Demonstrates that the cooling effect of the developing La Niña is already manifesting in the global data, pulling temperatures down from the record highs of early 2025.
-   **2025-01-09** Climate.gov reports La Niña conditions officially emerged in December 2024 and are expected to be weak. (↓) — Establishes the start and character of the event; a "weak" event implies a more moderate cooling effect than a strong one.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **ENSO State (La Niña):** La Niña involves cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which has a net cooling effect on global average air temperatures, typically with a lag of 3-6 months. This is the primary downward driver. **Size: Large.**
-   **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The accumulation of greenhouse gases creates a persistent, powerful upward pressure on global temperatures. Each year has a higher baseline temperature than the last, meaning a La Niña in 2025 will be warmer than one in 2015. **Size: Large.**
-   **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** While the equatorial Pacific is cool, many other ocean basins (e.g., North Atlantic, Western Pacific) remain at record or near-record warmth. These vast reservoirs of heat release energy into the atmosphere, counteracting some of La Niña's cooling effect. **Size: Moderate.**
-   **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Eruption (Jan 2022):** This eruption injected a massive amount of water vapor (a potent greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. While its peak warming effect has likely passed, it may still be contributing a small positive anomaly to global temperatures. **Size: Small.**
-   **Stochastic Weather Variability:** Short-term, regional weather patterns can cause significant day-to-day fluctuations in the global average. A confluence of heatwaves across multiple continents could cause a temporary spike. **Size: Small to Moderate.**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Non-ENSO Ocean Warmth:** Compared to the 2020-2022 La Niña (the primary reference class), the background SSTs in the rest of the world are significantly higher. This provides a powerful buffer against cooling, suggesting 2025 will be much warmer than previous La Niña years.
-   **Higher Warming Baseline:** The underlying anthropogenic warming trend has added ~0.06°C to the global average temperature since the last La Niña event concluded in early 2023. The starting point for any cooling is substantially higher.
-   **Lingering Stratospheric Water Vapor:** The Hunga Tonga eruption's effects were not a significant factor during the 2020-2022 La Niña. This adds a small but unique warming pressure to the current climate state.
-   **Preceded by a Super El Niño:** The climate system is transitioning from an exceptionally strong 2023-2024 El Niño, which injected a massive amount of heat into the atmosphere. There is significant thermal inertia, and the system may not have fully cooled from this peak.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with the peak daily anomalies from the recent 2020-2022 La Niña period as the reference class. This suggests a prior centered around **1.65°C**, with an equivalent n=15, reflecting a reasonably strong belief that the current ENSO state is the most important factor.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) The baseline for global temperature is significantly higher due to two additional years of anthropogenic warming.
    -   (↑ Moderate) Record-breaking ocean heat content outside the equatorial Pacific will substantially moderate La Niña's cooling effect.
    -   (↑ Small) Lingering stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga adds a slight warming influence not present in the reference class.
    -   (↓ Small) The current La Niña is consistently described as "weak," which may imply a less potent cooling effect than the multi-year event of 2020-2022.
-   **Net effect:** The upward pressures, particularly the higher baseline and global ocean heat, are substantial and almost certainly outweigh the cooling from a weak La Niña. The posterior should move significantly **upward** from the 1.65°C prior, likely into the 1.75°C to 1.90°C range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Weekly Niño 3.4 index values trending warmer (e.g., from -1.0°C to -0.6°C), suggesting the La Niña is weakening or failing to intensify.
    -   Copernicus reports of new record-high monthly SSTs in the North Atlantic or Indian Oceans.
    -   Widespread, persistent heatwaves reported across major landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere in late October/early November.
    -   Lower-than-expected global snow and ice cover extent.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Weekly Niño 3.4 index values trending colder (e.g., from -1.0°C to -1.4°C), indicating a strengthening La Niña.
    -   A notable cooling trend in global SST anomalies outside the Pacific.
    -   A major tropical volcanic eruption with significant sulfur dioxide emissions (a black swan event).
    -   Unusually cool and stormy weather patterns dominating large continental areas.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The question resolves on the single highest *daily* anomaly, which is inherently more volatile and subject to short-term weather noise than monthly or annual averages. The peak could be significantly higher than the monthly mean.
-   **Data Reanalysis:** The Copernicus ERA5 dataset, which this is based on, is a reanalysis product. Final figures for the resolution period may be subject to slight revisions after the fact.
-   **ENSO Forecast Uncertainty:** While a weak La Niña is the consensus, climate model predictions for ENSO intensity have a significant error margin. A rapid change in its strength is a low-probability but high-impact risk.
-   **Definition of "Anomaly":** The anomaly is calculated against the 1991-2020 baseline. Using a different baseline (e.g., pre-industrial) would yield a much higher number, but the resolution criteria are specific to the Copernicus standard.

**Final Research Summary:**
A weak La Niña is exerting a cooling influence on the climate system. However, this is occurring within a context of a powerful long-term warming trend and unprecedented heat stored in the global oceans, which will likely make Nov/Dec 2025 exceptionally warm for a La Niña period and significantly warmer than the 2020-2022 La Niña years.

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class:** Recent La Niña years (2020-2022) are the most relevant due to the current La Niña conditions. During these years, peak anomalies were around 1.5°C to 1.7°C. This provides a baseline reflecting similar ENSO conditions.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** We'll use a mean of 1.65°C with a moderate variance to account for natural variability and the influence of other factors.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current La Niña conditions are similar to those in 2020-2022, providing a cooling influence.
   - **Differences:** The current background warming trend is higher, and ocean heat content is at record levels, suggesting a warmer baseline than previous La Niña years.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Higher Baseline Temperature (↑ Large):** The anthropogenic warming trend adds approximately 0.06°C since the last La Niña, suggesting higher anomalies.
   - **Ocean Heat Content (↑ Moderate):** Record warmth in non-ENSO ocean basins counteracts La Niña cooling.
   - **Weak La Niña (↓ Small):** A weak La Niña implies less cooling than a strong event.
   - **Stratospheric Water Vapor (↑ Small):** Residual effects from the Hunga Tonga eruption add a slight warming influence.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered at 1.65°C.
   - **Evidence Impact:** The upward pressures (higher baseline, ocean heat) outweigh the cooling from La Niña.
   - **Posterior Shift:** Adjust the mean upward to around 1.80°C, reflecting the net effect of the evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the volatility of daily anomalies and potential ENSO forecast errors.
   - **Tail Risks:** A sudden strengthening of La Niña or unexpected volcanic activity could lower anomalies.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with a stronger La Niña might suggest a lower range, but current evidence supports a warmer outcome.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the adjusted posterior distribution, the percentiles are as follows:

P10: 1.70  
P20: 1.75  
P40: 1.80  
P60: 1.85  
P80: 1.90  
P90: 1.95

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly for Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the temperature anomalies from recent La Niña periods, particularly focusing on the 2020-2022 La Niña event, as this represents the most relevant reference class. During this period, the peak daily anomalies in November/December were approximately 1.5-1.7°C, with a central tendency around 1.65°C.

I'm selecting this as my base rate because:
- The current climate state is entering a La Niña phase expected to persist through the forecast period
- La Niña typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures
- This reference class captures similar ENSO conditions to what we expect in late 2025

The prior distribution has a mean/median of approximately 1.65°C with a standard deviation of roughly 0.15°C.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Both involve La Niña conditions during the November-December period
- Both occur within the modern climate regime with elevated greenhouse gas concentrations
- Both follow periods of elevated temperatures

**Key differences:**
- Background warming trend: There's been approximately 0.06°C of additional warming since the last La Niña ended in early 2023
- Ocean heat content: Current global oceans (outside the equatorial Pacific) are significantly warmer than during 2020-2022
- Preceding conditions: The 2025 La Niña follows an exceptionally strong 2023-2024 El Niño, which injected substantial heat into the climate system
- La Niña strength: The current La Niña is described as "weak," potentially exerting less cooling influence than the 2020-2022 event
- Lingering effects from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption, which injected water vapor (a greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere

These differences predominantly push toward higher temperature anomalies compared to the 2020-2022 reference period.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward higher anomalies:**

1. **Background warming trend (+0.06°C since 2022)**
   - Likelihood ratio: This makes higher values approximately 1.5× more likely
   - This is a direct upward shift in the baseline

2. **Record ocean heat content outside the equatorial Pacific**
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values approximately 2× more likely
   - The North Atlantic and other ocean basins remain exceptionally warm, providing a buffer against La Niña cooling

3. **Transition from a strong El Niño**
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values approximately 1.3× more likely
   - Thermal inertia from the 2023-2024 El Niño means the system retains excess heat

4. **Hunga Tonga eruption effects**
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values approximately 1.1× more likely
   - While diminishing, the water vapor injection still provides a small warming influence

**Evidence pushing toward lower anomalies:**

1. **La Niña conditions confirmed and expected to persist**
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes lower values approximately 1.5× more likely
   - The primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period

2. **Flattening of 2025 temperature curve**
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes lower values approximately 1.2× more likely
   - Indicates La Niña's cooling effect is already manifesting

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 1.65°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - Background warming trend:**
- Prior: Mean = 1.65°C
- Likelihood: Higher values 1.5× more likely
- Posterior shift: Approximately +0.06°C
- Updated mean ≈ 1.71°C

**Second update - Record ocean heat content:**
- Prior: Mean = 1.71°C
- Likelihood: Higher values 2× more likely
- Posterior shift: Approximately +0.10°C
- Updated mean ≈ 1.81°C

**Third update - La Niña conditions:**
- Prior: Mean = 1.81°C
- Likelihood: Lower values 1.5× more likely
- Posterior shift: Approximately -0.05°C
- Updated mean ≈ 1.76°C

The posterior distribution has shifted upward from the original prior, with a mean around 1.76°C and slightly increased variance due to the competing factors at play. The distribution is also slightly right-skewed, reflecting the potential for occasional high spikes due to short-term weather patterns.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**

1. **La Niña strength uncertainty:** If La Niña strengthens beyond current expectations, temperatures could be lower than my forecast suggests. Conversely, if it weakens, temperatures could be higher.

2. **Daily vs. monthly variability:** I may be underestimating the potential for short-term spikes in daily temperature anomalies, which can exceed monthly averages by 0.2-0.3°C.

3. **Volcanic activity:** A major volcanic eruption before or during the forecast period could significantly lower temperatures, though this is a low-probability event.

4. **Anthropogenic aerosol changes:** Shifts in industrial emissions or clean air policies could affect short-term temperature trends in ways not captured by my model.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would center around 1.65°C, arguing that La Niña's cooling effect will be stronger than I've estimated, potentially offsetting more of the background warming factors. This would align more closely with the 2020-2022 reference class.

Rebuttal: While plausible, this alternative doesn't adequately account for the unprecedented ocean warmth outside the equatorial Pacific and the additional background warming since the last La Niña.

After considering these factors, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for the daily variability and adjust my median estimate slightly upward to better reflect the potential for short-term temperature spikes.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 1.58
P20: 1.65
P40: 1.74
P60: 1.80

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
-   **Base Rate**: The peak daily global surface air temperature anomalies during the November-December periods of the most recent La Niña event (2020-2022).
-   **Reasoning**: This is the most appropriate reference class because it shares the same primary climate driver, the La Niña phase of ENSO, which has a net cooling effect on global temperatures. This period provides a realistic anchor for how the climate system behaves under La Niña's influence in the modern era.
-   **Distribution**: The research report states that peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec of 2021 and 2022 were in the approximate range of 1.5°C to 1.7°C. I will model this prior with a median around **1.60°C** and a standard deviation of roughly 0.1°C to capture this range.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
-   **Similarities**: The dominant climate driver for the forecast period is La Niña, which is expected to suppress global temperatures relative to the long-term trend, just as it did in 2020-2022.
-   **Differences**: The current situation is significantly warmer than the base case for several reasons:
    1.  **Higher Warming Baseline**: The underlying anthropogenic warming trend has continued for approximately three years since the reference period, adding roughly +0.06°C to the baseline temperature.
    2.  **Unprecedented Ocean Heat Content (OHC)**: The planet, particularly oceans outside the equatorial Pacific (e.g., the North Atlantic), is substantially warmer than during the 2020-2022 La Niña. This massive reservoir of heat will counteract La Niña's cooling effect.
    3.  **Preceding "Super El Niño"**: The climate system is transitioning from an exceptionally strong El Niño in 2023-2024, meaning there is significant thermal inertia, and the system is starting from a much higher temperature peak.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
-   **La Niña Conditions (Strong downward pressure)**: The confirmed presence of La Niña is the primary evidence for lower values. It makes outcomes similar to the 2023-2024 El Niño peak (>2.0°C) extremely unlikely and is the main cooling driver.
-   **Record Global OHC & Thermal Inertia (Very strong upward pressure)**: This is the most significant warming factor compared to the base case. The extreme warmth in other ocean basins makes it highly likely that this La Niña period will be significantly warmer than the 2020-2022 period. This factor pushes the distribution up by a large amount (e.g., +0.15°C to +0.20°C).
-   **Long-term Warming Trend (Moderate upward pressure)**: This adds a near-certain +0.06°C to the base rate, making values at or below the previous La Niña's peak less likely.
-   **Observed 2025 Cooling Trend (Moderate downward pressure)**: The provided chart shows the anomaly has already dropped from its early 2025 peak to around 1.75°C in September. This is strong evidence that the La Niña cooling is actively working. This makes it less likely that the Nov/Dec peak will be dramatically higher than the current level and pulls the final estimate down from where the warming factors alone would place it.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
-   **Prior**: A distribution centered at **1.60°C**, based on the 2020-2022 La Niña.
-   **Update Step**:
    1.  Start with the prior median of 1.60°C.
    2.  Add the effect of the long-term warming trend: 1.60°C + 0.06°C = 1.66°C.
    3.  Incorporate the major warming effect of record OHC and thermal inertia. This is the largest adjustment, shifting the estimate up by ~0.19°C to 1.85°C. This reflects the fundamentally hotter background state of the planet.
    4.  Condition on the observed data from the chart: the anomaly has already fallen to ~1.75°C by September. While the *peak* daily value can be higher than the monthly average, the clear downward trend suggests the peak is unlikely to be far above this. This evidence pulls the forecast down from 1.85°C.
-   **Posterior**: I will adjust my final median to **1.80°C**. This balances the powerful background warming pressures with the observed cooling from La Niña. The posterior distribution is now centered significantly higher than the prior, with considerable variance due to the unprecedented nature of this climatic setup.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Alternative Scenario (La Niña Dominates)**: I might be underestimating the cooling power of La Niña. The atmospheric response could be stronger than anticipated, causing the global system to shed heat rapidly and pushing the peak anomaly down towards ~1.70°C, similar to the very warmest days of the last La Niña but adjusted for the trend.
-   **Alternative Scenario (Warmth Dominates)**: Conversely, the La Niña could be very weak or falter unexpectedly. The immense ocean heat could then keep temperatures stubbornly high, with a peak approaching or exceeding 1.90°C.
-   **Volatility**: The question resolves on the single highest *daily* anomaly, not a monthly average. Short-term weather patterns can cause significant spikes. My median of 1.80°C assumes some daily volatility on top of a monthly average that might be slightly lower (e.g., 1.75°C). My P90 of 1.95°C accounts for the risk of a major, widespread heatwave event causing a brief spike. My distribution accounts for these competing risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 1.65
P20: 1.70
P40: 1.77
P60: 1.83
P80: 1.90
P90: 1.95
