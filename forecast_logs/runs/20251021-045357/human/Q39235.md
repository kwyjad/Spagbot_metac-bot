### Reference class & base rates
*   **DRC Ebola Outbreaks (Post-Vaccine Era, 2019-Present):** This is the most relevant class. Since the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine's approval and widespread use, DRC outbreaks have been small.
    *   2021 North Kivu: 12 cases, 6 deaths.
    *   2022 Équateur: 5 cases, 5 deaths.
    *   2022 North Kivu: 1 case, 1 death.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median death toll is 5. This class suggests a high probability of rapid containment with fewer than 25 deaths.
    *   **Limitation:** This class has few data points (n=3) and excludes the massive Kivu outbreak (2018-2020), which overlapped with the vaccine's introduction and was driven by unique security challenges.

*   **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present):** A broader, more volatile reference class (n=16 outbreaks).
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is extremely right-skewed. The median is low (approx. 30-40 deaths), but the mean is high (~160 deaths) due to major outliers like the 1976 Yambuku (280 deaths) and 2018-2020 Kivu (2,299 deaths) outbreaks. This class highlights the potential for catastrophic tail risk.
    *   **Limitation:** Pre-2019 data does not account for the game-changing impact of effective vaccines and therapeutics, making historical outcomes less representative of current capabilities.

*   **Outbreaks with >25 Deaths at 6 Weeks:** This conditional class filters for outbreaks that were not immediately contained. The current outbreak, with 45 deaths by week 6, fits this profile.
    *   **Base Rate:** Historical outbreaks meeting this criterion (e.g., Yambuku 1976, Kikwit 1995, Kivu 2018-20) have all resulted in final death tolls in the hundreds or thousands.
    *   **Limitation:** This is a small, cherry-picked class of worst-case scenarios. However, it correctly identifies that failure of initial containment is a strong predictor of a severe outcome.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-09-04] Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province, DRC, with 32 cases and 15 deaths reported. — ↑ — Establishes a significant starting point, already larger than some recent outbreaks at declaration.
*   [2025-10-15] CDC report confirms 64 total cases and 45 deaths. — ↑↑ — Tripling of deaths in ~6 weeks shows sustained, rapid transmission, moving this outbreak out of the "quickly contained" reference class.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Speed and Efficacy of Ring Vaccination:** (Large) Rapid deployment of the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine to contacts and contacts-of-contacts is the primary tool for containment. Delays or gaps in coverage are the main failure points.
*   **Contact Tracing and Isolation:** (Large) The ability to identify, monitor, and isolate all potential contacts of a known case is critical. Success hinges on workforce capacity and community cooperation.
*   **Community Trust and Security:** (Large) Mistrust of health workers or government officials, or active conflict, can severely hamper all response efforts, from vaccination to safe burials. This was the key driver of the Kivu outbreak's severity.
*   **Geographic Location and Mobility:** (Moderate) Kasaï is a more central province than the Kivu region. This may slow international spread but does not prevent spread to major domestic transport hubs like Kananga, which would accelerate the outbreak.
*   **Healthcare System Capacity:** (Moderate) The availability of Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs), trained staff, and therapeutics (like monoclonal antibodies) directly impacts the case fatality rate (CFR) and can affect community willingness to report cases. The current CFR of ~70% (45/64) is high, suggesting potential system strain.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Failure of Initial Containment:** Unlike the three most recent DRC outbreaks (2021-2022), which were held to ≤6 deaths, this outbreak has already grown substantially. This is the single most important difference.
*   **Experience and Tools from Day One:** Compared to the large Kivu outbreak, response teams are starting with a well-understood vaccine, established therapeutic options, and nearly a decade of recent institutional experience. This should, in theory, enable a more effective response.
*   **Geopolitical Context (Kasaï vs. Kivu):** The Kasaï region has a history of conflict, but it is a different operational environment than the North Kivu/Ituri region, which was an active warzone with multiple armed groups during the 2018-2020 epidemic. The specific security and trust landscape in Kasaï is a key variable.
*   **High Initial CFR:** The reported case fatality rate of ~70% is at the high end of the historical range for Ebola Zaire. This may indicate late case detection, overwhelmed treatment facilities, or community reluctance to seek formal care.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the "Post-Vaccine Era" reference class seems appropriate, suggesting a low total death count (median ~15-20 deaths) with a small equivalent n (e.g., n=5) to reflect the limited data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Growth from 15 to 45 deaths in ~6 weeks is strong evidence against the prior, indicating that key containment mechanisms have not been fully effective.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The high initial CFR (~70%) suggests underlying problems with the response, such as delayed patient presentation or strained healthcare capacity.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The full availability of modern vaccines and therapeutics from the start of the outbreak provides a powerful downward pressure compared to historical large outbreaks.
    *   (↓/↑ Uncertain) The operational environment in Kasaï is different from Kivu. If it is more permissive for health workers, this is a strong ↓; if not, it is a strong ↑.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of rapid, sustained growth overwhelmingly contradicts the low prior. The posterior distribution should shift significantly upward, with the median moving from the tens to the low-to-mid hundreds (e.g., 150-250) and a much fatter right tail representing the non-trivial risk of an outcome in the high hundreds or low thousands.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in a major city (e.g., Kananga) or another province.
    *   Weekly new case counts continue to rise or plateau instead of declining.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or response teams.
    *   A high percentage (>15%) of new cases not being on a known contact list.
    *   Official requests for significant international assistance (e.g., from WHO GOARN, MSF).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Two consecutive weeks of declining new case numbers.
    *   Contact tracing success rate reported as >80% of contacts followed for 21 days.
    *   No new cases reported outside of the initial outbreak zone.
    *   Reports of high vaccine acceptance and coverage in affected communities.
    *   A falling case fatality rate, suggesting more effective and earlier treatment.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lags and Revisions:** Official numbers from the DRC Ministry of Health can be delayed and are often subject to revision. Initial reports may undercount the true scale.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The distinction between "suspected," "probable," and "confirmed" cases can be fluid. The resolution criteria depend on the final official tally, which may differ from operational reports.
*   **Political Instability:** The DRC's political situation is a constant source of uncertainty. A separate political or security crisis could divert resources and attention away from the Ebola response.
*   **Short Horizon:** With resolution on Jan 1, 2026 (in ~2.5 months), the final number is highly sensitive to the response's effectiveness over the next 8-10 weeks. A rapid clampdown could still keep the total low, while continued failure would lead to a very high number in a short time.

**Final Research Summary:** The outbreak's rapid initial growth has already invalidated the base case of a small, quickly contained event. The forecast should be anchored on the "failed containment" reference class, suggesting a final death toll in the hundreds, with the primary uncertainty being the on-the-ground effectiveness of response teams in the specific context of Kasaï province.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province, DRC, before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the "Post-Vaccine Era" reference class for DRC Ebola outbreaks since 2019. This class has a median death toll of 5, indicating a high probability of rapid containment due to the availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Median ~5 deaths, with a small sample size (n=3) leading to high variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, where recent outbreaks have been contained quickly due to vaccination.
- **Differences:** The current outbreak has already exceeded the typical size of recent outbreaks, with 45 deaths reported, indicating a failure of initial containment.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Rapid Growth:** The tripling of deaths from 15 to 45 in ~6 weeks suggests a failure of containment, making higher death tolls more likely.
- **High CFR:** A case fatality rate of ~70% suggests healthcare system strain, supporting higher death tolls.
- **Vaccine and Therapeutics Availability:** The presence of vaccines and therapeutics should reduce the death toll compared to historical large outbreaks.
- **Operational Environment:** The Kasaï region's security and trust environment could either hinder or help containment efforts, adding uncertainty.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Start with a low death count prior based on the "Post-Vaccine Era" reference class.
- **Evidence Update:** The rapid growth and high CFR are strong evidence against the prior, shifting the distribution upward.
- **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The median shifts from tens to low-to-mid hundreds (e.g., 150-250 deaths), with a fatter right tail for potential high outcomes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider tail risks and alternative scenarios, such as further escalation due to security issues or a breakthrough in containment efforts.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where containment improves rapidly could result in fewer deaths, but current evidence supports a higher toll.
- **Adjustments:** Ensure the forecast accounts for both the potential for rapid containment and the risk of further escalation.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Calibrated Percentiles:** Based on the analysis, the percentiles reflect the updated distribution with consideration for tail risks and uncertainties.

P20: 100  
P40: 150

# Forecasting Ebola Deaths in DRC Outbreak Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Post-Vaccine Era DRC Outbreaks (2019-Present)**:
- 2021 North Kivu: 6 deaths
- 2022 Équateur: 5 deaths
- 2022 North Kivu: 1 death
- Median: 5 deaths
- This is relevant because it reflects modern containment capabilities with vaccines.

**All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present)**:
- Highly right-skewed distribution
- Median: ~35 deaths
- Mean: ~160 deaths (skewed by major outbreaks like Kivu 2018-2020 with 2,299 deaths)
- This provides historical context but doesn't fully account for modern interventions.

**Outbreaks with >25 Deaths at 6 Weeks**:
- These typically resulted in hundreds or thousands of deaths
- This is particularly relevant as the current outbreak already has 45 deaths at 6 weeks

Given the current outbreak has already reached 45 deaths, I'll use a weighted combination of these reference classes, with more weight on the "Outbreaks with >25 Deaths at 6 Weeks" class. This gives a prior centered around 200-300 deaths, with a wide variance to reflect uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes**:
- Same virus (Ebola Zaire) with similar transmission mechanisms
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure challenges
- Same availability of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine as in recent outbreaks

**Key differences**:
- Already larger than recent post-vaccine outbreaks (45 deaths vs. typical <10)
- High case fatality rate (~70%) compared to the typical 50%, suggesting detection or treatment issues
- Different geographic location (Kasaï vs. Kivu) with potentially different security dynamics
- Only ~2.5 months remain until the resolution date (Jan 1, 2026), limiting potential growth

These differences suggest the current outbreak is more severe than typical post-vaccine outbreaks but may have less time to reach the scale of the largest historical outbreaks.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast higher**:
- Rapid growth from 15 to 45 deaths in ~6 weeks (likelihood ratio ~5:1 favoring larger outbreak)
- High CFR of 70% suggests challenges in early detection/treatment (likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- Failure of initial containment places this in a different category than recent small outbreaks (likelihood ratio ~4:1)

**Evidence pushing forecast lower**:
- Modern vaccines and therapeutics available from the start (likelihood ratio ~1:3)
- Only 2.5 months remain until resolution date, limiting growth potential (likelihood ratio ~1:2)
- Institutional experience from previous outbreaks should improve response (likelihood ratio ~1:1.5)

**Net effect**: The evidence strongly suggests this outbreak will be larger than typical post-vaccine outbreaks but constrained by the short timeframe until resolution.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 200-300 deaths:

**Update based on failed initial containment**:
- Prior: ~250 deaths (median)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring larger outbreak
- Posterior: Shift upward to ~400 deaths (median)

**Update based on high growth rate**:
- Prior: ~400 deaths
- Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 favoring larger outbreak
- Posterior: Shift upward to ~600 deaths (median)

**Update based on time constraint**:
- Prior: ~600 deaths
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:2 (limiting factor)
- Posterior: Shift downward to ~400 deaths (median)

The posterior distribution is centered around 400 deaths, with a wider right tail to account for the possibility of exponential growth.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating how quickly Ebola can spread in the remaining 2.5 months
- The security situation in Kasaï could deteriorate rapidly, hampering response efforts
- I may be overestimating the effectiveness of vaccines if community resistance is high

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Rapid containment scenario**: If contact tracing improves dramatically, deaths might plateau at 100-150 (10% probability)
- **Moderate growth scenario**: Continued steady growth reaching 300-500 deaths (50% probability)
- **Accelerating outbreak scenario**: Spread to urban centers leading to 500-1000+ deaths (35% probability)
- **Catastrophic scenario**: Security breakdown leading to 1000-2000+ deaths (5% probability)

I should widen my distribution to account for these scenarios, particularly extending the right tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 150
P20: 220
P40: 350
P60: 480
P80: 700
P90: 950

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is not all post-vaccine outbreaks, but rather outbreaks that have already demonstrated a failure of initial containment. The current outbreak, with 45 deaths six weeks after declaration, has clearly surpassed the small, quickly-contained outbreaks of 2021-2022 (which had 1-6 deaths each).

Therefore, I select a prior based on the reference class of **"historical DRC Ebola outbreaks that were not immediately contained."** This class includes major events like Yambuku 1976 (280 deaths), Kikwit 1995 (250 deaths), and Kivu 2018-2020 (2,299 deaths). This prior is highly right-skewed, with a median in the mid-to-high 200s and a mean in the high hundreds, reflecting a significant potential for a catastrophic outcome.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current outbreak's trajectory (tripling of deaths in ~6 weeks) is similar to the initial phases of past large outbreaks, indicating that transmission is not under control.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the context. Unlike the 1976 and 1995 outbreaks, we now have highly effective vaccines (rVSV-ZEBOV) and monoclonal antibody treatments. Unlike the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak, which occurred in an active warzone and where these tools were deployed under extreme duress, the response team today has a more established playbook and licensed tools from day one. This is a major factor suggesting a lower potential death toll than the historical precedents. The specific security and community trust environment in Kasaï province is a key unknown but is different from the Kivu warzone.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the prior based on two key pieces of conflicting evidence:

1.  **(↓ Strong Downward Pressure) Full availability of modern tools:** The existence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics from the start of the outbreak makes the worst-case scenarios of the past (like Kivu's >2,000 deaths) significantly less likely. This evidence strongly pulls the entire distribution to the left, suggesting a final toll in the hundreds, not thousands.
2.  **(↑ Moderate Upward Pressure) High initial Case Fatality Rate (CFR):** The reported CFR of ~70% (45 deaths / 64 cases) is very high. This suggests that the modern tools are not being deployed with maximum effectiveness. It could indicate late case detection, overwhelmed treatment facilities, or community reluctance to seek care. This evidence counteracts some of the optimism from the available tools and pushes the distribution back towards higher numbers.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A wide, right-skewed distribution with a median around 280 deaths, based on past failures of containment.
*   **Update 1 (Modern Tools):** I perform a strong downward update. The availability of a full modern toolkit makes a repeat of the Kivu catastrophe much less probable. This shifts my median down significantly, perhaps to the 150-200 range, and dramatically shortens the right tail.
*   **Update 2 (High CFR):** The worrying on-the-ground signal from the high CFR pushes the distribution back up. It suggests that despite our tools, the response is facing serious challenges. I adjust the median upward to the 190-200 range and re-widen the right tail, acknowledging that if the response is failing *despite* modern tools, the outcome could still be severe.

The resulting posterior distribution is centered in the high 100s, remains right-skewed, and has a median significantly lower than the mean.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

A key risk is underestimating the right tail. The primary driver of the Kivu outbreak was not a lack of technology but a lack of access and trust due to conflict. If a similar dynamic emerges in Kasaï, the final death toll could be much higher than my median.

However, a critical constraint is the **short time horizon**. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, which is only about 10 weeks from the date of this forecast (Oct 21, 2025). To reach a catastrophic number like 1,000 deaths, the outbreak would need to accelerate to an average of over 90 deaths per week, a rate characteristic of the peak of a massive epidemic. While possible, this is an extreme scenario. The short timeline provides a strong cap on the plausible upper end of the distribution.

Conversely, an effective response ramp-up could still bring the outbreak under control relatively quickly. A final total below 100 is still possible, though unlikely given the 45 deaths already recorded and the ongoing transmission. My lower percentiles account for this possibility. I will slightly increase my upper percentiles to account for the tail risk of a security breakdown, but the time constraint prevents me from forecasting a Kivu-scale event.
