### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia's "Anti-Presidential Party" Trend:** Since 1977, the party holding the White House has won the Virginia gubernatorial election only once (Terry McAuliffe, D, in 2013). This reference class of 12 elections suggests a base rate of **~92% (11/12) for the non-presidential party's candidate to win**. Assuming a Republican holds the presidency in 2025 (as implied by the background), this provides a strong prior for a Democratic victory. *Limitation: This is a powerful historical trend, but the small sample size (N=12) and changing state demographics warrant caution.*
*   **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (Post-2000):** In the six gubernatorial elections since 2001, Democrats have won four times (2001, 2005, 2017, 2021) and Republicans twice (2009, 2013). This suggests a base rate of **~67% for a Democratic victory**. *Limitation: This period covers different national environments and candidate pairings; it doesn't account for the specific strength of a repeat challenger like Ciattarelli.*
*   **Modern Off-Year Gubernatorial Elections in Blue/Purple States:** In recent off-year elections (e.g., VA 2021, NJ 2021, KY 2023), the national environment and candidate-specific factors have often led to closer-than-expected results or upsets. This class suggests that fundamentals (like state partisanship) can be overcome, and a generic base rate should be treated with skepticism. It points to higher variance than the other reference classes might suggest.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-20] News report highlights tightening NJ race, with affordability as the top voter concern. (↓) — This issue environment favors Republicans and echoes the themes that fueled Jack Ciattarelli's near-upset in 2021.
*   [2025-10-18] Final Virginia gubernatorial debate is held; post-debate polling suggests Spanberger won among undecided voters. (↑) — Reinforces Spanberger's image as a competent, policy-focused candidate, which plays well with crucial suburban moderates.
*   [2025-10-15] A major national Republican figure campaigns with Winsome Earle-Sears in a rural part of Virginia. (↓) — While this may energize the GOP base, it could alienate moderate voters Spanberger is targeting, potentially hurting Earle-Sears in Northern Virginia.
*   [2025-10-12] New Jersey's largest public employee union launches a major get-out-the-vote (GOTV) effort for Mikie Sherrill. (↑) — Democratic-aligned union support is critical for turnout in a blue state, providing organizational muscle in the final weeks.
*   [2025-09-30] Quarterly fundraising reports show Spanberger (VA) with a significant cash-on-hand advantage over Earle-Sears. (↑) — Financial superiority allows for a dominant position in advertising and field operations during the crucial final month.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **National Political Environment:** The performance and popularity of the sitting U.S. President is a primary driver, especially in Virginia. An unpopular president creates a strong headwind for their party's gubernatorial candidate. (Size: Large)
*   **Candidate Quality and Profile:** The perceived moderation, experience, and appeal of the candidates are crucial. Spanberger's ex-CIA, swing-district profile and Ciattarelli's 2021 performance make them formidable candidates, distinct from generic partisans. (Size: Moderate to Large)
*   **State-Specific Partisan Lean:** New Jersey's fundamental blue lean provides a significant structural advantage for any Democratic candidate, creating a higher baseline of support that Republicans must overcome. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Dominant Campaign Issues:** The salience of issues like affordability and taxes (favors GOP) versus abortion rights and threats to democracy (favors Democrats) can shift the electorate's focus and benefit one side. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Suburban Voter Swing:** In both states, but particularly Virginia (Northern Virginia, Richmond suburbs), the preferences of college-educated suburban voters are decisive. Their vote often swings based on which party seems more extreme. (Size: Large)
*   **Turnout Differentials:** Off-year elections have lower turnout. The party that is more successful at mobilizing its base and persuading low-propensity voters has a major advantage. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Virginia: A Uniquely Strong "Curse":** The anti-presidential party trend in Virginia is one of the most consistent in American politics, making it a more powerful predictor than a generic national mood. The 2025 election appears to be a classic test of this trend.
*   **New Jersey: A Proven, Non-Incumbent Challenger:** Unlike a typical challenger, Jack Ciattarelli has already demonstrated statewide appeal and an ability to outperform polls, losing by only ~3 points in 2021. This makes the race far more competitive than the base rate for a generic Republican would suggest.
*   **Both States: Two Women Nominees in Virginia:** The Spanberger vs. Earle-Sears matchup is the first time both major party nominees for Virginia governor are women. This neutralizes gender as a simple factor and introduces complex dynamics, especially with Earle-Sears being the first woman of color elected statewide.
*   **Post-Roe Environment:** Unlike many elections in the reference class period, this election takes place after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This has consistently boosted Democratic performance, especially with suburban women, and may counteract economic headwinds.
*   **Conflicting Recent Data in NJ:** While Ciattarelli's 2021 performance suggests GOP strength, Democrats *expanded* their majority in the 2023 state legislative elections, providing a strong counter-signal that the 2021 result may have been a one-off reaction to the incumbent rather than a lasting realignment.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
This analysis is broken down by state to inform the final multiple-choice probability.

**Virginia (Democrat Win)**
*   **Prior:** Start with the strong reference class of the "anti-presidential party" trend. Prior probability ~85-90% for a Democratic win (equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ small) Candidate quality: Spanberger is a strong, moderate candidate well-suited for Virginia.
    *   (↑ small) Polling and fundraising: Current data shows Spanberger with a consistent lead and financial advantage.
    *   (↓ small) Countervailing factors: Earle-Sears has statewide name recognition as Lt. Governor and a unique profile.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence modestly reinforces the very strong prior. The posterior should remain very high, likely in the **low 90s percentage range**.

**New Jersey (Democrat Win)**
*   **Prior:** Start with the state's blue lean and recent gubernatorial history. Prior probability ~65-70% for a Democratic win (equivalent n ≈ 6).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ moderate) Challenger strength: Ciattarelli's 2021 overperformance is a major piece of evidence suggesting he is an unusually strong Republican candidate for NJ.
    *   (↓ small) Issue environment: Focus on affordability and taxes provides a favorable issue set for the GOP.
    *   (↑ small) Recent electoral counter-signal: Democrats' strong performance in the 2023 legislative elections suggests the party's fundamentals are still robust.
    *   (↑ small) Post-Roe landscape: Abortion remains a potent issue for mobilizing Democratic and independent voters.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly Ciattarelli's proven strength, should significantly pull the posterior **down from the prior**, landing in the **55-65% range**. It's still a race that favors the Democrat, but it is highly competitive.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Democratic wins):**
    *   Final polling averages in VA show Spanberger's lead holding or expanding beyond 5 points.
    *   News reports focus on abortion access as a top-three issue for NJ voters.
    *   High early-voting turnout in Democratic strongholds (Northern Virginia, urban/suburban NJ counties).
    *   Late, high-profile gaffes from Earle-Sears or Ciattarelli tying them to the national GOP's most unpopular positions.
*   **DOWN indicators (disfavoring Democratic wins):**
    *   Final polling averages in NJ show the race within the margin of error or Ciattarelli ahead.
    *   A late-breaking national or local scandal involving a prominent Democrat.
    *   Media narrative solidifies around "economic anxiety" and "affordability crisis" in the final week.
    *   Reports of an "enthusiasm gap" with GOP voters more motivated to turn out than Democrats.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Polling Error:** Off-year gubernatorial polls can be unreliable, as demonstrated by the massive miss in New Jersey in 2021. A similar polling error could be present in either race.
*   **Turnout Uncertainty:** Turnout is the key variable in off-year elections. A failure by either party to mobilize its base could easily flip the expected outcome, especially in the closer NJ

To forecast the outcomes of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Virginia**: The historical trend of Virginia electing a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President is strong. Assuming a Republican president in 2025, the base rate for a Democratic win is approximately 92%. However, considering demographic changes and the small sample size, we'll adjust this to 85% to account for uncertainty.

- **New Jersey**: Historically, Democrats have won 67% of gubernatorial elections since 2001. Given New Jersey's blue lean, we'll start with a base rate of 65% for a Democratic win, acknowledging the competitive nature of the race.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia**: The current scenario aligns with the historical trend, with Spanberger leading in polls and having a financial advantage. However, Earle-Sears' statewide recognition and unique profile introduce some uncertainty.

- **New Jersey**: While the state leans Democratic, Ciattarelli's previous strong performance and the current issue environment (favoring Republicans) make this race more competitive than the base rate suggests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia**:
  - Spanberger's polling lead and financial advantage (↑ small likelihood for Democratic win).
  - Earle-Sears' recognition and GOP base energization (↓ small likelihood for Democratic win).

- **New Jersey**:
  - Ciattarelli's past performance and favorable issue environment (↓ moderate likelihood for Democratic win).
  - Democratic GOTV efforts and post-Roe environment (↑ small likelihood for Democratic win).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia**:
  - Prior odds for Democratic win: 85% / 15% = 5.67
  - Likelihood ratio (considering evidence): Slightly above 1 due to Spanberger's advantages.
  - Posterior odds ≈ 6.0, leading to a posterior probability of about 86%.

- **New Jersey**:
  - Prior odds for Democratic win: 65% / 35% = 1.86
  - Likelihood ratio: Below 1 due to Ciattarelli's strengths, around 0.8.
  - Posterior odds ≈ 1.49, leading to a posterior probability of about 60%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Virginia**: Consider the possibility of polling errors or unexpected turnout patterns. Adjusting for these, the probability might slightly decrease, but remains high.

- **New Jersey**: Acknowledge the potential for a polling miss or strong Republican turnout. Adjusting for these, the probability might decrease further.

### 6. Final Normalization

- **Both elections**: Probability of both states going Democratic is the product of individual probabilities: 86% * 60% = 51.6%.
- **Only Virginia**: 86% - 51.6% = 34.4%.
- **Only New Jersey**: 60% - 51.6% = 8.4%.
- **Neither election**: 100% - (51.6% + 34.4% + 8.4%) = 5.6%.

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 52%  
Only Virginia: 34%  
Only New Jersey: 8%  
Neither election: 6%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and historical trends, with adjustments for potential uncertainties and competitive dynamics in each race.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical base rate: Virginia has elected governors from the opposite party of the sitting president in 11 out of 12 elections since 1977 (~92%).
- Assuming a Republican president in 2025 (as implied in the research report), this suggests a strong prior of ~90% for a Democratic win.
- Recent polling shows Spanberger leading, reinforcing this prior.

**New Jersey:**
- Since 2001, Democrats have won 4 of 6 gubernatorial elections (~67%).
- New Jersey is generally considered a reliably blue state, though it had a Republican governor as recently as 2018.
- Base rate for Democratic win: ~65%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Virginia continues to follow its pattern of electing governors from the opposite party of the president.
- New Jersey maintains its general Democratic lean in statewide elections.
- Both states have term-limited incumbents, creating open races.

**Differences from base rate scenarios:**
- Virginia: Both major candidates are women (first time in state history), neutralizing gender as a factor.
- New Jersey: Republican candidate Ciattarelli is a repeat challenger who nearly won in 2021 (48%), making him stronger than a typical GOP candidate.
- Post-Roe environment may boost Democratic performance compared to historical patterns.
- Current polling shows Democrats leading in both states, which aligns with Virginia's pattern but suggests New Jersey may be more secure for Democrats than the base rate indicates.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia Evidence:**
- Polling shows Spanberger leading (P(E|Dem wins) = high, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Spanberger won the final debate among undecided voters (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Spanberger has significant cash advantage (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Major Republican figure campaigning with Earle-Sears could alienate moderates (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = moderate)

**New Jersey Evidence:**
- Polling shows Sherrill leading (P(E|Dem wins) = high, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Race is tightening with affordability as top voter concern (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = high)
- Largest public employee union launched GOTV effort for Sherrill (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = low)
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (P(E|Dem wins) = moderate, P(E|Dem loses) = high)
- Democrats expanded their majority in 2023 state legislative elections (P(E|Dem wins) = high, P(E|Dem loses) = low)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia Update:**
- Prior: 90% chance of Democratic win
- Key evidence: Polling lead + debate performance + cash advantage
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 in favor of Democratic win
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (90/10) × 3 = 27:1
- Posterior probability = 27/(27+1) ≈ 96%

**New Jersey Update:**
- Prior: 65% chance of Democratic win
- Key evidence: Ciattarelli's 2021 performance + tightening race on affordability issues
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7:1 (slightly against Democratic win)
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (65/35) × 0.7 ≈ 1.3:1
- Posterior probability = 1.3/(1.3+1) ≈ 57%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polling error: Off-year elections often have polling misses. In 2021, polls underestimated Republican strength in both VA and NJ.
- Turnout uncertainty: Low turnout in off-year elections makes results more volatile.
- Late developments: We're still weeks from the election; late-breaking news could shift either race.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Virginia's anti-presidential party pattern could break if national environment strongly favors Republicans.
- New Jersey could see higher Republican turnout if economic issues dominate, similar to 2021's close race.
- Third-party candidates could affect margins in close races.

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce confidence in Virginia (96% → 92%) to account for polling uncertainty.
- Slightly increase New Jersey Democratic win probability (57% → 60%) to account for the state's fundamental blue lean and recent Democratic legislative success.

## 6. Final Normalization

Calculating joint probabilities for the four possible outcomes:
- Both Democratic wins: 92% × 60% = 55.2%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 92% × 40% = 36.8%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: 8% × 60% = 4.8%
- Neither Democratic win: 8% × 40% = 3.2%

These sum to 100%, so no further normalization is needed.

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 55%
Only Virginia: 37%
Only New Jersey: 5%
Neither election: 3%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To determine the probabilities for the combined outcomes, I will first establish a prior probability for a Democratic win in each state individually.

*   **Virginia:** The most relevant base rate is Virginia's strong historical trend of electing a governor from the party opposite the sitting U.S. President. Since 1977, this has occurred in 11 of 12 elections. The background information ("...which bodes well for Spanberger") implies that the sitting president in 2025 is a Republican. Therefore, the base rate for a Democratic victory in Virginia is approximately **92% (11/12)**.
*   **New Jersey:** A suitable base rate is the outcome of recent gubernatorial elections in this blue-leaning state. Since 2001, Democrats have won 4 out of 6 races. This provides a prior probability for a Democratic victory of approximately **67% (4/6)**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Virginia:** The current election is a classic test of the historical trend. A key difference from many elections in the reference class is the post-Roe political environment, which has consistently benefited Democratic candidates, particularly in suburban areas crucial to winning Virginia.
*   **New Jersey:** While the state's blue lean provides a favorable backdrop for Democrats, this case is unusual due to the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli. His very strong performance in 2021, where he lost by only 3 points, shows he is a much more formidable challenger than a generic Republican, making this race more competitive than the base rate would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the prior for each state based on the specific evidence provided.

**Virginia (P(Democrat Win))**
*   **Prior:** ~92%
*   **Key Evidence:**
    *   **Candidate Quality (↑):** Abigail Spanberger is a strong, moderate candidate with a history of winning in competitive districts, a profile well-suited for Virginia.
    *   **Polling & Fundraising (↑):** The report indicates Spanberger has a lead in the polls and a significant financial advantage, both strong positive indicators.
    *   **Post-Roe Environment (↑):** The salience of abortion rights provides a powerful tailwind for Democrats, reinforcing their advantage with key suburban demographics.
*   **Posterior Update:** The evidence strongly reinforces the already very high prior. The combination of the historical trend, a strong candidate, and a favorable issue environment makes a Democratic win highly probable. I will adjust the probability slightly downward from the raw base rate to account for inherent electoral uncertainty, setting the final probability at **P(D_VA) = 90%**.

**New Jersey (P(Democrat Win))**
*   **Prior:** ~67%
*   **Key Evidence:**
    *   **Challenger Strength (↓↓):** Jack Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting he is an unusually strong Republican candidate for New Jersey. This significantly lowers the probability of a Democratic win compared to the base rate.
    *   **2023 Election Results (↑↑):** As a strong counterpoint, Democrats expanded their legislative majorities in 2023, suggesting the 2021 result may have been an anomaly related to the incumbent and national mood, and that the state's underlying blue lean remains robust.
    *   **Issue Environment (↓):** The focus on "affordability" is a headwind for the Democratic candidate, as this issue typically favors Republicans.
    *   **Candidate & Party Strength (↑):** Mikie Sherrill is a strong candidate, and the Democratic party has significant organizational support from unions, which is critical in a lower-turnout, off-year election.
*   **Posterior Update:** The evidence is conflicting. Ciattarelli's proven strength makes the race highly competitive. However, the 2023 results and other Democratic advantages suggest the party still holds an edge. The prior of 67% is too high. A significant downward adjustment is needed. I assess the final probability as **P(D_NJ) = 60%**, reflecting a race where the Democrat is favored but an upset is very plausible.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior for Combined Outcomes)

Assuming the two elections are independent events, I can combine the individual probabilities to find the probability of each of the four options.
*   P(Democrat wins VA) = 0.90
*   P(Democrat wins NJ) = 0.60
*   P(Republican wins VA) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10
*   P(Republican wins NJ) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40

*   **P(Both elections):** P(D_VA) × P(D_NJ) = 0.90 × 0.60 = 0.54
*   **P(Only Virginia):** P(D_VA) × P(R_NJ) = 0.90 × 0.40 = 0.36
*   **P(Only New Jersey):** P(R_VA) × P(D_NJ) = 0.10 × 0.60 = 0.06
*   **P(Neither election):** P(R_VA) × P(R_NJ) = 0.10 × 0.40 = 0.04

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast's biggest vulnerability is the assumption of independence. A national political wave could cause both outcomes to correlate. For example, a "red wave" would make the "Neither" outcome more likely than 4%. However, the individual dynamics of each race—the strong historical trend in Virginia and the specific candidate matchup in New Jersey—are powerful enough that the independence assumption is a reasonable approximation. The high probability (36%) assigned to a split decision ("Only Virginia") already accounts for the significant possibility of a Republican win in the more competitive New Jersey race. The forecast seems robust.

### 6. Final Normalization

The calculated probabilities sum to 100% (54% + 36% + 6% + 4% = 100%). No normalization is needed.

Both elections: 54%
Only Virginia: 36%
Only New Jersey: 6%
Neither election: 4%
