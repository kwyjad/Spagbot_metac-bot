### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Second Attempt at Orbital Booster Propulsive Landing:** This is the most specific and relevant class. The only company to have attempted this is SpaceX with the Falcon 9. Their first landing attempt (Jan 2015) failed due to hydraulic fluid depletion. Their second attempt (Apr 2015) also failed due to a sticky valve. Their first success came on their third sea-landing attempt (eighth flight with landing legs). This suggests a very low base rate for success on the second-ever attempt.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0-10%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Based on the only available data point (N=1, SpaceX), the success rate is 0%. A small allowance is made for randomness and potential differences.
    *   **Limitations:** Extremely small sample size. Technological and organizational differences between Blue Origin and early SpaceX could make this comparison less reliable.

2.  **Maiden Flight of a New Landing System/Procedure:** This class considers any new major landing system's first few uses. This could include the Space Shuttle's first landings or experimental X-planes. These systems often experience issues in early operational use before achieving high reliability.
    *   **Base Rate:** 20-40%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Early attempts with complex new aerospace systems often reveal unknown unknowns. While component-level testing is extensive, full system integration under flight conditions is the ultimate test. This rate is higher than Class 1 as it broadens the scope beyond a single competitor.
    *   **Limitations:** The analogy is imperfect. Propulsive rocket landing is a unique challenge with different failure modes than winged vehicle landings.

3.  **Blue Origin's Own Reusability Program (New Shepard):** Blue Origin has extensive experience with its suborbital New Shepard booster, which also performs vertical propulsive landings. After an initial failure on its first attempt in 2015, the subsequent booster flew and landed successfully five times, and the program has achieved over 20 successful landings in total.
    *   **Base Rate (for success after one failure):** >90%.
    *   **Reasoning:** The company has demonstrated mastery of the core principles of propulsive landing and a "learn from failure" capability within its own hardware ecosystem.
    *   **Limitations:** New Glenn is an orbital-class rocket. The booster is vastly larger, heavier, and experiences much higher velocities and atmospheric stresses. The landing profile is significantly more complex than New Shepard's, making this a very optimistic reference class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** New Glenn booster "Never Tell Me The Odds" rolls out to the launch pad. — ↑ — A critical pre-launch milestone, indicating hardware is ready and the launch campaign is proceeding. This makes a 2025 launch more tangible.
*   **2025-08-15** Launch target slips from "no earlier than Aug. 15" to "no earlier than Sep. 29". — ↓ — Continues a pattern of delays, shrinking the available window to launch before the end of 2025.
*   **2025-06-10** CEO Dave Limp announces a launch target of "no earlier than August 15". — ↓ — Represents a delay from the initial "spring 2025" target mentioned in other reports, reinforcing the company's flexible (and delayed) scheduling.
*   **2025-01-16** New Glenn's first flight successfully reaches orbit but fails the booster landing. — ↑/↓ — Mixed result. Proves the rocket's core systems work (a major hurdle), but also provides the first data point of a landing failure. Crucially, it provides invaluable data for correcting issues on the second attempt.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Technical Learning from First Flight:** Blue Origin now has a complete set of flight data from a full launch and landing attempt. The ability of their engineers to correctly diagnose the cause of the January 2025 landing failure and implement effective fixes is the single largest driver of success. (Size: Large)
2.  **Corporate Culture ("Gradatim Ferociter"):** Blue Origin's "step-by-step, ferociously" motto and cautious approach means they are unlikely to launch until they have very high confidence in their fixes. This increases the probability of a successful landing *if they launch*, but also increases the probability of a delay past 2025 if any issues are found in testing. (Size: Large)
3.  **Engine & Hardware Reliability:** The seven BE-4 engines must perform flawlessly through ascent, then a subset must successfully relight in flight for the boostback and landing burns. The performance of grid fins, landing legs, and guidance systems is also critical. A failure in any single component could cause a landing failure. (Size: Large)
4.  **Launch Window & Weather:** The launch must occur before Dec 31, 2025. The timeline is already tight. Any further technical delays, coupled with unfavorable weather at the launch site or the landing zone in the Atlantic, could push the attempt into 2026. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **NASA Mission Pressure:** The payload is NASA's EscaPADE mission to Mars. Planetary missions have specific launch windows. This could exert pressure on Blue Origin to launch within the required timeframe, potentially influencing their risk tolerance. However, NASA is also typically risk-averse with its payloads. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extensive Suborbital Experience:** Unlike SpaceX when they first attempted Falcon 9 landings, Blue Origin has years of successful, repeated suborbital booster landing experience with New Shepard. This provides a deep well of institutional knowledge on guidance, control, and engine throttling.
*   **Data from a Full Landing Attempt:** Blue Origin is not going in blind. They have data from the NG-1 attempt, which reportedly made it through most of the landing profile before failing. This is a much better starting point than a purely theoretical one.
*   **A More Mature Industry:** Blue Origin operates in a world where propulsive landing has been proven possible and is done routinely by a competitor. The fundamental physics and engineering challenges are better understood across the industry than they were in 2015.
*   **Cautious vs. "Iterate Fast" Culture:** The primary reference class (SpaceX) had a philosophy of rapid, iterative testing in public, accepting frequent failures as a learning cost. Blue Origin's more methodical, secretive, and cautious approach means this second attempt is likely the result of a much longer and more thorough internal review process than SpaceX's second attempt was.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The most relevant reference class is "second attempt at orbital booster landing," which suggests a very low probability. A reasonable starting point, anchored on this difficult task, would be a prior around **25%** (equivalent n≈4), acknowledging the difficulty but giving some credit for this not being a completely new concept.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Blue Origin's extensive and successful New Shepard landing program demonstrates mastery of the core concepts, a significant advantage over the reference class.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The first New Glenn flight successfully reached orbit, proving the vehicle's fundamental viability and providing critical data from the failed landing attempt to learn from.
    *   ↑ (Small): The booster is physically at the launch pad, a strong signal that the launch campaign is in its final stages and an attempt in 2025 is the clear intent.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The consistent pattern of schedule slips throughout 2025 suggests that the timeline is fragile and further delays pushing the launch into 2026 are a significant risk.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The core task remains exceptionally difficult, with many potential single points of failure (engine relight, guidance, hardware deployment).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests Blue Origin is more capable than the N=1 reference class (SpaceX in 2015) would imply. The successful New Shepard program and data from the first flight are powerful positive updates. However, the risk of a schedule slip past the deadline is also very real. The posterior should move **moderately upwards** from the low prior, but be capped by the significant schedule risk.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a firm launch date in November 2025.
    *   Successful completion of a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR).
    *   Successful static fire test of the booster on the pad.
    *   Landing vessel *Jacklyn* leaves port and heads to the recovery zone.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any announcement of a new delay, particularly one pushing the target to "December" or "late 2025".
    *   The booster is rolled back from the launch pad to the integration facility for non-weather reasons.
    *   Scrubbed static fire or WDR attempts without a quick resolution.
    *   Statements from NASA or Blue Origin that de-emphasize the 2025 launch target.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Ambiguity of "Successful Landing":** The resolution criteria require a "successful landing." This is assumed to mean a soft touchdown on the drone ship where the booster remains upright and recoverable. A hard landing that destroys the booster, or a soft water landing, would not count.
*   **Private Company Opacity:** Blue Origin is not a public company and shares information selectively. Public statements about readiness and confidence may not fully reflect internal technical assessments.
*   **Fictional Scenario Data:** The provided sources are dated in the future. This analysis is based entirely on the world described in those snippets and assumes their veracity within the context of the question.
*   **Small N Problem:** The primary reference class has a sample size of one, making any statistical inference extremely weak. The forecast relies heavily on qualitative factors and analogies to other programs.
*   **Schedule Fragility:** With only ~10 weeks left in the year, the schedule has very little slack. A single technical issue or a prolonged period of bad weather could easily push the launch into 2026.

**Final Research Summary:** Blue Origin possesses the foundational experience from its New Shepard program and crucial flight data from its first attempt to make a successful landing plausible. However, the extreme technical difficulty of the task, combined with a demonstrated history of schedule delays, creates a significant risk that the attempt will either fail or be pushed into 2026.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the "second attempt at orbital booster landing," which suggests a very low probability of success. SpaceX's experience indicates a 0% success rate on the second attempt, but given Blue Origin's extensive experience with New Shepard, a more generous prior of **25%** is reasonable. This acknowledges the difficulty but also credits Blue Origin's experience and data from the first attempt.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both SpaceX and Blue Origin are attempting propulsive landings of orbital-class boosters. The task's inherent difficulty is a common factor.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience and data from a previous orbital attempt, which SpaceX did not have at the time of their second attempt. Blue Origin's cautious approach contrasts with SpaceX's rapid iteration, potentially leading to a more refined second attempt.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Blue Origin's New Shepard Experience**: Increases probability. The successful history of New Shepard landings suggests competence in propulsive landing technology. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Data from First New Glenn Flight**: Increases probability. Provides valuable insights into failure modes and potential fixes. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Launch Pad Readiness**: Increases probability. Indicates progress towards a 2025 launch. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Schedule Delays**: Decreases probability. Persistent delays suggest a risk of slipping into 2026. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Technical Complexity**: Decreases probability. The inherent difficulty of the task and potential single points of failure remain significant. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 25% = 1:3
   - Evidence updates:
     - New Shepard experience and first flight data significantly increase odds.
     - Launch pad readiness provides a moderate increase.
     - Schedule delays and technical complexity provide moderate decreases.
   - Posterior odds: Adjusting for evidence, the odds might increase to approximately 2:3.
   - Posterior probability: (2/3) / (1 + 2/3) = 40%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate Blue Origin's ability to translate suborbital success to orbital landings.
   - Alternative scenario: A delay into 2026 is plausible given historical delays and technical challenges.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unforeseen technical issues or weather delays.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering all factors, including Blue Origin's experience, data from the first attempt, and the risk of delays, the final probability is adjusted to reflect a moderate chance of success before 2026.

Final: 40%

# Probability Analysis: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" Launch and Land Successfully Before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider the probability of Blue Origin successfully launching and landing their "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster before the end of 2025.

The most relevant reference class is "second attempt at orbital booster propulsive landing." In this class, we have limited data:
- SpaceX's second attempt at landing a Falcon 9 booster failed
- However, Blue Origin has extensive experience with suborbital landings via New Shepard

Given the technical difficulty and limited precedent, I'll start with a prior of **25%**. This reflects:
- The inherent difficulty of the task (orbital-class booster landing)
- Blue Origin's experience with landing technology (albeit at a smaller scale)
- The fact that this is a second attempt, with data from the first failure

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like SpaceX's early attempts, this is an early-stage orbital booster landing attempt
- The physics challenges of deceleration, guidance, and propulsive landing remain similar
- The company has experienced one failure and is attempting to learn from it

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard (>20 successful landings)
- The industry now has proven that orbital booster landings are possible (SpaceX does it routinely)
- Blue Origin has a more cautious approach than SpaceX did, suggesting more thorough preparation
- The first New Glenn flight successfully reached orbit, proving the core vehicle works
- The timeline is tight with only ~10 weeks remaining in 2025

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Blue Origin's New Shepard landing experience**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If they succeed with New Glenn, their New Shepard experience would be a contributing factor
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if they fail, they still have this experience
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (positive update)
- This significantly increases the probability of success, as they have institutional knowledge of propulsive landing

**Evidence 2: First New Glenn reached orbit but failed landing**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A successful second landing would likely follow a partially successful first attempt
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Even if they fail again, the first flight reaching orbit is expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (small positive update)
- This provides crucial flight data but also confirms landing difficulties

**Evidence 3: Pattern of schedule delays throughout 2025**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even successful programs experience some delays
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Continued delays are more consistent with technical challenges
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63 (negative update)
- This suggests potential timeline risk pushing beyond 2025

**Evidence 4: Booster has rolled out to the launch pad**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - This would be expected before a successful launch
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Even unsuccessful attempts typically reach this milestone
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.36 (positive update)
- This increases confidence in a 2025 launch attempt

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability of 25% (prior odds of 1:3)

First update (New Shepard experience):
- Prior odds: 1:3 (0.25 probability)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 1.8:3 = 0.6:1
- Posterior probability: 0.6/(1+0.6) = 37.5%

Second update (First flight partial success):
- Prior odds: 0.6:1 (0.375 probability)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14
- Posterior odds: 0.684:1
- Posterior probability: 0.684/(1+0.684) = 40.6%

Third update (Schedule delays pattern):
- Prior odds: 0.684:1 (0.406 probability)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 0.431:1
- Posterior probability: 0.431/(1+0.431) = 30.1%

Fourth update (Booster at launch pad):
- Prior odds: 0.431:1 (0.301 probability)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.36
- Posterior odds: 0.586:1
- Posterior probability: 0.586/(1+0.586) = 36.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating Blue Origin's ability to transfer New Shepard landing experience to the much larger New Glenn
- The timeline constraint (only ~10 weeks left in 2025) may be more severe than I've accounted for
- Blue Origin's cautious culture could lead to further delays if any issues are found
- Weather risks in November/December could further constrain launch opportunities
- I may be underestimating the technical complexity of landing an orbital-class booster

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Optimistic view: Blue Origin has learned exactly what went wrong on the first attempt and has a clear fix, putting them in a much better position than my reference class suggests (~60% chance)
- Pessimistic view: The landing technology for New Glenn is fundamentally more challenging than anticipated, and one attempt is insufficient to resolve all issues (~15% chance)

**Adjustments:**
- The timeline constraint deserves more weight - with only ~10 weeks left and a history of delays, the risk of slipping to 2026 is substantial
- I should slightly reduce my probability to account for this constraint

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launching before 2026 and successfully landing is approximately 35%.

This reflects:
- Blue Origin's valuable experience with New Shepard landings
- Data from their first orbital attempt
- The booster being at the launch pad (positive sign for 2025 launch)
- Their cautious approach which increases landing success probability if they launch
- The significant time constraint with only ~10 weeks remaining in 2025
- The inherent technical difficulty of orbital-class booster landings

Final: 35%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event requires two conditions to be met: a launch before 2026 and a successful landing. I will analyze these components separately. The most challenging part is the successful landing, so I will select a base rate for that.

The most relevant reference class is **"second attempt at an orbital-class booster propulsive landing on a sea platform."** The only company to have done this is SpaceX with the Falcon 9.
-   SpaceX's first sea landing attempt (Jan 2015) failed.
-   SpaceX's second sea landing attempt (Apr 2015) also failed.
-   Their first success came on their fifth sea landing attempt.

Based on this N=1 reference class, the success rate on a second attempt is 0%. However, using a 0% base rate is too extreme. A more reasonable approach is to use a broader class like **"early attempts of a novel, complex aerospace maneuver,"** which historically have low but non-zero success rates.

I will set the initial prior probability for a successful landing at **25%**. This acknowledges the extreme difficulty demonstrated by the most direct analogue (SpaceX) while allowing for the possibility of success. This is equivalent to prior odds of 1:3 against success.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation with Blue Origin's New Glenn differs from the base case of SpaceX's early Falcon 9 attempts in several crucial ways:

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental task is the same: performing a series of complex burns and aerodynamic maneuvers to land a massive orbital-class first stage on a small, moving platform in the ocean. The physics and engineering challenges are directly comparable.
*   **Differences (Pro-Success):**
    1.  **Suborbital Experience:** Unlike SpaceX in 2015, Blue Origin has extensive, direct experience with propulsive landing via its New Shepard program, which has over 20 successful landings. This provides invaluable institutional knowledge in Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and engine throttling.
    2.  **Data from First Attempt:** Blue Origin has a complete set of flight data from the failed landing attempt in January 2025. This allows them to diagnose the specific failure mode and implement a targeted fix, which is a much better position than starting from pure theory.
    3.  **Mature Industry:** The aerospace industry now has a decade of public knowledge about how propulsive landing works, including lessons from SpaceX's successes and failures.
*   **Differences (Anti-Success/Schedule):**
    1.  **Cautious Culture:** Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" motto implies a slow, methodical approach. While this increases confidence in a fix *if they launch*, it also makes them more likely to delay the launch into 2026 if any new issues arise during pre-flight testing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will first estimate the probability of a successful landing, conditional on a launch occurring in 2025, and then estimate the probability of the launch itself happening in 2025.

**A. Probability of Successful Landing (Conditional on Launch)**

*   **Prior:** 25% (Odds: 1:3)
*   **Evidence 1: New Shepard Program Success.** This is strong positive evidence. A company with a proven track record in the core technology (propulsive landing) is far more likely to succeed than one without. P(E|H) is much higher than P(E|~H). I'll apply a likelihood ratio of approximately 3x to the odds.
*   **Evidence 2: Data from NG-1 Failure & Cautious Culture.** The fact that they have diagnosed the first failure and are confident enough to proceed to a second launch attempt is a positive signal. This suggests they believe the problem is solved. This is a moderate positive update. I'll apply a likelihood ratio of approximately 1.5x.

**B. Probability of Launch in 2025**

This is not a base rate problem but an estimation based on current facts.
*   **Current Date:** 2025-10-21, leaving ~10 weeks in the year.
*   **Positive Evidence:** The booster is on the launch pad (as of Oct 8), a major milestone indicating the launch campaign is in its final phase. The payload is a NASA Mars mission (EscaPADE), which has a limited launch window, creating strong pressure to launch on time.
*   **Negative Evidence:** Blue Origin has a consistent history of schedule slips (from spring to August to September). Key milestones like a Wet Dress Rehearsal and static fire are yet to be completed. Their cautious culture favors delays over taking risks.
*   **Assessment:** The schedule is tight. Any significant technical issue or prolonged bad weather could easily push the launch into 2026. I estimate a **60%** chance of the launch occurring before the end of the year.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will first update the probability of a successful landing, then combine it with the probability of a timely launch.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds for Landing Success:** 1:3 (25% probability).
2.  **Update for New Shepard Experience (LR ≈ 3):**
    *   Posterior Odds = 1:3 × 3 = 3:3 = 1:1.
    *   This updates the probability to 50%.
3.  **Update for NG-1 Data & Culture (LR ≈ 1.5):**
    *   This evidence is somewhat captured by the first update, as their culture drove the New Shepard program. To be conservative, I will not apply a full second update but will use the 50% figure as a robust estimate. A coin-flip chance feels appropriate, balancing their significant experience against the immense, demonstrated difficulty of the task.
    *   **P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025) ≈ 50%**

4.  **Combine Probabilities:**
    *   The question requires both events to happen: Launch in 2025 AND Successful Landing.
    *   P(Total Success) = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025)
    *   P(Total Success) = 60% × 50% = 0.60 × 0.50 = 0.30

The resulting posterior probability is 30%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast could be wrong if I am misjudging either component.
*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (>30%):** I might be underweighting the combination of New Shepard experience and the specific data from the first flight. Perhaps the problem was simple, the fix is robust, and their GNC is so mature that success is highly likely (>70%). I might also be too pessimistic about the schedule; the Mars window could force them to accelerate their processes, making a 2025 launch more certain (>80%). This could push the final probability to 50% or higher.
*   **Argument for a Lower Probability (<30%):** I might be overweighting the New Shepard experience. The energies and flight environment of an orbital return are an entirely different class of problem. SpaceX's repeated early failures are a testament to this. The true probability of landing success might only be 30%. Furthermore, Blue Origin's history strongly suggests delays are more likely than not, so the chance of a 2025 launch could be less than 50%. This would push the final probability below 15%.

My 30% forecast sits between these two poles. It acknowledges Blue Origin's capabilities but respects the dual challenges of extreme technical difficulty and a very tight schedule.

### 6. Final Forecast

The final probability is the product of the probability of the launch occurring in 2025 (estimated at 60%) and the probability of the landing being successful on that attempt (estimated at 50%). This results in a combined probability of 30%.

Final: 30%
