### Reference class & base rates
-   **The Open Zone Map List (2021-Present):** The most specific reference class is the list of charter cities on the Open Zone Map itself. In October 2021, it listed 29 cities. A direct check of the map today (November 2025) shows the number remains 29. This implies a base rate of change of **zero cities per year** over the last four years. This is the strongest reference class as it pertains directly to the resolution source.
-   **New Special Economic Zones (SEZs):** Charter cities are a specialized subset of SEZs. Globally, hundreds of SEZs are planned or under construction at any time, with dozens becoming operational each year. However, the charter city definition ("large zone...commercial and residential district, and its own school") is far stricter. The SEZ growth rate provides a very loose, high-end ceiling for potential additions, but the conversion rate to the charter city definition is likely extremely low.
-   **Large-Scale Greenfield City Projects:** This class includes projects like NEOM (Saudi Arabia) or Forest City (Malaysia). The base rate for such projects moving from announcement to a state of completion that would satisfy the resolution criteria (including a school) is exceptionally low, taking 5-15 years on average. The number of such projects completed globally per year is in the single digits, likely <3.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-28** Direct check of the Open Zone Map reveals 29 charter cities, a number unchanged since its launch data in October 2021. (↓ volatility) — The resolution source has been completely static, suggesting a high bar for additions or removals.
-   **2025-06-02** Free Cities Foundation article confirms ongoing legal and political uncertainty for the three Honduran ZEDEs following the 2022 law repeal. (↓) — Increases the small but non-zero chance of de-listing for 3 of the 29 cities, though their physical operations continue.
-   **2024-05-01** CCI's 2023 Annual Report highlights progress on policy and legal frameworks in Africa (Malawi, Kenya). (↑ long-term) — Shows a pipeline of potential future cities, but these are upstream activities unlikely to result in a completed city by Jan 2026.
-   **2024-01-01** Academic paper notes that despite political opposition in Honduras, existing agreements protect projects like Próspera. (↔) — Mitigates the immediate risk of the Honduran ZEDEs being shut down, making their de-listing from the map less likely.
-   **2023-Late** Ciudad Morazán (Honduras ZEDE) began a new phase of construction despite political headwinds. (↔) — Demonstrates resilience of existing projects, counterbalancing the risk of their removal from the list.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Host Nation Political Will:** The single most important factor. A supportive government can enable a project (e.g., Zambia's presidential endorsement), while a hostile one can effectively kill it (e.g., Honduras ZEDE law repeal). **(Large)**
-   **Capital Investment & Viability:** Charter cities are massive, capital-intensive undertakings. Securing funding from VCs like Pronomos Capital or state actors is critical, but projects must also prove economically viable to continue construction. **(Large)**
-   **Construction & Development Timelines:** Building a new city with commercial, residential, and educational infrastructure from a greenfield site is a multi-year, often decade-long, process. This acts as a powerful brake on the rate of new city creation. **(Large)**
-   **Adrianople Group's Curation Process:** The resolution depends entirely on the map's maintainers. Their methodology, update frequency, and definition of "charter city" are the direct levers. A batch update or definitional change could alter the number instantly. **(Moderate)**
-   **Geopolitical Stability:** Regional conflicts or economic crises can halt development and investment, posing a significant risk to nascent projects. **(Moderate)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Resolution Source Specificity:** Unlike forecasting the "true" number of cities, this question is tied to a single, specific, and seemingly static database. This makes the data curation process of the Adrianople Group more important than on-the-ground reality.
-   **Extreme Political Polarization:** The charter city concept is politically contentious, framed as both a tool for prosperity and a "neoliberal experiment." This is more pronounced than for typical SEZs, as seen in the Honduran case, creating higher political risk.
-   **Long Gestation Period vs. Short Horizon:** The base rate of city creation is measured in years or decades. The forecast horizon is approximately one month. This mismatch makes the probability of a new, qualifying city being built *and added to the map* within the timeframe exceptionally low.
-   **Concentrated Ecosystem:** The charter city movement is driven by a small number of key organizations (e.g., CCI, Pronomos, Adrianople Group). This means developments are highly correlated and can be tracked via these central nodes.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** An initial prior based on the 2021 announcement might be centered on 29, but with significant uncertainty allowing for growth (e.g., a Poisson distribution with λ≈30-32, equivalent n of ~5).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓↓↓) Four years of complete stasis (0 additions, 0 removals) on the resolution map. This is overwhelmingly strong evidence against volatility.
    -   (↓) Political repeal of the ZEDE law in Honduras, creating a persistent, though unrealized, risk of removal for 3 cities.
    -   (↓) Evidence from CCI reports that African projects are in very early, non-physical stages (policy/legal), confirming the long lead times.
    -   (↔) Resilience of existing Honduran ZEDEs, which continue to build, counteracting the de-listing risk.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior should collapse dramatically around the current number, 29. The probability assigned to any other number should be very small. The mean should shift slightly below 29 to account for the small de-listing risk, but the variance reduction is the primary update.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   The Adrianople Group or Open Zone Map announces a "major data update" or new methodology.
    -   A project not currently on the list (e.g., in Zambia or Nigeria) has a major opening ceremony and announces its first school is operational.
    -   The Open Zone Map website undergoes a significant redesign, suggesting a data refresh.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The Honduran government or judiciary issues a definitive ruling to halt or expropriate the existing ZEDEs.
    -   The Open Zone Map website shows a "last updated" date in the near future, indicating a potential data review.
    -   Press reports indicate a listed charter city project has failed or stalled indefinitely.
    -   The Open Zone Map becomes inaccessible or shows clear signs of being unmaintained.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **The Map IS the Territory:** The resolution depends exclusively on the Open Zone Map's list on a specific date. On-the-ground facts are irrelevant if not reflected on the map.
-   **Lumpy Data Updates:** The four-year stasis could mean an update is overdue. The Adrianople Group could perform a batch update, adding or removing several cities at once, though this is unlikely in the next month without a prior announcement.
-   **Definitional Drift:** The Adrianople Group could refine its definition of "charter city," causing existing entries to be reclassified as SEZs or vice-versa, leading to a sudden change.
-   **Ambiguity of "School":** The criterion "and its own school" is ambiguous. It could mean anything from a small primary school to a full K-12 campus, and the map's curators may apply this standard inconsistently.
-   **Website Failure:** The resolution becomes ambiguous if the map goes offline. While unlikely, it's a non-zero risk for any single-source resolution criterion.

**Final Research Summary:** The number of charter cities on the Open Zone Map has been static at 29 for over four years. Given the extremely short time to resolution (~1 month) and the multi-year timelines for city development, the probability of a new city being added is negligible, while the risk of an existing one being removed is low but non-zero.

To forecast the number of charter cities that will exist by 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the number of charter cities listed on the Open Zone Map, which has remained at 29 since October 2021. This suggests a base rate of zero net change per year. The mean of this base rate is 29, with a variance reflecting the potential for minor changes due to political or definitional shifts.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the base case in that the Open Zone Map has shown no change in the number of charter cities for four years. Differences include the political uncertainty in Honduras, which could lead to a reduction, and ongoing developments in Africa, which might eventually lead to additions, though likely not within the forecast horizon.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The static nature of the Open Zone Map (↓↓↓) strongly suggests no change.
   - Political uncertainty in Honduras (↓) slightly increases the likelihood of a decrease.
   - New developments in Africa (↑ long-term) are unlikely to impact the number by January 2026.
   - The resilience of existing projects in Honduras (↔) mitigates immediate risks of removal.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 29, the overwhelming evidence of stasis leads to a posterior distribution that is tightly clustered around 29. The small risk of de-listing due to political issues in Honduras slightly shifts the mean below 29, but the variance is reduced due to the strong evidence of no change.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of potential blind spots includes the possibility of a sudden update to the Open Zone Map or a definitional change. However, given the short timeframe, these scenarios are unlikely. The best alternative forecast might consider a slight increase if a new city were added, but this is not supported by current evidence.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the percentiles are tightly clustered around 29, with a slight skew towards a decrease due to political risks in Honduras.

P10: 28  
P20: 28  
P40: 29  
P60: 29  
P80: 29  
P90: 29

# Forecasting the Number of Charter Cities by 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the Open Zone Map's current count of charter cities, which is 29 as of November 2025. This is the most appropriate base rate because:

- The question explicitly resolves based on this specific source
- The Open Zone Map has maintained this exact count since its launch in October 2021
- This represents a 4-year period of complete stability (0 additions, 0 removals)

The prior distribution would be centered at 29, with a small variance to account for potential changes. Given the historical stability, I'll use a narrow distribution with most probability mass between 27-31 cities.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The resolution mechanism remains unchanged (Open Zone Map's count)
- The definition of charter cities used by the map curators appears consistent
- The political and economic factors affecting charter city development remain similar

**Differences from base case:**
- The forecast window is extremely short (approximately 1 month until January 2026)
- There is a small but non-zero risk of de-listing for the 3 Honduran ZEDEs due to political opposition
- The 4-year stasis could potentially indicate an overdue update to the map

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for stability (29 cities):**
- The Open Zone Map has shown zero volatility over 4 years (very strong evidence, ~10:1 likelihood ratio favoring no change)
- Charter city development timelines typically span 5-15 years, making new additions within 1 month extremely unlikely (~20:1 likelihood ratio against additions)
- No announcements of imminent map updates from the Adrianople Group (~3:1 likelihood ratio favoring no change)

**Evidence for potential decrease:**
- Honduran ZEDE law repeal creates ongoing legal uncertainty for 3 existing charter cities (~2:1 likelihood ratio favoring a small chance of removal)

**Evidence for potential increase:**
- CCI reports mention progress in African countries, but these are in early policy/legal stages (~10:1 likelihood ratio against near-term additions)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered at 29 with small variance, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

1. **Update on map stability**: The 4-year period with zero changes dramatically reduces my uncertainty. This shifts my posterior to be much more concentrated around 29.
   - Prior: ~70% probability on 29, with ~30% spread across 27-31
   - Likelihood: ~10:1 favoring stability
   - Posterior: ~95% probability on 29, with ~5% spread across 27-31

2. **Update on Honduran ZEDE risk**: The political situation in Honduras creates a small downside risk.
   - Prior (after first update): ~95% on 29, ~5% spread across 27-31
   - Likelihood: ~2:1 favoring a small chance of removal
   - Posterior: ~93% on 29, ~6% on 26-28, ~1% on 30-31

The posterior distribution is now heavily concentrated at 29, with a slight negative skew reflecting the small but real risk of removals exceeding additions.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the historical stability. The map could be due for a major update.
- I might be underestimating the Adrianople Group's curation process - they could have a batch update planned.
- The resolution mechanism itself has risk - what if the website goes offline?

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be to expect more volatility, perhaps centered at 27-28 cities, anticipating that the Honduran ZEDEs might be removed. However, this seems unlikely given:
- The ZEDEs have shown resilience despite political opposition
- Ciudad Morazán continued construction in late 2023
- Academic papers note that existing agreements protect projects like Próspera

**Tail risks:**
- Low-probability upside: A batch update adding several previously uncounted charter cities
- Low-probability downside: Website failure or map discontinuation leading to ambiguous resolution

After considering these factors, I'll maintain my heavy concentration at 29, but ensure my percentiles reflect the asymmetric risk (slightly more downside than upside risk).

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the extremely short time horizon, the historical stability, and the asymmetric risks, my distribution is highly concentrated at 29, with a slight negative skew:

P10: 28
P20: 29
P40: 29
P60: 29
P80: 29
P90: 30

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the history of the resolution source itself: the Open Zone Map's list of charter cities.
- **Reference Class:** The number of charter cities listed on the Open Zone Map.
- **Data:** In October 2021, the map listed 29 cities. A direct check on November 28, 2025, confirms the number is still 29.
- **Base Rate:** Over a period of more than four years (49 months), the net change has been zero. This establishes a powerful base rate of zero change per month.
- **Prior Distribution:** My prior is therefore a very narrow distribution, sharply peaked at 29. I will model this as a process with a very low rate of "events" (additions or removals), meaning the probability of the number remaining 29 in any given month is extremely high.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is highly similar to the base case (the last 49 months), but the extremely short forecast horizon of approximately one month makes the base rate of stasis even more compelling.
- **Similarities:** The fundamental drivers of charter city creation—long construction timelines, complex political negotiations, and high capital requirements—remain unchanged. These factors naturally lead to a very slow rate of change.
- **Differences:** The key difference is the resolution's complete dependence on a single, specific website that has not been updated in four years. This shifts the primary source of uncertainty from real-world city development to the curation and update schedule of the Adrianople Group. The long period of no updates could imply the map is semi-dormant, making any change unlikely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence for how they shift the distribution away from the prior of 29.
- **Evidence 1: Four years of stasis on the Open Zone Map.** This is overwhelmingly strong evidence supporting the "no change" hypothesis. It drastically reduces the variance of the forecast and suggests the bar for adding or removing a city is very high, or that the map is not actively maintained. This pushes the central tendency to exactly 29.
- **Evidence 2: Political/legal risk for Honduran ZEDEs.** Since 2022, the three Honduran ZEDEs on the list have faced legal challenges after the national law was repealed. This creates a specific, plausible mechanism for a *decrease* in the number. However, the projects have proven resilient and continue to operate. This evidence slightly increases the probability of a lower outcome (e.g., 26, 28) but the risk has not materialized in a delisting for over three years, so the immediate probability is low.
- **Evidence 3: Long development pipeline.** Reports from the Charter Cities Institute on new projects in Africa confirm they are in very early, non-physical stages (policy and legal frameworks). This is strong evidence *against* an increase, as it confirms no new city could possibly be built and meet the criteria ("has its own school") by the resolution date. The only path to an increase is a reclassification of an existing city, which is a low-probability event.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** A distribution with a mean and median of 29, and very low variance. Let's say P(29) is ~85%, with the remaining 15% split between higher and lower outcomes.
- **Likelihoods:**
    - The four years of stasis provide a likelihood that strongly favors the number remaining 29.
    - The Honduran situation slightly increases the likelihood of outcomes like 28 or 26 relative to 30 or 31.
    - The long pipeline evidence decreases the likelihood of outcomes > 29.
- **Posterior:** The update process dramatically sharpens the distribution around 29. The evidence of stasis, combined with the short time horizon, overwhelms other factors. The posterior probability of the number being exactly 29 increases to well over 90%. The mean shifts slightly below 29 (e.g., to 28.95) to account for the asymmetric, albeit small, risk of delisting the Honduran ZEDEs. The variance collapses. The posterior distribution is a spike at 29 with a small, left-skewed tail.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is extremely confident in the number remaining 29. What could go wrong?
- **The "Lumpy Update" Scenario:** The four-year stasis might not indicate dormancy, but rather that a batch update is overdue. The Adrianople Group could perform a full review and update the map on January 1st, 2026. This could add one or two previously missed cities and remove the three Honduran ZEDEs, leading to a net change (e.g., 29 - 3 + 1 = 27). This is the most plausible alternative forecast.
- **Rebuttal:** While possible, there is no specific evidence to suggest an update is imminent. The principle of inertia is strong; the most likely state for a system that has been static for four years is to remain static for one more month.
- **Adjustment:** To account for this "lumpy update" risk, I will assign a small but non-zero probability to other outcomes. I estimate the probability of the number being exactly 29 is about 92%. I will assign a 4% chance to a decrease (driven by the Honduras risk) and a 4% chance to an increase (driven by a surprise data addition). However, even with this 8% chance of change, the probability of the outcome being less than 29 is below 10%, and the probability of it being greater than 29 is also below 10%. Therefore, the percentiles from P10 to P90 will all fall on the central value of 29.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated on the integer 29. The probability of the number of cities being less than 29 is below 10%, and the probability of it being greater than 29 is also below 10%. This means the central 80% of my probability mass falls on the single value of 29.

P10: 29
P20: 29
P40: 29
P60: 29
P80: 29
P90: 29
