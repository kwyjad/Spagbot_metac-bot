### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Previous extensions of Ukrainian martial law (2022-2025):** Since February 2022, the Verkhovna Rada has approved the extension of martial law 16 consecutive times without failure. This is the most specific and relevant reference class.
    *   **Base Rate:** 100% (16 out of 16).
    *   **Reasoning:** This reflects an established political and legal routine under a consistent set of circumstances (ongoing war).
    *   **Limitations:** The sample consists of non-independent events driven by the same underlying cause. It indicates a strong pattern but is not a statistical probability in itself.

2.  **States of emergency/martial law during major modern interstate wars:** Nations engaged in existential or large-scale wars on their own territory rarely lift emergency measures before the cessation of major hostilities. Examples include the UK's emergency powers during WWII, which were only gradually lifted after victory.
    *   **Base Rate:** >95%.
    *   **Reasoning:** The security, political, and logistical imperatives of a major war make lifting such measures untenable until the threat is neutralized or a stable truce is achieved.
    *   **Limitations:** The legal frameworks, political systems, and nature of conflicts vary significantly, making direct comparisons difficult.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-13** Recent poll shows only 25% of Ukrainians want Zelenskyy to remain president *after* the war, though trust in him *during* the war remains at 60%. — **↑** — This decouples post-war political sentiment from the immediate necessity of wartime governance, reinforcing the consensus to maintain the status quo until the conflict ends.
*   **2025-08-07** Verkhovna Rada overwhelmingly approves the 16th extension of martial law and general mobilization until November 5, 2025. — **↑** — Demonstrates the recent and continued political unanimity on the necessity of martial law, making a sudden reversal highly improbable.
*   **2025-07-01** Reporting confirms broad consensus among Ukrainian political parties to postpone elections until after the conflict, citing constitutional prohibitions. — **↑** — Reaffirms that there is no significant domestic political pressure to lift martial law, which would legally trigger an election cycle.
*   **2025-05-20** Reports indicate continued intense, attritional fighting along the eastern and southern fronts, with no signs of a ceasefire or peace negotiations. — **↑** — The primary driver for martial law—the active, high-intensity war—persists with no indication of abating before the November deadline.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **State of the Russo-Ukrainian War (Large):** This is the primary driver. As long as there is active, large-scale combat, the government will maintain that martial law is a military and security necessity. A genuine, lasting ceasefire is the only plausible mechanism for ending it.
2.  **Constitutional Prohibition on Elections (Large):** Ukrainian law explicitly forbids holding national elections under martial law. Lifting the measure would trigger a constitutional crisis by requiring elections that are logistically and securely impossible to conduct (due to millions of displaced persons/refugees, occupied territories, and the risk of attacks on polling stations).
3.  **Domestic Political & Public Consensus (Moderate):** There is a widespread, cross-party agreement that elections are not feasible or desirable during the war. Public opinion, despite showing war fatigue, consistently supports postponing elections until after victory. This removes any internal pressure to lift martial law.
4.  **Need for Mobilization Authority (Moderate):** Martial law provides the legal framework for general mobilization, which is critical for sustaining the war effort. Ending martial law would complicate the state's ability to conscript and deploy troops.
5.  **International Stance (Small):** While some international partners raised questions about elections early on, there is now a broad understanding and acceptance of Ukraine's position. A sudden, high-pressure demand from key allies (e.g., the US) to hold elections is a potential, but currently dormant, driver.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Legal Link to Elections:** Unlike some historical cases where emergency powers are more vaguely defined, Ukraine's constitution creates a direct, unavoidable link between the state of martial law and the postponement of elections. This makes the decision less arbitrary and more of a legal necessity.
*   **High Dependency on Foreign Aid:** Ukraine's war effort is heavily reliant on Western military and financial support. This creates a potential vector for external pressure to alter its domestic legal status, a vulnerability not present for more self-sufficient wartime states in the past.
*   **Resilient Democratic Institutions:** Despite the war and martial law, Ukraine has maintained a relatively pluralistic media and active civil society. This provides a check on the abuse of emergency powers, but also reinforces the legitimacy of the consensus to extend them, as it is not seen as a simple power grab.
*   **Nature of the Conflict:** This is a total war for national survival against a larger aggressor, fought on home soil. The justification for martial law is arguably stronger and less ambiguous than in cases of expeditionary wars or counter-insurgencies, which might form part of the broader reference class.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The base rate from 16 consecutive, unopposed extensions suggests a very strong prior, well above 95%. An equivalent n of ~20 seems appropriate, reflecting the strength of the established pattern and the clear causal mechanism.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The war continues at high intensity with no peace process in sight, preserving the core justification for martial law.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The recent parliamentary vote and ongoing political consensus show no erosion of elite support for extension.
    *   (↑ Small) Recent polling confirms public acceptance of postponing elections, neutralizing potential populist pressure.
    *   (↔) The international community remains aligned with Ukraine's rationale, exerting no pressure to change course.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence is entirely consistent with and reinforces the strong prior. The posterior should be adjusted slightly higher, moving extremely close to 100%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   Official statements from the President's office or military command linking continued security threats to the need for martial law.
    *   A major new Russian offensive or escalation in attacks on civilian infrastructure.
    *   The submission of the draft law on extension to the Verkhovna Rada (this is a procedural step, but its smooth passage is a key indicator).
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   Announcement of high-level, credible peace talks involving key international actors (e.g., US, China).
    *   A sudden and decisive Ukrainian military breakthrough that fundamentally alters the strategic landscape.
    *   A sudden, unexpected collapse of the domestic political consensus (e.g., major parties publicly calling for an end to martial law).
    *   Public statements from the US or EU explicitly conditioning future aid on a roadmap to elections.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast assumes a continuation of the current conflict paradigm. A sudden event like a leadership change in Russia, a dramatic military collapse on either side, or the use of a tactical nuclear weapon could unpredictably alter all calculations.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The question is specific to "martial law." It is conceivable, though unlikely, that Ukraine could replace it with a different legal framework (e.g., a "state of anti-terrorist operation") that still prohibits elections. This would technically resolve the question as "No" while achieving the same practical outcome.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The decision will be based on the Ukrainian government's assessment of the military situation, to which we do not have full access. A secret peace negotiation is highly improbable but not impossible.
*   **War Fatigue Tipping Point:** While polls currently show acceptance, public sentiment could theoretically shift rapidly if a catastrophic military or economic event occurred, though this is unlikely to happen and translate into policy change before the November 5 deadline.

**Final Research Summary:** The extension of martial law is a legal and political necessity directly tied to the continuation of the war. With no end to hostilities in sight and a firm domestic consensus, another routine extension is virtually certain.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of martial law extensions in Ukraine since February 2022. The Verkhovna Rada has extended martial law 16 times consecutively, which gives a base rate of 100% (16 out of 16).
   - This base rate is chosen because it reflects a consistent pattern of behavior under similar circumstances (ongoing war with Russia).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation is similar to previous extensions as the war with Russia continues, and there is no significant change in the political or military landscape that would suggest a deviation from past behavior.
   - Differences: The only potential difference could be a change in international pressure or a significant shift in the war dynamics, but there is no current evidence of such changes.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Continued war: The ongoing high-intensity conflict supports the likelihood of extending martial law (P(E | H) is high).
   - Political consensus: The recent unanimous parliamentary vote and public opinion support the extension (P(E | H) is high).
   - International stance: No pressure from allies to change the current legal status (P(E | H) is high).
   - Likelihood ratio: Each piece of evidence strongly supports the continuation of martial law, reinforcing the prior probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 100% base rate translates to odds of 1 (certainty).
   - Given the strong supporting evidence, the likelihood ratio is very high, further reinforcing the prior.
   - Posterior probability remains extremely high, close to 100%, as the evidence aligns with the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a sudden peace negotiation or international pressure, is important but currently unlikely.
   - The possibility of a black swan event, such as a dramatic shift in the war or political landscape, is acknowledged but not supported by current evidence.
   - The forecast remains robust given the current evidence and historical pattern.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the strong historical precedent and current evidence, the probability of Ukraine extending martial law beyond November 5, 2025, is extremely high.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the history of martial law extensions in Ukraine since the Russian invasion as my primary reference class:

- Since February 2022, Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times without fail
- Base rate: 16/16 = 100% historical extension rate

This suggests an extremely high prior probability of ~95-98%. I'm not setting it at 100% because there should always be some uncertainty, but the consistent pattern of extensions during an ongoing war provides a very strong prior.

Converting to odds form: 95% = 19:1 odds in favor of extension

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental driver (active war with Russia) remains unchanged
- The same constitutional and legal framework applies (elections prohibited during martial law)
- The same political leadership is in place
- The same broad political consensus exists across parties

**Differences from base case:**
- War fatigue may be higher after 3.5+ years of conflict
- Public support for Zelenskyy's post-war leadership has declined (only 25% want him to remain president after the war)
- The war has evolved into a more static, attritional conflict compared to earlier phases

These differences don't significantly alter the probability because:
1. War fatigue doesn't translate to ending martial law while fighting continues
2. The distinction between wartime and post-war leadership in polling suggests Ukrainians accept the current governance model during the conflict
3. Even a static conflict still represents an existential threat requiring martial law powers

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Ongoing active combat**
- P(E|H): ~100% (If martial law is extended, we would certainly see ongoing combat)
- P(E|~H): ~5% (If martial law is not extended, it would almost certainly mean combat had ceased)
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 2: Constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law**
- P(E|H): ~100% (If martial law is extended, this constitutional constraint would be in effect)
- P(E|~H): ~20% (If martial law is not extended, it would likely be because this constraint was changed or worked around)
- Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 3: Recent parliamentary approval pattern**
- P(E|H): ~100% (If martial law is extended, we would expect to see the same parliamentary consensus)
- P(E|~H): ~10% (If martial law is not extended, it would likely indicate a breakdown in this consensus)
- Likelihood ratio: ~10:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 4: No peace negotiations in progress**
- P(E|H): ~90% (If martial law is extended, we would likely see no serious peace talks)
- P(E|~H): ~20% (If martial law is not extended, it would likely be preceded by serious peace talks)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases the probability of extension

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 19:1 (95% probability)

Update based on ongoing combat (LR = 20:1):
- Posterior odds = 19 × 20 = 380:1
- Posterior probability = 380/(380+1) ≈ 99.7%

This already pushes us to an extremely high probability. The additional evidence factors would push this even higher, but I'll be cautious about overconfidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential scenarios that could lead to non-extension:

1. **Sudden peace breakthrough**: While unlikely given current dynamics, a major diplomatic initiative backed by key powers could create momentum for a ceasefire before November.

2. **Domestic political crisis**: If internal Ukrainian politics experienced a major upheaval, it could theoretically affect the martial law consensus, though this seems highly improbable given the existential nature of the threat.

3. **External pressure**: Major allies could theoretically condition aid on democratic reforms, including elections, though this would contradict their current understanding of Ukraine's situation.

4. **Legal redefinition**: Ukraine could technically end "martial law" but implement a different emergency framework that serves the same purpose, though this would be a semantic rather than substantive change.

None of these scenarios seems particularly likely before November 5, 2025, especially given the procedural timeline for extending martial law (which would begin weeks before the expiration).

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the extremely strong historical pattern, I assess there is a very high probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025. The ongoing war, constitutional constraints, political consensus, and absence of peace talks all strongly support this conclusion.

However, I will avoid extreme overconfidence by acknowledging some small possibility of unexpected developments.

Final: 98%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate comes from the specific actions of the Ukrainian government under the exact circumstances of the current war.
- **Reference Class:** Extensions of martial law by the Verkhovna Rada since February 24, 2022.
- **Data:** As of the date of this forecast, martial law has been extended 16 consecutive times without failure.
- **Base Rate (Prior):** This perfect track record (16 out of 16) suggests an extremely high prior probability. While not a statistical sample of independent events, it establishes a powerful precedent and a clear political-legal routine. A starting prior of **98%** is appropriate. This reflects the overwhelming pattern while leaving a small (2%) allowance for the possibility that the underlying conditions (i.e., the war) might change. This is equivalent to prior odds of 49:1 in favor of extension.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is nearly identical to the circumstances preceding the previous 16 extensions.
- **Similarities:** The core driver—an active, high-intensity war of national survival—persists. There are no credible, high-level peace negotiations underway. The same political leadership and broad cross-party consensus that approved all prior extensions remain in place. The constitutional prohibition on holding elections during martial law provides a powerful legal incentive to maintain it.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the sheer duration of the war, which could increase war fatigue. However, the provided polling data from October 2025 indicates that the Ukrainian public still distinguishes between wartime and post-war governance, maintaining high trust in the leadership *during* the war. Therefore, this difference does not appear to be a significant factor pointing toward a different outcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that Ukraine extends martial law, and ~H be the hypothesis that it does not.

- **Evidence 1: The war continues at high intensity with no resolution in sight.**
    - This is the foundational reason for martial law. The probability of observing this evidence if Ukraine plans to extend martial law (P(E|H)) is very high (~1). The probability of observing this evidence if Ukraine does *not* plan to extend martial law (P(E|~H)) is extremely low. Lifting martial law during intense fighting would be a radical and dangerous departure from policy.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large, strongly increasing the probability of extension.

- **Evidence 2: The Verkhovna Rada overwhelmingly approved the 16th extension on August 7, 2025.**
    - This recent, unanimous vote demonstrates that the political will to extend martial law is not weakening. It is strong evidence of the status quo continuing. P(E|H) is high; P(E|~H) is very low, as it would require a sudden, unexplained collapse of this consensus within three months.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Large, increasing the probability of extension.

- **Evidence 3: Broad political and public consensus to postpone elections until after the war.**
    - Since martial law is the legal mechanism for postponing elections, this consensus directly supports its continuation. P(E|H) is high; P(E|~H) is very low.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Large, increasing the probability of extension.

All key pieces of evidence are mutually reinforcing and point strongly toward extension.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The evidence strongly confirms the assumptions underlying the high prior. The prior was set at 98%, leaving a 2% chance for non-extension. This 2% risk is primarily composed of: (a) a sudden end to the war, or (b) a sudden internal political collapse.

The recent evidence (from July-October 2025) directly refutes the likelihood of a political collapse. Furthermore, with the deadline only three weeks away, the probability of the war ending decisively in that short window is extremely low. Therefore, the evidence serves to reduce the initial 2% uncertainty.

- **Conceptual Update:** Prior odds are 49:1. The combined likelihood ratio of the confirmatory evidence is very high. A qualitative update suggests moving the probability from "extremely likely" (98%) to "virtually certain." The posterior probability should be higher than the prior. An update to **99%** reflects this, shrinking the perceived chance of failure from 1-in-50 to 1-in-100.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenario:** Could Ukraine choose not to extend martial law? This would almost certainly require a sudden, unexpected cessation of hostilities. For example, a "black swan" event like a sudden political change in Russia leading to an immediate troop withdrawal. While not impossible, the probability of such an event occurring in the specific three-week window before the extension vote is exceptionally low.
- **Semantic Risk:** Another possibility is that the government replaces "martial law" with a different legal framework (e.g., a "state of emergency") that has the same practical effect of postponing elections and enabling mobilization. This would technically resolve the question as "No." This is a plausible, though unlikely, tail risk.
- **Conclusion:** The primary risks are extremely low-probability "black swan" events or a semantic/legal maneuver. A 1% chance of failure (i.e., a 99% forecast) seems sufficient to cover these remote possibilities.

### 6. Final Forecast
The combination of a perfect track record of 16 prior extensions, the ongoing reality of the war, a solid domestic political and public consensus, and the very short time remaining until the deadline makes another extension overwhelmingly likely. The evidence strongly reinforces the high prior, moving the probability into the high-90s. The small remaining uncertainty is reserved for truly unexpected, low-probability events.

Final: 99%
