### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the standard process for selecting a COP host, particularly within the Western European and Others Group (WEOG)? How are deadlocks typically resolved?
    *   What are the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the Australian and Turkish bids?
    *   What is the current diplomatic landscape within WEOG regarding the two bids? Who are the key players and what are their likely preferences?
    *   What is the probability and implication of the default scenario (Bonn, Germany)?
    *   What recent events (last 6-12 months) have materially affected the standing of either bid?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `"UNFCCC COP host selection process WEOG"`
    *   `"history of contested COP host bids"`
    *   `"Australia COP31 bid support" + "Pacific nations"`
    *   `"Turkey COP31 bid" + "climate policy"`
    *   `"WEOG consensus COP31 Australia Turkey"`
    *   `"EU position on COP31 host"`
    *   `"Australia 2035 NDC submission details"`
    *   `"COP29 host selection" Armenia Azerbaijan` (as a recent analogue for a contested bid)

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The core of this forecast is the *consensus* mechanism within WEOG. It is not a majority vote. This gives Turkey significant leverage, even if Australia has more numerous supporters.
    *   Australia's bid has a powerful narrative ("a Pacific COP") that aligns with the climate justice focus of recent COPs. Its diplomatic efforts are visible and recent, including shoring up regional support and submitting a new NDC to bolster its climate credentials.
    *   Turkey's bid is logistically simpler (single host) but lacks a compelling narrative. Its success hinges on its ability to leverage geopolitical relationships within WEOG and maintain a blocking position until a concession is made.
    *   The recent standoff for COP29 in the Eastern European Group, which was resolved through a bilateral deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, serves as a key precedent. It shows that deadlocks can be broken by deals external to the broader group.
    *   The default to Bonn is a credible threat that creates pressure on both parties to negotiate. It represents a collective failure for the WEOG group, which most members will want to avoid.

4.  **Drafting the Research Brief:**
    *   The following brief is structured to directly address the statistician's needs, translating the synthesized research into the required format.

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Bids (within a regional group):** This is the most relevant class. These are uncommon but not unprecedented. The recent selection of Azerbaijan for COP29 after a standoff in the Eastern European Group is a key example. In such cases, the outcome is driven by high-stakes diplomacy, not a simple vote. The initial "favorite" does not always win; often a compromise or a bilateral deal decides the outcome. **Base Rate:** In a two-candidate race, the probability of one of the primary bidders winning is high (~85-90%), with the default/failure option being a small but real possibility (~10-15%). The odds between the two bidders are highly context-dependent.
2.  **UN Consensus-Based Decisions with Two Strong Candidates:** In UN bodies, consensus rules give disproportionate power to actors who can credibly block a decision. This often leads to prolonged negotiations, package deals (e.g., "we'll support your bid here if you support ours for another position"), or one party withdrawing in exchange for a future consideration. The base rate of failure (no decision) is low, as there is immense institutional pressure to find a solution.
3.  **WEOG-Hosted COPs:** Historically, WEOG hosts are major, developed economies (e.g., UK, France, Spain). Both Australia and Turkey fit the profile of having the capacity to host. This class does not strongly distinguish between the two candidates but suggests an "Other" or "Another Pacific Island Nation" (acting alone) is extremely unlikely.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-20** Australia-PNG Ministerial Forum Communiqué (↑ Australia) — Reaffirmed PNG's support for a "Pacific COP," showing Australia is actively maintaining and publicizing its coalition's cohesion.
*   **2025-10-13** Australia's NDC Submission Mentioned (↑ Australia) — The Department of Climate Change (DCCEEW) highlighted the submission of a 2035 target, a concrete action to bolster climate credibility ahead of the decision.
*   **2025-09-08** Australian Gov't COP31 Bid Website Update (↑ Australia) — Emphasized the economic and First Nations benefits, indicating a continued domestic and international public relations push for the bid.
*   **2024-11-26** Decision Deferred (from June 2025) (↑ Turkey/Germany) — The fact that an earlier deadline passed without consensus demonstrates the deadlock is serious and Turkey's blocking position is effective.
*   **2024-11-20** "Standoff" Report (↔ Neutral/Status Quo) — Guardian article confirmed the competitive nature and that while Australia has "significant support," it's not enough to achieve consensus, framing the current state of play.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** The single most important mechanism. Any of the ~30 WEOG members can theoretically block a decision. This transforms the contest from a popularity contest into a diplomatic negotiation where leverage matters more than broad support. (Large impact)
2.  **Narrative and Thematic Resonance:** Australia's "Pacific COP" narrative is powerful, timely, and aligns with the UNFCCC's focus on climate justice and frontline communities. Turkey's bid lacks a similarly compelling story. (Moderate impact, favors Australia)
3.  **Geopolitical Leverage:** The outcome may depend on unrelated diplomatic horse-trading. Turkey's strategic importance and complex relationship with the EU could be used as leverage. Australia can count on strong support from Commonwealth nations and likely the US. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Climate Policy Credibility:** Australia's status as a major fossil fuel exporter is a vulnerability, but its recently legislated targets and new 2035 NDC are designed to counter this. Turkey's own climate record will also be under scrutiny. (Small-to-moderate impact)
5.  **Pressure to Avoid Failure (Bonn):** The default to Bonn is viewed as a collective diplomatic failure for WEOG. This creates significant pressure on both candidates and the wider group to broker a deal before the COP30 deadline. (Moderate impact, favors a resolution for either AUS or TUR over GER)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Co-Host Model:** The Australia-Pacific bid is a co-hosting model, which is logistically and politically more complex than a standard single-country bid.
*   **Strong Thematic Bid:** The Australian bid is unusually strong on theme ("climate justice for the Pacific"), which may carry more weight in the current international climate.
*   **Absence of a Clear Compromise Candidate:** In past deadlocks (like for COP29), a third party emerged. Here, no other WEOG nation has stepped forward, making it a stark choice between the two bidders or the default.
*   **Prolonged Public Standoff:** The contest has been public and described as a "standoff" for nearly a year, suggesting both sides are deeply invested and less likely to concede easily without a significant return.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior would place Australia as the favorite due to its stronger narrative and broader likely support base, but with high uncertainty given the consensus rule. An initial distribution could be: **Australia (55%), Turkey (35%), Germany (10%), Other (<1%)**, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=10) to reflect the volatility of diplomatic negotiations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Aus, small):** Recent, active diplomatic efforts by Australia (PNG communiqué) and concrete policy actions (NDC submission) show momentum and a commitment to addressing credibility gaps.
    *   **↓ (Aus, small) / ↑ (Tur, small):** The decision's deferral past the mid-2025 informal deadline is strong evidence of the resilience of Turkey's blocking strategy. It proves Australia's support is not yet decisive.
    *   **↓ (Ger, small):** The continued high-level engagement from both Australia and Turkey suggests both are actively seeking

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option. 

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given Australia's strong thematic bid and active diplomatic efforts, a base rate of 55% is reasonable. Australia's narrative aligns well with recent COP themes, and it has significant support within the WEOG.
- **Turkey**: Turkey's bid is logistically simpler and it has maintained a blocking position, suggesting a base rate of 35%. Turkey's geopolitical leverage within WEOG could play a crucial role.
- **Germany**: As the default host city, Bonn, Germany, represents a fallback option. Historically, the default is rarely used, so a base rate of 10% is appropriate.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is highly unlikely given the current bids, so a base rate of <1% is appropriate.
- **Other**: Similarly, the emergence of another candidate is improbable, so a base rate of <1% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The co-host model with Pacific nations is unique and adds complexity, but it strengthens the narrative of climate justice.
- **Turkey**: The lack of a compelling narrative is a disadvantage, but its strategic position and ability to block consensus are significant.
- **Germany**: The default option is a credible threat but represents a failure to reach consensus, which is generally avoided.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation/Other**: No significant developments suggest these are viable options.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: Recent diplomatic efforts and policy actions (e.g., NDC submission) increase the likelihood of Australia's bid succeeding. Likelihood ratio favors Australia.
- **Turkey**: The deferral of the decision indicates Turkey's blocking strategy is effective, increasing its likelihood. Likelihood ratio favors Turkey.
- **Germany**: The active engagement of both Australia and Turkey reduces the likelihood of defaulting to Germany. Likelihood ratio disfavors Germany.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation/Other**: No evidence suggests these are likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds of 55% are increased by recent diplomatic efforts and thematic alignment. Adjusted probability: ~60%.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds of 35% are increased by the effective blocking strategy. Adjusted probability: ~30%.
- **Germany**: Prior odds of 10% are decreased due to active negotiations. Adjusted probability: ~8%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation/Other**: Remain negligible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of a last-minute diplomatic breakthrough or a shift in geopolitical alliances that could alter the probabilities.
- The potential for unforeseen geopolitical events or climate-related disasters could impact the decision-making process.
- Adjust probabilities slightly to account for these tail risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- Australia: 60%
- Turkey: 30%
- Germany: 8%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: <1%
- Other: <1%

### 7. Output Format

Turkey: 30%  
Germany: 8%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: <1%  
Other: <1%

# Forecasting COP 31 Host Country for 2026

I'll analyze the probabilities for each potential host country using Bayesian reasoning.

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia is one of two official bidders from the WEOG group, which is scheduled to host COP 31. Australia has a compelling narrative with its "Pacific COP" approach and has shown active diplomatic efforts.

**Turkey**: 35% 
- Rationale: Turkey is the other official bidder from WEOG. While it lacks the narrative strength of Australia's bid, it has maintained its position and shown ability to block consensus.

**Germany**: 15%
- Rationale: Germany is the default option if consensus cannot be reached, as Bonn hosts the UNFCCC secretariat. Historical precedent suggests a ~10-15% chance of defaulting to the backup option in contested bids.

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 3%
- Rationale: While Pacific nations are part of Australia's co-hosting bid, the likelihood of one hosting independently is very low given resource constraints and regional group rotation.

**Other**: 2%
- Rationale: The possibility of another WEOG country emerging as a compromise candidate exists but is unlikely given the late stage and absence of other declared bids.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The host selection follows the established UN regional rotation system
- The decision requires consensus within the regional group
- Both main candidates (Australia and Turkey) are developed economies with capacity to host

**Key differences:**
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations is unusual and adds complexity
- The public "standoff" has been prolonged, indicating deep investment from both sides
- Australia has a particularly strong thematic narrative around climate justice
- No clear compromise candidate has emerged despite the deadlock

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Australia's active diplomatic efforts**
- P(E|Australia wins): 80% - We would expect to see this level of diplomatic activity if Australia were on track to win
- P(E|Australia doesn't win): 40% - We might still see some activity, but likely not as coordinated

**Evidence 2: Decision deferral past mid-2025**
- P(E|Turkey wins): 70% - This suggests Turkey's blocking position is effective
- P(E|Turkey doesn't win): 40% - Delays could occur for other reasons

**Evidence 3: Australia's climate policy actions (NDC submission)**
- P(E|Australia wins): 75% - Taking concrete actions to address credibility gaps is consistent with preparing to host
- P(E|Australia doesn't win): 50% - Australia might take these actions regardless

**Evidence 4: Absence of compromise candidates**
- P(E|Either Australia or Turkey wins): 90% - With no alternatives emerging, one of the two main bidders is highly likely to win
- P(E|Neither wins): 60% - Even without alternatives, a deadlock could still result in defaulting to Germany

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on Evidence 1 (Australia's diplomatic efforts):

For Australia:
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 80/40 = 2
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 2 = 1.64
- Posterior probability: 1.64/(1+1.64) = 62%

For Turkey:
- Prior probability: 35%
- After accounting for Australia's increase, Turkey's probability decreases proportionally to ~26%

Now updating on Evidence 2 (decision deferral):

For Turkey:
- Prior odds (after first update): 26/74 = 0.35
- Likelihood ratio: 70/40 = 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.35 × 1.75 = 0.61
- Posterior probability: 0.61/(1+0.61) = 38%

For Australia:
- Probability decreases from 62% to ~52% after accounting for this evidence

Continuing with Evidence 3 and 4, and considering the full evidence set holistically, I arrive at these updated probabilities:
- Australia: ~50%
- Turkey: ~35%
- Germany: ~12%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: ~2%
- Other: ~1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the importance of Australia's narrative strength versus Turkey's geopolitical leverage
- The consensus mechanism gives Turkey significant blocking power that might be underweighted
- I might be underestimating the probability of a compromise solution emerging late in the process

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could leverage its strategic importance to the EU to gain support
- Australia's fossil fuel exports could become a more significant liability
- A third WEOG country could emerge as a compromise candidate at the last minute

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce Australia's probability and increase Turkey's to reflect the power of the consensus mechanism
- Maintain a non-trivial probability for Germany to reflect the real possibility of deadlock
- Keep small but non-zero probabilities for other outcomes to account for unexpected developments

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I'll make final adjustments to ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

## 7. Output Format

Australia: 48%  
Turkey: 37%  
Germany: 12%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%  
Other: 1%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is "contested COP host bids within a regional group." The research report notes these are uncommon but have recent precedent (e.g., COP29).
*   **Base Rate for Bidders vs. Default:** In these situations, one of the primary bidders usually wins. The report suggests a base rate of 85-90% for one of the bidders (Australia or Turkey) to succeed, and a 10-15% chance of the process failing and reverting to the default host (Germany).
*   **Base Rate for Bidders:** Without specific information, a 50/50 split between two bidders would be a neutral starting point. However, the background suggests Australia has a more developed and thematically resonant bid. Therefore, an initial prior favoring Australia is justified.
*   **Initial Prior Distribution:** Based on the report's sketch, a reasonable prior is:
    *   Australia: 55% (stronger narrative, broader support base)
    *   Turkey: 35% (relies on blocking power, less compelling narrative)
    *   Germany: 10% (lower end of the 10-15% failure base rate)
    *   Another Pacific Island Nation: <1% (This is part of Australia's bid, not a standalone option)
    *   Other: <1% (No other WEOG country has put forward a bid)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current case is a two-candidate standoff within a UN regional group, with a consensus-based decision rule and a default option. This aligns well with the base case (e.g., the COP29 selection process).
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Australia's Co-Host Model:** The "Pacific COP" model is more complex but provides a powerful narrative of climate justice, which is a significant asset in the current diplomatic environment.
    2.  **Absence of a Compromise Candidate:** Unlike some past deadlocks, no third WEOG nation has emerged as a compromise, which polarizes the choice and potentially increases the probability of the default (Germany) if the two bidders remain deadlocked.
    3.  **Prolonged Public Standoff:** The contest has been public for nearly a year, suggesting both sides are deeply invested, which may make a simple concession less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence provided in the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Australia's strong "Pacific COP" narrative and active diplomacy (PNG communiqué, NDC submission).**
    *   This evidence is highly likely if Australia is on a winning trajectory (P(E|Australia wins) is high). A campaign that is actively shoring up support and addressing its weaknesses is more likely to succeed.
    *   This evidence is less likely if Turkey or Germany wins (P(E|Turkey/Germany wins) is lower).
    *   **Effect:** This evidence increases the probability of Australia winning.

*   **Evidence 2: The decision was deferred past a mid-2025 informal deadline.**
    *   This is strong evidence that the deadlock is real and Turkey's blocking strategy is effective.
    *   The likelihood of this deferral is high if Turkey ultimately wins or if the process defaults to Germany (P(E|Turkey wins) is high; P(E|Germany wins) is high).
    *   The likelihood is lower for a scenario where Australia wins easily, though a hard-fought victory is still possible (P(E|Australia wins) is medium).
    *   **Effect:** This evidence significantly decreases the probability of an easy Australian victory, and increases the probabilities for both Turkey and Germany.

*   **Evidence 3: The COP29 precedent (bilateral deal resolving a deadlock).**
    *   This shows that there is a path out of deadlock that does not involve the default host. This suggests that a geopolitical deal could be struck.
    *   This slightly lowers the probability of the default (Germany) compared to a pure deadlock scenario.
    *   The probability mass shifted from Germany could go to either Australia or Turkey, depending on which is perceived as having more geopolitical leverage for such a deal. Turkey's strategic position might give it a slight edge in this specific type of negotiation.
    *   **Effect:** Slightly decreases P(Germany), and slightly increases P(Turkey) and P(Australia).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will now update my priors based on the evidence.

1.  **Start with Prior:** Australia (55%), Turkey (35%), Germany (10%).
2.  **Update for Deferral:** The deferral is the most significant piece of evidence. It shows Turkey's blocking power is not theoretical but actual. This significantly closes the gap between Australia and Turkey and makes the German default more plausible. I will shift a significant portion of probability from Australia to Turkey and Germany.
    *   *Shift:* Move ~10 percentage points from Australia. Distribute 6 points to Turkey and 4 to Germany.
    *   *Intermediate Posterior:* Australia (45%), Turkey (41%), Germany (14%).
3.  **Update for Australia's Active Campaign:** Australia's recent diplomatic and policy actions show momentum. This counteracts some of the negative evidence from the deferral.
    *   *Shift:* Move ~2 points back to Australia, primarily from Turkey.
    *   *Intermediate Posterior:* Australia (47%), Turkey (39%), Germany (14%).
4.  **Update for COP29 Precedent:** This precedent makes a brokered deal more likely and a default slightly less likely.
    *   *Shift:* Move ~1 point from Germany and distribute it to the two main bidders, perhaps slightly favoring Turkey due to its potential for geopolitical horse-trading.
    *   *Resulting Posterior:* Australia (47%), Turkey (39.5%), Germany (13.5%).

This step-by-step update leads to a very close race where Australia is a slight favorite, but Turkey is a very close second, and the default option is a serious possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My current forecast is Australia 47%, Turkey ~40%, Germany ~13%. Is this correct?
*   **Argument for Turkey being the favorite:** The consensus rule is the most powerful factor. In such a system, a determined blocker often has the advantage over a candidate with broad but not unanimous support. The deferral is hard evidence of Turkey's effective use of this leverage. My forecast might be underweighting this structural advantage.
*   **Argument for Germany being more likely:** Both sides are dug in. Australia has staked its reputation on the "Pacific COP." Turkey may be using this for unrelated geopolitical leverage. If neither side can afford to back down and no grand bargain is struck, the 13.5% chance of default might be too low.
*   **Adjustment:** In light of these points, I will slightly reduce the gap between Australia and Turkey to reflect the power of the consensus rule, making it nearly a toss-up. I will keep Germany's probability stable, as the pressure to avoid a "WEOG failure" is also a strong counteracting force. I will narrow the gap by taking from Australia and giving to Turkey.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the red team adjustment, I will finalize the probabilities.
*   Australia: 44%
*   Turkey: 42%
*   Germany: 13%
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 0.5% (Extremely unlikely to host alone)
*   Other: 0.5% (No other candidate has emerged)

This distribution sums to 100%. It reflects a very tight race where Australia's strong narrative gives it a razor-thin edge, but Turkey's structural power as a potential blocker makes it a very strong contender. The significant probability for Germany reflects the real risk of a continued deadlock.

Australia: 44%
Turkey: 42%
Germany: 13%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0.5%
Other: 0.5%
