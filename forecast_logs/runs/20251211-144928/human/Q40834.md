### Reference class & base rates
1.  **YoY Growth for the Same Week in the Prior Year:** The most specific reference class is the performance of this exact period in the previous cycle. For the week ending January 5, 2025, OpenTable reported a massive **+50%** year-over-year growth. This suggests the New Year's holiday week is highly volatile and that the 2025 figure represents an exceptionally strong performance, possibly a post-pandemic recovery peak. This single data point, however, has high variance.
2.  **Average Weekly YoY Growth for OpenTable in 2025:** A broader reference is the company's typical performance throughout the most recent full year. The background states the average weekly YoY growth in 2025 was **+9.4%**. This serves as a more stable, albeit less specific, indicator of the company's underlying growth trajectory over the last 12 months.
3.  **General US Full-Service Restaurant Sales Growth:** A macro-level reference class is the overall health of the US restaurant industry, where OpenTable is dominant. Post-pandemic nominal growth has been in the mid-to-high single digits, but after accounting for inflation, real growth is much lower, likely in the **+2% to +5%** range for 2025. This provides context for the broader market conditions.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-08** Article predicts major 2026 restaurant tech trends, including 'agentic AI' and brand-building beyond reservations. **(↓)** Matters because it highlights a shift in industry focus to technology where OpenTable is not the primary innovator, reinforcing the narrative of competitive pressure.
*   **2025-12-05** Article forecasts 80% of restaurant transactions will be cashless and AI will manage nearly half of customer interactions by 2026. **(↓)** Similar to the above, this points to a rapidly evolving tech landscape where OpenTable's core value proposition is being commoditized, likely accelerating market share loss.
*   **2025-11-16** Last available data point from the provided 2025 spreadsheet. **(↓)** Analysis of the data from H2 2025 shows a deceleration from the full-year average of +9.4%, suggesting that momentum was already slowing heading into the end of the year.
*   **2025-08-05** Competitor Toast announces adding a record 8,500 net new locations in Q2 2025. **(↓)** This is direct evidence of a key competitor's rapid growth, substantiating the claim of OpenTable's market share erosion and its negative impact on diner growth relative to the overall market.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **The Base Effect (Large):** The single most significant driver is the +50% growth achieved in the comparison week (ending Jan 1, 2025). This creates an extremely high mathematical hurdle for the week ending Jan 1, 2026, to overcome. Lapping such a massive gain makes a negative YoY print highly probable.
2.  **Market Share Erosion (Moderate):** OpenTable's market share has fallen from 51% to 46% in two years. Competitors like Resy, Toast Tables, and Yelp are growing aggressively. This structural headwind means OpenTable will capture a smaller percentage of total industry reservations than it did in the prior year.
3.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds (Moderate):** Fine dining is highly sensitive to discretionary income. Even with stable employment, persistent inflation and slowing economic growth in late 2025 are likely to temper consumer spending on high-end restaurant meals compared to the more optimistic environment of early 2025.
4.  **Return to Normalcy (Moderate):** The +50% figure in January 2025 was likely influenced by the final stages of post-pandemic "revenge spending" and a return to holiday gatherings. This one-off recovery effect has now fully dissipated, leading to a reversion to more normal, modest growth or decline.
5.  **Calendar Effects (Small):** New Year's Day 2025 was a Wednesday; in 2026, it is a Thursday. This places New Year's Eve on a Wednesday, which is a slightly more favorable night for dining out than the prior year's Tuesday. This provides a minor upward pressure but is unlikely to overcome major headwinds.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Anomalous Comparison Period:** Unlike a typical week, this forecast is for a holiday period being compared against a week that saw +50% growth. The +9.4% average base rate is derived from mostly "normal" weeks and is not representative of the dynamics of this specific comparison.
*   **Intensified Competition:** The competitive landscape is significantly more challenging for OpenTable than it was at the start of 2025. Competitors have had another full year to gain share and integrate their reservation systems into broader restaurant management platforms (e.g., Toast).
*   **Waning Recovery Momentum:** The economic and consumer behavior context has shifted. The start of 2025 was still buoyed by strong post-pandemic recovery dynamics. The start of 2026 faces a more mature, slowing economic cycle.
*   **Market Saturation:** OpenTable's network of 60,000+ restaurants is mature. Growth is now more dependent on the performance of existing clients rather than rapid network expansion, making it more susceptible to macro trends and competition.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior could be centered around the 2025 average weekly growth of +9.4%, but with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=5) to reflect high volatility and the uniqueness of the forecast period.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The +50% growth in the comparison week creates a powerful base effect that makes positive growth mathematically challenging.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Clear evidence of market share erosion to competitors like Toast, meaning OpenTable is capturing a smaller piece of the pie.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The dissipation of post-pandemic "revenge spending" suggests the 2025 peak was an anomaly not to be repeated.
    *   **↓ (Small):** A general macroeconomic environment of slowing growth and persistent inflation will likely dampen discretionary spending.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to a significant downward revision from the prior. The posterior should be centered deep in negative territory.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Stronger-than-expected December retail sales and consumer confidence reports.
    *   OpenTable announcing a major, successful New Year's Eve marketing campaign or promotion.
    *   Unseasonably mild weather across major US and European markets during the last week of December.
    *   Reports of widespread technical issues or outages at competing reservation platforms.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Weak holiday travel numbers from airlines and hotels, suggesting less festive spending.
    *   Negative pre-announcements from publicly traded restaurant groups for Q4 2025.
    *   Spikes in COVID-19 or flu cases that lead to increased cancellations or dining hesitancy.
    *   OpenTable's weekly "State of the Industry" data showing a sharp deceleration in the weeks leading up to the holiday.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **The "Why" of the +50%:** The specific drivers of the massive +50% growth in January 2025 are unknown. It could have been a data artifact, a specific calendar alignment, or a post-COVID surge. This uncertainty in the base period is the largest source of potential error.
*   **Data Definition:** The resolution source is a public-facing tracking page. The methodology for defining the "week ending" and how data is aggregated globally is not fully transparent and could be subject to change.
*   **Global vs. US:** While US-dominant, OpenTable is a global company. A significant, unexpected event in another large market (e.g., UK, Germany, Canada) could disproportion

To forecast the global year-over-year change in seated diners reported by OpenTable for the week ending January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for this forecast is the average weekly year-over-year growth for OpenTable in 2025, which is +9.4%. This reflects the company's typical performance over the past year, providing a stable starting point.
   - The variance is high due to the volatility observed in the weekly growth numbers, ranging from -24% to +50%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The base rate reflects the overall growth trend of OpenTable in 2025.
   - Difference: The specific week ending January 1, 2025, had an exceptionally high growth of +50%, which is not typical and creates a high base effect for comparison.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Base Effect (Large ↓):** The +50% growth in the comparison week makes it challenging to achieve positive growth in 2026.
   - **Market Share Erosion (Moderate ↓):** OpenTable's declining market share due to competition suggests a smaller growth rate.
   - **Macroeconomic Headwinds (Moderate ↓):** Economic slowdown and inflation may reduce discretionary spending on dining.
   - **Return to Normalcy (Moderate ↓):** The dissipation of post-pandemic spending suggests a reversion to more typical growth rates.
   - **Calendar Effects (Small ↑):** New Year's Eve falling on a Wednesday in 2026 provides minor upward pressure.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at +9.4%, the evidence suggests a significant downward revision.
   - The base effect and market share erosion are strong downward pressures, shifting the posterior mean into negative territory.
   - The variance remains high due to the uncertainty and volatility in the data.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a stronger-than-expected economic performance or a successful marketing campaign by OpenTable, could lead to a less negative outcome.
   - However, the overwhelming evidence points to a negative growth rate, and the forecast should account for tail risks of a more significant decline.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles are as follows:

P10: -30%
P20: -25%
P40: -18%
P60: -10%
P80: -5%
P90: 0%

# Forecast: OpenTable Global YoY Change in Seated Diners (Week Ending Jan 1, 2026)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: The most relevant base rate is the YoY change for the same week in the previous year. For the week ending January 5, 2025, OpenTable reported a +50% YoY growth.

**Secondary reference class**: The average weekly YoY growth throughout 2025 was +9.4%, with high volatility (range from -24% to +50%).

**Tertiary reference class**: Market share trends show OpenTable declining from 51% to 46% over two years, suggesting competitive pressure.

For my prior distribution, I'll center it significantly below the +9.4% average, closer to 0%, with a wide variance to reflect the high volatility. This accounts for the general growth trend but acknowledges the exceptional nature of the comparison period.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- OpenTable remains the market leader in restaurant reservations
- The week includes the New Year's holiday, a traditionally strong period for dining
- The general economic environment continues to support dining out

**Key differences**:
- The comparison period (week ending Jan 1, 2025) had an exceptional +50% growth, creating an extremely challenging base effect
- OpenTable's market share has continued to decline due to competition from Resy, Toast Tables, and Yelp
- The post-pandemic "revenge dining" effect that likely boosted early 2025 numbers has fully dissipated
- The economic environment appears to be cooling compared to early 2025

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast downward**:
- **Base effect** (STRONG): The +50% growth in the comparison week creates a mathematical hurdle that makes positive growth highly unlikely. This suggests a high probability of negative YoY change.
- **Market share erosion** (MODERATE): OpenTable's declining market share (from 51% to 46% over two years) indicates competitors are growing faster, directly reducing OpenTable's potential growth.
- **Competitive pressure** (MODERATE): Toast's record growth of 8,500 new locations in Q2 2025 demonstrates the intensity of competition.
- **Normalization** (MODERATE): The exceptional growth in early 2025 likely represented the tail end of post-pandemic recovery, which has now normalized.

**Evidence pushing forecast upward**:
- **Calendar effects** (WEAK): New Year's Eve 2025 falls on a Wednesday vs. Tuesday in the previous year, potentially a slightly more favorable dining day.
- **Continued industry growth** (WEAK): The restaurant industry as a whole continues to grow, albeit at a modest pace.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered around 0% (given the competing forces of industry growth and OpenTable's specific challenges), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update 1 - Base Effect**: The +50% comparison creates a strong downward pressure. This shifts my distribution significantly negative, centered around -15% to -20%.

**Update 2 - Market Share Erosion**: The continued loss of market share (approximately 2.5 percentage points per year) further shifts the distribution downward by about 2-3 percentage points.

**Update 3 - Competitive Pressure**: Evidence of Toast's rapid growth reinforces the market share concerns, adding another 1-2 percentage points downward.

**Update 4 - Calendar Effects**: The slightly more favorable day of week provides a small positive adjustment of perhaps 1-2 percentage points.

The posterior distribution is now centered around -18%, with significant spread due to the historical volatility.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting the base effect. If the +50% in 2025 was due to a one-time anomaly (data error, weather event, etc.), the comparison might not be as challenging.
- I might be underestimating OpenTable's ability to respond to competition with new features or marketing initiatives.
- Global performance could differ significantly from US trends, and international growth might offset US weakness.

**Alternative forecast**: A more optimistic view might center around -5% to -10%, arguing that:
- OpenTable could maintain its user base even with market share loss
- The company might have implemented successful retention strategies
- The restaurant industry could experience stronger-than-expected holiday performance

However, the mathematical reality of comparing against +50% growth makes any positive outcome highly unlikely unless there's an extraordinary and unexpected catalyst.

**Adjustments**: I'll widen my distribution to account for these uncertainties, particularly on the upside, but maintain the negative central tendency.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the average weekly year-over-year (YoY) growth for OpenTable throughout 2025, which the background states was **+9.4%**. This figure represents the company's typical performance over the most recent annual period, capturing its underlying growth trend including factors like network expansion and inflation. However, this base rate comes with high uncertainty, as the weekly numbers in 2025 were extremely volatile, ranging from -24% to +50%. Therefore, I will treat this +9.4% as the center of a very wide prior distribution, reflecting a "business as usual" scenario before considering the specifics of the forecast week.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The situation for the week ending January 1, 2026, is profoundly different from an "average" week in 2025 due to one critical factor:

*   **Anomalous Base Period:** The forecast is for YoY growth compared to the first week of 2025. The research report highlights that the week ending January 5, 2025, saw a massive **+50%** YoY growth. This creates an exceptionally high "base effect," making it mathematically difficult to achieve positive growth in the subsequent year. This is the single most important difference from a typical week.
*   **Intensifying Headwinds:** The competitive and macroeconomic environment has shifted. OpenTable's market share erosion, which was already occurring, has had another year to progress. Similarly, the post-pandemic "revenge spending" tailwind that likely contributed to the early 2025 surge has fully dissipated, replaced by a more cautious consumer in a slowing economy.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the +9.4% prior.

*   **The +50% Base Effect (Massive Downward Pressure):** This is the dominant piece of evidence. To understand its impact, consider a simple model: if "normal" two-year growth from Jan 2024 to Jan 2026 follows the 2025 average trend (a CAGR of 9.4%), the total growth would be (1.094)^2 - 1 ≈ +19.7%. If the first year saw +50% growth, the second year's growth would have to be `(1.197 / 1.50) - 1` ≈ **-20.2%** to return to the trendline. This single piece of evidence shifts the entire distribution from a positive prior to a strongly negative posterior.
*   **Market Share Erosion (Moderate Downward Pressure):** The report notes a decline from 51% to 46% market share in two years, with competitors like Toast growing rapidly. This structural headwind means that even if the overall restaurant reservation market grows, OpenTable will capture a smaller portion. This likely shaves another 3-5 percentage points off its growth relative to the market, pushing the forecast further into negative territory.
*   **Macroeconomic Environment (Moderate Downward Pressure):** The dissipation of post-pandemic recovery effects and a general economic slowdown will likely temper discretionary spending on fine dining compared to the exuberant environment of early 2025. This suggests the overall market growth will be weaker, making the high base even harder to overcome.
*   **Calendar Effect (Small Upward Pressure):** New Year's Eve 2025 falls on a Wednesday, a slightly better night for dining out than the prior year's Tuesday. This provides a minor, positive counter-impetus, perhaps adding 1-2 percentage points, but it is insignificant compared to the major negative drivers.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered at +9.4%.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a much lower outcome. The base effect is so strong that it acts as a powerful anchor.
*   **Update Step:**
    1.  Start with the prior median of +9.4%.
    2.  Apply the base effect calculation, which powerfully pulls the median down to ~-20%.
    3.  Incorporate the market share loss and macro headwinds, which are ongoing drags. This further lowers the median by several points, to roughly -24%.
    4.  Adjust slightly upward for the minor positive calendar effect, perhaps from -24% to -23%.
*   **Posterior:** My final posterior distribution is centered deep in negative territory, with a median around -23% to -24%. The variance remains high due to the inherent volatility of weekly data, but the central tendency has shifted dramatically downward.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis hinges on the +50% figure representing an anomalously strong performance. What if it was a recovery from an anomalously *weak* base in the first week of 2024 (e.g., due to a major storm)? If the 2024 base was unusually low, then the +50% in 2025 might just represent a return to a normal trendline. In that scenario, the 2026 figure could revert to the average growth rate of ~+9.4%.

However, the research report's language ("exceptionally strong performance," "post-pandemic recovery peak," "revenge spending") strongly supports the interpretation that early 2025 was a period of unusually high demand, not just a rebound from a weak comp. While the alternative scenario is possible and argues for not making the upper end of my forecast *too* negative, the primary interpretation remains the most likely.

The biggest risk is a severe, unexpected economic shock (e.g., a sharp recession in late 2025) which could push results even lower than my P10. Conversely, a sudden surge in consumer confidence could soften the decline. My final range must account for this volatility. I will center my distribution around -24% and create a wide 80% confidence interval to reflect these possibilities.
