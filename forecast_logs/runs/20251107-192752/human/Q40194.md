### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Initial phase of new bilateral migration agreements:** New, politically sensitive agreements like this often start extremely slowly due to administrative setup, legal challenges, and political friction. The 2016 EU-Turkey deal, for example, saw only a few hundred returns and resettlements in its first few months, despite a backdrop of hundreds of thousands of arrivals. This class suggests a base rate in the **low tens to low hundreds** for the first 2-3 months of operation.
2.  **Extrapolation from the scheme's own initial data:** The scheme admitted 23 people in its first month of operation (late Sep to late Oct). Extrapolating this rate (~0.75 people/day) over the remaining ~54 days of the year (Nov 7 - Dec 31) would yield approximately 40 more people, for a total of around **60-70**. This serves as a data-driven, albeit naive, base rate.
3.  **UK's non-humanitarian returns programs:** Programs focused on returning individuals (e.g., agreements with Albania) have often struggled to achieve high numbers quickly. They are constrained by legal processes and operational capacity. This class points towards a low outcome, likely **under 100**, as the admissions are capped by the number of returns.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-24** First three people admitted under the scheme. — **↑** — Confirms the agreement is operational, establishing a baseline.
*   **2025-10-09** Total admitted reaches 18 people. — **↑** — Shows continued operation at a rate of roughly one person per day since the first arrivals.
*   **2025-10-24** Total admitted reaches 23 people. — **↓** — The rate of admissions slowed significantly in the preceding 15 days to ~0.33 people/day, suggesting bottlenecks or that the initial group was a pre-arranged "easy" cohort.
*   **2025-10-24** RFI reports the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting. — **↓** — Lack of deterrent effect reduces political capital and incentive for either side to accelerate the program.
*   **2025-11-03** Reports of an 11-day gap in Channel crossings due to bad weather. — **↓** — Fewer crossings mean fewer potential returns, which is the direct input for the "one-in" side of the deal. This highlights a major seasonal constraint.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Number of successful returns to France (Large):** This is the primary driver and a hard ceiling. The agreement is "one-in, one-out." If returns are low due to legal, logistical, or political issues, admissions will be low.
2.  **Weather in the English Channel (Large):** Winter weather drastically reduces crossing attempts. This severely limits the pool of individuals who can be intercepted and returned, thereby capping the number of potential admissions.
3.  **Administrative capacity (Moderate):** The speed of both French processing of returns and UK vetting of online applicants for admission acts as a significant bottleneck. Bureaucratic friction in new systems is typically high.
4.  **Political will and stability of the agreement (Moderate):** As the deal is reportedly failing as a deterrent, political support may wane. Either side could slow-walk implementation if the agreement becomes a political liability.
5.  **Legal challenges (Moderate):** Any legal injunction in the UK or France against the returns process could halt the entire mechanism, freezing admissions at the current number.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Hard 1:1 Linkage:** Unlike most resettlement schemes (e.g., for Ukrainians, Afghans) which are driven by need or quotas, this program's intake is strictly tied to and limited by a parallel, and difficult, returns process.
*   **Extreme Recency and Short Horizon:** The program is brand new, and the resolution is less than two months away. There is very little time to overcome initial "teething problems" and scale up operations before the deadline.
*   **Deterrence as Primary Goal:** The stated goal is deterrence. Since evidence suggests this is failing, the political logic for enthusiastically processing the "admissions" side of the deal is weakened, unlike in purely humanitarian schemes.
*   **Seasonal Headwinds:** The program is ramping up (or failing to) directly into the winter, the period of lowest Channel crossing activity, severely constraining the primary input (returned migrants).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the initial phase of similar bilateral schemes would be centered low, perhaps a Poisson distribution with a mean (λ) around 75, reflecting high uncertainty and a strong possibility of a very low outcome (equivalent n ≈ 2).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The observed admission rate is extremely low (<1 person/day) and has decelerated since the first announcement.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The onset of winter weather provides a powerful physical constraint on the supply of potential returnees, and thus the number of admissions.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Reports of mounting criticism and the failure of the deterrence goal reduce the political incentive to accelerate the scheme.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The inherent administrative friction of a new, complex, two-country process is likely to keep the rate low in the short term.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to a significant downward update. The posterior distribution should be heavily concentrated in the low double digits, likely below 50.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official UK/French government announcements of a successful "batch" of returns.
    *   A joint ministerial statement reaffirming commitment and announcing streamlined processing.
    *   An unusual, prolonged spell of calm weather in the Channel leading to a spike in crossings.
    *   Leaked reports of a target number to be reached by year-end for PR purposes.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any media report of a successful legal challenge to the returns process.
    *   A period of more than two weeks with no new admission numbers being announced.
    *   Statements from French officials expressing frustration or non-cooperation.
    *   Consistently stormy weather in the Channel.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lags and Batching:** The UK Home Office may not release data in real-time. They could announce a larger, batched number shortly before the end of the year, making linear extrapolation unreliable.
*   **Political Symbolism:** The government might orchestrate a single, larger transfer before year-end to claim the policy is working, even if the underlying daily rate is near zero.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criterion is "received visas." This could happen before the person travels, potentially allowing for a last-minute surge in the official number even if no one physically arrives.
*   **Scheme Viability:** The agreement is new and politically fragile. It could be informally or formally suspended before the end of the year, freezing the number at its current level.

**Final Research Summary:** The scheme's operational rate is very low and slowing, heavily constrained by the "one-in, one-out" mechanism. The onset of winter weather will further suppress the number of Channel crossings, creating a hard ceiling on potential admissions, making a final count in the low double-digits highly probable.

To forecast the number of people who will be admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, we will follow the structured probabilistic forecasting approach outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The initial phase of new bilateral migration agreements often starts slowly. The EU-Turkey deal, for example, saw limited activity initially. Given this, a base rate in the low tens to low hundreds for the first few months is appropriate.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** A Poisson distribution with a mean (λ) around 75 reflects high uncertainty and a strong possibility of a low outcome.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to other new migration agreements in its initial phase, characterized by slow administrative processes and political sensitivity.
   - **Difference:** The hard 1:1 linkage with returns, the onset of winter, and the political context (failing deterrence) are unique constraints that likely reduce the number of admissions compared to other agreements.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Observed Admission Rate:** The rate has slowed to ~0.33 people/day, indicating bottlenecks. This suggests lower outcomes are more likely.
   - **Weather Constraints:** Winter weather reduces crossings, limiting potential returns and admissions.
   - **Political and Administrative Factors:** Mounting criticism and administrative friction further suggest a lower number of admissions.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Poisson(λ=75)
   - **Likelihood Adjustments:** The evidence strongly suggests a downward adjustment. The observed rate and external constraints imply a lower mean.
   - **Posterior:** Adjusting for the evidence, the posterior distribution is heavily concentrated in the low double digits, likely below 50.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a political push to increase numbers or a sudden administrative breakthrough.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A last-minute surge due to political pressure or improved weather could increase numbers.
   - **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, ensure the forecast accounts for potential tail risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles are:
P10: 20
P20: 25
P40: 30
P60: 35
P80: 40
P90: 45

# Forecast: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the initial data from the scheme itself, combined with data from similar migration agreements:

- The scheme has admitted 23 people in its first month (Sept 24 - Oct 24, 2025)
- The rate started at ~1 person/day but slowed to ~0.33 people/day in the latter half
- Similar bilateral migration agreements (like the EU-Turkey deal) typically start very slowly
- The agreement is a strict "one-in, one-out" system tied to successful returns to France

Based on these factors, I'll use a prior centered around 50-60 people by the end of 2025, with significant uncertainty. This represents roughly the current 23 people plus a continuation of the recent slower rate (~0.33 people/day) for the remaining ~55 days of 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The scheme remains politically sensitive and administratively complex
- The "one-in, one-out" mechanism continues to be the fundamental constraint
- Both countries still have the same political incentives and administrative systems

**Differences from base rate:**
- We're now entering winter months when Channel crossings typically decrease significantly due to weather
- The scheme is reportedly failing as a deterrent, which may reduce political will to accelerate it
- Administrative systems may improve somewhat as they mature, potentially increasing efficiency
- The approaching year-end might create political pressure for a symbolic "success" batch

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing numbers down:**
- The admission rate has already slowed from ~1 person/day to ~0.33 people/day (strong evidence, ~3x more consistent with lower outcomes)
- Winter weather will severely limit crossing attempts (strong evidence, ~4x more consistent with lower outcomes)
- Reports that the deal is not deterring crossings reduces political incentive (moderate evidence, ~2x more consistent with lower outcomes)
- An 11-day gap in Channel crossings was recently reported due to bad weather (moderate evidence, ~2x more consistent with lower outcomes)

**Evidence pushing numbers up:**
- The scheme is operational and has successfully processed some admissions (weak evidence, ~1.2x more consistent with higher outcomes)
- Political pressure to show results by year-end might lead to a symbolic batch (weak evidence, ~1.5x more consistent with higher outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 50-60 people, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - slowing admission rate:**
- Prior: ~55 people
- Evidence: Rate slowed from ~1/day to ~0.33/day
- Likelihood ratio: ~3x more consistent with lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shifts downward to ~35-40 people

**Second update - winter weather constraints:**
- Prior: ~35-40 people
- Evidence: Winter weather severely limiting crossings
- Likelihood ratio: ~4x more consistent with lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shifts further downward to ~25-30 people

**Third update - political factors:**
- Prior: ~25-30 people
- Evidence: Lack of deterrent effect reducing political will, but potential year-end push
- Likelihood ratio: Net ~1.5x more consistent with lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shifts slightly downward to ~20-25 people as central estimate

The posterior distribution is now centered much lower than my initial prior, with significant weight below 20 and some possibility of outcomes above 40 if there's a political push to show results.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the UK government's determination to make the scheme work despite challenges
- Data reporting lags could mean more people have already been admitted than publicly known
- The definition focuses on "received visas" rather than physical arrivals, which could allow for last-minute processing
- A political decision could be made to accelerate admissions to demonstrate success

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 50-60 people, arguing that:
- Administrative processes will improve over time
- The UK government has strong incentives to show the policy is working
- A year-end push could significantly increase numbers
- The "visas received" criterion could allow for processing without actual travel

**Rebuttal:**
While these points have merit, they're outweighed by:
- The hard constraint of the "one-in, one-out" mechanism
- The severe weather limitations during winter months
- The observed deceleration in admission rates
- The political headwinds from the scheme's apparent failure as a deterrent

To account for these considerations, I'll widen my distribution to allow for more possibility of higher outcomes while keeping the central estimate relatively low.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the performance of new, politically sensitive bilateral migration agreements in their initial phase. Such agreements, like the 2016 EU-Turkey deal, often start extremely slowly due to high administrative friction, the need to establish new operational procedures between two countries, potential legal challenges, and political sensitivities. This reference class suggests a low number, likely in the low tens to low hundreds, for the first 2-3 months of operation.

A secondary, more specific base rate can be derived by naively extrapolating the program's own initial data. In its first month (Sep 24 to Oct 24), the program admitted 23 people. The forecast period ends on Dec 31, which is about 2.2 months after the last data point. A simple linear extrapolation (23 people/month * ~3.2 total months of operation) would suggest a total around **70-80 people**.

Combining these, I will establish a prior distribution centered around a median of **70**, but with a wide spread to reflect the high uncertainty of a new program. For instance, a log-normal distribution where P25 is ~40 and P75 is ~120.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation has several key differences from a generic new resettlement program, most of which suggest a lower outcome than the base rate.

*   **Hard 1:1 Linkage:** Unlike most resettlement schemes, this program's intake is strictly capped by the number of individuals successfully returned to France. This "one-in, one-out" mechanism creates a severe bottleneck, as the returns process is logistically and legally complex.
*   **Strong Seasonal Constraint:** The program is ramping up (or failing to) as winter approaches. Bad weather in the English Channel drastically reduces the number of small boat crossings. This severely limits the "supply" of individuals who can be intercepted and returned, thereby placing a hard, weather-dependent ceiling on the number of admissions.
*   **Deterrence as the Primary Goal:** The agreement's stated purpose is deterrence. The provided background indicates this is failing and criticism is mounting. When a program fails to meet its primary political objective, the political will to overcome administrative hurdles and accelerate its secondary functions (in this case, admissions) often wanes.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the prior.

*   **Initial Admission Rate (3 -> 18 -> 23):** This is the strongest piece of evidence. The rate of admissions was initially ~1 person/day (15 people in 15 days). It then decelerated sharply to ~0.33 people/day (5 people in the next 15 days). This deceleration is a powerful signal that the initial rate was not sustainable, perhaps representing a pre-arranged or "easy" cohort. This evidence strongly pushes the forecast **downward**. It suggests that future performance will be closer to the lower, more recent rate, or even slower.
*   **Seasonality (Winter):** The forecast covers November and December, the months with historically lower crossing attempts due to poor weather. The research report notes an 11-day gap in crossings already occurred due to weather. This physical constraint on the supply of potential returnees is a major factor pushing the forecast **downward**.
*   **Political Context (Failing Deterrent, Mounting Criticism):** The RFI report suggests the political foundation of the deal is weak. This reduces the likelihood that either government will expend significant political capital to accelerate the program's implementation. This is a moderate downward pressure, as it increases the probability of the program stalling or being de-prioritized.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior Median:** ~70 people.
*   **Update from Evidence:** The evidence, particularly the decelerating operational rate and the hard constraint of winter, is overwhelmingly negative.
    *   Let's perform a conceptual update. My prior was centered at 70. The evidence of a decelerating rate (from 1/day to 0.33/day) is highly inconsistent with a final total of 70. If we extrapolate the *new* rate of 0.33/day over the remaining ~68 days (from Oct 24 to Dec 31), we get an additional 22 people (0.33 * 68). This would lead to a total of 23 + 22 = 45.
    *   Now, we must factor in the winter weather, which suggests even the 0.33/day rate is likely optimistic. This pushes the median down further.
*   **Posterior Distribution:** The posterior distribution's median should shift significantly downward from 70 to the **35-45 range**. The distribution will be heavily skewed to the right (positively skewed), with a high concentration of probability on outcomes slightly above the current 23, and a tail for less likely higher outcomes. The variance should also be reduced, as the winter ceiling makes very high outcomes much less plausible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily reliant on the idea that the program will continue as a slow trickle. I need to consider alternative scenarios.

*   **Alternative Forecast (Higher):** The government, for political reasons, could be processing a large batch of returns and visas behind the scenes. They might announce a "success" just before the new year, adding 30-50 people to the total in a single day. This would make my extrapolation-based forecast look foolish. The resolution is based on "visas received," which is an administrative action that could be batched and executed quickly to meet a political goal.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Lower):** The program could collapse entirely. A successful legal challenge in the UK or France, or a political decision by either side to suspend cooperation, could freeze the number at 23 or just slightly above it.
*   **Adjustment:** The "political PR batch" scenario is plausible and represents the main upside risk. I will adjust my upper percentiles (P80, P90) upwards to account for this possibility of a non-linear, politically motivated surge at the end of the year. My lower percentiles are already anchored by the current number and the high probability of stalling, so they seem appropriate.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is anchored by the current known total of 23 people. The central estimate is based on a continued slow, winter-constrained trickle of admissions. The upper tail is widened to account for a potential end-of-year "political batch" announcement, while the lower tail accounts for the risk of the program stalling completely.
