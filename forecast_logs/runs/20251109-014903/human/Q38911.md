Here is the research plan as requested.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **What is the primary legislative vehicle for this change?** Is it exclusively the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), or are there other plausible paths?
2.  **What is the recent history of this specific proposal?** How many times has it been attempted, in what form, and why did it fail?
3.  **Who are the key actors and their current positions?** This includes the leadership of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees (HASC/SASC), party leadership, the White House, and influential interest groups (e.g., social conservatives, feminist organizations, anti-war groups).
4.  **What is the current political context?** What is the partisan control of Congress and the White House in late 2025? How does this issue fit into the broader political landscape (e.g., "culture wars," focus on military readiness)?
5.  **What is the procedural timeline?** Given the question's deadline of January 1, 2026, what are the realistic legislative steps and deadlines that must be met? How does the "takes effect" clause in the resolution criteria impact the probability?
6.  **Are there any non-legislative paths?** Could a new court case or executive action force the issue before the deadline?

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   The NDAA is the only realistic legislative vehicle. It's a "must-pass" bill, but this makes it a target for controversial amendments that are often stripped out in conference committee to ensure final passage.
*   The proposal to include women has a clear pattern of failure. It has been included in the Senate version of the NDAA (e.g., FY22, FY23) but consistently removed during negotiations with the more conservative House. This establishes a strong precedent.
*   The political alignment is unusual. Opposition comes from a "bootleggers and Baptists" coalition of social conservatives (opposed on traditional gender role grounds) and some anti-war progressives (opposed to any expansion of the draft). Support comes from military leaders (for a larger personnel pool) and gender-equality advocates. This cross-cutting opposition makes it difficult to pass.
*   The Supreme Court explicitly deferred to Congress in 2021, making a judicial resolution before 2026 highly improbable. The court is unlikely to reverse its stance of deference so soon.
*   The timeline is extremely compressed. As of November 2025, the FY2026 NDAA would be in its final, contentious conference committee phase. Passing a controversial provision *and* having it take effect within ~50 days is a very high bar. Implementation of such a change would likely require at least a short lead time for the Selective Service System to update its processes, even with its ongoing modernization.
*   The SSS modernization is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. It removes a technical barrier but does not create the political will to pass the law.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Controversial amendments to the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA):** Many are proposed in committee, but few that face significant bipartisan or cross-factional opposition survive the House-Senate conference committee. The base rate for a specific, controversial amendment that has previously failed to pass is very low, likely **<5%**.
*   **Major changes to US military personnel policy:** Significant changes like the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" or opening all combat roles to women are infrequent and typically follow years of public debate, commission reports, and shifting political consensus. Such a change occurring in any given two-year period is rare, suggesting a base rate of **~10%**.
*   **Expansions of federal registration requirements:** Mandating a new segment of the population to register with the federal government is politically difficult and often faces legal and ideological challenges. The base rate for such an expansion being enacted and taking effect within a single year is low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-10-02] SSS announces its registration system modernization will go live in 2025. (↑ small) — Removes a potential technical excuse for delaying implementation, but does not create political will.
*   [2025-01-29] CRS report on FY2025 NDAA notes ongoing discussions but no enactment of female registration. (↔) — Confirms the issue remains a perennial topic but has not gained sufficient traction to become law, reinforcing the status quo.
*   [Hypothetical 2025-07-15] The Senate Armed Services Committee, following its pattern, includes a provision requiring women to register in its version of the FY2026 NDAA. (↑ small) — Repeats a now-familiar first step, but the key obstacle (the House and conference committee) remains.
*   [Hypothetical 2025-09-20] The House version of the FY2026 NDAA, reflecting opposition from a bloc of social conservatives, does not include the provision and may include language explicitly forbidding it. (↓ moderate) — Signals a repeat of the legislative dynamic that has killed the proposal in previous years.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Legislative Inertia & Precedent (Large ↓):** The proposal has failed in at least two prior NDAA cycles. The path of least resistance is to strip the controversial amendment to ensure the must-pass bill is enacted.
*   **"Culture War" Politics (Large ↓):** The issue is framed as a "culture war" battle, activating a powerful and motivated coalition of social conservatives who are strongly opposed. This makes compromise difficult.
*   **Bipartisan/Cross-Ideological Opposition (Moderate ↓):** Opposition from both social conservatives and some anti-war progressives creates a formidable blocking coalition that is harder to overcome than simple partisan opposition.
*   **Military Readiness & Equality Arguments (Moderate ↑):** Proponents, including many military leaders and the 2020 National Commission, argue it is necessary for both national security (doubling the potential pool) and gender equality. This provides a consistent, logical basis for the proposal.
*   **Geopolitical Crisis (Small ↑, potential for Large ↑):** A major war or credible threat of a large-scale conflict could dramatically shift the political calculus, making military readiness the paramount concern and overriding previous objections.
*   **Judicial Deference (Moderate ↓):** The Supreme Court's 2021 decision to defer to Congress removes a key pressure point that could have forced legislative action.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves in less than two months (from Nov 9, 2025). Enacting a law *and* having it take effect in this window is exceptionally difficult for a non-emergency, controversial issue.
*   **Established Pattern of Failure:** Unlike a novel proposal, this specific amendment has a recent, clear track record of being introduced in the Senate and killed by the House/conference committee. This is a strong piece of case-specific evidence.
*   **Unusual Opposition Coalition:** The alliance of social conservatives and anti-militarists is not typical for all defense policy, making this issue uniquely difficult to resolve along standard party lines.
*   **SCOTUS Punt:** The Supreme Court has explicitly passed the decision to Congress, meaning there is no imminent judicial threat forcing lawmakers' hands, a factor that has driven other major policy changes.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10%) based on the reference class of major, controversial military policy changes, with a moderate strength (equivalent n≈15) due to the clear historical patterns.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓↓) The established, multi-year pattern of the NDAA amendment failing in conference is the single strongest piece of evidence against.
    *   (↓↓) The extremely short time remaining for the law to be passed *and take effect* creates a massive procedural hurdle.
    *   (↓) The cross-ideological nature of the opposition makes building a winning coalition exceptionally

To forecast the probability of women being required to register for US Selective Service before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The base rate for controversial amendments to the NDAA passing is low, given historical precedent. The specific amendment for women to register has been proposed and failed multiple times. A reasonable base rate for such a controversial amendment passing is less than 5%. For significant military policy changes, a base rate of around 10% is more appropriate. Given the specific context and repeated failures, we start with a prior probability of 5%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past attempts where the amendment was included in the Senate version but removed in conference. The political dynamics and opposition coalitions remain largely unchanged.
   - **Differences:** The modernization of the Selective Service System removes a technical barrier, but this does not significantly alter the political landscape. The timeline is extremely compressed, making it even more challenging than in previous years.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Likelihood of Passage (P(E | H)):** The modernization of the Selective Service System slightly increases the likelihood of passage, but the entrenched opposition and procedural hurdles remain significant.
   - **Likelihood of Non-Passage (P(E | ~H)):** The repeated failure of the amendment, the strong opposition coalition, and the short timeline all strongly suggest non-passage.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence strongly favors non-passage, with the likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 5% translates to odds of 1:19.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence against passage, we assume a likelihood ratio of 0.1.
   - **Posterior Odds:** 1:19 × 0.1 = 0.1:19, or approximately 0.0053.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 0.0053 / (1 + 0.0053) ≈ 0.53%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be overconfident in non-passage due to the entrenched opposition. However, the short timeline and historical precedent strongly support this view.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A major geopolitical crisis could shift priorities, but this is speculative and not supported by current evidence.
   - **Rebuttals:** The modernization of the system is a positive step, but without political will, it is insufficient.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of women being required to register for US Selective Service before 2026 is very low.

Final: 1%

# Will women be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the probability that women will be required to register for US Selective Service before January 1, 2026.

The most relevant reference class is "controversial amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that have previously failed to pass." This specific proposal to include women in Selective Service registration has been included in Senate versions of the NDAA (FY2022, FY2023) but was removed during conference committee negotiations with the House.

Given this specific history of failure, and the fact that controversial provisions that face significant bipartisan or cross-factional opposition rarely survive the House-Senate conference committee, I'll assign a base rate of **5%**.

This low base rate reflects:
- The established pattern of this specific amendment failing in previous years
- The general difficulty of passing controversial military policy changes
- The cross-ideological opposition from both social conservatives and some anti-war progressives

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The legislative vehicle remains the same (NDAA)
- The political dynamics that led to previous failures (opposition from social conservatives in the House) likely persist
- The issue continues to be framed as part of the "culture wars"

**Differences from base case:**
- The timeline is extremely compressed - as of November 9, 2025, there are less than two months until the resolution date
- For the question to resolve as "Yes," not only must legislation pass, but it must also take effect before January 1, 2026
- The Selective Service System has announced modernization of its registration system going live in 2025, potentially removing a technical barrier to implementation

The compressed timeline is particularly significant and makes this case even less likely than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Pattern of legislative failure**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect to see previous legislative attempts gaining momentum, not repeatedly failing. Probability: 0.2
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we would expect exactly the pattern we've seen - repeated legislative failures. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Supreme Court deference to Congress**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, the Supreme Court's deference is neutral. Probability: 0.5
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, the Court's deference removes a key pressure point that could have forced action. Probability: 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.8 = 0.63 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: SSS modernization in 2025**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect system modernization to prepare for this change. Probability: 0.8
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, system modernization could still occur for other reasons. Probability: 0.6
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.6 = 1.33 (weak evidence in favor)

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeline remaining**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect more time for implementation. Probability: 0.1
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, the short timeline is expected. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (very strong evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence - the extremely short timeline:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = (1/19) × 0.11 = 0.11/19 = 0.0058

Converting back to probability:
Posterior probability = 0.0058 / (1 + 0.0058) = 0.0058 / 1.0058 ≈ 0.0058 ≈ 0.6%

This is an extremely low probability, reflecting the significant time constraints. However, I should consider the other evidence as well.

Updating further with the pattern of legislative failure:
Posterior odds = 0.0058 × 0.22 = 0.001276
Posterior probability = 0.001276 / (1 + 0.001276) ≈ 0.13%

This is becoming unrealistically low. Let me reconsider and be more conservative in my updates.

Starting again with the 5% prior and considering all evidence holistically, I believe the probability should be reduced significantly but not to near-zero levels. The combination of:
1. Previous legislative failures
2. Cross-ideological opposition
3. Extremely short timeline for passage and implementation
4. Lack of judicial pressure

All point to a very low probability, but I should account for unexpected scenarios like emergency legislation due to geopolitical crises.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

What could I be missing?

- **Geopolitical crisis**: A major international conflict could trigger emergency legislation that includes expanding draft registration
- **Surprise bipartisan agreement**: Congressional leadership could reach an unexpected compromise
- **Executive action**: While unlikely, the President might attempt to expand registration through executive order
- **Overconfidence in timeline constraints**: The implementation requirement might be satisfied by a law passed in December that technically takes effect before January 1

The most plausible alternative scenario is a geopolitical crisis triggering emergency legislation. However, even in this scenario, the timeline constraints remain significant.

I may be underestimating the possibility of a law being passed in December with an immediate effective date. However, implementing such a significant change to the Selective Service System would typically require more than a few weeks.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, I believe the probability that women will be required to register for US Selective Service before January 1, 2026 is very low.

The strongest factors are the extremely short timeline remaining, the established pattern of legislative failure, and the cross-ideological opposition to the measure.

While not impossible, the combination of these factors makes it highly unlikely that legislation requiring women to register will both pass and take effect in the less than two months remaining before the resolution date.

```md

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "major, controversial changes to US military personnel policy." Examples include the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" or opening all combat roles to women. These changes are infrequent and typically occur only after years of sustained political debate, commission reports, and a clear shift in public and elite opinion. The probability of such a change being enacted and taking effect within any given two-year congressional session is low. A reasonable starting point, or prior probability, for such an event is approximately **10%**. This translates to prior odds of 1:9 against the event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the general base case in several critical ways, all of which suggest a lower probability:

*   **Similarity:** Like other major policy shifts, this proposal is backed by a formal commission report (the NCMNPS) and has support from parts of the military establishment and gender-equality advocates.
*   **Difference 1 (Timeline):** The most significant factor is the extremely short timeline. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, and the current date is November 9, 2025. This leaves less than eight weeks. For a controversial provision to navigate the final stages of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference committee, pass both houses of Congress, be signed by the President, *and for the law to take effect* within this window is an exceptionally high procedural bar.
*   **Difference 2 (Established Pattern of Failure):** This is not a new proposal. A provision to require women to register was included in the Senate's version of the NDAA in previous years (e.g., for FY2022 and FY2023) but was stripped out during negotiations with the House. This recent and repeated pattern of failure is strong evidence of a stable blocking coalition.
*   **Difference 3 (Nature of Opposition):** The opposition is not purely partisan. It is a powerful, cross-ideological coalition of social conservatives (who oppose on principle) and some anti-war progressives (who oppose any expansion of the draft). This makes it much harder to overcome than a standard party-line disagreement.
*   **Difference 4 (Lack of External Pressure):** In 2021, the Supreme Court explicitly deferred to Congress on this issue. This removed a significant external pressure point that could have forced legislative action, allowing Congress to maintain the status quo without immediate legal threat.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the key evidence in terms of likelihood ratios (P(Evidence | Hypothesis is True) / P(Evidence | Hypothesis is False)).

*   **Evidence: Repeated failure of the amendment in prior NDAA cycles.**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if the proposal is destined to fail again (P(E|~H) is high) than if it is destined to pass (P(E|H) is low). The pattern suggests the underlying political dynamics are stable and unfavorable.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence: The remaining timeline is less than 8 weeks for the law to pass and take effect.**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The legislative process for non-emergency, controversial items is slow. The probability of successfully navigating all remaining steps *and* the law becoming effective within this window is minuscule.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence: The Selective Service System (SSS) modernized its registration system in 2025.**
    *   This removes a potential technical excuse for delay. It is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. The SSS would likely modernize its systems for general efficiency regardless of this specific policy change.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: Slightly > 1 (Slightly increases probability, but is very weak evidence).**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a 10% prior (1:9 odds), we update with the evidence.

1.  **Prior:** 10% (Odds: 1:9)
2.  **Update with repeated legislative failures:** This strong evidence significantly reduces the odds. A likelihood ratio of, say, 0.2 would change the odds to (1/9) * 0.2 ≈ 0.022, or a probability of ~2.2%.
3.  **Update with the extreme time constraint:** This is the decisive factor. The procedural hurdles to pass and implement a law in under two months are immense. This acts as another strong multiplicative factor against, with a likelihood ratio far below 1 (e.g., 0.1 or less). Applying this would push the probability well below 1%.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.022 * 0.1 = 0.0022.
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.0022 / (1 + 0.0022) ≈ 0.2%.

The combined weight of the political opposition, the established pattern of failure, and the severe time constraint drives the probability to a very low value.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong. The most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution is a sudden, massive geopolitical crisis (e.g., the outbreak of a major war involving the US or its key allies) in the next seven weeks. Such an event could create an overwhelming political imperative for military readiness that sweeps aside the usual objections. However, the probability of such a specific, high-impact crisis occurring in this short window is itself very low. Another possibility is a surprise political "grand bargain," but the ideological nature of the opposition makes this highly unlikely. My forecast of <1% is low, but it correctly reflects that a "Yes" resolution would require an extraordinary and unexpected event to overcome the immense procedural and political inertia. The 1% accounts for this "unknown unknown" or black swan possibility.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial 10% base rate is dramatically reduced by overwhelming evidence. The consistent failure of this proposal in recent legislative cycles, combined with the extremely short time remaining for a law to be passed *and take effect*, makes a "Yes" resolution exceptionally unlikely. The political dynamics of the cross-ideological opposition remain a stable barrier. The only plausible path to success involves a low-probability, high-impact external shock like a major war. Therefore, the final probability is very low.

Final: 1%
