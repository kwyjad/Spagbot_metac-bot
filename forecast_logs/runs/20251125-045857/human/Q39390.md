### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All UK Christmas #1s (1952-2024):** This class includes all 73 winners. It provides the broadest historical context but is limited by significant structural changes in the music industry (e.g., the shift from physical sales to streaming).
    *   **Base Rates (n=73):**
        *   1960s or earlier: ~21%
        *   1970s: ~14%
        *   1980s: ~14% (boosted by the last two years)
        *   1990s: ~11%
        *   2000s: ~14%
        *   2010s: ~11%
        *   2020s: ~5%
    *   **Reasoning:** Simple count of original release decades for all winners. The key limitation is that for most of this period (pre-2009), the winner was almost always a contemporary release.

2.  **Post-Streaming & Social Media Campaign Era (2009-2024):** This class begins with the Rage Against the Machine campaign, which broke the dominance of contemporary TV talent show winners and demonstrated the power of organized online movements. It better reflects the modern mechanics of the chart race.
    *   **Base Rates (n=16):**
        *   1980s: 12.5% (2 wins: Wham! x2)
        *   1990s: 6.25% (1 win: RATM)
        *   2000s: 6.25% (1 win: The Justice Collective)
        *   2010s: 50% (8 wins: various X Factor, charity, LadBaby)
        *   2020s: 25% (4 wins: LadBaby, Ed Sheeran/Elton John)
    *   **Reasoning:** This period shows a bimodal distribution: either a very recent song (2010s/2020s) driven by a campaign/major release, or a much older song driven by a protest campaign or streaming.

3.  **Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024):** This is the most recent and arguably most relevant reference class. It reflects the current environment where there is no single, dominant, guaranteed contemporary contender, leaving a power vacuum.
    *   **Base Rates (n=2):**
        *   1980s: 100% (Wham!'s "Last Christmas" won both years)
    *   **Reasoning:** While the sample size is extremely small, it represents the "new normal" where, absent a major campaign, a perennially popular streaming classic becomes the default winner.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2023-11-21** LadBaby announces they will not release a 2023 Christmas single — ↑ (for older decades) — This ended a five-year streak of contemporary (2010s/2020s) winners, creating a power vacuum and opening the door for a non-campaign song to win.
*   **2023-12-22** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) becomes the Christmas #1 — ↑ (for 1980s) — Confirmed that in the absence of a LadBaby-style campaign, a streaming classic could triumph, establishing a new potential default outcome.
*   **2024-12-20** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) repeats as Christmas #1 — ↑ (for 1980s) — This historic second consecutive win reinforces the "classic-by-default" hypothesis, suggesting the 2023 result was not a fluke but the start of a new regime.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Streaming Inertia (Large):** Perennial Christmas classics ("Last Christmas," "All I Want for Christmas Is You") are embedded in millions of playlists and receive massive, passive streaming volume every December. In a quiet year, this is now the most powerful mechanism.
2.  **Coordinated Novelty/Charity Campaign (Large):** A highly organized campaign, typically for charity and with a strong social media presence (e.g., LadBaby). This mechanism can easily overpower streaming inertia but its appearance is not guaranteed.
3.  **Major Artist Contemporary Release (Moderate-Large):** A genuine Christmas-themed single from a globally recognized artist (e.g., Ed Sheeran & Elton John in 2021). This can win but is less common and faces stiff competition from classics and campaigns.
4.  **Social Media "Rebellion" Campaign (Moderate):** A grassroots, often anti-establishment, campaign to propel an unlikely older song to the top (e.g., Rage Against the Machine, 2009). This is a wildcard event, difficult to predict and replicate.
5.  **Tribute Campaign (Small-Moderate):** A campaign to get a song by a recently deceased or culturally significant artist to number one. This is event-driven and has had mixed success in the past (e.g., The Pogues after Shane MacGowan's death in late 2023, which did not win).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The LadBaby Vacuum:** Unlike the 2018-2022 period, there is no longer a reliable, dominant, contemporary "event" single occupying the top spot. This void is the single biggest difference from the recent past.
*   **Primacy of Streaming:** Compared to the long-term historical base rate (Reference Class 1), streaming has fundamentally changed the charts. Older songs are no longer just memories; they are active, high-volume competitors every year, a phenomenon impossible in the era of physical sales.
*   **Proven Success of Classics:** The wins for "Last Christmas" in 2023 and 2024 have created a focal point. The public and media now see winning as a real possibility for these songs, potentially creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where they attract more attention and streams.
*   **Potential Campaign Fatigue:** After five years of LadBaby and the earlier X Factor dominance, the public may have less appetite for another manufactured-feeling campaign, potentially raising the bar for a new contemporary act to break through.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be based on the Post-RATM era (2009-2024), giving significant weight to contemporary releases (2010s/2020s ~75%) but with a non-trivial chance for an older song (~25%). Equivalent n ≈ 16.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (older decades):** LadBaby's confirmed absence for two years creates a structural break from the immediate past. (Large)
    *   **↑ (1980s specifically):** Wham!'s 2023 victory established a new "classic-by-default" precedent. (Large)
    *   **↑ (1980s specifically):** Wham!'s 2024 repeat victory strongly confirms this new regime is not a one-off event. (Large)
    *   **↓ (2020s):** The lack of any obvious successor to the LadBaby model suggests the "coordinated campaign" mechanism is currently dormant. (Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift dramatically away from the 2020s and 2010s and heavily towards the 1980s. The evidence of the last two years is so strong and consistent that it suggests a regime change, warranting a very substantial update from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring older decades):**
    *   Early December betting odds list Wham!, Mariah Carey (1990s), or The Pogues (1980s) as the top 3 favorites.
    *   No announcement of a major, well-organized charity or novelty single by the first week of December.
    *   Music industry news and social media chatter focuses on the "battle of the classics" rather than a new contender.
    *   A major artist (e.g., Taylor Swift, Adele) releases a non-Christmas-themed single in late November, which will likely fade as holiday streaming ramps up.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring 2020s):**
    *

To forecast the decade in which the 2025 UK Christmas number one will have been originally released, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Reference Class 3: Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024)**
- **Base Rates:**
  - 1980s: 100% (Wham!'s "Last Christmas" won both years)
- **Reasoning:** This is the most recent and relevant reference class, reflecting the current environment where there is no single dominant contemporary contender. The small sample size is a limitation, but it captures the current trend.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarity:** The current environment lacks a dominant contemporary contender, similar to the past two years where Wham!'s "Last Christmas" won.
- **Difference:** The absence of a major campaign or new contender could change the dynamics, but no strong evidence suggests a shift away from the current trend.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **LadBaby's Absence:** Increases the likelihood of older songs winning due to the absence of a dominant contemporary campaign.
  - **P(E | 1980s):** High, as this aligns with the recent trend.
  - **P(E | other decades):** Lower, as they haven't shown similar dominance recently.
  
- **Streaming Inertia:** Favors perennial classics like "Last Christmas."
  - **P(E | 1980s):** High, as streaming supports older hits.
  - **P(E | other decades):** Lower, unless another classic gains similar traction.

- **No Major New Release:** No evidence of a strong contemporary contender emerging.
  - **P(E | 1980s):** High, as it suggests continuity of the current trend.
  - **P(E | other decades):** Lower, as they would need a strong new release to compete.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior Odds for 1980s:** Based on the Post-LadBaby Era, the prior heavily favors the 1980s.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Strong evidence from streaming inertia and lack of new contenders further supports the 1980s.
- **Posterior Probability:** The evidence strongly supports the 1980s, with other decades having significantly lower probabilities.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise campaign or new release.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major artist could release a new Christmas hit, but no evidence currently supports this.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strong evidence for the 1980s, minimal adjustment is needed, but maintain awareness of potential shifts.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Option_1: 1960s or earlier: 1%  
Option_2: 1970s: 1%  
Option_3: 1980s: 85%  
Option_4: 1990s: 3%  
Option_5: 2000s: 3%  
Option_6: 2010s: 4%  
Option_7: 2020s: 3%  

The forecast heavily favors the 1980s due to the recent trend and lack of strong contemporary contenders.

# Forecasting the Decade of the 2025 UK Christmas Number One

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates from three reference classes, with increasing recency and relevance:

**Reference Class 1: All UK Christmas #1s (1952-2024)**
- 1960s or earlier: ~21%
- 1970s: ~14%
- 1980s: ~14% 
- 1990s: ~11%
- 2000s: ~14%
- 2010s: ~11%
- 2020s: ~5%

**Reference Class 2: Post-Streaming Era (2009-2024)**
- 1980s: 12.5% (2 wins: Wham! x2)
- 1990s: 6.25% (1 win: RATM)
- 2000s: 6.25% (1 win: The Justice Collective)
- 2010s: 50% (8 wins)
- 2020s: 25% (4 wins)

**Reference Class 3: Post-LadBaby Era (2023-2024)**
- 1980s: 100% (Wham!'s "Last Christmas" both years)

I'll use Reference Class 2 as my primary base rate, with adjustments from the other classes. This gives us:
- 1960s or earlier: 0%
- 1970s: 0%
- 1980s: 12.5%
- 1990s: 6.25%
- 2000s: 6.25%
- 2010s: 50%
- 2020s: 25%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The streaming-dominated chart environment remains
- Social media campaigns can still mobilize fans
- Christmas classics continue to have streaming advantages

**Key differences:**
- The LadBaby vacuum persists (no guaranteed contemporary contender)
- Wham!'s "Last Christmas" has now won twice consecutively (2023-2024), establishing a new pattern
- The success of older songs has created a template for streaming-driven classics to win
- By 2025, we'll be deeper into the 2020s, with more potential for new contemporary hits

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: LadBaby's absence**
- P(E|1980s): Very high - creates space for classics like "Last Christmas"
- P(E|2020s): Low - removes a guaranteed contemporary winner

**Evidence 2: Wham!'s consecutive wins (2023-2024)**
- P(E|1980s): Very high - demonstrates 80s classics can win repeatedly
- P(E|1990s): Moderate - suggests other classics (like Mariah Carey) could follow
- P(E|2020s): Low - shows contemporary songs struggling without campaigns

**Evidence 3: Streaming's structural impact**
- P(E|1980s/1990s): High - benefits perennial classics embedded in playlists
- P(E|2020s): Moderate - new hits can still gain traction but face established competition

**Evidence 4: Deeper into 2020s by Christmas 2025**
- P(E|2020s): Moderate-high - more time for potential new Christmas standards to emerge
- P(E|1980s): Moderate - the pattern may continue but could be challenged by new hits

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the strongest evidence: Wham!'s consecutive wins in 2023-2024.

For the 1980s:
- Prior odds: 12.5% / 87.5% = 0.143
- Likelihood ratio: ~5 (the evidence strongly favors 1980s)
- Posterior odds: 0.143 × 5 = 0.715
- Posterior probability: 0.715 / (1 + 0.715) ≈ 41.7%

For the 2020s:
- Prior odds: 25% / 75% = 0.333
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (the evidence moderately disfavors 2020s)
- Posterior odds: 0.333 × 0.5 = 0.167
- Posterior probability: 0.167 / (1 + 0.167) ≈ 14.3%

For the 1990s (considering Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You"):
- Prior odds: 6.25% / 93.75% = 0.067
- Likelihood ratio: ~3 (the evidence moderately favors 1990s classics)
- Posterior odds: 0.067 × 3 = 0.201
- Posterior probability: 0.201 / (1 + 0.201) ≈ 16.7%

Updating on the "deeper into 2020s" evidence:
- This slightly increases 2020s probability to ~18%
- Slightly decreases 1980s to ~38%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the recent Wham! pattern (recency bias)
- I'm not accounting for potential new campaigns that could emerge
- A major artist death could trigger a tribute campaign for their catalog
- The 2025 Christmas chart could see rule changes affecting streaming weighting

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A new charity campaign emerges with the scale of LadBaby
- A major artist (Taylor Swift, Adele, etc.) releases a Christmas song that becomes a phenomenon
- A viral TikTok campaign propels an unexpected older song to #1
- Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994) finally gets its UK Christmas #1

**Adjustments:**
- Increase 2020s probability slightly to account for potential new hits
- Increase 1990s slightly to account for Mariah Carey's perennial strength
- Slightly decrease 1980s to avoid overconfidence in the Wham! pattern

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and adjustments:
- 1960s or earlier: ~1% (minimal chance but not impossible)
- 1970s: ~2% (slightly higher than 1960s but still unlikely)
- 1980s: ~35% (strong chance due to Wham! pattern)
- 1990s: ~18% (significant chance, primarily Mariah Carey)
- 2000s: ~5% (limited contenders from this era)
- 2010s: ~19% (still relevant contemporary songs)
- 2020s: ~20% (new releases have a solid chance)

## 7. Final Forecast

1960s or earlier: 1%
1970s: 2%
1980s: 35%
1990s: 18%
2000s: 5%
2010s: 19%
2020s: 20%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, the most relevant reference class is the **Post-Social Media Campaign Era (2009-2024)**. This period of 16 years begins with the successful Rage Against the Machine campaign, which demonstrated that organized online efforts could disrupt the chart, and it fully encompasses the era of streaming's dominance. This is a better prior than the entire history of the chart (1952-present), which is distorted by different music consumption technologies (physical singles) and industry structures (the X Factor monopoly).

Based on the original release decade of the winning song for these 16 years (2009-2024), the base rates are:
*   **1960s or earlier:** 6% (1 win: The Justice Collective, 2012)
*   **1970s:** 13% (2 wins: NHS Choir, 2015; LadBaby, 2020)
*   **1980s:** 31% (5 wins: LadBaby x3, Wham! x2)
*   **1990s:** 6% (1 win: Rage Against the Machine, 2009)
*   **2000s:** 0%
*   **2010s:** 38% (6 wins: various X Factor winners and contemporary artists)
*   **2020s:** 6% (1 win: LadBaby, 2021)

This prior suggests a bimodal world: either a very contemporary song (2010s) or a classic, often from the 1980s, propelled by a campaign.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The 2025 race will operate under the same fundamental mechanics as the 2009-2024 period: a combination of streaming, sales, and the potential for social media campaigns to influence the outcome.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the establishment of a new "default" winner. From 2018-2022, the default was a contemporary LadBaby song. Since LadBaby's exit, the default has become Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984), which won in both 2023 and 2024. This represents a significant structural shift *within* the modern era. The power of passive streaming for a perennial classic has been proven to be sufficient to win in the absence of a major, organized campaign.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most crucial pieces of evidence are the results from 2023 and 2024.

*   **Evidence:** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) won the Christmas #1 in both 2023 and 2024.
*   **Likelihood Assessment:**
    *   **P(Evidence | 1980s will win in 2025) is very high.** These back-to-back wins establish a powerful precedent and a new status quo. It suggests that the 1980s classic is now the song to beat, making another 1980s win (most likely the same song) the most probable outcome.
    *   **P(Evidence | A contemporary [2020s] song will win in 2025) is very low.** If a contemporary song were the likely winner, it would imply that the wins by "Last Christmas" were flukes. Two consecutive wins make this highly improbable. It shows that the bar for a new song to overcome the streaming inertia of a classic is now extremely high.

This evidence provides a very strong likelihood ratio in favor of the 1980s option over all others, especially the contemporary 2020s option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the prior odds for the 1980s vs. all other decades.

*   **Prior Odds (1980s vs. Not-1980s):** The prior probability for the 1980s was 31%. The odds were 31 / (100 - 31) = 31 / 69, or approximately 0.45 to 1.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence of two consecutive wins by an 80s classic is extremely strong. It suggests the underlying system has changed from the one that produced the 2009-2022 results. A qualitative estimate of the likelihood ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H)) would be very large, perhaps 10:1 or more.
*   **Posterior Odds Calculation (Conceptual):** Posterior Odds ≈ 0.45 × 10 = 4.5 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** This corresponds to a probability of 4.5 / (1 + 4.5) ≈ 82%. This seems too high and potentially overconfident based on just two data points. A more conservative update is warranted.

Let's use a more qualitative approach. The evidence confirms a new regime where an 80s classic is the default. This dramatically increases the probability for the 1980s and suppresses the probability for contemporary decades (2010s, 2020s).

1.  **1980s:** Starts at 31%. The evidence of a new, stable "classic-by-default" regime, proven twice, boosts this significantly. It is now the clear frontrunner. I will place its probability above 50%.
2.  **2020s:** Starts at 6%. This is the most likely alternative, representing the chance that a new LadBaby-style campaign or a major artist release successfully unseats the default. This probability should increase from the low base rate, as it's the main source of a potential upset.
3.  **1990s:** Starts at 6%. This option's chances are almost entirely dependent on Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994), the other streaming behemoth. It's a plausible contender if a campaign forms around it.
4.  **2010s:** Starts at 38%. This high prior is now misleading. It was driven by the X Factor and early LadBaby era, mechanisms that are no longer active. This decade is now too old to be "current" but too new to be a "classic." Its probability must be drastically reduced.
5.  **Other decades (1970s, 1960s, 2000s):** These decades contain beloved classics but none with the demonstrated streaming power of Wham! or Mariah. They remain low-probability outsiders.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary forecast is that the 1980s will win, likely via "Last Christmas" for a third consecutive year. The biggest risk to this forecast is over-weighting the last two years and underestimating the potential for a novel challenger to emerge. The music and social media landscape is dynamic; a new viral TikTok song or a perfectly executed charity campaign for a new (2020s) song is the most plausible alternative scenario. The failure of the Pogues campaign in 2023, despite a strong narrative, suggests this is difficult, but not impossible. Therefore, the 2020s option must retain a significant minority share of the probability. I will also assign a non-trivial probability to the 1990s for Mariah Carey, the most direct competitor to Wham!.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updating and red team thinking, I will construct the final probability distribution.

*   **1980s (55%):** The clear favorite. This reflects the high probability that the new "status quo" of "Last Christmas" winning by default continues. It also includes other 80s classics like The Pogues.
*   **2020s (18%):** The most likely challenger. This captures the possibility of a new, successful campaign for a contemporary song, a major artist release, or a viral phenomenon.
*   **1990s (14%):** The second most likely challenger, almost entirely representing Mariah Carey's chances.
*   **1970s (6%):** For other classics like Slade or Wizzard, which have an outside chance.
*   **2010s (4%):** Drastically downgraded from the prior, as this decade seems stuck in a relevance trough.
*   **1960s or earlier (2%):** The least likely outcome, requiring a very specific and successful tribute campaign.
*   **2000s (1%):** Very few major Christmas contenders from this decade.

The sum is 55 + 18 + 14 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 100%.
