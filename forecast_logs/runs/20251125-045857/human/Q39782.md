### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Longest Field Goal by Season (2015–2024).** In the last decade of the pre-2025 era, the longest field goal in a regular season has typically fallen in the 61- to 64-yard range.
    -   *Base Rate:* The median longest kick in this period is 62 yards. The mean is 62.5 yards. The maximum was Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021. The distribution is tight, with 8 of 10 seasons seeing a longest kick between 61 and 64 yards.
    -   *Reasoning:* This class captures the modern era of kicking specialization and athleticism before the 2025 rule changes and the emergence of new talent like Cam Little. It establishes a baseline for what a "normal" season-long maximum looks like.
-   **Reference Class 2: Seasons with a New Longest Field Goal Record.** Since 1970, the official record has been broken five times (Dempsey 1970, Elam 1998, Prater 2013, Tucker 2021, Little 2025).
    -   *Base Rate:* The record is broken, on average, once every 11 years. It is extremely rare for the record to be broken and then broken *again* in the same season. There is no modern precedent for this.
    -   *Reasoning:* This class highlights the outlier nature of the current situation. The 2025 season is already a record-breaking year. This reference class suggests that the current record of 68 yards is highly likely to be the final value, as such events are not typically surpassed immediately.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-08-09** Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. — **↑** — Demonstrates a new, previously unproven maximum human capability in a live (though unofficial) NFL game setting.
-   **2025-09-05** NFL regular season begins with a new rule allowing teams to practice with "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. — **↑** — Plausible mechanism for increased maximum distance, as kickers can "break in" balls to their liking, potentially making them travel farther.
-   **2025-09-29** Through Week 4, two field goals of 64 and 65 yards are made by different kickers. — **↑** — Suggests a league-wide increase in maximum range, not just an isolated phenomenon with one kicker. Reinforces the impact of the K-ball rule or other systemic factors.
-   **2025-10-27** (Date estimated) Cam Little kicks a 68-yard field goal in a regular season game, setting the new official NFL record. — **↑** — Establishes a new, very high floor for the final resolution (it cannot be less than 68). It also confirms Little's ability to perform at extreme distances under official game pressure.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Kicker Specialization & Talent (Large):** Athletes are specializing in kicking earlier and are physically stronger and more technically refined than previous generations. The emergence of a young talent like Cam Little, who combines leg strength with accuracy, is the primary driver.
-   **"K-Ball" Rule Change (Moderate):** The new rule allowing kickers to prepare their game balls all week is a significant change. While its effect on overall 50+ yard accuracy is not yet clear, it could provide the marginal gains (1-2 yards) needed to break a record by allowing kickers to optimize the ball's condition.
-   **Favorable Conditions (Moderate):** A record-breaking attempt requires ideal conditions. This includes playing in a dome (no wind/weather) or at high altitude (e.g., Denver, Mexico City) where the ball travels farther. The probability of a new record increases if a strong-legged kicker has remaining games in such venues.
-   **Game Situation (Large):** Attempts over ~62 yards are almost exclusively made at the end of a half or the end of a game. In these situations, a miss has a low cost (the half/game ends, or the opponent gets the ball in poor field position anyway), incentivizing coaches to take a low-probability, high-reward chance. The number of such opportunities is a key driver.
-   **Psychological Barriers (Small):** Now that 66 yards has been surpassed and 68 yards has been achieved, coaches and kickers may be more willing to attempt kicks from 67-69 yards. The "impossible" has become "possible," slightly increasing the chance of an attempt.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **The Record Has Already Been Broken:** Unlike a typical season where the question is *if* the longest kick will reach the low 60s, the 2025 season has already seen a new all-time NFL record of 68 yards. The question is now about the probability of a second, even more extreme outlier event in the same season.
-   **A New Generational Kicker:** Cam Little has demonstrated unprecedented range (70 yards in preseason, 68 in regular season) as a very young player. The presence of a kicker with this proven capability is a major deviation from the norm.
-   **The K-Ball Rule Is Novel:** This is the first season with the new rule. Its full effect on maximum kicking distance is unknown, but it represents a structural change from all prior seasons in the reference class, favoring longer kicks.
-   **Multiple Kickers Showing 64+ Range:** The fact that 64 and 65-yard kicks were made early in the season by others suggests the potential for a record attempt is not limited solely to Cam Little, increasing the overall number of potential "at-bats."

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Based on the 2015-2024 reference class, a reasonable prior for the season's longest field goal would be a distribution centered around 63 yards, with a long tail acknowledging the possibility of a record-breaking kick like Tucker's 66-yarder. (Equivalent n ~10 seasons).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↑ (Large):** Cam Little's 68-yard official record sets a hard floor and proves a new capability threshold. This single event forces the posterior distribution to have zero mass below 68 yards.
    -   **↑ (Moderate):** The new K-ball rule provides a causal reason to believe maximum distances are systemically easier to achieve this season than in the past.
    -   **↑ (Large):** Little's 70-yard preseason kick provides strong evidence of his maximum potential range, suggesting 68 yards is not his absolute limit.
    -   **↑ (Small):** Other long kicks (64, 65 yards) this season suggest a broader environmental effect, increasing the chances that another kicker might get an opportunity in ideal conditions.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence dramatically shifts the distribution upward. The prior, centered around 63, is now obsolete. The posterior is a new distribution starting at 68 yards. The key question for the posterior is the probability mass at 69, 70, and beyond, which, while small, is significantly larger than it would have been before this season's events.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Any remaining games for Cam Little (Jaguars) or other strong-legged kickers (e.g., Brandon Aubrey, Jake Moody) scheduled in domes or at altitude.
    -   Press reports or pre-game footage of kickers successfully making kicks from 68+ yards in practice.
    -   Close games involving teams with strong-legged kickers, creating end-of-half/game scenarios.
    -   A successful 66 or 67-yard field goal by any kicker, which would signal the 68-yard record is within reach for others.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The current record of 68 yards holding through the end of Week 17, leaving only one week of games.
    -   An injury to Cam Little or another top kicker with extreme range.
    -   Jaguars playing in cold, windy, or wet outdoor stadiums for the remainder of the season.
    -   A series of blow-out games across the league, reducing the number of last-second, long-distance field goal attempts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Extreme Outlier Event:** A 68-yard field goal is already a massive statistical outlier. The probability of improving on such an extreme event in the short remainder of the season is inherently very low.
-   **Opportunity is Rare:** The specific confluence of factors needed (end of half/game, perfect weather/dome, correct field position, coach's approval) is rare. There may be zero further attempts from 68+ yards this season.
-   **Focus on a Single Actor:** While other kickers are strong, the most likely candidate to break the 68-yard record is the person who set it. An injury to Cam Little would dramatically lower the odds of a longer kick.
-   **Small Sample Size:** With only a few weeks left in the regular season, the window of opportunity is small. The base rate of attempts from this distance is close to zero.

**Final Research Summary:**
The longest field goal of the 2025 season is already a new NFL record of 68 yards. While a confluence of factors—a generational kicker, a new rule favoring distance, and lowered psychological barriers—makes a 69+ yard kick plausible, breaking an extreme record twice in one season is historically unprecedented and would require a rare combination of opportunity and execution in the season's final weeks.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Longest Field Goal by Season (2015–2024) with a median of 62 yards and a mean of 62.5 yards. This captures the modern era of kicking before 2025.
   - **Reference Class 2:** Seasons with a New Longest Field Goal Record, broken on average once every 11 years. This highlights the rarity of breaking a record twice in one season.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the 2025 context, the prior will be centered around the new record of 68 yards, acknowledging the historical rarity of surpassing such a record within the same season.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The 2025 season has already seen a new record, aligning with the base rate's expectation of rare record-breaking events.
   - **Differences:** The presence of Cam Little and the new K-ball rule are significant deviations, suggesting a higher potential for another record-breaking event.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Cam Little's 68-yard record:** Sets a new floor, indicating that any longer kick must exceed this distance.
   - **70-yard preseason kick:** Demonstrates potential for even longer kicks, increasing the likelihood of surpassing 68 yards.
   - **K-ball rule:** Provides a systemic advantage, potentially increasing maximum distances.
   - **Other long kicks (64, 65 yards):** Suggests a broader league-wide capability for long kicks.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 68 yards with a long tail for potential longer kicks.
   - **Evidence:** Strongly shifts the distribution upwards, focusing on the possibility of 69+ yards.
   - **Posterior:** The mean shifts slightly above 68 yards, with increased variance to account for the potential of a new record.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The rarity of breaking a record twice in one season suggests caution.
   - **Tail Risks:** Consideration of ideal conditions (e.g., dome, altitude) and game situations that could enable a longer kick.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A conservative forecast would place the longest kick at 68 yards, but given the evidence, a slight upward adjustment is justified.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles reflect a distribution acknowledging the potential for a new record but tempered by historical rarity.

P10: 68  
P20: 68  
P40: 68  
P60: 69  
P80: 69  
P90: 70

# Forecast: Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Reference Class 1: Longest Field Goal by Season (2015-2024)**
- Median: 62 yards
- Mean: 62.5 yards
- Range: Typically 61-64 yards, with Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021 as an outlier

**Reference Class 2: All-time NFL Field Goal Records**
- The progression shows records are broken approximately once every 11 years
- Records tend to increase by 1-3 yards each time they're broken

I'll use a prior centered around 63 yards with a standard deviation of about 2 yards, reflecting the typical season-long maximum field goal distance before 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental physics of kicking hasn't changed
- Game situations that allow for extremely long attempts remain rare
- Most stadiums and weather conditions remain the same

**Key differences:**
- We already know the longest field goal of the 2025 season is at least 68 yards (Cam Little)
- The new K-ball rule allows kickers to practice with game balls all week
- Cam Little has demonstrated 70-yard capability in preseason
- Multiple kickers have made 64+ yard field goals early in the season
- The psychological barrier of what's possible has shifted

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Cam Little's 68-yard regular season field goal**
- This establishes a hard floor of 68 yards
- Likelihood ratio: Infinite in favor of ≥68 yards vs. <68 yards

**Evidence 2: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason field goal**
- Demonstrates physical capability for 70 yards under game-like conditions
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 in favor of a potential 69+ yard kick vs. exactly 68 yards

**Evidence 3: New K-ball rule allowing practice with game balls**
- Creates a plausible mechanism for increased maximum distances
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 in favor of longer kicks than historical norms

**Evidence 4: Multiple 64+ yard field goals early in the season**
- Suggests a broader trend, not just one exceptional kicker
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 in favor of continued long-distance success

**Evidence 5: Historical rarity of breaking records twice in one season**
- No precedent for breaking the all-time record twice in the same season
- Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 against exceeding 68 yards

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 63 yards, I need to update given the evidence:

1. **First major update**: Cam Little's 68-yard field goal completely shifts the distribution, creating a hard floor at 68 yards. This is an extreme update that eliminates all probability mass below 68.

2. **Second update**: Considering Little's 70-yard preseason kick:
   - Prior (after first update): 100% at 68 yards
   - Likelihood: ~3× more likely to see a 69+ yard kick given demonstrated 70-yard capability
   - Posterior: Shifts probability mass above 68 yards, with perhaps 25% chance of exceeding 68

3. **Third update**: Considering historical rarity of breaking records twice:
   - This dampens the optimism from the previous update
   - Final posterior: Still centered heavily at 68 yards, but with meaningful probability mass at 69-70 yards

The posterior distribution is now:
- Heavily weighted at 68 yards (~70-75%)
- Moderate probability at 69 yards (~15-20%)
- Small probability at 70 yards (~5-8%)
- Very small probability at 71+ yards (~2-5%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the K-ball rule change
- With ~6 weeks remaining in the season, there are still many opportunities for attempts
- Altitude games in Denver or Mexico City could provide ideal conditions
- End-of-season games might see more risk-taking by teams out of playoff contention

**Potential underestimation:**
- The 68-yard kick may have been a perfect confluence of factors unlikely to repeat
- Coaches are still extremely conservative about attempting 65+ yard kicks
- Weather typically worsens in December, reducing long-distance opportunities
- The specific game situations needed for such attempts are exceedingly rare

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would place more weight on 69-70 yards, arguing that the K-ball rule change is more significant than we realize and that Cam Little's demonstrated capability makes another record-breaking kick likely. However, the historical rarity of such extreme events and the limited remaining opportunities make this less plausible.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential biases, I'll provide my calibrated forecast:

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 69
P80: 70
P90: 71

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary reference class is the longest field goal by season in the modern era (2015-2024). This period reflects modern training, specialization, and athleticism before the unique events of the 2025 season.

*   **Base Rate Distribution:**
    *   **Median:** 62 yards.
    *   **Mean:** 62.5 yards.
    *   **Spread:** This distribution is tight. 8 of the 10 seasons in this period saw a longest kick between 61 and 64 yards. The maximum was Justin Tucker's then-record 66-yard field goal in 2021.
*   **Reasoning:** This base rate establishes what a "normal" season's maximum looks like. It highlights that values in the low 60s are typical, and anything approaching the mid-60s is exceptional. This prior serves as a starting point to measure how extreme the 2025 season already is.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base case, rendering the prior distribution obsolete for direct forecasting but useful for context.

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental constraints of the sport remain. Attempts from extreme distances (>65 yards) are still exceedingly rare, requiring a specific end-of-half or end-of-game situation, favorable weather (or a dome), and a coach's willingness to take a low-probability chance.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **New Record Already Set:** The longest field goal is *already* 68 yards, set by Cam Little. This establishes a hard floor for the final value. The forecast is no longer about reaching the mid-60s, but about surpassing an all-time record that was just set.
    2.  **Demonstrated Higher Ceiling:** Cam Little's 70-yard preseason field goal provides strong evidence that his 68-yard kick is not his absolute physical limit, making a longer kick plausible.
    3.  **Systemic Rule Change:** The new "K-ball" rule, allowing kickers to prepare their game balls all week, is a structural change from all prior seasons. This provides a causal mechanism for why maximum distances might be systemically higher in 2025.
    4.  **League-Wide Strength:** The presence of other 64+ yard kicks this season suggests the trend is not isolated to a single player, increasing the pool of kickers who might get a record-breaking opportunity.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The core question is: What is the probability that the 68-yard record is broken in the remaining weeks of the season?

*   **Evidence Pushing the Forecast Up (for a value > 68):**
    *   **Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick (Strong Upward Pressure):** This is the most significant piece of evidence. It proves the physical capability exists to surpass 68 yards in a live-game setting. This makes a 69 or 70-yard kick a credible possibility, not just a theoretical one.
    *   **The 68-yard record itself (Moderate Upward Pressure):** This event confirms Little's ability to perform at an elite level under regular-season pressure and breaks the psychological barrier associated with the previous 66-yard record. Coaches may now be more willing to attempt a 69-yarder.
    *   **The K-Ball Rule (Moderate Upward Pressure):** This provides a plausible reason for a league-wide increase in kicking distance, supporting the idea that this season is fundamentally different.

*   **Evidence Pushing the Forecast Down (for a value of 68):**
    *   **Extreme Rarity (Strong Downward Pressure):** A 68-yard field goal is already a massive statistical outlier. The base rate for breaking an all-time record twice in the same season is effectively zero in the modern era. We are forecasting an outlier on top of an outlier.
    *   **Lack of Opportunity (Strong Downward Pressure):** The specific game script required for a 68+ yard attempt is rare. With only a few weeks left in the season, there may be zero such attempts across the entire league. The probability of making a kick you don't attempt is zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 63 yards.
*   **Update 1 (The 68-yard kick):** The observation of a 68-yard field goal forces a complete update. The posterior distribution now has zero probability mass below 68. The new "prior" becomes a belief that the final value will be 68, with some probability of it being surpassed. Let's estimate the probability of the record standing at 68 as ~75-80%.
*   **Update 2 (Considering Little's 70-yarder and other factors):** The evidence of a 70-yard preseason kick and the K-ball rule significantly increases the likelihood of the record being broken again. This evidence shifts probability mass from the "68" bucket into the "69+" buckets. My posterior belief is that there is a ~25% chance the record is broken again.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting distribution is a spike at 68 yards, with a rapidly decaying tail.
    *   P(value = 68) ≈ 75%
    *   P(value = 69) ≈ 13%
    *   P(value = 70) ≈ 9%
    *   P(value ≥ 71) ≈ 3%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence in the Status Quo:** Am I putting too much weight on the rarity of breaking a record twice? The combination of a generational talent like Little and a new rule could represent a paradigm shift, making historical base rates less relevant. The 2025 season may be the start of a new normal.
*   **Underestimating Opportunity:** While opportunities are rare, they are not zero. With roughly 5-6 weeks of football left, there are hundreds of games. It only takes one end-of-half situation for a team like the Jaguars in a dome for an attempt to happen.
*   **The "Best Alternative" Forecast:** A plausible alternative is that the record *will* be broken, making the median 69. This forecast would argue that Little's proven talent is the dominant factor, and an opportunity is more likely than not to arise.
*   **Rebuttal and Adjustment:** While plausible, that alternative feels too aggressive. It downplays the immense difficulty and luck involved. The sheer number of variables that must align perfectly (game situation, field position, weather, snap, hold, kick) makes any single attempt from that range a low-probability event. My 25% estimate of the record being broken again seems like a reasonable balance between acknowledging the new potential while respecting the inherent difficulty. The resulting percentiles reflect this balance.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution places a 75% chance that the record remains at 68 yards for the rest of the season. The remaining 25% is distributed across higher values, with 69 and 70 being the most likely next steps, reflecting Cam Little's demonstrated potential.

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 68
P80: 69
P90: 70
