### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Appropriations in Divided Government (Post-1980).** In years with divided government (different parties controlling the House, Senate, or White House), the appropriations process is consistently delayed. The median number of regular appropriations bills enacted by the start of the fiscal year (Oct 1) is zero. It is common for all 12 bills to be bundled into a last-minute omnibus package in December or for Congress to rely on a series of Continuing Resolutions (CRs) pushing final decisions into the next calendar year.
    -   *Base Rate:* The probability of enacting 0 additional bills between a late-November CR and Jan 1 is high, perhaps 60-70%. The probability of bundling the remaining bills into a single omnibus is ~20-30%. The probability of passing a few more in a "minibus" is low, ~10%.
-   **Reference Class 2: Appropriations Following a Government Shutdown.** Shutdowns occur due to a failure to reach a compromise on spending levels or policy riders. The deals that end shutdowns often involve a short-term CR to allow for a "cooling off" period. The subsequent legislative action is typically focused on preventing another shutdown at the new deadline, not on methodically passing individual bills.
    -   *Base Rate:* In these scenarios, the most common outcome is another CR or a large omnibus package passed just before the new deadline. The number of *additional* bills passed in the interim period before the holidays is almost always zero.
-   **Limitations:** The current situation is unusual because three bills were enacted *with* the CR that ended the shutdown. This "down payment" on appropriations is not typical, making direct historical comparisons difficult.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-08 (Hypothetical)** Congress ends a month-long shutdown by passing a CR funding most of the government through January 30, 2026. **(↓)** — This pushes the action-forcing deadline past the New Year, significantly reducing the urgency to complete appropriations work in December.
-   **2025-11-08 (Hypothetical)** The President signs a "minibus" package enacting three FY26 bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) into law. **(↓)** — This clears the least controversial bills from the agenda, leaving only the nine most difficult bills to negotiate under a tight, holiday-shortened calendar.
-   **2025-10-01 (Hypothetical)** FY2026 begins with zero appropriations bills enacted, triggering a partial government shutdown. **(Neutral)** — This was the expected outcome given the political climate and confirms the high level of partisan disagreement that must be overcome.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Divided Government & Partisan Polarization (Large ↓):** With opposing parties controlling the House, Senate, and/or White House, fundamental disagreements on spending levels and policy riders (e.g., on immigration, climate, social issues) make compromise on the remaining, more controversial bills (like Homeland Security, Labor-HHS) extremely difficult.
-   **The Legislative Calendar (Large ↓):** It is late November. The legislative calendar in December is short due to Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's holidays. There is very little floor time available to process nine separate, complex appropriations bills.
-   **The January 30, 2026 Deadline (Large ↓):** The CR created a new "cliff" at the end of January. This is now the focal point for all negotiations. It removes any real pressure to act before January 1, making it the path of least resistance for members and staff to defer difficult work until after the holidays.
-   **Shutdown Fatigue & Leadership Incentive (Small ↑):** Congressional leaders and the White House may feel pressure to demonstrate progress and functionality after a damaging shutdown. This could incentivize them to package a few of the less-controversial remaining bills into another minibus, but this is a weak driver compared to the calendar and deadline effects.
-   **Bundling (Omnibus/Minibus) (Moderate ↑):** This is the only plausible mechanism for passing *any* additional bills. Rather than passing nine individual bills, leadership could bundle them all into one large omnibus or a smaller minibus of 2-4 bills. This allows for complex trade-offs but requires immense effort to negotiate, which is unlikely to be completed in December.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **The "Easy" Bills are Already Done:** Unlike typical omnibus negotiations where less-controversial bills can be used to build momentum and goodwill, the three easiest bills are already enacted. The remaining nine contain the bulk of the fiscal and ideological disagreements.
-   **Post-Shutdown, Pre-Deadline Lull:** The CR has created an unusual "lull" between the end of the shutdown and the new deadline. The base rate often involves a CR that expires just before Christmas, creating a holiday deadline crisis. Here, the crisis is explicitly deferred to January, a significant structural difference.
-   **Severity of Preceding Shutdown:** The background states this was the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This level of dysfunction suggests that partisan divisions are deeper than in a typical reference year, making further compromise in the short term less likely. The political capital needed to end the shutdown may have been fully expended, leaving none for further deals in December.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the reference classes, centered on 0 *additional* bills being passed before Jan 1. The total would therefore be 3. This prior should have moderate strength (e.g., equivalent n=10), reflecting consistent historical patterns. The distribution should have a long tail, allowing for the small possibility of a full omnibus (9 more bills).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↓ (Large):** The CR deadline is Jan 30, not late December. This removes the primary forcing mechanism for a pre-2026 deal.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The three least controversial bills have already been enacted, leaving only the most difficult negotiations for the remaining nine.
    -   **↓ (Small):** The historic length of the recent shutdown indicates deeper-than-usual partisan gridlock, making swift, good-faith negotiations less probable.
    -   **↑ (Small):** Leadership may have a minor incentive to pass another small package to project an image of competence, but this is unlikely to overcome the structural barriers.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests the number of additional bills will be zero. The posterior should shift strongly toward 3 total bills, with the probability of any outcome greater than 3 being significantly reduced from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Public statements from House/Senate leadership and the White House explicitly targeting a pre-Christmas vote on another "minibus" package.
    -   News reports of "four corners" (House/Senate, R/D) leadership meetings reaching agreements on top-line spending numbers for the remaining bills.
    -   The House Rules Committee meeting to set rules for floor debate on a new appropriations package.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Leadership statements focusing exclusively on the January 30 deadline and plans for negotiations "after the holidays."
    -   Congress adjourning for the Christmas recess earlier than scheduled.
    -   An increase in partisan messaging blaming the other side for the previous shutdown, signaling a hardening of positions.
    -   Introduction of a "clean" CR to extend the Jan 30 deadline further, indicating a complete punt.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution is "enacted," which means passed by both chambers *and* signed by the President. A bill passing the House in December does not count.
-   **Surprise Grand Bargain:** While highly unlikely, a sudden political event or a "Christmas miracle" could lead to a rapid, comprehensive deal on all remaining bills. The probability is very low but not zero.
-   **Hypothetical Scenario Dynamics:** This forecast is based on a hypothetical background. Real-world events or shifts in political leadership could alter the dynamics assumed in this brief.
-   **Lame-Duck Session Risk:** If the scenario takes place after an election, outgoing members of Congress ("lame ducks") may vote differently than they otherwise would, introducing a small amount of unpredictability.

**Final Research Summary:** The recent CR punted the funding deadline to January 30, removing all urgency for Congress to act before the holidays. With only the most controversial of the nine remaining appropriations bills left to negotiate, the overwhelming likelihood is that no additional bills will be enacted before 2026, leaving the final count at the three already passed.

To forecast the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Appropriations in Divided Government (Post-1980) suggests a high probability (60-70%) of enacting 0 additional bills between a late-November CR and Jan 1, with a 20-30% chance of an omnibus package and a 10% chance of a minibus.
   - **Reference Class 2:** Appropriations Following a Government Shutdown indicates almost always zero additional bills passed before the holidays.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** A prior centered on 0 additional bills, with a long tail allowing for the possibility of an omnibus package. The mean is approximately 3 (the 3 already enacted), with high variance due to the small chance of an omnibus.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** Divided government and a recent shutdown align with historical patterns of gridlock and delayed appropriations.
   - **Differences:** The three least controversial bills are already enacted, and the CR deadline is January 30, reducing urgency.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR Deadline (Large ↓):** The January 30 deadline removes urgency for December action.
   - **Enacted Bills (Moderate ↓):** Only the most difficult bills remain, reducing the likelihood of additional enactments.
   - **Shutdown Length (Small ↓):** Indicates deep partisan gridlock.
   - **Leadership Incentives (Small ↑):** Minor incentive to pass a small package, but unlikely to overcome barriers.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered on 3 total bills, with a long tail for omnibus possibilities.
   - **Evidence:** Strongly supports 0 additional bills, shifting the posterior towards 3 total bills.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Remains close to 3, with reduced probability for outcomes greater than 3.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the low but non-zero chance of a surprise omnibus deal.
   - **Tail Risks:** A "Christmas miracle" or sudden political shift could alter outcomes.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is 12 bills if a grand bargain occurs, but this is highly unlikely.
   - **Adjustment:** Maintain focus on 3 total bills, with slight consideration for tail risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the overwhelming evidence and historical patterns, the forecast is heavily weighted towards 3 total bills enacted before 2026.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 3

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use historical data on appropriations bills enacted before the start of the calendar year following a government shutdown:

- In most cases where a shutdown occurs and is resolved with a CR extending into January, very few additional bills are enacted before January 1st.
- The background indicates 3 bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA).
- The base rate suggests that after a shutdown is resolved with a CR extending past January 1st, it's rare to see additional bills enacted before the new year.

Prior distribution centered around 3 bills (the current number enacted), with some probability mass at higher values to account for the possibility of additional bills being passed.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Divided government with partisan polarization
- A CR has been passed extending funding into the next calendar year (January 30, 2026)
- The shutdown was particularly severe (longest in US history), indicating deep partisan divisions

**Differences from base rate:**
- Three bills have already been enacted alongside the CR, which is somewhat unusual
- The CR extends quite far (to January 30), removing pressure to act before year-end
- The remaining nine bills are likely the most contentious ones, as the "easier" bills have already been enacted

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for lower values (3 bills total):**
- The CR deadline of January 30, 2026 removes any urgency to pass bills before January 1 (strong downward pressure)
- The three least controversial bills have already been enacted, leaving only the most difficult ones (moderate downward pressure)
- The historic length of the shutdown indicates deeper partisan gridlock than usual (moderate downward pressure)
- Limited legislative calendar in December due to holidays (strong downward pressure)

**Evidence for higher values (>3 bills):**
- Leadership may want to demonstrate functionality after a damaging shutdown (weak upward pressure)
- Possibility of bundling some of the remaining bills into a "minibus" package (weak upward pressure)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered at 3 bills with moderate variance:
- The strongest evidence is the CR deadline of January 30, which significantly reduces the likelihood of action before January 1
- The limited December legislative calendar further reduces probability of additional bills
- The fact that only the most contentious bills remain makes quick action less likely

Posterior distribution shifts:
- The probability mass becomes more concentrated around 3 bills
- The right tail (probability of >3 bills) becomes thinner
- The mean shifts slightly downward from the prior

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the political incentives to demonstrate progress before the end of the year
- There could be external events (e.g., national security concerns) that force action on specific appropriations bills
- I might be overweighting the impact of the January 30 deadline

**Alternative scenario:**
A plausible alternative is that congressional leadership negotiates a "minibus" package of 2-3 additional bills before the Christmas recess, bringing the total to 5-6 bills. This could happen if there's strong political pressure to show progress or if certain agencies need certainty before January.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The calendar constraints and the fact that only the most contentious bills remain make this scenario unlikely. The path of least resistance is to wait until January when there's a real deadline.

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary reference class is the behavior of the U.S. Congress during appropriations processes under divided government, particularly in years following a contentious fiscal event like a government shutdown.

*   **Reference Class:** Appropriations under divided government, post-1980.
*   **Reasoning:** In these scenarios, partisan gridlock is the norm. Deadlines, not the legislative calendar, force action. It is common for Congress to pass a series of Continuing Resolutions (CRs) to push final decisions into the next calendar year. The median number of regular appropriations bills enacted on time (by October 1) is zero. Action, when it happens, is typically consolidated into large omnibus or minibus packages right before a CR expires.
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** Based on this, my prior for the number of *additional* bills passed in a "lull" period between two CR deadlines is heavily skewed towards zero. A reasonable prior would be:
    *   P(0 additional bills): ~70%
    *   P(a few additional bills in a minibus, 1-3): ~10%
    *   P(all remaining bills in an omnibus): ~20% (This is a common outcome, but usually happens *at* a deadline, not before one).
    This means my prior for the *total* number of enacted bills is centered on 3, but with a significant possibility of a jump to 12.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation has strong similarities and critical differences compared to the base case.

*   **Similarities:** The context of a divided government and extreme partisan polarization fits the reference class perfectly. The recent government shutdown confirms the high level of disagreement, which is typical for these scenarios.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **The Deadline:** The most significant difference is that the CR expires on January 30, 2026, *after* the new year. The base rate for a major pre-holiday legislative package is driven by a pre-Christmas deadline. The absence of this forcing mechanism dramatically reduces the urgency to act in December.
    2.  **Remaining Bills:** The three least controversial bills have already been enacted. This is unusual. It means the remaining nine bills are the most difficult, containing the major fiscal and ideological disagreements (e.g., Homeland Security, Labor-HHS). This makes it harder to assemble a small, "easy" minibus to show progress.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the prompt and their effect on the distribution.

*   **Evidence 1: CR Expires Jan 30, 2026 (Strongly pushes down):** This is the most important factor. It removes the primary incentive for congressional leaders to engage in painful, time-consuming negotiations over the holidays. The path of least resistance is to recess and address the issue in January. This makes the "0 additional bills" outcome much more likely than the "omnibus" outcome. I'd estimate this evidence makes a zero-action outcome at least 5x more likely relative to a high-action outcome.
*   **Evidence 2: "Easy" Bills Already Enacted (Moderately pushes down):** This leaves only the nine most contentious bills. It makes a small minibus (e.g., passing 2-3 more bills) less likely, as there are no easy compromises left to bundle. This concentrates the probability at the extremes: either zero additional bills or all nine.
*   **Evidence 3: "Longest... shutdown in US history" (Slightly pushes down):** This suggests that partisan divisions are deeper than in a typical reference year. The political capital needed to end the shutdown was likely exhausted, leaving little appetite for another major compromise just a few weeks later.
*   **Evidence 4: Shutdown Fatigue / Leadership Incentive (Slightly pushes up):** There is a minor incentive for leaders to demonstrate that government is working again. This could lead to a push for a small package. However, this is a weak psychological driver compared to the powerful structural driver of the January deadline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Centered on 3, with a ~70% chance of staying at 3 and a ~20% chance of jumping to 12.
*   **Update Step:** The most powerful piece of evidence is the January 30 deadline. It fundamentally undermines the rationale for a December omnibus. I will update my prior by drastically reducing the probability of the omnibus scenario (from ~20% down to <5%) and reallocating that probability to the "zero additional bills" scenario.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The evidence overwhelmingly points toward inaction in December. My posterior distribution is therefore extremely concentrated at 3 enacted bills. The probability of zero *additional* bills being passed before 2026 is very high.
    *   My posterior belief is P(Total = 3) ≈ 85-90%.
    *   The remaining 10-15% is split between a small minibus (total of 4 or 5 bills) and the very low probability "Christmas miracle" omnibus (total of 12 bills).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The best argument for a higher number is that the shutdown was so damaging that leaders on both sides are desperate to avoid a repeat in January. They could use the December lull to negotiate a full omnibus package to clear the decks for 2026. In this scenario, the Jan 30 deadline is seen as a catastrophic backstop, not a target.
*   **Plausibility & Rebuttal:** This is plausible but unlikely. The logistics of negotiating the nine most complex spending bills in three holiday-shortened weeks are formidable. Staff are exhausted, and members want to go home. The structural incentive to wait until the deadline is almost always stronger than the psychological desire to act early.
*   **Adjustment:** My initial update might be slightly overconfident. The "grand bargain" scenario, while improbable, is not impossible. I will ensure my upper percentiles reflect this tail risk. A small minibus of 1-2 additional bills (e.g., Defense) is also a non-zero possibility. I will model this as a small chance of the total being 4 or 5. My final distribution assigns roughly an 80% chance to 3 bills, a 10% chance to a small minibus (4-5 bills), and a 10% chance to a surprise omnibus (12 bills).

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final forecast is heavily skewed, with the vast majority of the probability mass on exactly 3 bills (the three already enacted). The upper percentiles reflect the small but non-zero chance of a last-minute minibus or a surprise omnibus deal before the holidays.
