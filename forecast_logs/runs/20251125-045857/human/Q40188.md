### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major U.S. Livestock Import Bans for Disease/Pest Control:** The most comparable recent event is the U.S. ban on Canadian cattle due to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003. The ban on all cattle lasted about four months, but the ban on older cattle (most at risk) lasted over two years. This class suggests that reopening is a multi-month to multi-year process, not a matter of weeks. **Base rate for reopening within ~1 month: <5%.**
2.  **Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) Eradication Campaigns:** The original U.S.-Mexico joint program to eradicate NWS (COMEXA) was a multi-decade effort that successfully pushed the pest out of Mexico by the 1990s. This demonstrates that NWS is a persistent threat requiring a massive, long-term, and systematic response. **Base rate for resolving a significant, established NWS incursion in a new area in under a year is extremely low.**
3.  **Short-Term/Precautionary Agricultural Trade Suspensions:** Sometimes, trade is halted for brief periods due to administrative issues or a single, isolated, and quickly contained pest detection. These can be resolved in days or weeks. The initial May 11 suspension could have fallen into this class, but the failed reopening on July 9 firmly moved it into the "Major Ban" category.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-07** — ↑ — The U.S. briefly reopened the border, signaling a willingness to resume trade quickly if specific conditions were met and demonstrating a pathway exists.
*   **2025-07-09** — ↓↓ — The suspension was reimposed just two days later after a new NWS case was detected, indicating the underlying pest problem was not contained and that USDA's tolerance for risk is extremely low.
*   **2025-08-15** — ↓ — The USDA announced a "sweeping" five-pronged plan, including building a new sterile fly facility in Texas and renovating one in Mexico. This signals the problem is large-scale and requires long-term infrastructure solutions, not a quick fix.
*   **2025-08-18** — ↓ — Mexico and the U.S. signed a detailed action plan. A new Mexican facility to produce sterile flies is planned, with operations expected in the "first half of the next year" (2026). This explicitly points to a post-resolution-date timeline for a key countermeasure.
*   **2025-11-04** — ↓ — USDA Secretary Rollins stated there is "no time frame for reopening the border." While pleased with Mexico's efforts, the lack of a concrete timeline this close to the deadline is a strong negative indicator.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **NWS Case Detection Rate & Location (Large):** The single most important driver. Any new confirmed cases, especially in northern Mexican states, will reset the clock on any potential reopening. A sustained period (e.g., 30-60 days) of zero new detections in border regions is a prerequisite for reopening.
2.  **Efficacy of Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) Dispersal (Large):** The primary eradication tool is releasing sterile male flies to disrupt the breeding cycle. The timeline for reopening is almost entirely dependent on how quickly this technique can demonstrably suppress the wild NWS population. This process takes time to show results.
3.  **Economic & Political Pressure (Moderate):** Mexican cattle exporters and U.S. feedlot operators who rely on Mexican cattle are heavily impacted, creating pressure for a solution. However, this is counter-weighed by the much larger economic risk a U.S. outbreak poses to the entire domestic livestock industry, making the USDA highly risk-averse.
4.  **Verification & Trust in Mexican Surveillance (Moderate):** The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must be fully confident in the data and control measures reported by its Mexican counterpart (SENASICA). Building this confidence after the July failure requires a period of proven, sustained success.
5.  **Bureaucratic Inertia (Small):** Even if all scientific criteria are met, the official process of lifting a major sanitary ban involves paperwork, formal risk assessments, and publication in the Federal Register. This process itself can take weeks, making a pre-2026 resolution difficult given the current date.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Failed Reopening:** Unlike the start of the BSE ban, authorities here have already attempted and failed at a rapid reopening. This experience will likely lead to significantly more caution and a higher burden of proof for the second attempt.
*   **Existing Eradication Infrastructure:** Unlike a novel disease, there is a decades-long history of U.S.-Mexico cooperation on NWS, including an existing sterile fly production plant in Panama. This provides a running start but is clearly insufficient, as evidenced by the plans for new facilities.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in ~36 days. This is an exceptionally short window to demonstrate control over a biological pest outbreak that has been spreading for a year and has already thwarted one reopening attempt.
*   **Explicit Long-Term Timelines:** Officials have publicly announced timelines for key infrastructure (new sterile fly plants) that extend well into 2026. This is a strong, explicit signal that they are planning for a long-term fight, not a short-term resolution.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior based on the reference class of major livestock import bans (e.g., BSE). A prior of ~10% for a resolution within 36 days seems reasonable, reflecting that while unlikely, rapid resolutions are not impossible (equivalent n of ~15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The failed reopening in July is powerful evidence that the problem is severe and not easily contained, significantly lowering the probability of a quick, successful second attempt.
    *   ↓ (Large): Public announcements of new eradication facilities with operational dates in "the first half of 2026" strongly suggest the controlling agencies do not expect to solve the problem before then.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The Nov 4 statement from the USDA Secretary explicitly mentioning "no time frame" is a direct, recent, and authoritative piece of evidence against an imminent reopening.
    *   ↑ (Small): The high degree of cooperation and signed agreements show political will, but this is a necessary, not sufficient, condition for reopening and is overshadowed by the operational realities.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence, particularly the failed reopening and the 2026 timeline for new facilities, is overwhelmingly negative for a "Yes" resolution. The posterior should move sharply down from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   USDA/APHIS announcement of a specific, data-based "pathway to reopening" with clear benchmarks for Mexico.
    *   Official declaration by SENASICA, verified by APHIS, of NWS-free status for key northern cattle-exporting states (e.g., Sonora, Chihuahua).
    *   A sustained period (e.g., 3-4 weeks) of zero new NWS detections reported in official channels.
    *   Resumption of imports on a limited, trial basis from specific certified-clean zones.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official report of a new NWS case, particularly north of the 24th parallel.
    *   Statements from U.S. cattlemen's associations urging the USDA to remain cautious.
    *   Reports of logistical or political problems with the joint sterile fly dispersal program.
    *   Any further statements from USDA officials that emphasize the long-term nature of the eradication effort.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criterion is "imports of cattle from Mexico are permitted to resume." This could be triggered by a partial reopening (e.g., only from Sonora) or for specific types of cattle (e.g., for immediate slaughter), which might be easier to achieve than a full reopening.
*   **Political "December Surprise":** The U.S. administration could theoretically force a political reopening for diplomatic or economic reasons, overriding the cautious, science-based timeline of APHIS. This is a low-probability but high-impact risk.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Public information on NWS case numbers and locations may lag behind the real-time data available to decision-makers at USDA. We are forecasting based on a slightly delayed and filtered view of the ground truth.
*   **Holiday Slowdown:** The upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays could slow bureaucratic processes in both

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for reopening livestock imports after a major ban due to disease or pest concerns is informed by historical precedents. The most relevant case is the U.S. ban on Canadian cattle due to BSE, which lasted several months to years depending on the risk level. Given the complexity and persistence of the New World screwworm (NWS) issue, a base rate of around 10% for reopening within a short timeframe (36 days) seems reasonable. This reflects the low likelihood of rapid resolution in such cases.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Both the BSE and NWS situations involve significant health risks that require careful management and verification before trade can resume. The need for long-term eradication efforts and infrastructure development is common in both cases.
- **Differences:** The NWS issue has a history of U.S.-Mexico cooperation and existing infrastructure, which could theoretically expedite resolution. However, the failed reopening attempt in July and the explicit long-term timelines for new facilities suggest a more cautious approach.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Failed Reopening (July 9):** The reimposition of the ban shortly after a brief reopening indicates a severe and persistent problem. This evidence strongly decreases the probability of a quick resolution.
- **Infrastructure Timelines (2026):** Announcements of new facilities with operational timelines extending into 2026 suggest that authorities do not expect a resolution before then. This is a strong negative indicator.
- **USDA Statement (Nov 4):** The lack of a concrete timeline for reopening, despite positive remarks about Mexico's efforts, further decreases the likelihood of a near-term resolution.
- **Cooperation and Agreements:** While there is political will and cooperation, these are necessary but not sufficient conditions for reopening. The operational challenges remain significant.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 10%, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests a lower probability of reopening before 2026. The failed reopening, long-term infrastructure plans, and recent USDA statements all point to a low likelihood of resolution within the next 36 days.

- **Prior Odds:** 10% probability = 0.1 odds
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong negative evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.1 × (much less than 1)
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior, likely below 5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast could be overly pessimistic if there are rapid, unreported improvements in NWS control. However, the public information and official statements strongly suggest otherwise.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A political decision to reopen for economic reasons could occur, but this is unlikely given the USDA's risk aversion and the potential economic impact of an outbreak.
- **Tail Risks:** The possibility of a partial reopening or a "December Surprise" remains, but these are low-probability events.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is very low.

Final: 3%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico within the next 36 days (by December 31, 2025).

The most relevant reference class is major U.S. livestock import bans due to disease or pest concerns:
- The 2003 BSE (mad cow disease) ban on Canadian cattle lasted about 4 months for all cattle, but over 2 years for older cattle
- Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) eradication efforts were multi-year or even multi-decade projects
- The current ban has already been in place for over 6 months (since May 11, 2025)
- There was a failed reopening attempt in July that lasted only 2 days

Given these historical patterns, a reasonable prior would be around 15% probability of reopening within a 36-day window. This reflects that while most major livestock bans last significantly longer than 6 months, there is some possibility of a quicker resolution, especially given the previous (albeit failed) reopening attempt.

**Prior probability: 15%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like previous livestock import bans, this involves a serious pest/disease threat (NWS) that could devastate U.S. agriculture
- The standard protocol involves verification of containment before reopening
- There are economic pressures from both countries to resume trade

**Key differences:**
- The failed July reopening attempt makes this situation unique - authorities have already tried and failed at reopening, which likely makes them more cautious
- The timeline is extremely compressed - only 36 days remain until the resolution date
- Officials have explicitly announced infrastructure plans with timelines extending into 2026
- The November 4 statement from the USDA Secretary specifically mentioned "no time frame for reopening"
- The holiday season (Christmas/New Year) falls within our resolution window, potentially slowing bureaucratic processes

These differences, particularly the failed reopening and explicit 2026 timelines, suggest our prior should be adjusted downward.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Failed reopening in July**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur by Dec 31, the probability of a failed July reopening is moderate (~40%) - it could represent an overly cautious first attempt
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't occur by Dec 31, the probability of a failed July reopening is very high (~90%) - it demonstrates the severity of the problem
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44
- This significantly decreases the probability of reopening by year-end

**Evidence 2: USDA Secretary's November 4 statement of "no time frame"**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur by Dec 31, the probability of such a statement in early November is very low (~10%) - they would likely hint at an imminent reopening
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't occur by Dec 31, such a statement is highly likely (~80%) - it's consistent with a longer timeline
- Likelihood ratio: 0.125
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Plans for new sterile fly facilities operational in "first half of 2026"**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur by Dec 31, announcing 2026 infrastructure is somewhat unlikely (~30%) - it suggests a longer timeline
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't occur by Dec 31, such announcements are very likely (~90%) - they align with a longer-term strategy
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Positive statement about Mexico's efforts ("every day we get closer")**
- P(E|H): If reopening will occur by Dec 31, such positive statements are very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If reopening won't occur by Dec 31, such statements are still moderately likely (~60%) - diplomatic language is common regardless of timeline
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

**Update on Evidence 1 (Failed July reopening):**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.44 = 0.077
- Posterior probability: 0.077 ÷ (1 + 0.077) ≈ 7.2%

**Update on Evidence 2 (November "no timeframe" statement):**
- Prior odds: 0.077
- Likelihood ratio: 0.125
- Posterior odds: 0.077 × 0.125 = 0.0096
- Posterior probability: 0.0096 ÷ (1 + 0.0096) ≈ 1.0%

**Update on Evidence 3 (2026 infrastructure plans):**
- Prior odds: 0.0096
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.0096 × 0.33 = 0.0032
- Posterior probability: 0.0032 ÷ (1 + 0.0032) ≈ 0.32%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Positive diplomatic statements):**
- Prior odds: 0.0032
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- Posterior odds: 0.0032 × 1.5 = 0.0048
- Posterior probability: 0.0048 ÷ (1 + 0.0048) ≈ 0.48%

After incorporating all evidence, our posterior probability is approximately 0.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the political pressure to reopen before year-end
- There could be a partial reopening (e.g., from specific Mexican states or for specific cattle types)
- The USDA might have more positive data than publicly disclosed
- A diplomatic breakthrough could accelerate the timeline

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A "December surprise" reopening for political/diplomatic reasons (1-2% chance)
- A limited, pilot reopening from specific NWS-free regions (2-3% chance)
- Accelerated progress in NWS containment not yet publicly announced (1-2% chance)

These alternative scenarios suggest I should adjust my forecast slightly upward, from 0.5% to around 5-6%.

However, the strongest counterarguments remain:
- The explicit 2026 timeline for key infrastructure
- The recent failure of a reopening attempt
- The USDA Secretary's November statement indicating no timeframe
- The extremely short window remaining (36 days)
- The holiday season potentially slowing bureaucratic processes

After considering these factors, I believe a final forecast of 4% is appropriate - low but not impossible.

## 6. Final Forecast

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class is major agricultural import bans imposed by the U.S. for sanitary (disease or pest) reasons. A key example is the 2003 ban on Canadian cattle due to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). The ban on all cattle lasted approximately four months, while the ban on higher-risk cattle lasted over two years. This suggests that resolving such issues is a multi-month to multi-year process. The question asks about a resolution within the next 36 days for a ban that has already been in place for over six months and has proven difficult to resolve. The base rate for a major, complex ban being lifted in any specific one-month window is low. I will set a prior probability of **10%** for a resolution before 2026. This is a conservative starting point, acknowledging that rapid resolutions, while atypical for major issues, are not impossible.
*   Prior P(H) = 0.10
*   Prior Odds = 0.10 / 0.90 = 1/9

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current situation involves a major trading partner, a significant economic impact, and a threat to the health of the U.S. domestic livestock industry, similar to the BSE case.
**Differences:**
*   **Failed Reopening:** Unlike the BSE ban, authorities attempted a quick reopening on July 7, which failed within two days. This failure significantly increases the level of caution and the burden of proof required for any subsequent reopening attempt, making a quick resolution *less* likely than in a standard case.
*   **Nature of the Threat:** New World Screwworm (NWS) eradication relies on the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), a biological control method that is effective but inherently slow. It takes time for released sterile flies to disrupt the wild population's breeding cycle, and it takes further time to verify that the wild population has been suppressed to a safe level. This biological reality imposes a minimum timeline that is likely longer than the 36 days remaining.

These differences suggest the current situation is more challenging to resolve quickly than the average case from our reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "the U.S. will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: The failed reopening on July 9.**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if the problem is severe and long-lasting (P(E|~H) is high) than if it is a simple issue that can be resolved by the end of the year (P(E|H) is low). The failure demonstrates the problem was underestimated and that the USDA's risk tolerance is very low.
    *   Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H)) is significantly less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Announcements in August 2025 of new sterile fly facilities with operational dates in 2026.**
    *   This is extremely strong evidence. It is highly unlikely that officials would announce and commit to long-term infrastructure projects with 2026 timelines if they expected to solve the problem in 2025 (P(E|H) is very low). This is precisely the action one would expect if they are planning for a protracted, multi-year effort (P(E|~H) is very high).
    *   Likelihood Ratio is very close to 0. This evidence **sharply decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The USDA Secretary's statement on November 4, 2025, that there is "no time frame for reopening."**
    *   This statement was made just three weeks ago. If a reopening were planned within the next 50 days (from Nov 4), the language would likely be more optimistic or specific. The "no time frame" comment is highly probable under the scenario of a long-term closure.
    *   Likelihood Ratio is much less than 1. This recent, authoritative evidence **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 10% (1/9 odds), we update with the evidence.

1.  **Prior Odds:** 1/9
2.  **Update with Failed Reopening:** The failed reopening suggests the problem is harder than initially thought, significantly reducing the odds. Let's say it cuts the odds by a factor of 3 (LR ≈ 0.33). New odds ≈ (1/9) * 0.33 = 1/27 (approx. 3.6%).
3.  **Update with 2026 Infrastructure Plans:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It signals the government's own expectation of a long timeline. This evidence is highly improbable if a 2025 reopening is planned. Let's estimate a strong likelihood ratio of 1/10. New odds ≈ (1/27) * 0.1 = 1/270 (approx. 0.37%).
4.  **Update with "No Time Frame" Statement:** This recent statement confirms the long-term outlook. It further reduces the odds. New odds are now extremely low.

The combined weight of the evidence, especially the explicit 2026 timeline for new facilities, pushes the probability from a low prior to a very low posterior. The evidence is consistent and points overwhelmingly toward a "No" resolution.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider how this forecast could be wrong.
*   **Alternative Scenario 1: Partial Reopening.** The resolution criteria could be met by a very limited reopening, such as allowing cattle from a single, certified NWS-free state (e.g., Sonora) into a quarantined U.S. facility. This is a lower bar than a full reopening and is the most plausible path to a "Yes." However, establishing the trust and verification for even a partial zone in just 36 days after the July failure seems highly ambitious.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Political Override.** Intense economic pressure from U.S. feedlots and Mexican exporters could lead to a political decision to reopen, against the advice of scientific agencies. While possible, the risk of a second failure and a domestic NWS outbreak would be a massive political and economic liability, making this a high-risk maneuver for the administration.
*   **Blind Spot: Information Asymmetry.** It's possible that eradication efforts have been spectacularly successful in the last three weeks and an announcement is imminent. However, this runs contrary to all public signaling.

While these alternative scenarios exist, they appear to be low-probability events. The biological timeline for NWS suppression and the bureaucratic timeline for lifting a major ban, especially during a holiday period, provide strong constraints. The evidence from official sources about long-term plans is a very strong signal of their internal expectations. I will assign a small amount of probability to these "surprise" scenarios, but the bulk of the probability mass must remain on "No."

### Final Forecast
The base rate for resolving a major livestock import ban within a 36-day window is low. The specifics of this case, particularly the failed reopening in July, make it even less likely to be resolved quickly. The evidence, including official statements about having "no time frame" and concrete plans for new infrastructure that will only become operational in 2026, overwhelmingly indicates that the USDA and its Mexican counterparts are preparing for a long-term effort. The biological and bureaucratic timelines required to safely lift the ban are not compatible with the remaining 36 days in 2025. While a surprise political decision or a limited partial reopening is a non-zero possibility, it is a remote one.

Final: 3%
