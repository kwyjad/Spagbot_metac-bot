### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa (Nov 2023 - present):** This is the most specific class. Noboa has shown a high propensity to use large-scale SoEs. In Jan 2024, he declared a nationwide (24 provinces) SoE for gang violence. The fictional Oct 2025 SoE covers 16 provinces for protests. This class suggests that when Noboa declares an SoE, it is typically broad in scope. However, these are *declarations*, not their state one month before expiration. The Jan 2024 SoE was not renewed nationwide after its 90-day maximum. **Base rate for this class suggests a bimodal outcome: either 0 provinces (if the crisis is resolved/SoE expires) or a high number (10+ provinces) if it is extended/escalated.**
2.  **Protest-driven SoEs in Ecuador (last 15 years):** Historically, SoEs declared in response to major indigenous-led protests (e.g., 2015, 2019, 2022) are tools to manage acute crises. They are rarely maintained for their full constitutional duration (60+30 days) because the underlying political conflict is typically resolved through negotiation, often with the government making concessions. **The base rate for provinces under a protest-related SoE ~80 days after its initiation is low, likely in the 0-3 province range.**
3.  **All SoEs in Ecuador (last 15 years):** This class includes responses to security issues, political turmoil, natural disasters, and health crises. Most are geographically limited and time-bound by constitutional limits (60 days + 30-day extension) and Constitutional Court oversight. It is uncommon for a specific SoE to be continuously active in the same provinces for over 90 days. **The base rate of a random province being in a state of emergency on a random day is low.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The forecast horizon is one month (Nov 25 to Dec 25, 2025). The recency guideline emphasizes the last 6 months. The provided background is the most critical recent information.
*   **2025-10-04** — President Noboa declares a 60-day SoE in 10 Sierra and Amazon provinces due to protests over diesel subsidy cuts. — **↑** — Establishes the initial scope and justification for the current SoE.
*   **2025-10-06** — SoE is expanded to 16 provinces, including key coastal provinces like Guayas and Manabí. — **↑** — Broadens the SoE beyond protest-centric regions to include gang hotspots, creating a dual justification (protests and crime).
*   **2025-10-08** — Government labels an attack on Noboa's convoy an "assassination attempt" and blames protesters. — **↑** — Significantly hardens the government's stance, making a negotiated de-escalation more difficult and justifying a prolonged security response.
*   **~2025-12-03** — The initial 60-day SoE is set to expire. — **(central event)** — The government must decide whether to let it expire, request a 30-day extension from the Constitutional Court, or declare a new SoE. This is the key decision point before the resolution date.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Government-Protester Negotiation Dynamics (Large ↓):** The primary driver for lifting the SoE in the 10+ protest-related provinces is a political settlement on fuel subsidies. Historically, these protests end in negotiation, as sustained unrest is politically and economically costly for the government.
2.  **Noboa's "Iron Fist" (Mano Dura) Security Doctrine (Large ↑):** Noboa's political brand is built on a hardline security stance. Framing protests as "terrorism" and linking them to cartels provides a rationale to extend the SoE, demonstrating strength to his political base, especially with a potential 2026 re-election campaign on the horizon.
3.  **Constitutional Limits & Court Oversight (Large ↓):** The Constitution limits SoEs to 60 days, renewable once for 30 days upon approval by the Constitutional Court. The Court has a history of striking down or limiting extensions that lack sufficient justification. Extending the SoE in all 16 provinces would require a compelling case that the initial crisis persists everywhere.
4.  **Persistence of Organized Crime (Moderate ↑):** The underlying security crisis from gang violence has not disappeared. The government has a strong incentive to maintain military presence and emergency powers in coastal provinces (e.g., Guayas, Manabí, El Oro) regardless of the protest situation, potentially using the protest SoE as a vehicle for a partial extension.
5.  **Holiday Season Pressure (Moderate ↓):** There is significant social and economic pressure for a return to normalcy during the Christmas and New Year's holidays. This creates an informal deadline for both sides to de-escalate, making a full-blown SoE on Dec 25 less likely.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Dual-Justification SoE:** Unlike typical protest-driven SoEs (Reference Class 2), this one was expanded to include provinces whose primary issue is gang violence, not protests. This provides the government a stronger rationale to maintain a partial SoE even if protests subside.
*   **Noboa's Unprecedented Framing:** Previous presidents declared SoEs for protests, but Noboa's rhetoric of "terrorism" and links to foreign cartels is a significant escalation. This hardline public stance makes it politically harder for him to back down and negotiate compared to his predecessors.
*   **Pre-Election Posturing:** With the forecast date one year into his new term, Noboa's actions are likely influenced by a desire to project strength for a future re-election bid. This may override the typical political calculus of seeking a quick, negotiated end to protests.
*   **Severe Fiscal Constraints:** The subsidy cuts are likely driven by deep economic problems, possibly linked to IMF agreements. This reduces the government's flexibility to offer the concessions that have historically ended such protests.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by Reference Class 2 (Protest-driven SoEs). These tend to resolve before their maximum duration. The prior should be strongly centered on a low number of provinces (0-3), reflecting the high likelihood of expiration or de-escalation. (e.g., a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution with a mean around 2; equivalent n≈15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** Noboa's hardline rhetoric and "war on terror" framing of dissent is a powerful signal against the base case of a negotiated settlement.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The dual justification (protests + crime) makes a *partial* extension in coastal provinces highly plausible, even if the protest-related SoEs are lifted.
    *   **↓ (Large):** Constitutional Court oversight is a major barrier to a full, 90-day extension in all 16 provinces without overwhelming evidence of continued, widespread crisis.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The impending Christmas holiday creates strong pressure for de-escalation and a return to normalcy.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls away from the prior of 0. The constitutional backstop makes a continuation in all 16 provinces unlikely. The most significant update is the high probability of a *partial* SoE. The posterior should shift upwards, away from 0, and be centered on a moderate number of provinces (perhaps 4-7), specifically the coastal ones where the gang violence justification remains strong. The distribution should be wider than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The government formally submits a request to the Constitutional Court to extend the SoE in a large number of provinces (5+).
    *   Negotiations between the government and indigenous leaders (e.g., CONAIE) publicly collapse.
    *   A major, high-profile act of violence occurs (either protest-related or gang-related).
    *   Noboa gives a national address doubling down on the "terrorist" narrative for protesters.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The government announces a partial or full reversal of the diesel subsidy cuts.
    *   The Constitutional Court rules against an extension of the SoE, or approves it for only a very small number of provinces (1-3).
    *   Protest leaders announce a "pause" or end to demonstrations to facilitate dialogue.
    *   The government

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 2 (Protest-driven SoEs in Ecuador, last 15 years):** Historically, these states of emergency are resolved through negotiation, often resulting in a low number of provinces remaining under SoE after 60+ days. The base rate suggests a low number of provinces (0-3) under SoE after 80 days.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Assume a Poisson distribution with a mean of 2, reflecting the typical resolution of protest-driven SoEs.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves indigenous-led protests similar to past events, where negotiation typically resolves the crisis.
   - **Differences:** The dual justification (protests and gang violence) and Noboa's hardline stance are significant deviations, potentially leading to a higher number of provinces under SoE.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Noboa's Hardline Rhetoric:** Increases the likelihood of a higher number of provinces remaining under SoE, as his framing of protests as terrorism suggests a reluctance to negotiate.
   - **Dual Justification:** The inclusion of gang violence as a reason for SoE increases the likelihood of maintaining SoE in coastal provinces.
   - **Constitutional Limits:** Decreases the likelihood of a full extension, as the Constitutional Court may limit the SoE.
   - **Holiday Season Pressure:** Decreases the likelihood of a prolonged SoE, as there is pressure for normalcy during the holidays.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Poisson distribution with a mean of 2.
   - **Likelihood Adjustments:** 
     - **↑ (Large):** Noboa's rhetoric and dual justification suggest a shift towards a higher number of provinces.
     - **↓ (Large):** Constitutional limits and holiday pressure suggest a reduction.
   - **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The posterior distribution shifts upwards, centering around 4-7 provinces, reflecting the likelihood of a partial SoE extension in coastal areas.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a complete resolution or a full extension, though both are less likely.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden de-escalation due to successful negotiations or a major violent event could shift the distribution.
   - **Adjustments:** Account for these possibilities by widening the distribution slightly.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - **Calibrated Percentiles:**
     - P10: 2
     - P20: 3
     - P40: 4
     - P60: 5
     - P80: 6
     - P90: 7

These percentiles reflect a moderate expectation of provinces under SoE, with a focus on those affected by gang violence, while considering the potential for negotiation and constitutional constraints.

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Protest-driven states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, ~80 days after declaration
- Historical pattern shows these typically resolve before their maximum constitutional duration (60+30 days)
- Base rate: 0-3 provinces still under SoE after ~80 days
- Mean around 2 provinces, with significant mass at 0

**Secondary reference class**: SoEs under President Noboa
- Noboa has shown willingness to declare broad SoEs (nationwide in Jan 2024, 16 provinces in Oct 2025)
- However, these are typically not maintained at full scope for their maximum duration
- Base rate suggests a bimodal distribution: either 0 (complete expiration) or partial continuation (5-8 provinces)

My prior distribution is centered around 2-3 provinces, with significant probability mass at 0 and a right tail extending to about 8 provinces.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- Constitutional constraints remain (60-day limit with possible 30-day extension)
- The October 2025 SoE follows the typical pattern of being declared in response to protests
- Economic pressures driving subsidy cuts are similar to past protest triggers

**Key differences**:
- Dual justification: This SoE combines protest response with security/gang violence concerns
- Noboa's unprecedented framing of protesters as "terrorists" with alleged cartel connections
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa creates a stronger security justification
- The December 25 date falls during holiday season, creating additional pressure for normalization

These differences suggest a higher likelihood of partial continuation compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring higher numbers of provinces under SoE**:
- Noboa's hardline security stance and "terrorism" framing (strong upward push, ~2x likelihood)
- The dual justification allows maintaining SoE in coastal/gang-affected provinces even if protests subside (moderate upward push, ~1.5x likelihood)
- The alleged assassination attempt provides stronger justification for extended security measures (moderate upward push, ~1.3x likelihood)

**Evidence favoring lower numbers of provinces under SoE**:
- Constitutional Court oversight limits arbitrary extensions (strong downward push, ~0.5x likelihood)
- Economic and social pressure during Christmas holiday season (moderate downward push, ~0.7x likelihood)
- Historical pattern of protest-related SoEs being resolved through negotiation (moderate downward push, ~0.7x likelihood)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 2-3 provinces, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update** - Noboa's hardline stance and dual justification:
- Prior: Mean ~2.5 provinces
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x for higher values
- Posterior: Shifts upward to mean ~5 provinces

**Second update** - Constitutional constraints and holiday pressure:
- Updated prior: Mean ~5 provinces
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.6x for higher values
- Posterior: Shifts downward to mean ~3-4 provinces

The posterior distribution is:
- More dispersed than the prior
- Shifted slightly upward from the original prior
- Has less mass at 0 (complete expiration) than the prior
- Has more mass in the 3-8 range (partial continuation)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the Constitutional Court's willingness to approve extensions given security concerns
- I might be overestimating the government's responsiveness to holiday season pressure
- The situation could dramatically change between now (Nov 25) and Dec 25

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Complete expiration (0 provinces)**: If negotiations succeed or the Constitutional Court rejects extensions
- **Nationwide renewal (24 provinces)**: If a major security incident occurs, justifying a completely new SoE
- **Targeted continuation (5-8 provinces)**: Most likely scenario, focusing on coastal/gang-affected areas

**Adjustments needed**:
- I should widen my distribution to account for these alternative scenarios
- I should place more probability mass on both tails (0 and higher values)

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 0
P20: 1
P40: 3
P60: 5
P80: 8
P90: 12

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary reference class is **protest-driven states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador over the last 15 years**. Historically, SoEs declared in response to major indigenous-led protests (e.g., 2019, 2022) are acute crisis management tools. They are typically resolved through political negotiation before reaching their maximum constitutional duration (60 days + 30-day extension). This base rate suggests that the number of provinces under such an SoE ~80 days after its initial declaration is very low. The prior distribution is therefore strongly skewed towards zero, with a median of 0 and a mean of perhaps 1-2 provinces, reflecting a high probability of the SoE expiring without renewal.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to the base case in that it was triggered by protests against fuel subsidy cuts, a recurring theme in Ecuadorian politics. However, there are critical differences:

*   **Dual Justification:** The SoE was expanded from the 10 protest-centric provinces to 16, including coastal provinces (Guayas, Manabí, etc.) whose primary issue is gang violence, not protests. This provides the government with a separate, more durable rationale to maintain a partial SoE even if the protests are resolved.
*   **President Noboa's Political Stance:** President Noboa's political brand is built on a hardline ("mano dura") security posture. Unlike predecessors who negotiated, Noboa has framed the protests as "terrorism" linked to foreign cartels and has survived a purported "assassination attempt." This rhetoric makes a negotiated de-escalation politically more difficult for him and justifies a prolonged security response.
*   **Fiscal Constraints:** The underlying reason for the subsidy cuts is likely severe fiscal pressure, reducing the government's flexibility to make the concessions that have historically ended these disputes.

These differences strongly suggest the base rate of a quick, complete resolution is less applicable, and the probability of a sustained, partial SoE is much higher.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence Pushing Forecast Up (↑):**
    *   **Noboa's "Terrorism" Framing & "Assassination Attempt":** This is strong evidence against a full de-escalation. It provides the political cover needed to request an extension from the Constitutional Court. This makes an outcome of 0 provinces significantly less likely than the base rate suggests.
    *   **Dual Justification (Protests + Crime):** This is the most crucial piece of evidence. It makes a *partial extension* scenario highly plausible. The government can de-escalate the protest conflict by lifting the SoE in the Sierra/Amazon while maintaining it in 4-7 coastal provinces under the guise of fighting organized crime. This strongly increases the likelihood of outcomes in the 4-7 range.

*   **Evidence Pushing Forecast Down (↓):**
    *   **Constitutional Limits & Court Oversight:** An extension beyond 60 days requires approval from the Constitutional Court, which has historically acted as a check on executive overreach. The Court is unlikely to approve a blanket extension for all 16 provinces without overwhelming evidence, thus capping the upper end of the distribution.
    *   **Holiday Season Pressure:** The resolution date is Christmas Day. There is significant social and economic pressure for a return to normalcy for the holidays, creating an informal deadline for both the government and protesters to reach a settlement. This increases the probability of de-escalation, particularly in the protest-focused provinces, and reinforces the likelihood of an outcome of 0.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My process begins with the prior distribution heavily weighted towards 0.

1.  I first update with the evidence of Noboa's hardline stance and rhetoric. This significantly reduces the probability mass at 0, shifting it towards higher numbers (e.g., P(0) might drop from ~70% to ~40%).
2.  Next, I incorporate the key evidence of the dual justification. This doesn't just shift the distribution rightward; it reshapes it, creating a new, strong mode in the 4-7 province range. This "partial extension" scenario now appears to be the most likely outcome.
3.  Finally, I incorporate the countervailing pressures from the Constitutional Court and the holiday season. This trims the upper tail of the distribution (making 16 provinces very unlikely) and adds some probability back to the 0 outcome (full de-escalation for Christmas).

The resulting posterior distribution is bimodal, with a significant peak at 0 (full resolution) and a larger, broader peak centered around 5-6 provinces (partial, crime-focused extension). The median of the distribution shifts from 0 in the prior to approximately 5 in the posterior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast centers on a "politically savvy" partial extension. I could be wrong in two main ways:

1.  **Overestimating Noboa's pragmatism:** Noboa might be a true believer in his hardline approach and attempt a full, broad extension in 10-16 provinces, risking a clash with the Court and society to project strength. The "assassination attempt" could give him the political capital for such a move. This suggests the upper tail of my distribution (P80, P90) might be too low.
2.  **Underestimating protest power:** The indigenous movement has immense mobilization capacity. Combined with holiday pressure, the protests could force the government into a complete reversal, making a full de-escalation (0 provinces) more likely than I have estimated. This suggests my P10/P20 of 0 might not fully capture a probability mass at 0 that could be as high as 30-40%.

Considering these risks, I have ensured my distribution has significant weight at both 0 and in the upper tail (represented by a P90 of 10), rather than being narrowly focused on the 4-7 range. The bimodal nature of the forecast reflects these competing scenarios.

### 6. Final Percentiles
