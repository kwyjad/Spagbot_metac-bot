### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent Nov/Dec Periods (2020-2024):** This class captures the modern climate baseline, including the long-term warming trend. Daily peak anomalies in this period have ranged from approximately **1.0°C to 1.5°C**. The lower end corresponds to the La Niña years (2020-2022), while the upper end reflects the record-breaking El Niño-influenced years (2023-2024). This class is useful for establishing a broad potential range.
-   **La Niña Nov/Dec Periods (2020-2022):** This is a more specific reference class, matching the current ENSO state. During the "triple-dip" La Niña, peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec were lower, likely in the **1.0°C to 1.2°C** range. This serves as a strong anchor for a baseline expectation under La Niña conditions.
-   **Limitation:** Both reference classes are affected by the powerful long-term warming trend (~0.2°C per decade). Furthermore, novel factors like the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption mean that a 2025 La Niña may not behave identically to a 2021 La Niña. The resolution criterion is a *single daily peak*, which is more volatile than monthly averages and susceptible to short-term weather events.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-10-09** La Niña conditions officially declared by NOAA. — ↓ — The primary cooling mechanism for the forecast period is now active and expected to strengthen, depressing the global average temperature relative to the recent past.
-   **2025-09-30** Copernicus reports September 2025 as the third warmest on record. — ↓ — While still exceptionally warm, this represents a cooling trend relative to the record-shattering pace of late 2023 and 2024, consistent with a transition to La Niña.
-   **2025-07-31** Global surface air temperature for July 2025 is second warmest on record. — ↓ — Confirms the cooling trend from the absolute peak warmth of the preceding El Niño, showing the planet's temperature anomaly is decreasing month-over-month.
-   **2025-06-15** Ocean heat content remains at near-record levels. — ↑ — Despite surface cooling, the enormous amount of energy stored in the oceans provides a persistent source of heat that can be released into the atmosphere, potentially moderating La Niña's cooling effect.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** La Niña involves cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which reduces the amount of heat transferred to the atmosphere. This is the single most important driver for this forecast. (Size: Large, ↓)
-   **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The background warming from greenhouse gas emissions acts as an escalator, making each year warmer than it would otherwise be. This ensures that even a La Niña-influenced 2025 will be very warm in the historical context. (Size: Large, ↑)
-   **Lingering Ocean Heat:** The planet is coming off a powerful El Niño and a multi-year period of record ocean heat content. This thermal inertia means the climate system will not cool down instantly, providing a significant buffer against La Niña's full impact. (Size: Moderate, ↑)
-   **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Eruption (Jan 2022):** The eruption injected a massive amount of water vapor (a potent greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. This effect is expected to persist for several years, adding a small but significant warming pressure. (Size: Small to Moderate, ↑)
-   **Reduced Aerosol "Masking":** Recent regulations on shipping fuels have reduced sulfur dioxide emissions, which form reflective aerosol particles. This reduction allows more solar radiation to reach the surface, contributing a slight warming effect. (Size: Small, ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Starting Point:** The global system is transitioning to La Niña from a much higher temperature peak (2023-2024) than the La Niña of 2020-2022. The sheer amount of residual heat in the oceans is exceptional.
-   **Competing Forcing Agents:** Unlike a "pure" La Niña period, 2025 is uniquely influenced by the lingering stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga and reduced aerosol masking, both of which are novel warming factors not present in the same way during most of the 2020-2022 reference period.
-   **Rapid ENSO Transition:** The shift from a strong El Niño to La Niña has been relatively swift. The atmospheric response can lag the oceanic changes, meaning the full cooling effect of La Niña might not be realized by December 2025.
-   **Global vs. Pacific Conditions:** While the equatorial Pacific is cooling, sea surface temperatures in other large ocean basins (e.g., the Atlantic) have remained persistently and anomalously high, which will counteract some of the global cooling effect from La Niña.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with the La Niña reference class (2020-2022), suggesting a prior centered around a peak daily anomaly of **1.1°C** (equivalent n≈10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↓ (Large): The presence of an established La Niña is a strong downward pressure compared to the 2023-2024 period.
    -   ↑ (Large): The underlying long-term warming trend makes any modern year substantially warmer than historical analogues.
    -   ↑ (Moderate): Record-high ocean heat content provides thermal inertia, slowing the cooling process.
    -   ↑ (Small/Moderate): The persistent warming effects from the Hunga Tonga water vapor plume are still active.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests a significant upward adjustment from the La Niña base rate. The cooling from La Niña will prevent new records, but the combined warming pressures will keep the peak anomaly well above the 2020-2022 levels. The posterior should shift moderately upwards from the prior, but remain well below the 2023-2024 peaks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) values weakening (moving from < -0.5°C back toward 0).
    -   Copernicus monthly reports for October/November showing a stall in the cooling trend.
    -   Anomalously high sea surface temperatures persisting or strengthening outside the equatorial Pacific.
    -   A major, widespread heatwave over a large landmass like Siberia or North America in late 2025.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   ONI values strengthening (becoming more negative, e.g., -1.0°C or lower), indicating a strong La Niña.
    -   A strong negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) developing.
    -   Unusually extensive early snow cover across the Northern Hemisphere.
    -   A major tropical volcanic eruption that injects cooling sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The resolution is on the *highest single daily anomaly*, which is inherently more volatile and subject to random weather patterns than a monthly average. A single extreme event could determine the outcome.
-   **Data Reanalysis:** The Copernicus ERA5 dataset, which this question resolves on, is a reanalysis product. Initial real-time figures can be revised slightly after the fact.
-   **Lag Effects:** The precise lag time between oceanic ENSO conditions and the peak atmospheric temperature response is variable and not perfectly understood, creating uncertainty.
-   **Model Divergence:** Climate models may differ on the projected strength and persistence of the current La Niña event, impacting forecasts for the coming months.
-   **Unknown Unknowns:** The climate system is complex; novel interactions or unforeseen events (e.g., a sudden stratospheric warming event) could influence the outcome in unpredictable ways.

### Final Research Summary
A newly established La Niña will exert a strong cooling influence, making a new record high anomaly extremely unlikely. However, this cooling will be significantly counteracted by the powerful long-term warming trend and unprecedented ocean heat, likely resulting in a peak daily anomaly lower than 2023/2024 but notably warmer than the last La Niña period (2020-2022).

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The appropriate base rate is the La Niña Nov/Dec periods from 2020-2022, where peak daily anomalies ranged from 1.0°C to 1.2°C. This is chosen because it matches the current ENSO state and provides a baseline expectation under La Niña conditions.
   - Mean/median: 1.1°C; Variance: small, reflecting the narrow range of anomalies during these periods.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current La Niña conditions align with the 2020-2022 reference period, suggesting a cooling influence.
   - Differences: The starting point in 2025 is warmer due to the residual heat from the preceding El Niño and long-term warming trends, which were not as pronounced in 2020-2022.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - La Niña conditions (↓): Strong cooling influence, making lower anomalies more likely.
   - Long-term warming trend (↑): Increases the likelihood of higher anomalies.
   - Ocean heat content (↑): Provides thermal inertia, moderating the cooling effect.
   - Hunga Tonga eruption effects (↑): Adds a small warming pressure.
   - Overall, the evidence suggests a moderate upward adjustment from the La Niña base rate.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered at 1.1°C.
   - Evidence suggests upward adjustment due to competing warming factors.
   - Posterior mean shifts upward, with increased variance to account for the mixed influences.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast should account for the volatility of daily peaks.
   - Tail risks: Consider extreme weather events or unforeseen climate interactions.
   - Alternative forecast: A stronger La Niña could push anomalies lower, but the warming trend and ocean heat content make this less likely.
   - Adjust percentiles to reflect these considerations.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the highest surface air temperature anomaly is expected to be higher than the 2020-2022 La Niña period but lower than the 2023-2024 El Niño peaks.

P10: 1.15  
P20: 1.20  
P40: 1.25  
P60: 1.30  
P80: 1.35  
P90: 1.40

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly for Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two key reference classes to establish my prior:
- **Recent La Niña Nov/Dec periods (2020-2022)**: During these periods, peak daily anomalies typically ranged from 1.0°C to 1.2°C.
- **Overall recent Nov/Dec periods (2020-2024)**: This broader class shows daily peak anomalies ranging from 1.0°C to 1.5°C, with the higher values during El Niño years.

Given that we're entering a La Niña period, I'll center my prior on the La Niña reference class, with a median of approximately **1.1°C** and a reasonable spread of about ±0.2°C to account for natural variability within La Niña conditions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're in a confirmed La Niña phase, similar to 2020-2022
- The seasonal pattern (Nov-Dec) matches our reference class
- The underlying measurement methodology remains consistent

**Key differences:**
- We're coming off a much warmer starting point in 2025 compared to the 2020-2022 La Niña
- Ocean heat content is significantly higher than during previous La Niña periods
- The background warming trend continues to push temperatures upward (~0.2°C per decade)
- Lingering effects from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption (water vapor in stratosphere)
- Reduced aerosol "masking" from shipping fuel regulations

These differences suggest our prior should be adjusted upward from the 2020-2022 La Niña baseline.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
- The long-term warming trend (~0.2°C per decade) means 2025 should be warmer than previous La Niña years (strong effect, +0.1°C)
- Unprecedented ocean heat content provides thermal inertia against cooling (moderate effect, +0.1°C)
- Stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga eruption adds warming pressure (small-moderate effect, +0.05°C)
- Reduced aerosol masking from shipping regulations (small effect, +0.02°C)
- 2025 has been the second/third warmest year on record so far (moderate evidence, +0.08°C)

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
- La Niña conditions officially declared and expected to persist through end of 2025 (strong effect, -0.2°C)
- Temperature anomalies have already begun declining from peak levels (moderate evidence, -0.1°C)
- September 2025 was only the third warmest on record, showing cooling trend (moderate evidence, -0.05°C)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 1.1°C (from La Niña reference class), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Upward adjustments:**
- Long-term warming trend: +0.1°C
- High ocean heat content: +0.1°C
- Hunga Tonga water vapor: +0.05°C
- Reduced aerosol masking: +0.02°C
- 2025's warmth so far: +0.08°C

**Downward adjustments:**
- La Niña cooling effect: -0.2°C
- Observed cooling trend: -0.15°C

**Net adjustment:** +0.1°C to the median

This shifts my posterior median from 1.1°C to approximately 1.2°C. The uncertainty range also widens slightly due to the competing factors at play.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating how quickly La Niña can cool the atmosphere once established
- The resolution criterion is the single highest daily anomaly, which could be affected by short-term weather events
- I might be overweighting the thermal inertia from ocean heat content
- The timing of La Niña's peak influence relative to Nov-Dec 2025 is uncertain

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Lower scenario (P10-P20 range)**: La Niña strengthens rapidly, global cooling accelerates, and no significant heat waves occur in Nov-Dec. Anomaly peaks around 0.9-1.0°C.
- **Higher scenario (P80-P90 range)**: La Niña develops weakly, ocean heat continues to dominate, and a major heat wave affects a large landmass. Anomaly peaks around 1.4-1.5°C.

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my uncertainty range to account for the volatility of daily measurements
- I should slightly lower my median estimate to account for the possibility that La Niña's cooling effect may be stronger than anticipated

## 6. Final Percentiles

After careful consideration of the evidence and potential uncertainties, here are my calibrated percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025:

P10: 0.9
P20: 1.0
P40: 1.1
P60: 1.2
P80: 1.3
P90: 1.4

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the highest single daily global surface air temperature anomaly in November or December 2025. The most relevant reference class is the behavior of this metric during recent La Niña events, as La Niña conditions have been declared for the forecast period.

-   **Reference Class**: Peak daily anomalies during the Nov/Dec periods of the "triple-dip" La Niña from 2020 to 2022.
-   **Reasoning**: This period matches the most critical climate driver for late 2025—the La Niña phase of ENSO. This phase is associated with global cooling relative to neutral or El Niño conditions.
-   **Distribution**: The research report suggests that peak daily anomalies during these La Niña years were in the **1.0°C to 1.2°C** range. I will therefore center my prior distribution around a median of **1.1°C**, with a plausible range (P10-P90) of approximately 0.95°C to 1.25°C to account for inter-annual variability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
While the ENSO state is similar to the 2020-2022 reference period, several crucial factors make the 2025 situation different, nearly all of which point toward a warmer outcome.

-   **Similarities**: The primary similarity is the active La Niña, which is the main cooling influence.
-   **Differences**:
    -   **Long-Term Warming Trend**: The underlying anthropogenic warming trend of ~0.2°C per decade means the baseline for 2025 is roughly 0.06-0.10°C warmer than the 2020-2022 period.
    -   **Unprecedented Thermal Inertia**: 2025 is emerging from the record-shattering heat of 2023-2024. Ocean heat content is at near-record levels. This immense stored energy will buffer against La Niña's cooling effect, keeping global temperatures higher than they would be otherwise.
    -   **Other Warming Factors**: The warming effect from the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption (stratospheric water vapor) is still present, and reduced aerosol pollution continues to have a small warming effect. These factors were not as prominent during the 2020-2022 base period.
    -   **Warmth in Other Oceans**: While the equatorial Pacific is cool (La Niña), other major ocean basins like the Atlantic have been persistently and anomalously warm, counteracting the global cooling effect.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Each piece of evidence adjusts the prior distribution.

-   **La Niña Presence (Likelihood from Prior)**: This is the foundation of the prior itself. It strongly suggests the outcome will be cooler than the 2023-2024 El Niño period (which saw monthly anomalies around 1.45°C).
-   **Long-Term Warming Trend (Upward Pressure)**: This evidence makes values from the 2020-2022 period less likely and pushes the entire distribution upward by ~0.08°C.
-   **Record Ocean Heat / Thermal Inertia (Strong Upward Pressure)**: This is the most significant piece of new evidence. The fact that the *monthly* anomaly for September 2025 was already ~1.2°C (the high end of the *peak daily* range from the prior) makes it highly probable that the Nov/Dec peak will be substantially higher than the prior's median. This evidence shifts the distribution upward by a significant amount, perhaps +0.15°C to +0.20°C.
-   **Hunga Tonga / Aerosols (Moderate Upward Pressure)**: These factors add a smaller but persistent warming pressure, making lower outcomes less likely. This might add another +0.05°C to the expectation.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Conceptually, I update the prior based on the likelihood of observing the current conditions.

-   **Prior Median**: ~1.1°C (based on 2020-2022 La Niña).
-   **Update Step**:
    -   Start with the prior: 1.1°C.
    -   Add the long-term trend: 1.1°C + 0.08°C = 1.18°C.
    -   Add the strong effect of ocean heat inertia and other warming factors: 1.18°C + 0.20°C = 1.38°C.
-   **Posterior Distribution**: The posterior distribution is shifted significantly upward from the prior. The new median is around **1.38°C**. The competing nature of a strong cooling signal (La Niña) and several strong warming signals (ocean heat) increases uncertainty, suggesting the posterior distribution should be reasonably wide. The distribution is likely positively skewed, as the La Niña provides a soft floor, while the unprecedented warming factors could lead to surprisingly high outcomes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must challenge my own forecast for potential biases.

-   **Alternative Scenario 1 (Stronger La Niña)**: What if the La Niña strengthens rapidly and its atmospheric coupling is faster than expected? In this case, the cooling could dominate, pushing the peak anomaly down toward the upper end of the 2020-2022 range, plus the warming trend (i.e., ~1.2°C + 0.08°C = 1.28°C). This is captured by the lower tail of my distribution (P10-P20).
-   **Alternative Scenario 2 (Weak La Niña / Dominant Warmth)**: What if the La Niña is a dud and the immense ocean heat continues to be released? The cooling trend could stall or reverse, potentially pushing the peak anomaly toward 1.5°C, challenging the non-El Niño records. This possibility is captured by the upper tail of my distribution (P80-P90).
-   **Volatility of Daily Peak**: The question is about a single day, not a monthly average. A "perfect storm" of continental heatwaves could cause a short-lived spike. My range (P10-P90 of ~0.28°C) is intended to capture this volatility.
-   **Conclusion**: The central estimate seems robust, but the tails are important. The current distribution, with a median of 1.38°C and a P10-P90 range from 1.24°C to 1.52°C, appropriately balances the competing forces and accounts for the inherent uncertainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is based on a posterior distribution centered around 1.38°C, reflecting a La Niña year that is significantly warmer than past La Niña years due to immense background heat and other warming factors.

P10: 1.24
P20: 1.29
P40: 1.35
P60: 1.42
P80: 1.47
P90: 1.52
