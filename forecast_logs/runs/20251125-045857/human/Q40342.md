### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Mid-term MP Departures (Resignations & Floor Crossings) in Canadian Parliaments:** Historically, mid-term departures are uncommon but not rare. In the 44th Parliament (2021-present), there have been 11 resignations and 2 floor crossings over ~3 years. This suggests a rate of ~4.3 events per year. For the ~1.5-month resolution window (Nov 17 - Dec 31), this implies a base rate of **~45-55%** for at least one event occurring. This is a broad reference class, averaging periods of stability and instability.
2.  **Departures during Minority Governments:** Minority governments are inherently less stable and create incentives for political maneuvering. The Martin minority government (2004-2006) saw a high-profile floor crossing (Belinda Stronach) that saved the government on a confidence vote. This class suggests that rates increase dramatically during high-stakes periods. The base rate from this class is likely higher, perhaps in the **60-70%** range for an event during a critical budget period, though the sample size of such situations is small.
3.  **Post-Election "Musical Chairs" (First 6 Months):** The period immediately following a contentious election can see shifts as MPs re-evaluate their roles. However, the current scenario is post-election but also features a specific, acute political crisis (the budget and the push for a majority). This reference class is less applicable as the drivers are not typical post-election adjustments but rather a targeted political campaign.

*Reasoning:* The most relevant class is #2, adjusted by the raw frequency of #1. The short, high-stakes timeframe makes a simple annualized rate less reliable. The key is that the *potential value* of a single MP's move is extraordinarily high, which should inflate the probability above a simple historical average.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** Jeneroux resigns from Conservative caucus — ↑ — His resignation, reportedly under pressure to prevent a floor crossing, signals that active, high-stakes negotiations are happening and that the Conservative party is using hardball tactics which could backfire.
*   **2025-11-05** d'Entremont crosses floor to Liberals — ↑ — This event breaks the inertia, making the idea of switching parties tangible and demonstrating a viable path for other disaffected Conservatives. It proves the Liberals are actively recruiting.
*   **2025-11-05** d'Entremont cites disagreement with Poilievre's leadership — ↑ — This provides a credible, policy-based justification for others to follow suit, framing a potential defection as a matter of principle rather than pure opportunism.
*   **Hypothetical (pre-Nov 17)** Budget introduced — ↑ — The budget itself creates a focal point and a deadline. It forces every MP to take a stand and provides the context for any potential government-saving or government-making move.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Liberal Government Inducements:** The promise of a cabinet position, a prestigious committee chair, or future appointments (e.g., Senate, ambassadorship) is a powerful lure for an opposition backbencher. The Liberals' desperate need for two seats makes their offers highly credible. (Size: Large)
2.  **Conservative Leadership Disaffection:** The background highlights friction with Pierre Poilievre's leadership. For moderate or "Red Tory" MPs, this provides a strong ideological push factor, especially if they feel their political future within the party is limited. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Conservative Party Discipline (Counter-pressure):** The party leadership will be aggressively "whipping" its members, using threats of deselection in the next election, removal from committees, and social ostracization to prevent further defections. This can be effective but, as seen with Jeneroux, can also backfire and trigger a resignation. (Size: Large)
4.  **Personal Factors & "Golden Handshake":** An MP nearing retirement might be induced to resign early to trigger a by-election in exchange for a patronage appointment, allowing them to exit public life on favorable terms. This is a common, lower-profile mechanism for engineering vacancies. (Size: Small-to-Moderate)
5.  **Bloc Québécois or NDP Instability:** While the focus is on Conservatives, an MP from another party could resign for personal reasons or become an independent over a specific policy dispute related to the budget, also triggering the resolution criteria. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Majority:** The government is just two seats away from a majority. This is not a typical minority situation; it's a tipping point. The value of a single MP crossing the floor is magnified immensely compared to a government that is 10 or 15 seats short.
*   **Active & Recent Precedent:** The d'Entremont and Jeneroux events within the last month have created a "hot" environment. The taboo against floor-crossing has been broken, and the political conversation is already primed for more moves.
*   **Specific Leadership Catalyst:** The friction is not abstract; it is explicitly tied to the current, known-to-be-polarizing leader of the Opposition. This creates a clear and identifiable faction of MPs who are at higher risk of departing.
*   **Imminent Confidence Vote:** The budget vote serves as a hard deadline, concentrating all political pressure into the resolution window. In a normal parliamentary session, these pressures are more diffuse over time.
*   **Public Justification Established:** d'Entremont has already road-tested a public relations narrative ("disagreement with the leader's ideals"), making it easier for a second or third MP to use a similar, pre-validated justification.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the reference class of mid-term departures in minority governments, a prior of ~60% seems reasonable, reflecting that these events are more likely than not in such volatile periods. (Equivalent n of ~5-10 similar high-stakes budget cycles).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The d'Entremont defection proves the concept and shows the Liberals are actively dealing.
    *   ↑ (Large): The Jeneroux resignation confirms intense backroom pressure and the reality of the threat, suggesting other MPs are also "in play."
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The government's razor-thin distance from a majority dramatically increases the incentive for them to make irresistible offers.
    *   ↑ (Small): The specific, polarizing nature of the Opposition leader provides a plausible ideological "cover" for defectors.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests this situation is far more acute than a typical minority government scenario. The prior should be revised significantly upwards.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Rumors or reports of specific Conservative MPs meeting with the Prime Minister's Office or senior Liberal cabinet ministers.
    *   A Conservative MP publicly breaking with the party line on a key budget issue.
    *   An MP from any party suddenly cancelling their public schedule or being unusually absent from Ottawa.
    *   Op-eds or media interviews by backbench MPs lamenting the "state of politics" or "toxic partisanship," classic signals of disaffection.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A public, strongly-worded, and unified statement of caucus solidarity from the Conservative Party, signed by all remaining MPs.
    *   The Liberal government signaling a willingness to compromise on the budget with the NDP or Bloc, reducing the need for a majority.
    *   Key "at-risk" Conservative MPs being given prominent new roles or critic portfolios by Poilievre to placate them.
    *   Parliament rising for the holiday break early, reducing the time available for political maneuvering.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Breadth:** The question resolves "Yes" for *any* MP from *any* party resigning or switching. While the focus is on a Con->Lib defection, a random NDP resignation for health reasons would also count.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most crucial information (private negotiations) is hidden. Public statements may be strategic misdirection. The Jeneroux resignation shows that events can happen with little public warning.
*   **Timing of Resignation:** An MP could *announce* their resignation before Jan 1, 2026, but have it be effective *after* that date. The resolution criteria must be checked carefully for the effective date of the change.
*   **Fictional Scenario Dynamics:** The scenario is built on plausible but fictional events. The motivations of these fictional MPs are assumed based on real-world political archetypes, which may not hold.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for an MP departure in a minority government is already elevated, but the current context—a government just two seats from a majority, with recent, successful precedents for defection and resignation—creates extreme incentives that push the probability of another event before year-end significantly higher.

To forecast the probability of another Canadian MP defecting or resigning before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate comes from the historical frequency of mid-term MP departures during minority governments, which is estimated at 60-70%. This reflects the increased likelihood of political maneuvering in such volatile periods, especially during high-stakes events like budget negotiations.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a minority government, which historically sees higher rates of MP departures. The proximity to a majority amplifies the stakes, similar to past high-stakes periods.
   - Differences: The recent defections and resignations, combined with the specific leadership dynamics and the imminent budget vote, create a more acute environment than typical minority governments.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **d'Entremont's defection**: This event increases the probability as it demonstrates active recruitment by the Liberals and sets a precedent for others.
   - **Jeneroux's resignation**: Suggests intense internal pressures and potential for further defections, increasing the likelihood.
   - **Proximity to majority**: The high value of a single defection increases the probability.
   - **Leadership disaffection**: Provides a plausible reason for MPs to defect, increasing the likelihood.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 60%, the evidence strongly supports an increase in probability. The likelihood ratios for the key pieces of evidence (defections, resignations, leadership issues) suggest a significant upward revision.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds)
   - Given the strong evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted upwards significantly from the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The forecast must account for potential countermeasures by the Conservative Party and the possibility of strategic misdirection.
   - Alternative scenarios: A sudden compromise on the budget or a strong show of unity by the Conservatives could reduce the probability.
   - Adjustments: While the evidence is strong, the inherent uncertainty in political negotiations suggests a conservative adjustment to avoid overconfidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential counterarguments, the final probability reflects a high likelihood of another MP defection or resignation before 2026.

Final: 85%

# Will another Canadian MP defect or resign before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for an MP defection or resignation in the specified timeframe (Nov 17 - Dec 31, 2025, approximately 6 weeks).

The most relevant base rate comes from examining MP departures during minority governments, particularly during politically tense periods:

- In the 44th Parliament (2021-present), there were approximately 11 resignations and 2 floor crossings over ~3 years, suggesting a rate of ~4.3 events per year
- For a 6-week period, this would translate to approximately 0.5 events (4.3 × 6/52)
- However, minority governments with razor-thin margins create heightened incentives for defections

Given these considerations, I'll start with a prior of **60%** that at least one MP will defect or resign in this period. This reflects that such events are more likely than not during politically volatile periods in minority governments.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a minority government situation where individual MPs have outsized influence
- There are ideological tensions within parties that can motivate defections
- The normal background rate of resignations for personal/health reasons still applies

**Key differences that matter:**
- The Liberal government is just 2 seats away from a majority, creating extraordinarily high incentives for recruitment
- Two recent precedents (d'Entremont crossing and Jeneroux resigning) have already occurred, breaking inertia
- The budget vote creates a specific, high-stakes focal point during the resolution window
- The explicit friction with Poilievre's leadership provides a ready-made justification for Conservative defectors
- The Conservative Party is actively using pressure tactics that could backfire into resignations

These differences significantly increase the likelihood above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Chris d'Entremont's floor crossing (Nov 5)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If more defections are coming, we'd expect to see initial defections like this
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - This could be a one-off event if the Liberals secured only one vulnerable MP
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Matt Jeneroux's resignation (Nov 6)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If more MPs are in play, we'd expect to see pressure tactics and resignations
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Such a quick resignation following another defection is unlikely if the situation is stable
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.0
- This evidence strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Reports of "consequences" for potential floor-crossers**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Active threats indicate party leadership fears more defections
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Could be standard discipline even if no other MPs are wavering
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Proximity to majority (just 2 seats needed)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - The high value of each defection creates strong incentives
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This situation could still resolve without further changes
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 60% (odds of 1.5:1), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 2 (Jeneroux resignation):**
- Prior odds: 1.5:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.0
- Posterior odds: 1.5 × 4.0 = 6.0:1
- Posterior probability: 6.0/(1+6.0) = 0.857 or ~86%

**Update on Evidence 1 (d'Entremont crossing):**
- Prior odds: 6.0:1
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 6.0 × 3.0 = 18.0:1
- Posterior probability: 18.0/(1+18.0) = 0.947 or ~95%

This seems too high given the uncertainties, so I'll be more conservative in my final assessment.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- I may be overweighting recent events (recency bias)
- The Conservative Party could implement effective countermeasures to prevent further defections
- The Liberals might secure support from the NDP or Bloc for the budget, reducing their need to recruit more MPs
- The short timeframe (6 weeks) limits opportunities for complex political maneuvers
- MPs might wait until after the holiday break to make major career decisions

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a much lower probability (~40%) based on the argument that the Conservatives will now be hyper-vigilant about preventing further defections, and the two recent events were the only "low-hanging fruit" available to the Liberals.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The pressure tactics already backfired once with Jeneroux, and the incentives for the Liberals to secure a majority are so strong that they will likely make extraordinary offers to potential defectors. The holiday period also provides cover for MPs to make decisions away from Ottawa's spotlight.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and accounting for uncertainties, I believe there is a high probability that another Canadian MP will defect or resign before 2026. The combination of:
1. Two recent precedents creating momentum
2. The high stakes of being just 2 seats from a majority
3. The explicit leadership tensions in the Conservative Party
4. The budget vote creating a focal point
5. Evidence of active recruitment and pressure tactics

All point to an environment where further changes are likely. However, I need to account for the limited timeframe and potential countermeasures.

Final: 78%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider the historical frequency of MP departures (resignations or floor crossings) in Canada.

*   **Broad Reference Class:** The research report notes that in the 44th Parliament (a recent minority government), there were 13 such events over approximately 3 years, yielding a rate of ~4.3 events per year. For the ~1.5-month resolution window (Nov 18 - Dec 31), this implies a baseline probability of at least one event occurring of roughly 45-55%. This rate averages over periods of calm and crisis.
*   **Narrow Reference Class:** A more specific reference class is "MP departures during a high-stakes confidence vote in a minority government." These situations are inherently more volatile. The 2005 defection of Belinda Stronach to the Martin Liberal government, which saved it on a budget vote, is a key historical analogue. This suggests the probability in such a crisis period should be significantly higher than the parliamentary average.

Given these points, I will select a prior that sits between the broad average and the expectation for a crisis period. A starting point of **P(H) = 55%** seems appropriate. This acknowledges that we are in a minority government situation with a pending confidence vote, making a departure more likely than a typical parliamentary period.

In odds form, this is 0.55 / (1 - 0.55) = 1.22 to 1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from a generic "minority government crisis" in several ways that increase the likelihood of an event:

*   **Proximity to Majority:** The Liberal government is only two seats away from a stable majority. This is a tipping point, not a typical minority situation. The value to the government of securing two more MPs is immense, dramatically increasing the incentives they can offer.
*   **Recent Precedents:** The defection of Chris d'Entremont and the resignation of Matt Jeneroux occurred just before the resolution window opens. This breaks the inertia against such moves, provides a ready-made public justification for others, and confirms that active, high-stakes negotiations are underway. The situation is "hot."
*   **Specific Catalyst:** The friction is explicitly linked to the leadership of Pierre Poilievre, creating a specific and identifiable group of potentially disaffected moderate Conservative MPs.

These factors suggest the base rate of 55% is likely too low and a significant upward adjustment is warranted based on the specific evidence.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "another Canadian MP will defect or resign before 2026." Let E be the evidence of the d'Entremont defection and Jeneroux resignation in early November.

*   **P(E | H):** If another departure were to happen before year-end (H), it is highly probable that it would be preceded by signs of instability. The events of Nov 5-6 are strong signals of a caucus in turmoil and a government on the offensive. Therefore, seeing this evidence, given that more is to come, is very likely.
*   **P(E | ~H):** If no further departures were to occur (~H), it is less likely that we would have seen two such events in rapid succession. It's possible they were a one-off, but it's more probable that such dramatic events are part of a larger, ongoing political battle. The evidence suggests the situation is volatile and unlikely to have suddenly resolved itself.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** The likelihood ratio is clearly greater than 1. The evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that the political environment is ripe for further departures. I will estimate a conservative combined likelihood ratio of approximately 2.0, meaning the observed evidence is about twice as likely if another departure is coming than if it is not.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will now update the prior odds using the likelihood ratio derived from the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1.22 to 1 (equivalent to 55%)
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** ~2.0
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
*   **Posterior Odds** = 1.22 × 2.0 = 2.44 to 1

Now, I convert the posterior odds back to a probability:

*   **Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)**
*   **Posterior Probability** = 2.44 / (1 + 2.44) = 2.44 / 3.44 ≈ 0.709

The updated probability after considering the specific evidence is approximately **71%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must consider reasons why this forecast might be wrong.

*   **Overconfidence from Recency:** The dramatic events of early November might be the entire story, not the beginning of one. The Conservative Party is now on high alert and will be using every measure of party discipline to prevent further departures. The element of surprise is gone.
*   **Alternative Forecast (e.g., 40%):** This lower forecast would be plausible if the Conservative caucus is more unified than it appears, and the "consequences" threatened by the party are sufficient to deter any other potential defectors. Furthermore, the Liberals may have already secured the only MPs who were willing to switch, and no other viable candidates exist.
*   **Rebuttal:** While party discipline is a strong force, the prize of a majority government provides the Liberals with the incentive to make offers (e.g., cabinet posts, ambassadorships) that can outweigh party loyalty. Also, the question is broad: it resolves "Yes" on *any* MP resigning for *any* reason (including personal or health), which provides a floor for the probability. The Jeneroux resignation shows that even if the party prevents a floor-crossing, their pressure tactics can still trigger a resignation, which also satisfies the resolution criteria.

The red team analysis confirms that there are significant counter-pressures, which is why the probability is not higher (e.g., >85%). However, the powerful incentives and demonstrated instability still make another departure the more likely outcome. The 71% forecast seems to properly balance these competing forces.

### 6. Final Forecast

My final forecast is based on a prior probability of 55% for an MP departure during a minority government crisis, updated by the strong evidence of recent, related departures and the extreme incentives created by the government's proximity to a majority. The evidence suggests this is a uniquely volatile situation, justifying a significant upward revision of the probability.

Final: 71%
