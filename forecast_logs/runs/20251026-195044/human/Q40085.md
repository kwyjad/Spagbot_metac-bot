### Reference class & base rates
1.  **UNFCCC COP Host Selections (General):** In over 30 instances, a host has been successfully selected from the designated regional group. The default to Bonn, Germany, is a backstop mechanism, not a common outcome. The base rate of a non-Bonn host being selected is >95%.
2.  **Contested Bids within a Regional Group:** This is a rarer subclass. When multiple countries bid, the outcome is determined by internal group politics and consensus. Often, one candidate withdraws to ensure group unity. A persistent deadlock leading to the Bonn default is unusual. A rough estimate is that in cases of contested bids, a consensus candidate is found ~80% of the time, with the default occurring ~20% of the time.
3.  **Bids from Major Fossil Fuel Exporters:** Countries with significant fossil fuel production/exports (e.g., Canada, Australia, UAE) bidding to host have faced increased scrutiny on their climate commitments. This often becomes a central point of negotiation and can weaken their position if their climate policies are not seen as sufficiently ambitious. This reference class suggests Australia faces a higher-than-average barrier to securing consensus.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-12** Australia submits a more ambitious 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC, targeting a 62-70% emissions reduction. **(↑ Australia)** — This directly addresses the primary criticism against its bid: a perceived lack of climate ambition, strengthening its case within WEOG.
*   **2025-09-03** Australian government website re-confirms its active bid to co-host COP31 with the Pacific. **(↔)** — Signals continued commitment but is not new information.
*   **2024-11-27** A report indicates the decision on the COP31 host was postponed until June 2025 due to a lack of consensus. **(↓ Australia, ↑ Germany)** — This is the most crucial recent event. The fact that a decision was not made as scheduled and that the June 2025 informal deadline has passed (as of today, Oct 2025) indicates a significant and persistent deadlock, likely centered on opposition to the Australian bid. This substantially increases the probability of the default Bonn outcome.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus:** (Large) The decision mechanism is "consensus" among all WEOG members. A single influential member or a bloc (e.g., the EU) can effectively veto a bid, forcing a stalemate. This is the primary driver of the outcome.
2.  **Climate Policy Credibility:** (Large) Australia's status as a major fossil fuel exporter is its key vulnerability. Its new, more ambitious NDC is a direct attempt to counter this. The credibility of this new target in the eyes of European WEOG members is critical.
3.  **The Pacific Partnership Narrative:** (Moderate) Australia's proposal to co-host with climate-vulnerable Pacific Island nations is a unique and powerful diplomatic tool. It frames the bid around climate justice, which resonates strongly with the goals of the UNFCCC process.
4.  **Geopolitical Horse-Trading:** (Moderate) The decision may be influenced by unrelated diplomatic considerations, such as support for other candidacies in UN bodies or other bilateral agreements between WEOG members. Turkey's geopolitical position may play a role here.
5.  **Risk of Stalemate (Reputational Damage):** (Moderate) A prolonged public failure to select a host would be embarrassing for the WEOG group. This creates pressure on both Australia and Turkey to either build a winning coalition or gracefully withdraw to allow the other to proceed. The longer the deadlock, the higher the pressure.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Prolonged, Public Deadlock:** Unlike typical host selections that are resolved quietly, this contest has been in "limbo" for nearly a year. The missed informal deadline of June 2025 is a strong signal of an unusually deep division within WEOG.
*   **Co-Hosting with Non-State Parties:** The bid to co-host with a group of Pacific nations is a novel approach, adding a layer of complexity and a powerful moral argument not present in typical single-country bids.
*   **Host Credibility Paradox:** The leading public bid is from a country whose economic identity is closely tied to fossil fuel exports, creating a fundamental tension with the purpose of the conference. This makes the political calculus for other WEOG members more complex than a simple evaluation of logistics and funding.
*   **Narrow Field:** With only two official bids, there is no third option to act as a compromise candidate (besides the Bonn default). This creates a direct head-to-head dynamic where one side must either win consensus or withdraw.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior would have placed Australia as a moderate favorite (~50%) due to its high-profile campaign and Pacific partnership, with Turkey as a significant challenger (~35%) and a small chance for the Bonn default (~15%). (Equivalent n≈15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↓ Large)** The failure to reach consensus by the informal June 2025 deadline is strong evidence that opposition to Australia's bid is entrenched, significantly increasing the probability of a continued stalemate and the Bonn default.
    *   **(↑ Moderate)** Australia's submission of an ambitious 2035 NDC is a material change that directly counters its main weakness, providing its supporters within WEOG with a strong argument.
    *   **(↔) Turkey's relative quiet:** The lack of recent news on Turkey's bid is an information gap. It could imply a less energetic campaign or a strategy of quiet diplomacy, waiting for the Australian bid to falter. It does not strongly shift probabilities on its own.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The deadlock is a major negative signal for Australia, while the new NDC is a major positive one. The net effect should be to lower the probability of Australia and increase the probability of Germany (Bonn) as the "no consensus" outcome. Turkey's probability may also slightly increase as the less controversial alternative. The overall uncertainty of the forecast should increase.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP (Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support for Australia's bid from major European WEOG members (e.g., Germany, France, UK).
    *   A joint statement from Pacific Island Forum leaders strongly re-endorsing the Australian co-host bid post-NDC submission.
    *   Reports or rumors of Turkey reconsidering or withdrawing its bid.
    *   An official announcement of a WEOG meeting specifically to resolve the COP31 host issue.
*   **DOWN (Australia):**
    *   Public statements from Turkey reaffirming its candidacy and lobbying efforts at COP30.
    *   Criticism of Australia's new NDC as insufficient by influential climate NGOs or European officials.
    *   Leaks from WEOG meetings indicating the deadlock persists.
    *   Discussions beginning about the logistical preparations needed for a default conference in Bonn.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Process:** The WEOG consensus process is conducted behind closed doors. The final decision could be sudden and based on private negotiations not visible to the public.
*   **Source Availability Bias:** The provided sources and general English-language media coverage are heavily focused on Australia's bid. The strength of Turkey's diplomatic campaign within WEOG is likely under-reported.
*   **Compromise Candidate:** While unlikely, if the deadlock is absolute, a third WEOG country could be asked to step in as a compromise host to save face for the group. This would resolve as "Other".
*   **Conditional Support:** Support for Australia's bid may be conditional on further climate policy concessions, which may or may not materialize before the decision is made.
*   **Definition of "Host":** The resolution criteria specify the "home country of the announced host city." If Australia wins, it resolves as Australia, even with Pacific co-hosts. If a Pacific Island nation were to be the primary host city (highly unlikely), it would resolve as "Another Pacific Island Nation."

**Final Research Summary:** Australia's strong bid, bolstered by a new climate target and a unique Pacific partnership, is locked in a protracted stalemate with Turkey. The persistent lack of consensus within the WEOG group makes the default option of Bonn, Germany, a growing and credible possibility.

To forecast which country will host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP 31) in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Historically, countries with strong bids and significant diplomatic efforts have a reasonable chance of hosting. Given Australia's active campaign and Pacific partnership, a prior probability of 50% seems reasonable.
- **Turkey**: As the only other official bidder, Turkey should have a significant chance, but less than Australia due to less visibility and diplomatic activity. A prior of 35% is appropriate.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: The default option if no consensus is reached. Historically rare, but given the current deadlock, a prior of 15% is reasonable.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely, as the bid is primarily led by Australia. Prior probability of 0%.
- **Other**: No other bids are currently known. Prior probability of 0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: Similar to base rate due to strong bid and new NDC. Different due to prolonged deadlock.
- **Turkey**: Similar to base rate as a significant contender. Different due to lack of recent activity.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: Similar to base rate as a fallback. Different due to increased likelihood from deadlock.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely as a primary host.
- **Other**: No other bids known.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia's new NDC**: Increases likelihood of Australia hosting (P(E | H) high), but deadlock reduces it (P(E | ~H) high).
- **Prolonged deadlock**: Strong evidence against Australia (P(E | H) low) and for Germany (P(E | ~H) high).
- **Turkey's quiet campaign**: Neutral, but slightly favors Germany due to lack of resolution (P(E | H) moderate).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 50/50. Deadlock evidence reduces odds significantly. New NDC increases odds slightly. Overall, posterior probability decreases.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 35/65. Deadlock slightly increases odds. Overall, posterior probability increases slightly.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: Prior odds = 15/85. Deadlock significantly increases odds. Overall, posterior probability increases significantly.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Ensure not overestimating Australia's chances due to strong bid.
- **Tail Risks**: Consider unlikely scenarios, such as a sudden consensus or new bid.
- **Alternative Forecast**: Germany as a fallback is plausible due to deadlock.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to sum to 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 35%  
Turkey: 25%  
Germany: 40%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0%  
Other: 0%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and the likelihood of each outcome, considering the ongoing deadlock and Australia's recent NDC submission.

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia: 40%**
- Australia has a formal bid with government backing and financial commitments
- It's from the WEOG group which is scheduled to host
- Co-hosting with Pacific nations adds diplomatic weight

**Turkey: 30%**
- Has an official bid from the correct regional group (WEOG)
- Antalya is identified as the likely host city
- Less information about the strength of their campaign

**Germany: 20%**
- Default option if consensus fails
- Houses UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn
- Serves as the fallback when regional groups can't agree

**Another Pacific Island Nation: 5%**
- While mentioned as co-hosts with Australia, unlikely to be primary host
- Limited infrastructure for such a large event
- Would be unusual for primary hosting to shift outside the designated regional group

**Other: 5%**
- Covers any other WEOG member stepping in as a compromise
- Historical precedent suggests this is rare but possible

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The rotation system is functioning as expected with WEOG's turn
- Multiple countries from the correct group have submitted bids
- The process follows established UNFCCC protocols

**Key differences:**
- The prolonged deadlock (decision postponed beyond June 2025) is unusual
- Australia's co-hosting approach with Pacific nations is novel
- Australia faces unique scrutiny as a major fossil fuel exporter
- Only two official bids creates a binary choice with no obvious compromise

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Failure to reach consensus by June 2025 deadline**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.3 - This significantly hurts Australia's chances
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.4 - Also negative but less so
- P(E|Germany hosts): 0.8 - Strongly supports the default option
- Likelihood ratio (Germany vs. Australia): ~2.7x

**Evidence: Australia's new ambitious 2035 NDC (Sept 2025)**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.7 - Directly addresses their main weakness
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.4 - Neutral to slightly negative
- P(E|Germany hosts): 0.3 - Makes default less necessary
- Likelihood ratio (Australia vs. Germany): ~2.3x

**Evidence: Australia's Pacific partnership approach**
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.6 - Strengthens their moral position
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.3 - Creates contrast with Turkey's standard bid
- Likelihood ratio (Australia vs. Turkey): ~2x

**Evidence: Relative quiet from Turkey's campaign**
- P(E|Turkey wins): 0.4 - Not what you'd expect from a strong campaign
- P(E|Australia wins): 0.5 - Slightly favors Australia
- Likelihood ratio (Australia vs. Turkey): ~1.25x

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the most significant evidence: the missed consensus deadline.

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 40%
- Prior odds: 40/60 = 0.67
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 0.43 = 0.29
- Posterior probability: 0.29/(1+0.29) ≈ 22%

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 4 = 1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+1) = 50%

Now updating on Australia's new climate target:
For Australia:
- Prior probability (after first update): 22%
- Prior odds: 22/78 = 0.28
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 0.28 × 2.33 = 0.65
- Posterior probability: 0.65/(1+0.65) ≈ 39%

For Germany:
- Prior probability (after first update): 50%
- Prior odds: 50/50 = 1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- Posterior odds: 1 × 0.43 = 0.43
- Posterior probability: 0.43/(1+0.43) ≈ 30%

Continuing with qualitative updates for all options based on remaining evidence:
- Turkey benefits from the deadlock but is hurt by their quiet campaign
- Pacific Islands as primary hosts remains very unlikely
- Other options become slightly more plausible as compromise candidates

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- We have limited visibility into internal WEOG negotiations
- Turkey's diplomatic efforts may be underreported in English sources
- The research report focuses more on Australia's bid
- The default to Bonn may be more procedural than political

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could be quietly building consensus while Australia gets media attention
- A third WEOG country could emerge as a compromise candidate
- The deadlock could be resolved through a package deal involving other international appointments
- Australia's climate commitments might be deemed insufficient despite the new NDC

**Adjustments needed:**
- Increase uncertainty across all options
- Slightly reduce Australia's probability to account for potential overrepresentation in sources
- Maintain a significant probability for the Germany default option given the persistent deadlock

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, here are my adjusted probabilities:

Australia: 35%
Turkey: 28%
Germany: 30%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 5%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 35%
Turkey: 28%
Germany: 30%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 5%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** Contested bids for hosting a UN COP within a regional group.
*   **Prior Probabilities:** The research report suggests that in such cases, a consensus candidate is typically found (~80% of the time), and the process defaults to the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany, only in cases of persistent deadlock (~20% of the time).
*   This gives us a starting point: P(Germany) = 20%.
*   The remaining 80% is split between the two official bidders: Australia and Turkey. Australia has a more prominent, high-profile bid with a unique co-hosting angle, while Turkey is the other official candidate. A reasonable prior split of this 80% would give a slight edge to the more visible campaign.
*   **Initial Priors:**
    *   P(Australia): 45%
    *   P(Turkey): 35%
    *   P(Germany): 20%
    *   P(Another Pacific Island Nation): <1% (The bid is for an Australian city).
    *   P(Other): <1% (A compromise candidate is rare with only two official bids).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process follows the standard UN regional group rotation and requires consensus within the Western European and Others Group (WEOG).
*   **Differences:** This case is highly unusual due to the **prolonged and public deadlock**. The failure to meet an informal June 2025 deadline is a strong deviation from the norm, suggesting the base rate of 20% for a default to Germany is likely too low for this specific situation. The central controversy around Australia's status as a fossil fuel exporter also makes this a more politically charged decision than a typical logistical one.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate two key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Persistent Deadlock (Postponement past June 2025).**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if Germany is the eventual host (P(E1|Germany) is high), as a deadlock is the direct cause of this outcome.
    *   It is less likely if Australia or Turkey were strong consensus candidates (P(E1|Australia) and P(E1|Turkey) are lower).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence strongly increases the probability of Germany hosting, while decreasing the probability of either Australia or Turkey winning consensus.

*   **Evidence 2: Australia's ambitious 2035 NDC submission (September 2025).**
    *   This evidence is highly likely if Australia is to win (P(E2|Australia) is high), as it's a strategic move to overcome the opposition that is causing the deadlock.
    *   It is also plausible if Australia ultimately fails (P(E2|Germany or Turkey) is medium), as it represents an attempt to win, not a guarantee of winning.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence moderately increases the probability of Australia hosting, primarily at the expense of Germany (by making consensus more likely) and Turkey (by strengthening Australia's specific bid).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Priors:** P(Australia) = 45%, P(Turkey) = 35%, P(Germany) = 20%.
2.  **Update for Deadlock:** The prolonged deadlock is strong evidence against a consensus outcome. This significantly shifts probability away from the bidders and towards the default option. I will move 20 percentage points from the "consensus pool" (Australia and Turkey) to Germany.
    *   P(Germany) increases from 20% to 40%.
    *   P(Australia) decreases from 45% to ~34%.
    *   P(Turkey) decreases from 35% to ~26%.
3.  **Update for Australia's New NDC:** This is Australia's countermove to break the deadlock. It makes an Australian-led consensus more plausible. However, the fact that the deadlock has persisted for over a month *after* this submission tempers its impact. It's a necessary step for Australia, but not sufficient to guarantee victory. This claws back some probability for Australia, mostly from the "deadlock" (Germany) outcome. I will shift 8 percentage points towards Australia.
    *   P(Australia) increases from 34% to 42%.
    *   This probability is drawn primarily from Germany (whose chances decrease as consensus becomes more likely) and slightly from Turkey (whose position as a compromise is weakened).
    *   P(Germany) decreases from 40% to 34%.
    *   P(Turkey) decreases from 26% to 24%.

This leaves a posterior of roughly: Australia 42%, Germany 34%, Turkey 24%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast places Australia as a slight favorite but gives a very high probability to the default option, Germany.
*   **Could I be underestimating Turkey?** Yes. The "Source Availability Bias" mentioned in the report is a key risk. Turkey may be running a very effective "quiet diplomacy" campaign that is not visible in English-language media. Their position as the less controversial alternative to a major fossil fuel exporter is a significant advantage.
*   **Could I be overestimating Australia?** Yes. The deadlock is the hardest piece of evidence. The fact that their ambitious NDC in September did not immediately break the stalemate is a very bad sign for their bid. It suggests the opposition within WEOG is principled and entrenched, and may not be swayed by policy tweaks. This would mean Germany's chances are even higher than I've estimated.
*   **Tail Risks:** The "Other" option, while unlikely, could materialize if the group wants to avoid the reputational damage of a failed process and asks a neutral country (e.g., Switzerland, New Zealand) to step in.

Considering these risks, I will slightly reduce the probabilities of the main contenders and distribute that mass to the other options to reflect the high uncertainty. I will slightly lower Australia and Germany and keep Turkey's share, reflecting the possibility of their quiet campaign being effective.

### 6. Final Normalization

After red-teaming, I adjust my probabilities to reflect the deep uncertainty and potential for a surprise outcome.

*   Australia: 41% (Slight favorite due to proactive bid, but facing major headwinds).
*   Germany: 33% (Very high chance for a default option, reflecting the persistent deadlock).
*   Turkey: 23% (Plausible consensus alternative, potentially underestimated).
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 1% (Extremely unlikely as the bid is for an Australian city).
*   Other: 2% (A small chance for a compromise candidate to emerge).

The sum is 41 + 33 + 23 + 1 + 2 = 100%. This distribution reflects a highly contested and uncertain situation with three very plausible outcomes.

Australia: 41%
Turkey: 23%
Germany: 33%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 2%
