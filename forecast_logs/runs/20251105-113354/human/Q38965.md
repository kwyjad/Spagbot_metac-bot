### Reference class & base rates
-   **Former UK Prime Ministers returning as party leader:** This is a very rare event in the modern era. The most cited example is Winston Churchill, who returned as PM in 1951 after losing the 1945 election. However, he remained party leader throughout. A better reference class is former party leaders who were ousted and later returned. Iain Duncan Smith was ousted in 2003 and has not returned. William Hague resigned in 2001 and has not returned. Looking further back, leaders like Stanley Baldwin and Ramsay MacDonald had multiple non-consecutive terms, but this was in a different political era (pre-1940s). **Base rate: <5%**. This is a low-confidence estimate based on the near-zero frequency in the post-war period.
-   **Failed leadership contenders who later become leader:** This is more common. Theresa May, Rishi Sunak, and Liz Truss all ran for leadership unsuccessfully before eventually winning. Johnson himself falls into this category (he pulled out of the 2016 contest). This class is not directly applicable as Johnson has already been leader, but it shows the party is willing to reconsider past figures. **Base rate: N/A for this question, but informative about party dynamics.**
-   **Populist leaders returning to power globally:** Figures like Donald Trump in the US or Silvio Berlusconi in Italy demonstrate that charismatic, controversial leaders can stage comebacks after losing power, even amidst scandal. This widens the reference class but reduces its specificity to the UK's parliamentary system. This suggests that personal brand and a loyal base can overcome institutional opposition. **Base rate: 10-20%**. This is a rough estimate, but it suggests such events are not impossible.

**Limitations:** The UK's parliamentary system, where a leader must command the confidence of their MPs, makes the global populist class a poor fit. The most relevant class (former UK PMs returning after being ousted by their party) has a base rate near zero.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2023-06-09** Johnson resigns as an MP. ↓ — A massive structural barrier. He cannot lead the party without a seat in the House of Commons. This was a direct result of the Privileges Committee report on Partygate.
-   **2024-07-04** Conservative Party suffers a historic defeat in the General Election. ↑ — Creates a leadership vacuum and a mood of desperation within the party, making a high-risk, high-reward "savior" candidate more appealing. Rishi Sunak resigns.
-   **2024-09-02** Kemi Badenoch is elected as the new Conservative Party leader. ↓ — A new leader is in place, temporarily blocking any comeback. The focus shifts to her performance and ability to unite the party and challenge the Labour government.
-   **2024-11-05** The Autumn Statement from the Labour government imposes new taxes, which are unpopular with the Conservative base. ↑ — Provides Johnson with ammunition for his Daily Mail column, allowing him to position himself as the true voice of conservatism and critique the new Tory leadership's response.
-   **2025-05-01** Conservatives perform poorly in local elections, showing no significant recovery in the polls under Badenoch's leadership. ↑ — Increases pressure on the current leader and fuels chatter among Johnson loyalists that a change is needed to have any chance at the next election.
-   **2025-09-09** Reports (per the provided source) indicate Johnson remains active on the speaking circuit and in his media role, consistently criticizing the opposition and subtly undermining the current Tory leadership. ↑ — He is deliberately keeping himself in the public eye and relevant to the political conversation, a prerequisite for any comeback attempt.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Conservative Party Desperation (Large ↑):** The primary driver for a Johnson return. If the party remains at historic lows in the polls under a new leader, the perceived need for an electoral "game-changer" could override concerns about his character and past conduct.
-   **Lack of an MP Seat (Large ↓):** The single biggest obstacle. Johnson must be selected for a safe seat and win a by-election to even be eligible. This requires the cooperation of the central party and a local association, which is not guaranteed.
-   **Popularity with Party Membership (Large ↑):** Polls consistently show Johnson remains popular with the grassroots members who ultimately vote for the leader. If he can get on the final ballot of two, he has a very high chance of winning.
-   **Hostility from the Parliamentary Party (Large ↓):** A significant number of Conservative MPs, including many senior figures, were instrumental in his ousting and view him as an electoral liability and unfit for office. They would likely work to prevent him from getting on the final leadership ballot.
-   **Performance of the Current Leader (Moderate ↔):** If the current leader (Kemi Badenoch, in this scenario) fails to gain traction, the "demand" for a replacement grows. If she stabilizes the party or improves its polling, the door for Johnson remains firmly shut.
-   **Media Profile and Financial Independence (Small ↑):** His Daily Mail column and lucrative speaking engagements keep him publicly relevant and financially secure, allowing him to bide his time and choose his moment without needing a parliamentary salary.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Forced out by own party over scandal:** Unlike Churchill, who lost a general election but retained the respect of his party, Johnson was forced to resign by his own MPs due to a series of scandals (Partygate, Pincher). This leaves a legacy of deep internal division and mistrust.
-   **No longer an MP:** This is a unique and critical distinction. No potential returning leader in modern UK history has faced the procedural hurdle of first needing to find a way back into Parliament.
-   **Formal censure by Parliament:** The Privileges Committee found that Johnson knowingly misled the House of Commons. This is an unprecedented stain on a former Prime Minister, making it harder for MPs to justify bringing him back.
-   **A loyal and vocal base:** Johnson commands a level of personal loyalty from a segment of the party membership and electorate that is more akin to a US-style populist figure than a traditional UK party leader.
-   **Scale of the 2024 defeat:** The historic nature of the 2024 election loss creates a level of desperation and a political vacuum not seen since 1997, potentially leading the party to consider options that would be unthinkable in normal times.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (<10%) based on the rarity of such comebacks in UK politics. A prior of **5% with an equivalent n=20** seems reasonable, reflecting a strong belief in the historical precedent.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) Johnson's resignation as an MP is a massive structural barrier that significantly lowers the probability from the base rate.
    -   (↑ Large) The catastrophic 2024 election defeat and subsequent polling failure of the new leadership creates the desperate conditions necessary for a high-risk comeback to even be considered.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The deep-seated opposition among the parliamentary party, who would have to put him on the ballot, remains a powerful check on the will of the membership.
    -   (↑ Moderate) His enduring popularity with the party membership provides a clear, viable path to victory *if* he can overcome the MP-related hurdles.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence presents a strong clash between a powerful negative (no seat) and a powerful positive (party desperation/membership support). The negative is a procedural gatekeeper, while the positive is a powerful motivator. The net effect should be an **upward revision from the very low prior, but the probability should remain low (likely in the 10-20% range)**, as the path to return is fraught with obstacles that must be overcome in sequence.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A Conservative MP in a very safe seat announces their resignation, sparking speculation it's to make way for Johnson.
    -   A "Draft Boris" campaign gains significant public backing from Conservative donors, councillors, and associations.
    -   The current leader faces a vote of no confidence or public calls to resign from senior party figures.
    -   Polls of Conservative members show Johnson's lead over all other potential candidates widening significantly.
    -   Johnson begins to make more frequent, direct interventions on policy and leadership.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The current Conservative leader's approval ratings stabilize or begin to rise.
    -   Johnson accepts a major international role or business position that is incompatible with a return to frontline politics.
    -   Potential safe seats hold by-elections and select other candidates.
    -   Senior party figures publicly and forcefully rule out any prospect of a Johnson return.
    -   A fresh scandal involving Johnson emerges.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **The MP Seat is a hard gate:** The entire scenario is contingent on Johnson finding a path back to Parliament. Without this, the probability is zero. Media speculation is irrelevant until a viable seat emerges.
-   **Member vs. MP disconnect:** Polling of the membership may show strong support, but the parliamentary party acts as a filter. They select the final two candidates for the membership to vote on. They could conspire to keep him off the ballot.
-   **Johnson's true intentions:** His actions (writing columns, giving speeches) can be interpreted as both keeping options open and simply building a lucrative post-political career. His actual desire to return to the grueling life of opposition leader is uncertain.
-   **Resolution deadline:** The question closes on Jan 1, 2026. This is a short timeframe. A leadership contest and a by-election campaign would take months. Events would need to move very quickly from this point forward.
-   **Media amplification:** The media loves the story of a Johnson comeback and may over-report minor events, creating a false sense of momentum.

**Final Research Summary:**
Boris Johnson's return as Conservative leader before 2026 is a low-probability event, primarily blocked by the major structural hurdle of him not being a Member of Parliament. However, the party's desperate post-election situation and his enduring popularity with the membership create a plausible, albeit narrow, path to power should the current leadership falter and a safe seat become available.

To forecast the probability of Boris Johnson returning as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026, let's follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for former UK Prime Ministers returning as party leader after being ousted is extremely low, estimated at less than 5%. This is based on historical precedent in the post-war period, where such events are nearly non-existent. Given the unique circumstances surrounding Johnson's resignation and the structural barriers he faces, a prior probability of 5% seems appropriate.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Johnson, like other ousted leaders, faces significant opposition within his party and has been involved in scandals. The historical rarity of such comebacks aligns with the base rate.
   - Differences: The current political climate, marked by a historic defeat for the Conservative Party and Johnson's enduring popularity with the party membership, creates a unique scenario that could increase his chances compared to the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Resignation as MP (↓ Large):** Johnson's resignation as an MP is a significant barrier, as he cannot lead the party without a seat in Parliament. This decreases the probability significantly.
   - **2024 Election Defeat (↑ Large):** The Conservative Party's historic defeat creates a leadership vacuum and desperation, increasing the probability of considering a high-risk candidate like Johnson.
   - **Popularity with Party Membership (↑ Moderate):** Johnson's popularity with the grassroots members increases the likelihood of his return if he can overcome the MP-related hurdles.
   - **Hostility from Parliamentary Party (↓ Moderate):** The opposition from many Conservative MPs decreases the probability, as they could prevent him from getting on the leadership ballot.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 5%, the evidence presents a mix of strong negatives (resignation as MP) and positives (party desperation and membership support). The structural barrier of not being an MP is a significant hurdle, but the party's desperation and Johnson's popularity provide a counterbalance.
   - Given the evidence, an upward revision from the very low prior is warranted, but the probability should remain low due to the procedural and political obstacles. A reasonable posterior probability might be in the range of 10-20%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from overestimating the impact of Johnson's popularity with the membership while underestimating the procedural barriers and opposition from MPs.
   - An alternative scenario where Johnson does not seek to return or where the current leader stabilizes the party could further decrease the probability.
   - Adjusting for these considerations, a conservative estimate would lean towards the lower end of the revised range.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final calibrated probability of Boris Johnson returning as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026 is:

Final: 15%

# Will Boris Johnson return as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical precedents of former UK party leaders returning to leadership after being forced to resign.

In modern UK political history (post-WWII), there are virtually no examples of party leaders who were forced to resign due to scandals and later returned to lead their party. Winston Churchill is often cited, but he lost an election rather than being forced out by his own party. The closest examples might be:

- Michael Howard: Previously a failed leadership contender who later became leader (2003)
- William Hague: Resigned after electoral defeat, never returned
- Iain Duncan Smith: Forced out by MPs, never returned

Looking at the Conservative Party specifically, no leader who resigned under pressure from their own MPs has ever returned to leadership in the modern era.

**Prior probability: 5%**

This reflects the extreme rarity of such comebacks in UK politics, especially for leaders who left under a cloud of scandal and parliamentary censure.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Johnson remains popular with segments of the Conservative membership
- The party is in opposition and searching for direction
- There's precedent for politicians making comebacks after setbacks (though not in this exact scenario)

**Key differences:**
- Johnson is no longer an MP, creating a procedural barrier not present in other cases
- He was formally censured by Parliament for misleading the House (Privileges Committee)
- The scale of the 2024 electoral defeat creates unprecedented desperation
- Johnson maintains high media visibility through his Daily Mail column
- The timeline is compressed (only until January 2026)

These differences, particularly his lack of a parliamentary seat, make Johnson's situation significantly more challenging than the already rare base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Johnson resigned as an MP in June 2023**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return as leader, this evidence would be very unlikely (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, this evidence would be very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability of his return

**Evidence 2: Historic Conservative defeat in July 2024 election**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return, this evidence would be quite likely (~0.7)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, this evidence would still be likely (~0.6)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.6 = 1.17
- This slightly increases the probability of his return

**Evidence 3: Kemi Badenoch elected leader in September 2024**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return, this evidence would be expected (~0.5)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, this evidence would be very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56
- This moderately decreases the probability of his return

**Evidence 4: Poor Conservative performance in May 2025 local elections**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return, this evidence would be very likely (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, this evidence would be moderately likely (~0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This moderately increases the probability of his return

**Evidence 5: Johnson remains active in media and speaking circuit**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return, this evidence would be very likely (~0.9)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, this evidence would still be likely (~0.7)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.7 = 1.29
- This slightly increases the probability of his return

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), let's update based on the evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (No longer an MP):**
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.11 = 0.0058
- Posterior probability: 0.0058/(1+0.0058) = 0.0058 ≈ 0.6%

**Update on Evidence 2-5 (combined effect of electoral defeat, new leadership, poor local elections, media presence):**
- Prior odds: 0.006/0.994 = 0.006
- Combined likelihood ratio: 1.17 × 0.56 × 1.6 × 1.29 ≈ 1.35
- Posterior odds: 0.006 × 1.35 = 0.0081
- Posterior probability: 0.0081/(1+0.0081) = 0.008 ≈ 0.8%

However, this mechanical calculation likely underestimates the probability by treating the MP barrier as nearly insurmountable. In reality, there are plausible paths for Johnson to return to Parliament if political conditions strongly favor it.

Adjusting for this, and considering the compressed timeline until January 2026, I would revise the probability upward to approximately 10%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the MP barrier. A by-election could be arranged quickly if there's sufficient will.
- The Conservative Party's desperation after a historic defeat might lead to more radical solutions than historical precedent suggests.
- Johnson's personal popularity with the membership might be stronger than I've accounted for.
- The timeline until January 2026 is short but not impossible if events move quickly.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast might be 20-25%, arguing that:
- The Conservative Party's electoral desperation is unprecedented
- Johnson maintains strong support among the membership
- A safe seat could be arranged through party machinery
- Johnson's media presence indicates continued political ambition

**Rebuttal:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome the fundamental structural barriers:
- The parliamentary party (MPs) would need to put him on the final ballot
- Many MPs who forced him out remain opposed to his return
- The procedural hurdles of finding a seat and winning a by-election
- The limited time remaining until January 2026
- Johnson may prefer his lucrative media career to the challenges of opposition leadership

After considering these alternative perspectives, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 12%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 12%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is former UK party leaders who were ousted by their own parliamentary party in the post-WWII era. This includes figures like Margaret Thatcher, Iain Duncan Smith, and Theresa May. None of them returned to the leadership. This suggests a historical frequency of effectively 0%. However, to avoid assigning a probability of zero to an event that is not a logical impossibility, a very low prior is appropriate. A broader, less relevant class of global populist leaders (e.g., Trump, Berlusconi) shows that comebacks are possible, but the specifics of the UK parliamentary system make this comparison weak.

Given the near-zero frequency in the most relevant reference class, I will set a conservative prior probability P(H) of **2%**. This acknowledges the event is historically unprecedented in modern Britain but not impossible. In odds, this is 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case of past ousted leaders in several critical ways:

*   **Difference (Negative): Johnson is not an MP.** This is a massive, unprecedented structural barrier. Unlike Thatcher or May, who remained in Parliament after losing the leadership, Johnson would first need to find a safe seat and win a by-election. This makes his path back significantly more complex.
*   **Difference (Positive): Enduring popularity with the party membership.** Johnson maintains a level of personal loyalty and popularity among the Conservative grassroots that is arguably much higher than that of other ousted leaders. Since members vote for the final two leadership candidates, this gives him a powerful advantage if he can clear the parliamentary stage.
*   **Difference (Positive): Extreme party desperation.** The research report posits a historic 2024 election defeat and a subsequent failure by the new leader to improve the party's fortunes. Such a desperate situation could lead the party to consider radical options, like returning to a leader they believe is a "proven election winner," which would not be considered in normal times.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event "Boris Johnson returns as leader before 2026" and ~H be "he does not."

*   **Evidence 1: Johnson resigned as an MP (June 2023).**
    *   P(E | H): The probability he would resign his seat, given he planned a comeback, is very low. It creates a huge obstacle.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability he would resign, given he was moving on to a post-political career, is high. It was a reaction to the Privileges Committee report and freed him to earn money.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability of a return.

*   **Evidence 2: The Conservative Party is in a state of crisis (historic defeat, new leader failing).**
    *   P(E | H): These conditions are almost a prerequisite for a Johnson comeback. The party would not consider such a move unless it were desperate. This probability is high.
    *   P(E | ~H): The party could be in crisis for many reasons, and the most likely outcome is still not a Johnson return. However, this specific scenario is the one that makes a comeback plausible at all.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1.** This evidence of desperation significantly increases the probability from the post-resignation low point.

*   **Evidence 3: The deadline is Jan 1, 2026 (14 months from the report's date).**
    *   P(E | H): For a comeback to happen, a complex sequence of events must unfold: the current leader must be ousted, a safe seat must be found for Johnson, he must win a by-election, and he must win a leadership contest. Completing this in 14 months is possible but very difficult.
    *   P(E | ~H): A 14-month window makes it more likely that political inertia, or any single failure point in the complex chain of events, will prevent a comeback.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1.** The short timeframe is a significant piece of evidence against the event occurring.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Prior:** Start at 2% (Odds 1:49).
2.  **Update 1 (Resigned as MP):** This is a massive blow. The odds are slashed. Let's say the odds are multiplied by 1/10, leading to new odds of 1:490, or a probability of ~0.2%.
3.  **Update 2 (Party Desperation):** This is the primary driver for a comeback. It creates the demand. This strong evidence might increase the odds by a factor of 20. New odds become (1:490) * 20 = 20:490 ≈ 1:24.5. The probability rises to ~4%.
4.  **Update 3 (Tight Timeline):** The 14-month window makes the complex sequence of events less likely. This might halve the odds (a likelihood ratio of 0.5). Final odds become (1:24.5) * 0.5 = 1:49. This brings the probability back to our starting point of ~2%.

My initial qualitative update feels too low. The "desperation" factor in a party facing oblivion feels like a more powerful force. Let's reconsider the update. The combination of desperation AND his specific popularity with members is a potent one. Let's re-run the update with more emphasis on that.

1.  **Prior:** 2% (1:49 odds).
2.  **Update 1 (Not an MP):** Odds decrease significantly. New probability ~0.5%.
3.  **Update 2 (Desperation + Member Popularity):** This is the core of the "pro-comeback" argument. It makes the "unthinkable" plausible. This is strong evidence. Let's say it increases the probability from 0.5% to around 10%.
4.  **Update 3 (Timeline + MP Hostility):** The short timeline and the fact that MPs must put him on the ballot act as powerful filters. This evidence significantly reduces the 10% estimate. A halving seems reasonable. This leads to a posterior of ~5%.

This feels more robust. The final probability should be low, reflecting the major hurdles, but not negligible, reflecting the unique drivers.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~5% could be wrong.
*   **Case for a higher probability (>10%):** I may be underestimating the sheer panic that will set in if the Conservatives continue to flatline in the polls. In a crisis, institutional norms can break down quickly. A "coronation" or a rapid by-election/leadership contest could be engineered by his allies. Johnson's charisma and perceived electoral magic might be a siren song the party cannot resist.
*   **Case for a lower probability (<3%):** I may be underestimating the logistical difficulty and the deep-seated opposition. The parliamentary party's "veto" is a hard barrier. Many MPs who helped oust him would rather lose than see him return, and they will actively work to prevent him from getting on the ballot. Furthermore, Johnson may not even want the thankless job of Leader of the Opposition. The entire narrative could be a media creation he is happy to entertain for profit and relevance. The 14-month timeline makes this sequence of events extremely unlikely.

The arguments for a lower probability, rooted in concrete procedural barriers (no seat, MP ballot) and the tight timeline, seem more compelling than the more speculative psychological argument about party desperation. Therefore, I will stick to the lower end of my range.

### Final Forecast
The probability of Boris Johnson returning as Conservative leader before 2026 is very low. The primary obstacles are that he is not a Member of Parliament and must overcome significant opposition within the parliamentary party to even be considered. The short timeframe of just over a year makes the necessary sequence of events—a leadership vacancy, a successful by-election, and a victorious leadership campaign—highly improbable. However, his enduring popularity with the party membership, combined with the party's desperate electoral situation, creates a narrow, non-zero path for a return. The event remains plausible enough to warrant a probability higher than the near-zero base rate.

Final: 6%
