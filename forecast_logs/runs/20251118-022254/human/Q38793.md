### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Post-Cold War Era (1991–2024).** In the 74 countries of Africa and Latin America, there have been approximately 45 successful coups over 34 years. This yields a rate of ~1.32 successful coups per year across these regions. For the question's ~4.3-month (133-day) window, a simple Poisson model (λ = 1.32 * 133/365 ≈ 0.48) suggests a base rate of **~38%** for at least one successful coup.
*   **Reference Class 2: Recent "Coup Contagion" Era (2020–2024).** This period has seen a marked increase in successful coups, almost exclusively in Africa's Sahel region. There have been 8 successful coups in ~5 years (Mali x2, Guinea, Chad, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon), an average of ~1.6 per year. This rate implies a base rate of **~44%** for the question's window (λ = 1.6 * 133/365 ≈ 0.58).
*   **Limitations:** Both classes assume a stable rate, but coup risk is "lumpy" and concentrated in a few highly unstable states. The second reference class is more relevant due to recent geopolitical shifts but is based on a small number of events. The true base rate for this specific future window likely lies between these two estimates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*As of 2025-11-18, the forecast window is very short (44 days remaining). Developments from the last 6 months are key.*
*   **2025-10-28** Sudan's rival military factions reject a new internationally-brokered ceasefire. (↑) — Continued civil war deepens state collapse, making any factional seizure of the capital a potential coup/regime change event.
*   **2025-10-15** Chad's transitional government announces a further 6-month delay to elections, citing security concerns. (↑) — Postponing the return to civilian rule increases military entrenchment and risks internal power struggles within the junta.
*   **2025-09-22** ECOWAS announces the suspension of joint military exercises planned for Q4 2025, citing funding shortfalls. (↑) — Signals weakening regional cohesion and reduced capacity to deter or respond to potential coups, lowering the cost for plotters.
*   **2025-08-05** The Haitian transitional council fails to meet a key deadline for establishing an electoral commission. (↑) — Political paralysis and extreme gang violence create a power vacuum where a non-state actor or a renegade police/military unit could attempt to seize control.
*   **2025-07-18** The G7 issues a statement condemning the "democratic backsliding" in the Sahel but announces no new concrete sanctions. (↓) — While acknowledging the problem, the lack of new deterrents maintains the status quo rather than increasing the risk. It's a weak downward signal.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Endemic State Fragility & Insurgency (Large):** In the Sahel (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger) and surrounding areas (Chad, Sudan), governments lack control over large territories and have failed to stop jihadist insurgencies. Military frustration and perceptions of civilian incompetence are primary drivers for intervention.
*   **Weakened International Norms (Large):** The post-Cold War consensus against coups has eroded. Western influence (especially France's) is waning in Africa, while actors like Russia offer alternative partnerships to isolated juntas, reducing the cost of international pariah status.
*   **Contagion/Demonstration Effect (Moderate):** Successful coups in neighboring countries provide a playbook and normalize military takeovers as a political tool. The creation of the "Alliance of Sahel States" by juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger institutionalizes this effect.
*   **Economic Grievances (Moderate):** High inflation, youth unemployment, and food insecurity fuel popular discontent. Coup leaders often leverage this anger, promising stability and economic relief to gain initial public support.
*   **Elite Power Struggles (Small-to-Moderate):** In both autocratic and fragile democratic settings, internal rivalries can spill over. A president attempting to purge a rival from the military or security services can trigger a preemptive coup (e.g., Niger 2023).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Geographic Concentration:** Unlike the more scattered coups of the past, the recent wave is hyper-concentrated in the African "coup belt" from Guinea to Sudan. This suggests a regional systems-level dynamic is at play, rather than just idiosyncratic national factors.
*   **Geopolitical Realignment:** The Cold War provided external patrons for coups. The post-Cold War era saw external pressure against them. We are now in a multipolar era where aspiring plotters can shop for patrons, fundamentally changing the incentive structure compared to the 1991-2019 period.
*   **Divergence of Regions:** Latin America's institutions, while stressed (e.g., Bolivia 2024, Brazil 2023), have proven more resilient to *successful military* coups than those in the Sahel. The risk is almost entirely concentrated in Africa for this question.
*   **Popular Support:** Many recent African coups have enjoyed significant, albeit sometimes temporary, popular support, framed as a rejection of corrupt, ineffective, and pro-Western civilian governments. This popular legitimacy buffer is a key feature.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the recent (2020-2024) coup rate seems most appropriate. This suggests a ~44% chance of at least one successful coup in the full ~4.3-month window.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The intense and unresolved crises in multiple Sahelian-adjacent states (Sudan, Chad) provide several plausible, short-term scenarios for a successful coup.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The demonstrated weakness of international and regional (ECOWAS) anti-coup responses has lowered the expected cost for plotters, making a coup a more attractive option.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The extremely short remaining time horizon (44 days) is a strong constraint. A coup plot must already be mature and near its execution phase to succeed before Jan 1, 2026.
    *   (↓ Small) Latin America appears unlikely to contribute to a "Yes" resolution, effectively removing ~20 countries from the high-risk pool and concentrating the risk in fewer African states.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of acute, concentrated instability in Africa significantly raises the probability above the historical average. However, the very short time window is a powerful countervailing factor. The posterior should move slightly upwards from the recency-based prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Sudden, unexplained dismissals or arrests of high-ranking military officers in Chad, Sudan, or Guinea.
    *   Large-scale mutinies or soldiers abandoning barracks in a capital city.
    *   A head of state (e.g., Mahamat Déby of Chad) disappearing from public view for several days without explanation.
    *   The collapse of a major regional city in Burkina Faso or Mali to insurgents, triggering panic in the capital.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A credible power-sharing agreement is signed and implemented between warring factions in Sudan.
    *   Chad's government successfully holds a peaceful referendum or local election, demonstrating progress towards transition.
    *   Successful counter-insurgency operations that significantly degrade jihadist capabilities in the Sahel.
    *   The African Union or a major power bloc imposes new, biting sanctions on a current junta, raising the cost for future plotters.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The line between a coup and a constitutionally dubious succession can be blurry (e.g., Chad 2021). Resolution will depend

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for coups in Africa and Latin America is derived from two reference classes. The first, covering the post-Cold War era (1991–2024), suggests a base rate of ~38% for a successful coup in the given time window. The second, focusing on the recent "Coup Contagion" era (2020–2024), suggests a base rate of ~44%. Given the recent increase in coup activity, particularly in Africa, the second reference class is more relevant. Therefore, I will use a prior probability of 44%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current geopolitical climate in Africa, particularly in the Sahel region, aligns with the recent "Coup Contagion" era, characterized by state fragility, insurgency, and weakened international norms against coups.
   - Differences: The time window is very short (44 days), which is a significant constraint compared to the longer periods considered in the base rate calculations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Sudan's ongoing conflict**: The rejection of a ceasefire increases the likelihood of a coup (↑).
   - **Chad's election delay**: Increases the risk of internal power struggles (↑).
   - **ECOWAS suspension of military exercises**: Reduces deterrence against coups (↑).
   - **Haiti's political paralysis**: Creates a power vacuum, though less relevant due to geographic focus (↑).
   - **Short time horizon**: Strongly decreases the likelihood of a coup occurring within the remaining time (↓).
   - **Latin America's stability**: Decreases the likelihood of a coup in this region (↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.44 / (1 - 0.44) = 0.7857
   - Likelihood ratio: Considering the evidence, the likelihood of a coup occurring is moderately increased by the instability in Africa but significantly constrained by the short time window. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 1.2.
   - Posterior odds = 0.7857 × 1.2 = 0.9428
   - Posterior probability = 0.9428 / (1 + 0.9428) ≈ 0.485

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The short time window is a critical factor that might be underestimated. Coups require planning and execution, which may not align with the remaining days.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden, unexpected event (e.g., assassination or major insurgent victory) could trigger a coup attempt.
   - Adjustments: Given the short time frame, I will slightly lower the probability to account for the execution challenges within 44 days.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect the constraints of the short time window and the concentrated risk in Africa.

Final: 45%

# Will there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish a prior based on recent historical coup frequencies in Africa and Latin America.

**Reference Class 1: Recent "Coup Contagion" Era (2020-2024)**
- 8 successful coups in Africa over ~5 years (Mali x2, Guinea, Chad, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon)
- Average of ~1.6 successful coups per year
- For the remaining 44-day window (Nov 18 - Dec 31, 2025), this yields:
  - λ = 1.6 × (44/365) ≈ 0.19
  - Using Poisson probability: P(at least 1 event) = 1 - e^(-λ) ≈ 17.5%

**Reference Class 2: Post-Cold War Era (1991-2024)**
- Approximately 45 successful coups over 34 years across 74 countries
- Average of ~1.32 coups per year
- For the 44-day window: λ = 1.32 × (44/365) ≈ 0.16
- P(at least 1 event) = 1 - e^(-λ) ≈ 14.8%

I'll use the more recent reference class (17.5%) as my prior, as it better reflects current geopolitical conditions and the recent "coup belt" phenomenon in the Sahel region.

**Prior probability: 17.5%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The same structural factors driving recent coups remain present: weak state institutions, insurgencies, economic grievances, and geopolitical competition
- The "coup belt" countries (Sahel region) remain highly unstable
- International deterrents against coups remain weak

**Key differences:**
- **Time constraint**: The extremely short remaining window (44 days) significantly reduces the probability compared to a full year
- **Geographic concentration**: Recent coups are highly concentrated in the Sahel region, not distributed evenly across all countries
- **Latin America stability**: Despite some attempts, Latin America has proven more resistant to successful military coups than Africa
- **Specific acute crises**: Sudan's ongoing civil war and Chad's delayed transition create particularly high-risk scenarios

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Extremely short time window (44 days)**
- P(E|H): If a coup occurs, it would need to happen in just 44 days, which is possible but requires a plot to already be well-developed
- P(E|~H): If no coup occurs, the short window is a major contributing factor
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) < 1 (significantly less than 1)
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Acute crises in Chad and Sudan**
- P(E|H): If a coup occurs, it's highly likely to be in one of these countries with ongoing severe instability
- P(E|~H): Even without a coup, these countries remain unstable
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) > 1 (moderately greater than 1)
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Weakened regional deterrents (ECOWAS suspension of joint exercises)**
- P(E|H): If a coup occurs, the weakened regional response capacity would be a contributing factor
- P(E|~H): Weakened deterrents don't guarantee a coup will happen
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) > 1 (slightly greater than 1)
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Recent coup attempts have been unsuccessful (Bolivia 2024)**
- P(E|H): If a coup occurs, it would buck the recent trend of failed attempts
- P(E|~H): Failed attempts suggest stronger institutional resistance
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) < 1 (moderately less than 1)
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the prior of 17.5% (odds of 0.212:1), I'll update based on the key evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (Short time window):**
- This is the strongest factor, with a likelihood ratio of approximately 0.5
- Posterior odds = 0.212 × 0.5 = 0.106
- Posterior probability = 0.106/(1+0.106) ≈ 9.6%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Acute crises in Chad/Sudan):**
- Likelihood ratio of approximately 1.5
- Posterior odds = 0.106 × 1.5 = 0.159
- Posterior probability = 0.159/(1+0.159) ≈ 13.7%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Weakened deterrents):**
- Likelihood ratio of approximately 1.2
- Posterior odds = 0.159 × 1.2 = 0.191
- Posterior probability = 0.191/(1+0.191) ≈ 16.0%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Recent failed attempts):**
- Likelihood ratio of approximately 0.8
- Posterior odds = 0.191 × 0.8 = 0.153
- Posterior probability = 0.153/(1+0.153) ≈ 13.3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which coups can develop and execute
- The "coup contagion" effect could be stronger than historical data suggests
- I might be overlooking specific countries outside the Sahel that have deteriorating conditions
- The holiday period (December) might actually be a strategic time for coups when international attention is diverted

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden collapse of Chad's transitional government is plausible given recent delays in the democratic transition
- Sudan's civil war could produce a coup-like event if a military faction seizes Khartoum
- A surprise coup in a seemingly stable country (like Senegal or Kenya) can't be ruled out

**Adjustments:**
- The extremely short time window remains the dominant constraint
- However, the acute situations in Chad and Sudan warrant a slight upward adjustment
- The probability should reflect both the structural conditions favoring coups and the severe time limitation

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026 is approximately 15%.

Final: 15%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use a reference class based on the recent frequency of successful coups. The research report highlights a "Coup Contagion" era from 2020–2024, which is more representative of the current geopolitical climate than a longer-term average.

- **Reference Class:** Successful coups in Africa and Latin America from 2020-2024.
- **Data:** There were 8 successful coups in this ~5-year period.
- **Annual Rate (λ):** 8 coups / 5 years = 1.6 successful coups per year.

The question's timeframe is from the current date (November 18, 2025) to January 1, 2026, a period of 44 days. I can model the occurrence of coups as a Poisson process.

- **Time Window (t):** 44 / 365.25 ≈ 0.1205 years.
- **Expected Number of Coups (λt):** 1.6 coups/year × 0.1205 years ≈ 0.193.

The probability of at least one successful coup is `1 - P(0 coups)`.
- `P(0 coups) = e^(-λt) = e^(-0.193) ≈ 0.824`
- `P(at least 1 coup) = 1 - 0.824 = 0.176`

This calculation provides a robust, data-driven prior probability.
**Initial Prior: 18%**

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is very similar to the 2020-2024 reference period. The key drivers identified in the research report—state fragility in the Sahel, waning international influence, the demonstration effect of prior coups, and economic grievances—are all still highly active.

The most significant difference is the **extremely short time horizon** of 44 days. My Poisson-based prior already accounts for this mathematically. Another key difference is the **concentration of risk**. While the base rate is calculated across 74 countries, the near-term risk is almost exclusively concentrated in a handful of African nations (e.g., Sudan, Chad), with Latin America's contribution to the probability being negligible. This concentration doesn't necessarily change the overall probability but focuses our attention on specific hotspots.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will now assess specific evidence to update the 18% prior.

- **Evidence 1: Acute and unresolved crises in Sudan and Chad.** (Increases probability)
  - Sudan's ongoing civil war and Chad's delayed transition to civilian rule create highly volatile environments where a factional seizure of power—which would likely qualify as a coup—is a constant and plausible threat.
  - P(E | H): Very high. If a coup were to happen in the next 44 days, it is extremely likely to emerge from one of these pre-existing, acute crises.
  - P(E | ~H): High. These crises are chronic and could easily persist for another 44 days without a coup.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately greater than 1. This evidence strongly confirms that the conditions for a coup are not just abstract but are actively present in specific, high-risk countries, pushing the probability up from a generic base rate.

- **Evidence 2: Weakened international and regional deterrents.** (Increases probability)
  - The reported weakness of regional bodies like ECOWAS and the lack of new, potent international sanctions lower the perceived cost for potential coup plotters. This reinforces the permissive environment that characterized the 2020-2024 period.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Slightly greater than 1. This is largely confirmatory evidence that the high-risk environment persists, so it reinforces the validity of our high-end base rate.

- **Evidence 3: Lack of a clear, public, and immediate trigger.** (Decreases probability)
  - Coups are often precipitated by a specific catalyst, such as a president attempting to fire a powerful general or a major military defeat sparking a mutiny. There are no public reports of such an acute trigger at this moment. While a plot can be secret, the absence of a visible catalyst makes a successful coup in the *immediate* 44-day window slightly less likely than in a random 44-day window during a crisis.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Slightly less than 1. This provides a small downward pressure on the prior.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior:** 18%
- **Update:** The evidence of acute crises in Sudan and Chad provides a moderate upward push, suggesting the risk in this specific 44-day window might be even higher than the average rate implies. The lack of a public trigger provides a slight downward nudge.
- **Synthesis:** The intense, ongoing instability in Sudan is the most powerful piece of evidence. The country is in a state of civil war where a decisive military move by one faction to seize the capital could happen rapidly and would likely be classified as a successful coup. This specific, high-acuity risk outweighs the general observation that there isn't a public trigger. Therefore, I will update the probability slightly upward from the base rate.

Let's adjust the 18% prior upwards by a few percentage points to reflect that the current risk is concentrated and acute, not just a background statistical average. An adjustment to the low 20s seems appropriate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
A key vulnerability in my forecast is relying on a model that assumes a constant rate. The risk is "lumpy." Am I in a lump? The Sudan civil war suggests yes. A better forecast might be significantly higher (e.g., 30-35%), arguing that a state collapse in Sudan is not a matter of *if* but *when*, and 44 days is a plausible timeframe.

Conversely, a lower forecast (~10%) would argue that even in a civil war, seizing total control is complex, and the 44-day window is simply too short for such a decisive event to be likely. Inertia is a powerful force.

My forecast of ~22% attempts to balance these. It acknowledges the severe, immediate risk in Sudan (pulling it above the 18% base rate) but respects the inherent difficulty and rarity of a successful coup happening in such a short, specific window. The risk is real and elevated, but it is not a near-certainty. I will increase my estimate slightly more to account for the severity of the Sudan situation.

Final: 24%
