### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Export Controls on Encryption Software (1990s):** The US government initially classified strong cryptography as a "munition" and heavily restricted its export. This effort ultimately failed due to the widespread global availability of encryption and strong industry pushback. This class suggests a low base rate (~10%) for successfully restricting mass-market, dual-use software over the long term.
2.  **US Export Controls on Semiconductor Technology (2020s):** The US has recently implemented aggressive, targeted controls on the export of advanced semiconductor chips and manufacturing equipment to China, citing national security. This is a more successful and relevant analogue for using technology controls as a tool of geopolitical competition. This class suggests a higher base rate (~40%) for restricting critical hardware inputs.
3.  **Sanctions & Geofencing of Digital Services:** US sanctions regimes (e.g., against Iran, North Korea) often require tech companies to block access. Separately, commercial geofencing for media content (DRM) is common. This shows that the technical and legal mechanisms for restricting access to digital services exist and are used, though typically for sanctions enforcement or commercial reasons, not broad technology control. This suggests a moderate base rate (~25%) for the *capability* to implement such a rule.

Considering these, a blended base rate for the US imposing a novel export control regime on a widely used digital service like an AI API within a few years of its emergence is low to moderate, perhaps in the **15-25% range**.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **National Security Exigency (Large ↑):** A specific, credible threat or incident (e.g., an AI-assisted bioterror plot, major cyberattack, or foreign election interference) linked to a US model would be the strongest driver, likely triggering a rapid executive order that bypasses slow legislative processes.
2.  **Geopolitical Competition with China (Moderate ↑):** The desire to slow China's AI progress by denying it access to US frontier models is a primary motivation within the national security community. This is the logic behind the chip controls and could easily be extended to models.
3.  **Industry Lobbying & Economic Impact (Large ↓):** US AI leaders (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft) generate significant revenue from global API customers. They will lobby intensely against restrictions, arguing they are easily circumvented (VPNs) and would cede the market to foreign or open-source competitors.
4.  **The Open-Source Alternative (Moderate ↓):** The existence of powerful, non-US, or globally available open-source models (e.g., from Meta, Mistral, or Chinese developers) undermines the effectiveness of restricting only US-proprietary APIs. Policymakers may deem the action futile if users can simply switch to an alternative.
5.  **Bureaucratic & Legislative Inertia (Large ↓):** The US federal rulemaking and legislative process is notoriously slow. With only ~10 weeks until the deadline, passing a new law or implementing a formal regulation through the standard process is nearly impossible. An executive action is the only plausible path.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Speed of Capability Gains:** AI progress is occurring much faster than the political and bureaucratic cycles that governed past technology controls (e.g., encryption, nuclear tech), creating pressure for rapid, potentially clumsy, policy responses.
*   **Intangible & Instantly Global Nature:** Unlike hardware (chips) or physical materials, AI model access is a digital service. It is harder to control and easier to circumvent (e.g., via VPNs, third-party resellers), making restrictions more porous than traditional export controls.
*   **Dominance of Private Sector Actors:** A handful of US corporations, not government labs, are at the frontier. Their commercial interests in global markets are a powerful counterweight to national security concerns, a dynamic less present in the early days of nuclear or encryption controls.
*   **Viable Open-Source Ecosystem:** Unlike the semiconductor industry, the AI field has a robust and rapidly advancing open-source community. This provides a readily available alternative that would significantly blunt the impact of restrictions on a few proprietary US APIs.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior of ~20%, based on the reference classes of tech export controls, reflecting that such actions are plausible but not common, especially for software.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Strong, persistent national security motivation to curb adversaries' access to transformative tech, mirroring the logic of recent chip controls.
    *   (↑ Moderate) High political and public salience of AI risks (e.g., deepfakes) is creating significant momentum for regulation of any kind.
    *   (↓ Large) Powerful economic counter-pressure from US AI companies who depend on global revenue and will lobby fiercely against restrictions.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (~10 weeks) makes standard legislative or regulatory action nearly impossible. Only a crisis-driven executive order is a plausible path to "YES".
    *   (↓ Moderate) The availability of powerful open-source models complicates the strategic logic, potentially rendering the restrictions ineffective.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for motivation is strong, but the practical barriers—industry opposition and especially the extremely short timeline—are immense. The posterior should move down significantly from the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A major national security incident explicitly linked to a US-based generative AI model.
    *   Leaked drafts of a presidential Executive Order concerning AI model access or export.
    *   High-level congressional hearings where national security officials urgently call for model export controls.
    *   Major AI companies unexpectedly announcing "voluntary" geo-restrictions on their APIs, possibly preempting regulation.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official statements from the Commerce or State Departments emphasizing allied cooperation and global norms over unilateral controls.
    *   New, powerful open-source models released by non-US entities, highlighting the futility of US-only restrictions.
    *   Intense, public lobbying campaigns by tech companies and trade associations against proposed restrictions.
    *   The US presidential transition (post-November 2025 election) consumes all political bandwidth, preventing action on non-essential issues.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The term "powerful generative AI systems" is not legally defined. A law might be passed that applies only to a future, undefined class of models (e.g., "models trained with >10^26 FLOPS"), which may not exist by the deadline, leading to a "NO" resolution.
*   **"Soft" vs. "Hard" Law:** The resolution requires "US law." This may exclude voluntary agreements or non-binding guidance from agencies like NIST, which are more likely to be implemented on a short timeline than formal regulation.
*   **Implementation Lag:** A law could be signed on Dec 30, 2025, but its requirements might not take effect until 2026. This would likely still resolve as YES, but the distinction matters.
*   **Crisis X-Factor:** This forecast is highly sensitive to a black swan event. A major AI-driven crisis would invalidate the base rate assumptions about the speed of government action.
*   **Focus on API:** The question is specific to APIs. A broader restriction on web access (like Italy's temporary ChatGPT ban) would not trigger a "YES" resolution.

**Final Research Summary:**
The motivation for restricting foreign adversary access to powerful US AI models is high and growing, but the immense practical hurdles, including industry opposition and the availability of open-source alternatives, make it a difficult policy to enact. Given the extremely short timeline of ~10 weeks to resolution, the probability is very low, as only a crisis-driven executive order could overcome standard government inertia.

To forecast the probability of the US restricting access outside the US to some APIs for generative AI before 2026, let's follow the structured approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the US imposing a novel export control regime on a widely used digital service like an AI API is estimated to be in the 15-25% range. This is based on historical reference classes such as US export controls on encryption software, semiconductor technology, and sanctions/geofencing of digital services. These suggest a low to moderate likelihood of such restrictions being implemented.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves national security concerns and the potential for geopolitical competition, similar to past export controls.
   - Differences: The rapid advancement of AI capabilities, the dominance of private sector actors, and the existence of open-source alternatives make the situation unique. These factors could either increase the urgency for restrictions or make them less effective and thus less likely to be implemented.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - National security concerns and geopolitical competition with China increase the likelihood of restrictions (↑).
   - The technical feasibility of implementing geo-restrictions is high, as demonstrated by existing DRM systems (↑).
   - Industry lobbying and economic impact are significant deterrents, as US companies rely heavily on global markets (↓).
   - The short timeline (~10 weeks) makes legislative or regulatory action unlikely, barring a crisis-driven executive order (↓).
   - The availability of open-source models reduces the strategic effectiveness of restrictions (↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 20%, the evidence for national security motivation and technical feasibility is outweighed by the practical barriers of industry opposition, the short timeline, and the availability of alternatives.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the strong evidence against the likelihood of restrictions, the posterior probability should decrease from the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of a black swan event, such as a major AI-driven crisis, could drastically change the probability. However, without such an event, the barriers remain significant.
   - The best alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher probability if there were signs of imminent executive action or a major security incident.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Taking into account the base rate, evidence, and potential for unforeseen events, the probability of the US restricting access outside the US to some APIs for generative AI before 2026 is low.

Final: 10%

# Will the US restrict access outside the US to some APIs to generative AI before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US implementing restrictions on foreign access to generative AI APIs before 2026 (which is about 10 weeks away).

Relevant reference classes include:
- US export controls on sensitive technologies (encryption, nuclear, semiconductors)
- Geopolitical restrictions on digital services
- Speed of US regulatory action on emerging technologies

Based on these reference classes:
- US export controls on encryption software in the 1990s (~10% success rate for restricting mass-market software)
- Recent US export controls on semiconductor technology to China (~40% success rate for hardware restrictions)
- Existing geofencing of digital services for sanctions or commercial reasons (~25% capability rate)

Considering these historical patterns, I'll use a prior probability of **20%** that the US will implement such restrictions before 2026. This reflects that such controls are plausible but not common for digital services, especially on such a short timeline.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- National security concerns are driving potential restrictions, similar to past export controls
- The US has established legal frameworks for restricting technology exports
- Technical mechanisms for geofencing digital services already exist and are widely used

**Key differences:**
- Timeline is extremely short (only ~10 weeks until deadline)
- AI APIs are digital services, making restrictions easier to circumvent than hardware controls
- Private companies dominate the frontier AI space and have strong commercial interests in global access
- Robust open-source AI ecosystem provides alternatives to US proprietary APIs
- AI progress is occurring much faster than typical regulatory cycles

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to the base rate, particularly the extremely short timeline and the commercial opposition from US AI companies.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for restrictions:**
1. **National security concerns:** The US government has shown increasing concern about AI capabilities in the hands of adversaries.
   - P(E|H) = High (0.8): If restrictions were to be implemented, national security would be the primary driver
   - P(E|~H) = Moderate (0.4): These concerns exist regardless but may be addressed through other means
   - Likelihood ratio: 2.0 (moderately increases probability)

2. **Recent regulatory momentum:** Surge in deepfake regulations and growing political will to regulate AI
   - P(E|H) = High (0.7): Regulatory momentum would be necessary for restrictions
   - P(E|~H) = Moderate (0.5): This momentum exists but may lead to other forms of regulation
   - Likelihood ratio: 1.4 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence against restrictions:**
1. **Extremely short timeline:** Only ~10 weeks remain until the deadline
   - P(E|H) = Very Low (0.1): Restrictions would likely require more time unless via emergency action
   - P(E|~H) = Very High (0.9): The lack of time strongly suggests no action will be completed
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.11 (significantly decreases probability)

2. **Industry opposition:** US AI companies generate significant revenue from global API access
   - P(E|H) = Moderate (0.4): Opposition could be overcome in case of strong national security imperative
   - P(E|~H) = High (0.8): Industry opposition is a major barrier to implementation
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.5 (moderately decreases probability)

3. **Open-source alternatives:** Existence of non-US or open-source models reduces effectiveness
   - P(E|H) = Moderate (0.5): Restrictions might proceed despite limited effectiveness
   - P(E|~H) = High (0.7): The futility of restrictions given alternatives makes them less likely
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.71 (moderately decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on timeline constraints:**
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.11 = 0.0275
- Posterior probability: 0.0275/(1+0.0275) ≈ 2.7%

This dramatic decrease reflects the reality that with only 10 weeks remaining, the normal legislative and regulatory processes are extremely unlikely to produce such restrictions. Only an emergency executive order could realistically implement restrictions in this timeframe.

**Update on national security concerns:**
- Prior odds: 0.027/0.973 = 0.028
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.028 × 2.0 = 0.056
- Posterior probability: 0.056/(1+0.056) ≈ 5.3%

**Update on industry opposition and open-source alternatives:**
- Prior odds: 0.053/0.947 = 0.056
- Combined likelihood ratio: 0.5 × 0.71 = 0.355
- Posterior odds: 0.056 × 0.355 = 0.02
- Posterior probability: 0.02/(1+0.02) ≈ 2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a crisis-driven executive order. A major AI-related national security incident could trigger rapid action.
- The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) might already have regulatory frameworks that could be quickly adapted to restrict API access.
- I might be overestimating the industry's ability to block restrictions if national security concerns become paramount.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A "soft restriction" scenario where the US implements reporting requirements or voluntary guidelines rather than hard restrictions.
- A targeted restriction that applies only to specific countries (e.g., China, Russia, Iran) rather than a global non-US restriction.

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for the possibility of crisis-driven executive action or narrowly targeted restrictions that could be implemented quickly. However, the fundamental constraints of the timeline remain extremely strong.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I arrive at a final probability of 4% that the US will restrict access outside the US to some APIs to generative AI before 2026.

This low probability primarily reflects:
1. The extremely short timeline (only ~10 weeks) making standard regulatory action nearly impossible
2. The strong commercial interests opposing such restrictions
3. The limited effectiveness of restrictions given open-source alternatives

Only a major crisis triggering emergency executive action could realistically lead to such restrictions in this timeframe, and even then, implementation challenges would be significant.

Final: 4%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the US government enacting a novel export control on a widely disseminated, dual-use software technology. I will use a blended base rate from several reference classes:
- **US Export Controls on Semiconductors (2020s):** The US has shown a strong and recent willingness to use export controls on critical hardware for national security and geopolitical reasons. This suggests a high willingness to act. This class points to a ~40% chance.
- **US Export Controls on Encryption (1990s):** The US government attempted to control the export of strong cryptography, another dual-use software technology. While the effort ultimately failed due to industry pushback and global availability, the *law was enacted*. This precedent suggests that attempts to control widely available software are plausible. This class points to a moderate chance.
- **General Pace of Major Federal Rulemaking:** Enacting significant new regulations that impact major industries typically takes years of drafting, public comment, and review. The probability of any *new* major regulation going from idea to law in a short period is very low, perhaps <5% per year.

Blending these, the idea of the US government *eventually* restricting AI models is plausible. A base rate for such a law being passed over a multi-year period could be around **20%**. This reflects a real possibility driven by national security concerns, but tempered by the significant practical and economic hurdles.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case is the US government implementing a major technology control policy over a 1-3 year timeframe.

**Similarities:**
- The core motivation—preventing strategic adversaries like China from accessing cutting-edge US technology—is identical to the successful semiconductor controls.
- The technology is seen as foundational and dual-use, with massive economic and military implications, justifying government intervention.

**Differences:**
- **Timeline:** This is the most critical difference. The resolution deadline is December 31, 2025, which is only about 10 weeks from the current date (October 18, 2025). This is an exceptionally short period for any government action. Standard legislative or regulatory processes are impossible. The only plausible path is a pre-drafted Executive Order or an interim final rule from an agency like the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).
- **Controllability:** Unlike physical semiconductor chips, API access is a digital service. Restrictions are more easily circumvented using VPNs, foreign resellers, or other methods. This makes the policy less effective and potentially less appealing to implement.
- **Alternatives:** A powerful open-source AI ecosystem exists (e.g., models from Meta, Mistral in France). This provides an immediate alternative for users, undermining the strategic impact of restricting only US proprietary APIs. This was a key reason the encryption export controls failed and is a weaker factor in the semiconductor space.
- **Economic Opposition:** US AI companies (Google, OpenAI, Microsoft) have global business models and will lobby intensely against a policy that cuts off international revenue and cedes the market to foreign competitors.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the US restricts API access before 2026.

- **Evidence 1: Timeline of ~10 weeks remaining.** This is extremely strong evidence against H. The likelihood of a major regulation being passed in such a short window, given it happens (P(E|H)), is very low. The likelihood of the timeline being short, given it *doesn't* happen (P(E|~H)), is very high. The likelihood ratio is thus very small (<< 1), dramatically decreasing the probability.
- **Evidence 2: Strong National Security Motivation.** The US has already taken steps to limit China's access to AI hardware and require reporting on cloud compute usage. This shows clear intent. This evidence increases the probability (Likelihood Ratio > 1), as this motivation is a necessary prerequisite for the restriction.
- **Evidence 3: Plausible Mechanism via BIS Rule.** The most likely path to a "YES" is not new legislation but a rule from the Commerce Department's BIS using existing export control authorities. Such rules can be implemented relatively quickly. This makes the short timeline *less* of an absolute barrier than it would be for Congress, slightly mitigating the effect of Evidence 1.
- **Evidence 4: Manifold Market Forecast at 36%.** This is a strong signal from a group of forecasters that the probability is non-trivial. This suggests a belief that a rule may already be drafted and awaiting a political window for release, or that the national security imperative is strong enough to overcome the inertia. This evidence significantly increases my posterior probability, as it challenges my initial assessment of the timeline's impact.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Start with the prior:** 20% (or 1:4 odds).
- **Update on timeline:** The 10-week timeline is a massive barrier. If we assume the probability of the law passing was uniformly distributed over the 2.5-year question period, the chance of it happening in the last 10 weeks is very small. This evidence alone would push the probability down to the low single digits (e.g., 2-3%). Let's say the odds become 1:49.
- **Update on other factors:** The strong motivation and the plausible BIS mechanism (vs. impossible legislation) push the odds back up. They make a "surprise" executive action more likely. Let's say this doubles the odds to 2:49.
- **Update on market data:** The 36% market forecast (roughly 1:2 odds) is wildly different from my current estimate of ~4% (2/51). This suggests my model may be flawed, likely by underestimating the probability of a pre-drafted rule being released. I must adjust significantly towards the market to account for this uncertainty. A weighted average of my estimate and the market's is a reasonable approach. If I put 2/3 weight on my analysis and 1/3 on the market: `(2 * 4% + 1 * 36%) / 3 = (8 + 36) / 3 = 44 / 3 ≈ 15%`.

This updated figure of ~15% seems more robust. It acknowledges that while my bottom-up analysis points to a very low probability, there is a significant "unknown unknown" factor captured by the market concerning a potential surprise executive action.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 15% is much lower than the Manifold market's 36%. Why might they be right? The strongest argument is that the decision has already been made within the national security community, the rule is drafted, and its release is imminent. In this scenario, the public signals I'm looking for (leaks, public debate) would be absent by design. The US government has demonstrated with chip controls that it can act decisively and unilaterally on tech competition with China.

Conversely, why might my 15% be too high? The post-election period in the US (November-December 2025) is often a "lame duck" session where controversial new initiatives are avoided. Furthermore, the economic arguments against the policy are immense—it would be a self-inflicted wound to a key American industry. The policy could be seen as both ineffective (due to open-source) and harmful, making it an unlikely choice. On balance, the 15% feels like a reasonable hedge between the overwhelming practical barriers and the non-zero chance of a surprise executive action.

### Final Forecast
The final probability is derived by starting with a moderate base rate for such a technology control, then drastically reducing it due to the extremely short timeline. This very low probability is then revised significantly upward to account for the plausible mechanism of a fast-moving BIS rule and the strong contrary signal from the prediction market, which suggests a non-trivial chance of a surprise action that has been prepared behind the scenes.

Final: 15%
