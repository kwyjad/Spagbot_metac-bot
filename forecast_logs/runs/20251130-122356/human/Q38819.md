### Reference class & base rates
*   **Harvard Admit Rate, Post-Pandemic (Classes of 2025-2028):** This is the most relevant reference class, reflecting the "new normal" of test-optional policies and inflated application pools.
    *   **Range:** 3.19% to 3.59%.
    *   **Mean:** ~3.43%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This period began with the Class of 2025, which saw a massive surge in applications due to the shift to test-optional admissions. It also includes the first post-SCOTUS affirmative action ruling cycle (Class of 2028), making it the best baseline for current dynamics.
*   **Harvard Admit Rate, Pre-Pandemic (Classes of 2020-2024):** This class shows the trend before the test-optional shock.
    *   **Range:** 4.50% to 5.20%.
    *   **Mean:** ~4.8%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Useful for understanding the magnitude of the recent drop and the underlying downward trend, but less predictive of the absolute level now that application behavior has fundamentally changed.
*   **Limitations:** The long-term downward trend is clear, but the last two years (3.41% -> 3.59%) have shown a slight increase, breaking the monotonic decline. This suggests the system may be reacting to new inputs (e.g., post-SCOTUS uncertainty) rather than just continuing a simple trend.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-11-18** Harvard reports a significant increase in Restrictive Early Action (REA) applications for the Class of 2029, reversing last year's decline. (↓) — This is the strongest leading indicator of a larger total applicant pool, which is the primary driver for a lower admit rate.
*   **2024-05-23** Harvard announces it will continue its test-optional admissions policy for the Class of 2029. (↓) — Maintaining a lower barrier to entry supports a high number of applications, especially as some peers (MIT, Yale, Dartmouth) have reinstated testing requirements.
*   **2024-03-28** Harvard releases Class of 2028 results: admit rate rose to 3.59% (from 3.41%) due to a 5% drop in applications. (↑) — This established a new, higher baseline and demonstrated that post-SCOTUS uncertainty could temporarily depress application numbers. The key question is whether this was a one-time dip or a new trend.
*   **2024-02-22** Yale and Brown announce the reinstatement of standardized testing requirements, following MIT and Dartmouth. (↑/↓) — Ambiguous effect. Could siphon some high-scoring applicants from Harvard, but could also consolidate Harvard's position as the premier test-optional institution, potentially boosting its applicant pool. The net effect is likely a small downward pressure on the rate.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Total Number of Applicants (Denominator):** The most significant driver. A 5% change in applicants can move the rate by ~0.15-0.20 percentage points. Driven by test-optional policies, ease of the Common App, and perceptions of accessibility post-SCOTUS. **(Large)**
*   **Target Class Size (Numerator Anchor):** Harvard consistently targets a class of ~1,650 students. This provides a strong anchor for the numerator. **(Small)**
*   **Anticipated Yield Rate (Numerator Adjustment):** The admissions office admits more students than the target class size, based on their prediction of "yield" (the percentage who will accept the offer). For a target of 1,650 and a yield of 84%, they would admit ~1,965 students. Uncertainty around yield in the post-SCOTUS era could cause them to be more or less conservative in their offers. **(Moderate)**
*   **Standardized Testing Policy Divergence:** With Harvard remaining test-optional while key peers (Yale, Dartmouth) require tests, application strategies change. This could concentrate applicants who lack top scores at Harvard, swelling the denominator. **(Moderate)**
*   **Adaptation to SCOTUS Ruling:** This is the second cycle post-ruling. The "chilling effect" that may have deterred some applicants last year could be dissipating as students and counselors adapt, potentially causing a rebound in applications. **(Moderate)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Post-SCOTUS Rebound vs. Dip:** The Class of 2028 cycle was characterized by uncertainty, leading to a 5% application drop. The current cycle is defined by adaptation. The strong early application numbers suggest a rebound is underway, contrasting with last year's dip.
*   **Divergent Testing Policies:** Unlike the near-universal test-optional policies of the pandemic years (our primary reference class), Harvard is now in a minority of its closest peers by not requiring tests. This creates a new competitive dynamic for applicants.
*   **Stabilized FAFSA Process:** The chaotic rollout of the new FAFSA for the 2024-25 aid year likely suppressed applications from some low-income students. A smoother process this year should remove that headwind, potentially boosting applicant numbers.
*   **Heightened Scrutiny on Admissions:** Public and legal pressure regarding legacy and donor preferences is at an all-time high. While unlikely to change the total number of offers, it could subtly shift internal priorities and yield calculations.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around the last three years' average of **~3.4%** (Classes of 2026-2028), with moderate confidence (equivalent n≈10), acknowledging the recent volatility.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) **Large:** A significant increase in Early Action applications strongly suggests the denominator (total applicants) will be larger than last year, likely surpassing the record highs of the Class of 2026/2027.
    *   (↓) **Small:** The resolution of last year's FAFSA issues should remove a barrier to application for some students, contributing to a larger pool.
    *   (↓) **Small:** Harvard's adherence to a

To forecast the Harvard admit rate for the undergraduate class of 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the Harvard admit rate for the post-pandemic classes (2025-2028), which reflects the current admissions environment, including test-optional policies and the impact of the SCOTUS ruling. The mean admit rate for this period is approximately 3.43%, with a range from 3.19% to 3.59%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The test-optional policy remains in place, and the class size target is consistent.
   - Differences: There is a significant increase in early applications, suggesting a larger applicant pool. The recent slight increase in admit rates (3.41% to 3.59%) indicates potential stabilization or a new trend.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Increase in early applications (↓): Suggests a larger applicant pool, likely decreasing the admit rate.
   - Continuation of test-optional policy (↓): Supports a high number of applications.
   - Rebound from FAFSA issues (↓): May increase applications from low-income students.
   - Divergent testing policies (↓): Could increase Harvard's applicant pool as other institutions reinstate testing requirements.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered at 3.43% with moderate confidence.
   - Evidence suggests a larger applicant pool, leading to a downward adjustment in the admit rate.
   - Posterior mean likely shifts slightly lower than the prior mean, with increased variance due to uncertainties in yield and application numbers.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The recent increase in admit rate could indicate stabilization, which might counteract some downward pressures.
   - Alternative scenario: If the increase in applications is less than expected, the admit rate might not decrease as much.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slightly wider distribution to account for these uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the admit rate is expected to decrease slightly from the recent baseline, with consideration for uncertainties and potential stabilization.

# Forecasting Harvard's Admit Rate for Class of 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the most recent Harvard admission rates as my primary reference class:

- Class of 2028 (most recent): 3.59%
- Class of 2027: 3.41%
- Class of 2026: 3.19%
- Class of 2025: 3.43%

The post-pandemic average is approximately 3.41%, with a standard deviation of about 0.17 percentage points. This represents the "new normal" following the shift to test-optional policies, which dramatically increased application numbers compared to pre-pandemic rates (which were in the 4.5-5.2% range).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Harvard still maintains its test-optional policy for the Class of 2029
- Target class size remains stable at around 1,650 students
- The Common App continues to make applying easier for students
- Harvard's brand and prestige remain unchanged

**Differences from base rate:**
- This is the second full admissions cycle after the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling
- Several peer institutions (Yale, Dartmouth, MIT) have reinstated testing requirements while Harvard remains test-optional
- Early application numbers for the Class of 2029 show an increase compared to the previous year
- The FAFSA process has stabilized after last year's chaotic rollout

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward lower admit rate (higher applications):**
- Significant increase in Restrictive Early Action applications for Class of 2029 (strong evidence, ~2x likelihood of higher applications)
- Harvard maintaining test-optional policy while peers require tests (moderate evidence, ~1.5x likelihood of higher applications)
- Stabilized FAFSA process removing barriers for low-income applicants (weak evidence, ~1.2x likelihood of higher applications)

**Evidence pushing toward higher admit rate (lower applications):**
- The 5% drop in applications for Class of 2028 could indicate a new trend (weak evidence, ~1.1x likelihood of lower applications)
- Increased scrutiny on legacy admissions might affect yield calculations (very weak evidence, ~1.05x likelihood of higher admit rate)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered at 3.41% (post-pandemic average):

The strongest evidence is the increase in early applications, which strongly suggests total applications will increase from last year. This would push the admit rate down from the 3.59% of the Class of 2028.

Updating based on early application increase:
- Prior mean: 3.41%
- Likelihood ratio favoring higher applications: ~2x
- Posterior shift: Downward from 3.59% (last year) toward the lower end of the recent range

The test-optional policy divergence further supports this downward pressure:
- Posterior after first update: ~3.35%
- Likelihood ratio favoring higher applications: ~1.5x
- Further posterior shift: Downward to ~3.25%

The stabilized FAFSA process provides a smaller additional update:
- Posterior after second update: ~3.25%
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2x
- Final posterior mean: ~3.20%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the impact of early application increases. Sometimes early application surges don't translate to proportional increases in the regular decision pool.
- The post-SCOTUS environment remains uncertain; Harvard might adjust its admissions strategy in ways that affect the admit rate.
- Economic factors or international events could affect application patterns in unpredictable ways.
- I might be underestimating Harvard's desire to maintain a certain admit rate for prestige reasons.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would be that the admit rate remains stable or even increases slightly from last year's 3.59%. This could happen if:
1. Early application increases don't translate to the regular decision pool
2. Harvard decides to admit more students to maintain yield in an uncertain environment
3. The trend of the past two years (slight increases from 3.19% to 3.41% to 3.59%) continues

However, the evidence for increased applications seems stronger than these counterarguments.

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these considerations, particularly allowing for more possibility in the upper tail.

P20: 3.05%
P40: 3.15%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My prior distribution is based on the Harvard admit rate in the post-pandemic, test-optional era, which represents a distinct regime from previous years. This reference class includes the Classes of 2025 through 2028.

*   **Class of 2025:** 3.43%
*   **Class of 2026:** 3.19% (record low rate, record high applications)
*   **Class of 2027:** 3.41%
*   **Class of 2028:** 3.59% (higher rate due to a dip in applications)

The mean of this period is **3.405%**, and the range is from 3.19% to 3.59%. I will model my prior as a distribution centered around **3.4%** with a standard deviation of approximately 0.15%, capturing the recent volatility and establishing that rates in the low-to-mid 3s are the new normal.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation (Class of 2029 cycle) shares key features with the base rate period but also has crucial differences.

*   **Similarities:** Harvard's test-optional policy remains in place, which was the primary catalyst for the surge in applications that defines this era. The target class size is also expected to remain stable at around 1,650 students.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Post-SCOTUS Adaptation:** The Class of 2028 cycle was the first after the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action, which likely created a "chilling effect" and contributed to a 5% drop in applications. The current cycle is the second, and applicants have had time to adapt, making a rebound likely.
    2.  **Divergent Testing Policies:** Unlike the first few years of the reference period where most elite peers were also test-optional, several (Yale, Dartmouth, Brown) have now reinstated testing requirements. Harvard's decision to remain test-optional may funnel applicants without top scores towards its pool, increasing the denominator.
    3.  **FAFSA Stabilization:** The chaotic rollout of the new FAFSA for the Class of 2028 cycle likely suppressed some applications. A smoother process this year removes that headwind.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the new evidence against my prior distribution centered at 3.4%.

*   **Evidence 1: Significant Increase in Early Applications (↓ Strong Downward Pressure):** The research report states that Restrictive Early Action (REA) applications are up significantly, reversing last year's decline. Early application volume is a strong leading indicator of the total applicant pool. This makes a lower admit rate much more likely than a higher one. It suggests the 3.59% rate from last year was an anomaly and the denominator (applicants) will increase substantially. This evidence pushes the forecast down, towards the record low of 3.19% or even lower.
*   **Evidence 2: Divergent Testing Policies (↓ Moderate Downward Pressure):** Harvard remaining test-optional while peers require tests positions it as the premier choice for strong students who may lack top scores. This is a structural reason to expect a larger-than-usual applicant pool, reinforcing the signal from the early application data.
*   **Evidence 3: Post-SCOTUS/FAFSA Rebound (↓ Moderate Downward Pressure):** These factors provide a clear causal explanation for why last year's application numbers dipped and why they are likely to rebound this year. This strengthens the case that last year's 3.59% rate is a poor predictor for this year and that the rate will revert to a lower level.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Centered at 3.4%, with a plausible range of [3.1%, 3.7%].
*   **Likelihood:** The combined evidence (strong REA numbers, divergent testing policies, rebound effects) strongly suggests a much larger applicant pool than the 54,008 for the Class of 2028. A return to the peak of ~61,000 applicants (Class of 2026) or even a new record is plausible.
*   **Update Step:** The numerator (admitted students) is relatively stable, typically around 1,950.
    *   Prior expectation (based on average applicants): ~1950 / ~57,400 = ~3.4%
    *   Posterior expectation (based on evidence of high applicants, e.g., 60,000): 1950 / 60,000 = 3.25%
*   **Posterior:** The evidence compels a significant downward shift of the entire distribution. The new median should be well below the 3.4% prior. I will center my posterior distribution around **3.28%**. The peak of the distribution is now lower, and the right tail (higher rates) has become much thinner.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher Rate):** Could the admissions office get nervous about yield and admit more students? If they fear yield might drop from its typical ~84% to, say, 81%, they might admit ~2,030 students instead of ~1,950. Even with a rebound to 58,000 applicants, this would result in a rate of 3.5%. While the strong early application data makes this less likely, uncertainty around yield is a real factor that prevents me from being overconfident in an extremely low rate.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower Rate):** Could a "perfect storm" of factors (test-optional funnel, FAFSA recovery, etc.) push applications to a new record of 65,000? With ~1,950 offers, the rate would be exactly 3.00%. This is an aggressive but not impossible outcome and should be reflected in the lower tail of my forecast.
*   **Adjustment:** The yield uncertainty provides a plausible reason for the rate to be higher than a simple application-based model would suggest. I will keep my P80 and P90 percentiles high enough to account for this possibility, preventing overconfidence in the downward trend. My P10 will account for the "application explosion" scenario. My final distribution is centered on a significant drop but maintains a reasonably wide range to reflect these uncertainties.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**  
   The most appropriate base rate is the post-pandemic Harvard admit rates for the classes of 2025-2028, with a range of 3.19% to 3.59% and a mean of ~3.43%. This reference class is chosen because it captures the "new normal" of test-optional policies, inflated application pools due to the pandemic, and the initial impacts of the SCOTUS affirmative action ruling (starting with the class of 2028). It reflects recent dynamics better than pre-pandemic rates (mean ~4.8%), which don't account for these structural shifts. For the prior distribution, I'll model it as approximately normal with a mean of 3.43% and a standard deviation of ~0.15% (based on the observed spread, implying 95% of outcomes fall roughly within 3.13% to 3.73%).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**  
   The current situation is similar to the base case in that Harvard remains test-optional, targets a consistent class size (~1,650), and faces similar applicant behaviors influenced by the Common App and post-SCOTUS adaptations. It's different due to a reported significant increase in Restrictive Early Action (REA) applications for the class of 2029, which reverses last year's 5% decline and suggests a rebound in total applications. Additionally, divergent testing policies (peers like Yale and Dartmouth reinstating requirements) could funnel more applicants to Harvard as a test-optional option. These differences matter because they likely inflate the applicant pool (denominator), pushing the admit rate lower than the base mean, while stabilized factors like FAFSA processes remove prior suppressants on applications.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**  
   - Significant increase in REA applications (↓, strong): This is highly consistent with a larger total applicant pool (e.g., >5% growth), making lower admit rates ~3-4x more likely than higher ones, as it directly inflates the denominator.  
   - Continuation of test-optional policy (↓, moderate): Aligns with sustained high application volumes, making lower rates ~2x more likely by lowering barriers compared to peers reinstating tests.  
   - Class of 2028's 3.59% rate due to application dip (↑, but contextual): This pushes slightly up as a recent anchor, but the rebound evidence outweighs it, making higher rates only ~1.5x as likely in light of new data.  
   - Peers reinstating testing (↓, moderate): Likely concentrates test-averse applicants at Harvard, making lower rates ~2x more likely (net downward pressure).  
   - Post-SCOTUS adaptation and stabilized FAFSA (↓, small): These reduce uncertainty and barriers, consistent with ~1.5x higher likelihood for lower rates via modest application growth.  
   Overall, evidence skews downward, with a net likelihood ratio favoring outcomes ~0.2-0.3% below the prior mean.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**  
   Starting with the prior (mean 3.43%, SD 0.15%), I apply Bayes' rule conceptually: Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood. For an explicit update, consider the strong REA increase as key evidence; assuming it implies a ~5-10% applicant growth (likelihood peaking at ~3.2-3.3%), this shifts the posterior mean down to ~3.3% (e.g., weighting the prior by 70% and evidence by 30% for a simple update: 0.7*3.43 + 0.3*3.25 ≈ 3.3%). Incorporating other downward factors (test-optional, peers' policies) further adjusts it to ~3.28%, with slight skew toward lower values. Variance increases mildly to SD ~0.18% to account for uncertainty in application rebound magnitude, resulting in a posterior that's tighter in the center but with fatter lower tails.

5. **Red Team Thinking**  
   Potential overconfidence: My forecast might undervalue upside risks, like if the REA surge doesn't translate to total applications (e.g., due to yield miscalculations or economic factors suppressing regular decisions), or if Harvard admits more conservatively post-scrutiny. Blind spots include unpredictable yield shifts (e.g., if post-SCOTUS perceptions lower yield, they might admit more, raising the rate). Tail risks: Lower tail (e.g., <3.0%) if applications surge 15%+ due to testing divergence; upper tail (>3.8%) if applications unexpectedly dip again (e.g., global events). Best alternative forecast: A more optimistic one centered at 3.5% (assuming minimal rebound and peers siphoning applicants), plausible if REA is an outlier; rebuttal is that early indicators and policy divergence strongly suggest otherwise. This leads me to widen tails slightly for robustness, adding ~0.1% to upper percentiles and subtracting ~0.1% from lower ones.
