### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Virginia Gubernatorial Elections in a Presidential Mid-Term-Equivalent Year (1977-2021):** This is the strongest reference class for the Virginia race. In the 12 elections held the year after a presidential election since 1977, the party not holding the White House has won the governorship 11 times. The only exception was in 2013 (Democrat Terry McAuliffe won with Democrat Barack Obama in the White House).
    *   **Base Rate (Democrat Win):** ~92% (11/12), assuming a Republican is in the White House in 2025 as implied by the background.
    *   **Reasoning:** Virginia's electorate has historically used this off-year election to register dissatisfaction with the incumbent presidential administration, creating a powerful anti-White House party trend.
2.  **New Jersey Open-Seat Gubernatorial Elections (Post-2000):** New Jersey does not exhibit the same strong anti-presidential party trend as Virginia. A more relevant class is modern, open-seat elections in a state that has trended strongly Democratic at the federal level but remains competitive in gubernatorial races. Since 2000, there have been three open-seat elections.
    *   **Base Rate (Democrat Win):** ~67% (2/3). Democrats won in 2005 (Corzine) and 2017 (Murphy); Republicans won in 2009 (Christie).
    *   **Reasoning:** This reflects NJ's general "blue" lean but acknowledges that with no incumbent, Republicans can and do win, often capitalizing on state-specific issues like taxes and affordability.
3.  **Combined Outcome (VA/NJ Gubernatorial Elections):** Looking at the four instances since 2001 where both states held elections (2005, 2009, 2013, 2021), the outcomes were:
    *   2005: D-VA, D-NJ (Both)
    *   2009: R-VA, R-NJ (Neither)
    *   2013: D-VA, R-NJ (Only VA)
    *   2021: R-VA, D-NJ (Only NJ)
    *   **Base Rate (Both Win):** 25%. This class is very small and highly sensitive to the national environment of each specific year, making it a weak predictor on its own but useful for understanding outcome correlations.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*As of 2025-10-11, the election is <3 months away; focus is on the last 6 months.*

*   **2025-10-09** Spanberger and Earle-Sears participate in final televised debate. ↑ Spanberger seen as more polished and knowledgeable on policy details, reinforcing her image of competence.
*   **2025-10-02** Major Virginia newspaper endorses Spanberger. ↑ Influential endorsement in the key Northern Virginia media market, could sway late-deciding suburban voters.
*   **2025-09-22** Ciattarelli launches statewide ad campaign focusing on "affordability crisis." ↓ Highlights a key Democratic vulnerability in high-cost New Jersey, resonating with voter concerns about taxes and inflation.
*   **2025-09-15** Polling average shows Sherrill's lead in NJ narrowing to mid-single digits. ↓ Suggests the race is tightening as Republican voters consolidate around Ciattarelli, mirroring the 2021 dynamic.
*   **2025-08-20** National jobs report shows slowing economic growth. ↓ A negative national economic outlook, even with a GOP president, can create general anti-incumbent sentiment that hurts all established politicians.
*   **2025-07-15** Q3 fundraising reports released. ↑ (for Both) Both Spanberger and Sherrill show significant cash-on-hand advantages over their opponents, enabling heavy TV ad spending in the final stretch.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **National Political Environment (Presidential Approval):** The single most important driver, especially in Virginia. Low approval for the sitting Republican president creates a massive tailwind for Spanberger. Its effect is less pronounced but still present in New Jersey. (Size: Large in VA, Small-to-Moderate in NJ).
2.  **Candidate Quality and Ideological Fit:** Both Democratic candidates (Spanberger, Sherrill) are former federal officials from competitive suburban districts with profiles (ex-CIA, ex-Navy pilot) that appeal to moderate and independent voters. This contrasts with some more polarizing Republican candidates. (Size: Moderate).
3.  **State-Specific Partisan Lean:** New Jersey's fundamental Democratic tilt provides a significant firewall for Sherrill. Virginia is a purple state, but the off-year election dynamics currently favor Democrats. (Size: Moderate).
4.  **Ciattarelli's Repeat Candidacy (NJ):** Jack Ciattarelli's high name recognition and the organizational network from his near-win in 2021 make him a uniquely strong Republican candidate in New Jersey, preventing the race from becoming a Democratic blowout. (Size: Moderate).
5.  **Suburban Voter Turnout:** The outcomes in both states, particularly in Northern Virginia and North Jersey, will depend heavily on the turnout and margins among suburban voters, a demographic that has trended Democratic in recent cycles. (Size: Moderate).
6.  **Economic Conditions (State-level):** Voter perception of the economy, particularly taxes and cost of living, is a primary driver. This is Ciattarelli's strongest issue in NJ and a potential vulnerability for Democrats in both states. (Size: Moderate).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Virginia's "Curse" Faces a Moderate Democrat:** The historical anti-presidential party trend is the base rate. What's different is that the Democratic candidate, Abigail Spanberger, has a well-established brand as a moderate consensus-builder from a swing district, making her an unusually strong candidate to capitalize on this trend. She is not a generic liberal, which could expand her appeal.
*   **New Jersey's Repeat Challenger:** Unlike a typical open-seat race, the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, is not a fresh face. His 2021 performance proves he can consolidate the GOP base and appeal to independents. This makes the race more competitive than the base rate for a generic open-seat election might suggest.
*   **Absence of Scandal/Incumbent Fatigue:** Both races are open seats, meaning voter fatigue with a specific governor (like Jon Corzine in 2009 or the end of Chris Christie's term in 2017) is not a factor. The races are more likely to be nationalized or driven by candidate contrasts.
*   **Post-2020 Electoral Realignment:** Both states have seen shifts in suburban voting patterns since 2016, with highly-educated suburbs moving toward Democrats. The 2025 elections will test the durability of this coalition in a non-federal election context.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior heavily favoring "Only Virginia" or "Both," based on the strong VA base rate (~90% Dem win) and the weaker but still positive NJ base rate (~65% Dem win). The "Both" option should be the modal outcome. Equivalent n: ~10-12 observations for the VA prior, ~3-5 for the NJ prior.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **VA:** ↑ (Large) The national environment strongly favors the non-presidential party (Democrats).
    *   **VA:** ↑ (Moderate) Spanberger is a high-quality candidate with a moderate profile well-suited for Virginia.
    *   **NJ:** ↑ (Moderate) Sherrill is also a strong candidate with a profile that plays well in NJ suburbs.
    *   **NJ:** ↓ (Moderate) Ciattarelli's proven strength from 2021 makes him a formidable, non-generic opponent.
    *   **Both:** ↑ (Small) Both Democratic candidates appear to have a significant fundraising advantage, allowing for message saturation in the final weeks.
    *   **Both:** ↓ (Small) Recent polling in both states, while showing Democratic leads, suggests competitive races rather than runaways.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence reinforces the priors. The posterior probability should increase for a Democratic win in Virginia, moving it toward "near-certainty." The posterior for a Democratic win in New Jersey should remain moderately high but acknowledge significant variance and a non-trivial chance of a GOP upset. The overall probability for "Both elections" should solidify as the most likely outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Both" or "Only VA/NJ"):**
    *   Final polling averages (e.g., FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics) show Spanberger's lead holding or growing >5 pts.
    *   Sherrill's lead in NJ polls stabilizes or expands back to high single digits.
    *   News reports of high Democratic enthusiasm or early voting turnout in Northern Virginia and North Jersey suburbs.
    *   The national Republican president's approval rating drops further in the final weeks.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "Neither" or "Only VA/NJ"):**
    *   A major gaffe or scandal involving Spanberger or Sherrill.
    *   Ciattarelli successfully makes the NJ race a referendum on local property taxes, gaining traction in media coverage.
    *   Late-breaking polls show the NJ race within the margin of error, or the VA race tightening significantly.
    *   A national security crisis or "rally 'round the flag" event that boosts the sitting president's approval rating.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Polling Error:** Off-year gubernatorial polls can have high uncertainty. The 2021 NJ race was much closer than most polls predicted, indicating a potential for systematic error in modeling the electorate.
*   **The "Virginia Curse" is a strong correlation, not an iron law:** A sufficiently popular president, a weak challenger, or a unique political event could break the trend. Relying on it completely is a risk.
*   **Turnout Dynamics:** Off-year election turnout is notoriously difficult to predict. The party that is more successful at mobilizing its base and persuading a small slice of independents will win, and motivation levels are hard to measure pre-election.
*   **Late-Breaking Events:** With less than a month to go, a major national or international event could fundamentally alter the political environment in ways that are currently unpredictable.
*   **Candidate Nomination Assumption:** The analysis assumes the candidates listed in the background are the confirmed nominees. Any last-minute changes (highly unlikely) would

To assign probabilities to each of the multiple-choice options regarding which of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections the Democrats will win, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections**: Historically, both states have elected Democratic governors simultaneously in 1 out of 4 recent instances (2005). Thus, the base rate for both states electing Democrats is 25%.
- **Only Virginia**: Virginia has a strong trend of electing a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President, with Democrats winning 11 out of 12 times when a Republican is in the White House. This gives a base rate of ~92% for Virginia alone.
- **Only New Jersey**: New Jersey has a base rate of 67% for Democrats winning open-seat gubernatorial elections since 2000.
- **Neither election**: The base rate for neither state electing a Democrat is 25%, based on the 2009 instance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia**: The current case aligns well with the base rate due to the historical trend and Spanberger's strong candidacy. Differences include Spanberger's moderate appeal and the absence of a strong anti-Democratic sentiment.
- **New Jersey**: The current case is slightly less favorable than the base rate due to Ciattarelli's strong candidacy and the narrowing polls. However, Sherrill's profile and the state's Democratic lean still align with the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia**:
  - Spanberger's debate performance and endorsements increase the likelihood of a Democratic win (P(E | H) high).
  - The national environment favors Democrats due to a Republican president (P(E | H) high).

- **New Jersey**:
  - Sherrill's narrowing lead and Ciattarelli's strong campaign reduce the likelihood of a Democratic win (P(E | H) moderate).
  - The state's Democratic lean and Sherrill's profile still support a Democratic win (P(E | H) moderate).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia**: Start with a prior of 92% for a Democratic win. The evidence (Spanberger's strengths and national environment) strongly supports this, increasing the posterior probability.
- **New Jersey**: Start with a prior of 67% for a Democratic win. The evidence is mixed, with Ciattarelli's strengths reducing the probability but not overwhelmingly so.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of polling errors or late-breaking events that could affect turnout or voter sentiment.
- Acknowledge the potential for unexpected national or international events that could shift the political landscape.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and adjust based on the evidence and red team considerations.

### 7. Output Format

Based on the analysis, the probabilities for each option are:

- **Both elections**: 40%
- **Only Virginia**: 30%
- **Only New Jersey**: 20%
- **Neither election**: 10%

These probabilities reflect the strong likelihood of a Democratic win in Virginia, a moderate likelihood in New Jersey, and the possibility of both or neither occurring based on historical trends and current evidence.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia Gubernatorial Election:**
- Base rate for Democratic win: 92% (11/12 elections since 1977 where the party opposite the White House wins)
- This is a strong historical pattern in Virginia, with only one exception (2013) in recent decades
- With a Republican president assumed to be in office in 2025, this strongly favors Democrat Spanberger

**New Jersey Gubernatorial Election:**
- Base rate for Democratic win: 67% (2/3 recent open-seat elections)
- New Jersey is generally Democratic-leaning at the state level, but Republicans can win gubernatorial races
- The state has elected Republican governors as recently as Chris Christie (2010-2018)

**Combined Outcomes:**
- Both Democratic wins: ~62% (0.92 × 0.67)
- Only Virginia Democratic win: ~30% (0.92 × 0.33)
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: ~5% (0.08 × 0.67)
- Neither Democratic win: ~3% (0.08 × 0.33)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Virginia's pattern of electing governors from the opposite party of the White House remains relevant
- New Jersey continues to be a Democratic-leaning state that can elect Republican governors
- Both races are open seats (term-limited incumbents), making the base rates more applicable

**Differences from base rate:**
- Candidate quality: Both Spanberger and Sherrill are unusually strong Democratic candidates with moderate profiles
- Ciattarelli in NJ is a repeat candidate who nearly won in 2021 (48%), making him stronger than a typical Republican
- The post-2020 electoral realignment has strengthened Democrats in suburbs, potentially helping both candidates
- Current polling shows leads for both Democrats, reinforcing the base rates

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Virginia:**
- Current polling shows Spanberger leading (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.9, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.2)
- Spanberger's moderate profile fits Virginia well (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.8, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.3)
- The "Virginia curse" of electing governors opposite the White House party (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.9, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.1)
- Spanberger's fundraising advantage (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.7, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.4)

**Evidence for New Jersey:**
- Current polling shows Sherrill leading but by narrowing margins (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.7, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.4)
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.4, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.8)
- New Jersey's Democratic lean in statewide elections (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.8, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.3)
- Economic concerns and affordability issues in NJ (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.5, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.7)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia Update:**
- Prior odds: 92:8 (11.5:1)
- Likelihood ratio for polling evidence: 0.9/0.2 = 4.5
- Updated odds: 11.5 × 4.5 = 51.75:1
- Posterior probability: 51.75/(51.75+1) ≈ 98%

**New Jersey Update:**
- Prior odds: 67:33 (2.03:1)
- Likelihood ratio for polling + Ciattarelli strength: (0.7 × 0.4)/(0.4 × 0.8) = 0.28/0.32 = 0.875
- Updated odds: 2.03 × 0.875 = 1.78:1
- Posterior probability: 1.78/(1.78+1) ≈ 64%

**Combined Posterior Probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 0.98 × 0.64 = 62.7%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 0.98 × 0.36 = 35.3%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: 0.02 × 0.64 = 1.3%
- Neither Democratic win: 0.02 × 0.36 = 0.7%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polling errors: Off-year elections often have polling misses. In 2021, NJ polls underestimated Republican support.
- Late developments: With less than a month to go, scandals or major events could shift either race.
- Turnout uncertainty: Off-year elections have unpredictable turnout patterns that could favor either party.
- Economic conditions: Voter perception of the economy could shift rapidly in the final weeks.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Virginia "curse" could break if the Republican president is unusually popular or if Spanberger makes a major error.
- Ciattarelli's focus on affordability in NJ could resonate more than expected, similar to his 2021 performance.
- A national security event could boost the sitting president's approval and help Republicans.

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce confidence in Virginia due to potential polling errors and late developments.
- Increase uncertainty in New Jersey given Ciattarelli's proven competitiveness and narrowing polls.
- Acknowledge correlation between outcomes (national environment affects both).

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots:

- Both Democratic wins: 60%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 35%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: 3%
- Neither Democratic win: 2%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 60%  
Only Virginia: 35%  
Only New Jersey: 3%  
Neither election: 2%  
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### Reasoning

My forecast is derived by first estimating the probability of a Democratic victory in each state individually and then combining those probabilities to determine the likelihood of the four possible outcomes.

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

*   **Virginia:** The most relevant base rate is the historical performance of the non-presidential party in Virginia's off-year gubernatorial elections. Since 1977, the party not holding the White House has won this election 11 out of 12 times. The background information implies a Republican is president in 2025. Therefore, the base rate for a Democratic win in Virginia, P(D_VA), is approximately **92%**.
*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey does not have the same strong anti-presidential trend. A better base rate is its performance in recent open-seat gubernatorial elections. Since 2000, Democrats have won 2 out of 3 such elections (in 2005 and 2017, while a Republican won in 2009). This suggests a base rate for a Democratic win, P(D_NJ), of approximately **67%**.

**2. Comparison to Base Case & Evidence Evaluation**

I will update these priors based on the specific evidence for the 2025 races.

**Analysis of the Virginia Election (P(D_VA))**

*   **Comparison:** The current situation is very similar to the base case, but the Democratic candidate appears unusually strong for this scenario.
*   **Evidence 1 (Candidate Quality):** Democrat Abigail Spanberger is a former Congresswoman from a competitive district with a moderate (ex-CIA) profile. This makes her a strong candidate to capitalize on the historical anti-presidential party trend, likely stronger than a generic Democrat. This evidence increases the probability of a Democratic win.
*   **Evidence 2 (Polling and Momentum):** The background and research report indicate Spanberger is leading in the polls, performed well in a recent debate, and has secured key endorsements. This is strong evidence that confirms the base rate's prediction.
*   **Posterior for Virginia:** The evidence strongly reinforces the already high prior. I will set the probability of a Democratic win in Virginia at **90%**. I cap it at 90% rather than going higher to account for the inherent uncertainty of any single election (i.e., "the curse is a strong correlation, not an iron law").

**Analysis of the New Jersey Election (P(D_NJ))**

*   **Comparison:** This case differs significantly from the base rate scenario due to the strength of the Republican candidate.
*   **Evidence 1 (Republican Candidate Strength):** Republican Jack Ciattarelli is not a generic opponent. He ran a very close race in 2021, receiving 48% of the vote and outperforming polls. His high name recognition and proven statewide appeal are strong evidence that this race will be more competitive than a typical open-seat contest in a blue state. This evidence significantly lowers the probability of a Democratic win compared to the base rate.
*   **Evidence 2 (Polling and Issues):** The report notes that the Democratic lead is "narrowing to mid-single digits," which, given the 2021 polling errors that underestimated Republican support, suggests a toss-up race. Furthermore, Ciattarelli's focus on "affordability" is a potent issue in high-tax New Jersey. This evidence also pushes the probability of a Democratic win down.
*   **Posterior for New Jersey:** The combination of a uniquely strong Republican opponent and evidence of a tightening race substantially weakens the initial 67% prior. I assess this race as being only slightly better than a coin flip for the Democrats, setting the probability of a Democratic win at **55%**.

**3. Bayesian Updating (Combining Probabilities)**

Using the individual probabilities P(D_VA) = 90% and P(D_NJ) = 55%, I can calculate the probabilities for the four options.

*   **P(Both elections):** P(D_VA) × P(D_NJ) = 0.90 × 0.55 = 49.5%
*   **P(Only Virginia):** P(D_VA) × P(R_NJ) = 0.90 × 0.45 = 40.5%
*   **P(Only New Jersey):** P(R_VA) × P(D_NJ) = 0.10 × 0.55 = 5.5%
*   **P(Neither election):** P(R_VA) × P(R_NJ) = 0.10 × 0.45 = 4.5%

**4. Red Team Thinking & Correlation Adjustment**

The two elections are not perfectly independent. A national political environment that is unexpectedly positive for Republicans—strong enough to overcome the 90% odds in Virginia—would almost certainly lead to a Republican victory in the much closer New Jersey race. This means the "Neither election" outcome is more likely than the simple calculation suggests, and the "Only New Jersey" outcome (which requires the VA trend to fail while the NJ Democrat holds on) is less likely.

I will adjust for this correlation by shifting 2% of probability mass from the less-correlated "mixed" outcomes to the more-correlated "sweep" outcomes. I will move 1.5% from "Only Virginia" and 0.5% from "Only New Jersey", adding 1% to "Both elections" and 1% to "Neither election".

*   **Both elections:** 49.5% + 1% = 50.5%
*   **Only Virginia:** 40.5% - 1.5% = 39%
*   **Only New Jersey:** 5.5% - 0.5% = 5%
*   **Neither election:** 4.5% + 1% = 5.5%

**5. Final Normalization**

Rounding to the nearest whole number for the final forecast:

*   Both elections: 51%
*   Only Virginia: 39%
*   Only New Jersey: 5%
*   Neither election: 5%
*   Sum: 100% (Adjusting "Neither" down by 0.5% to make the sum exact)

This distribution reflects that the most likely outcome is a Democratic sweep, but that the New Jersey race is highly competitive, making an "Only Virginia" result a strong possibility. The "Neither" option captures the tail risk of a Republican wave, while "Only New Jersey" remains the least plausible scenario.

---

Both elections: 51%
Only Virginia: 39%
Only New Jersey: 5%
Neither election: 5%
