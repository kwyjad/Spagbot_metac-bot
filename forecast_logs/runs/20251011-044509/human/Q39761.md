### Reference class & base rates
-   **Ukraine's Wartime Precedent (2022-2025):** This is the most relevant reference class. Since the full-scale invasion began, Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times. Since May 2022, this has occurred like clockwork every 90 days. This establishes an extremely strong procedural and political precedent. **Base rate: >95%**.
-   **Nations Under Sustained Foreign Invasion:** States facing an existential threat from a full-scale invasion by a larger power (e.g., UK in WWII, South Korea during the Korean War, Kuwait in 1990) almost invariably maintain states of emergency or martial law until the immediate threat of conquest is neutralized or a durable armistice is signed. The termination of such powers is contingent on the termination of active, large-scale hostilities. **Base rate: >99%**.
-   **States with Prolonged Martial Law:** This is a broader, less applicable class, often involving internal conflicts, coups, or civil wars (e.g., Egypt, Pakistan, Philippines at various times). These cases are driven more by domestic political consolidation than external threats and are less relevant to Ukraine's situation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-09-26** CFR conflict tracker notes war is a stalemate with high-intensity fighting. ↑ — The fundamental condition for martial law—active, large-scale war—remains unchanged, making an extension necessary.
-   **2025-08-07** Gallup poll shows Zelenskyy's approval has stabilized at 67%. ↑ — Indicates sufficient political capital and no overwhelming public pressure to risk a major policy change like ending martial law amidst war.
-   **2025-06-23** Pew Research survey shows mixed international confidence in Zelenskyy. ↔ — While relevant for long-term aid, international opinion has little bearing on the non-discretionary domestic legal requirement to extend martial law during an active invasion.
-   **2025-04-03** RFE/RL reports on quiet groundwork for future elections. ↓ — A weak signal indicating a long-term desire to return to democratic normalcy, but explicitly contingent on the war's end, not a specific date.
-   **2025-03-01** Security Council Report notes a US pivot and difficult high-level talks. ↑ — Suggests that a negotiated end to the war is not imminent and that diplomatic friction may prolong the conflict, thus necessitating continued martial law.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **State of the Russo-Ukrainian War:** This is the primary driver. As long as there is large-scale, active combat and Russian occupation of Ukrainian territory, the *casus belli* for martial law remains firmly in place. (Large)
-   **Ukrainian Legal and Constitutional Framework:** Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits national elections under martial law. A broad political consensus exists that elections are impossible and undesirable until the war ends. This creates a powerful, self-reinforcing legal and political lock-in. (Large)
-   **Political Unity and Procedure:** The extension process (presidential decree followed by Verkhovna Rada approval) has become a routine, non-controversial procedure passed with overwhelming majorities. The absence of a significant political faction opposing extension makes it a near-formality. (Moderate)
-   **Military and Mobilization Needs:** Martial law is the legal foundation for mass mobilization, military administration in frontline areas, and the direction of the national economy toward the war effort. Lifting it would cripple Ukraine's ability to fight. (Large)
-   **International Pressure for Elections:** Western partners exert soft pressure on Ukraine to uphold democratic norms. However, this is consistently counteracted by their acknowledgement of the practical impossibility and security risks of holding elections during a full-scale invasion. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Accumulated Duration:** This extension will push martial law toward its fourth year. The sheer length of time increases institutional fatigue and amplifies questions about democratic legitimacy, even if there is no practical alternative.
-   **Zelenskyy's Mandate:** President Zelenskyy's official five-year term expired in May 2024. While legally his authority continues under martial law, each extension further detaches his presidency from its last electoral mandate, a fact used in Russian propaganda.
-   **Shifting International Support:** Unlike in 2022-2023, the international environment is more complex. The provided sources note a "US pivot" and tensions with the Trump administration, suggesting that the long-term path of the war (and thus martial law) is subject to greater external uncertainty.
-   **Nature of the Conflict:** The war has shifted from a phase of rapid maneuver to a high-intensity stalemate. This chronic state normalizes the 90-day extensions, making them a feature of governance rather than a temporary emergency measure.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with the strong base rate from Ukraine's own precedent (16 consecutive extensions). A prior of ~95% with a high equivalent n (e.g., n=20) is appropriate, reflecting the highly regularized pattern.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The military situation remains a high-intensity stalemate with no imminent prospect of a ceasefire or peace treaty.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Domestic political consensus remains solid, and leadership approval is stable, indicating no internal pushback against the extension.
    *   (↓ Small) Background discussions about eventual elections and international concerns about democratic timelines are present but are consistently subordinated to the reality of the war.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly confirms the prior. The posterior probability should increase, moving very close to 100%. The factors against extension are long-term concerns, not actionable drivers for the November 2025 decision.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   President Zelenskyy's office submits the draft law on extending martial law and general mobilization to the Verkhovna Rada (typically occurs 1-2 weeks before expiration).
    *   Statements from senior Ukrainian officials (e.g., Stefanchuk, Shmyhal) affirming the necessity of continuing martial law.
    *   A significant Russian offensive or escalation in attacks.
    *   The relevant Rada committee recommends the draft law for a vote.
-   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   A sudden, unexpected, and comprehensive ceasefire agreement is announced and holds.
    *   A joint peace summit involving the US, Russia, and Ukraine announces a breakthrough framework for ending the war.
    *   A significant, unprecedented political bloc in the Rada announces it will vote against the extension (extremely unlikely).

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast assumes no catastrophic, paradigm-shifting events before Nov 5, such as the sudden death of a key leader, a coup, or a sudden military collapse on either side.
-   **Definitional Change:** There is a very small chance Ukraine could replace the "martial law" framework with a different, but functionally identical, "state of war" or "state of emergency" to manage optics. This is unlikely but would complicate resolution.
-   **Deception/Information Warfare:** Russia may launch a "peace offensive" in the media to coincide with the extension vote, aiming to create division in Ukraine. This is unlikely to affect the outcome but could cloud analysis.
-   **Short Horizon:** With less than a month to resolution, the forecast is highly sensitive to sudden, unexpected events, though the inertia of the current situation is immense.

**Final Research Summary:** The extension of martial law is a deeply entrenched, legally necessary, and politically routine response to the ongoing war. With no credible scenario for the war's conclusion before November 5, 2025, another extension is virtually certain.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own precedent of extending martial law 16 consecutive times since the Russian invasion began. This establishes a strong procedural and political precedent. The base rate for extending martial law in this context is >95%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors past extensions, with ongoing high-intensity conflict and no imminent resolution. The legal and political framework supporting martial law remains unchanged.
   - Differences: The accumulated duration of martial law and Zelenskyy's extended mandate without elections introduce questions about democratic legitimacy, but these are not immediate drivers for change.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Military Situation (↑ Large):** The ongoing stalemate and high-intensity fighting make the extension of martial law highly likely. Likelihood ratio strongly favors extension.
   - **Political Consensus (↑ Moderate):** Stable approval ratings and political unity support the continuation of martial law. Likelihood ratio favors extension.
   - **International Concerns (↓ Small):** Discussions about future elections and international pressure are present but do not outweigh the necessity of martial law during active conflict. Likelihood ratio slightly against extension but weak.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 95% (19:1 in favor of extension).
   - Evidence strongly supports the continuation of martial law, reinforcing the prior.
   - Posterior odds increase, moving the probability closer to 100%.
   - Posterior probability: Given the strong evidence and lack of credible counter-evidence, the probability of extending martial law is extremely high.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of black swan events or a sudden peace agreement is necessary but unlikely within the short timeframe.
   - The possibility of a definitional change in the legal framework (e.g., replacing martial law with a similar state) is noted but improbable.
   - The best alternative forecast would involve a sudden, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough, but current evidence does not support this scenario.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the strong procedural precedent, ongoing conflict, and political consensus, the probability of Ukraine extending martial law beyond November 5, 2025, is extremely high.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Ukraine's own pattern of martial law extensions since the Russian invasion as the most relevant base rate:

- Since February 2022, Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times
- Since May 2022, extensions have occurred every 90 days without exception
- Each extension has been approved by overwhelming majorities in parliament

This establishes a very strong procedural precedent. Given this consistent pattern over 3+ years, I'll set a prior probability of 95% that Ukraine will extend martial law again.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental condition necessitating martial law (active large-scale war with Russia) remains unchanged
- The September 2025 CFR conflict tracker confirms the war continues as a high-intensity stalemate
- The legal and constitutional framework requiring martial law during wartime remains in place
- The political process for extension (presidential decree followed by parliamentary approval) is well-established

**Differences from base case:**
- The cumulative duration (approaching 4 years) creates some democratic legitimacy pressure
- President Zelenskyy's original electoral mandate expired in May 2024
- International support dynamics have shifted somewhat (noted "US pivot" and diplomatic tensions)
- The RFE/RL report indicates some preliminary groundwork for eventual elections

These differences create minor downward pressure on the probability, but don't fundamentally alter the overwhelming necessity of extension while active combat continues.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Ongoing high-intensity combat (CFR conflict tracker, September 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~100% (If martial law will be extended, we would certainly see ongoing combat)
- P(E|~H): ~5% (If martial law won't be extended, it's extremely unlikely combat would still be ongoing)
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 (strongly favors extension)

**Evidence 2: Zelenskyy's stable 67% approval rating (August 2025 Gallup poll)**
- P(E|H): ~80% (If martial law will be extended, we'd expect reasonable approval ratings)
- P(E|~H): ~40% (If martial law won't be extended, approval might be lower due to war fatigue)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 (moderately favors extension)

**Evidence 3: Preliminary groundwork for future elections (April 2025 RFE/RL report)**
- P(E|H): ~70% (Even with planned extension, some election preparation makes sense)
- P(E|~H): ~95% (If martial law won't be extended, we'd definitely see election preparations)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.74:1 (slightly against extension)

**Evidence 4: Difficult diplomatic talks and US pivot (March 2025 Security Council Report)**
- P(E|H): ~85% (Diplomatic friction makes peace less likely, necessitating continued martial law)
- P(E|~H): ~30% (If martial law won't be extended, we'd expect more positive diplomatic signals)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.8:1 (moderately favors extension)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 95:5 (or 19:1):

**Update on Evidence 1 (ongoing combat):**
- Posterior odds = 19:1 × 20:1 = 380:1
- Posterior probability = 380/(380+1) ≈ 99.7%

**Update on Evidence 2 (approval ratings):**
- Posterior odds = 380:1 × 2:1 = 760:1
- Posterior probability = 760/(760+1) ≈ 99.9%

**Update on Evidence 3 (election groundwork):**
- Posterior odds = 760:1 × 0.74:1 = 562:1
- Posterior probability = 562/(562+1) ≈ 99.8%

**Update on Evidence 4 (diplomatic friction):**
- Posterior odds = 562:1 × 2.8:1 = 1574:1
- Posterior probability = 1574/(1574+1) ≈ 99.9%

The evidence strongly reinforces the prior expectation that martial law will be extended.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the historical pattern and underestimating the possibility of change
- The sources are limited and may not capture internal Ukrainian political dynamics fully
- With only a month until resolution, a sudden peace breakthrough is unlikely but not impossible

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Sudden ceasefire agreement:** While extremely unlikely given the current stalemate, a surprise diplomatic breakthrough could eliminate the need for martial law extension.
2. **Legal reframing:** Ukraine could technically end "martial law" but replace it with a functionally identical "state of emergency" or "state of war" framework.
3. **Political crisis:** An unforeseen internal political crisis could disrupt the normal extension process.

**Adjustments for uncertainty:**
Given the extremely high posterior probability (99.9%), I should consider whether I'm being overconfident. However, the evidence is genuinely overwhelming - the war continues at high intensity, and there are no credible signals of imminent peace or internal opposition to extension. The legal and practical necessity of martial law during active combat is clear.

I'll make a small adjustment downward to account for unforeseen possibilities, but the probability remains very high.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the overwhelming historical precedent (16 consecutive extensions), the ongoing high-intensity combat, stable political support, and absence of any credible peace process, the extension of martial law beyond November 5, 2025, is virtually certain. The only scenarios that would prevent extension would require dramatic, unexpected developments in the next month.

Final: 98%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is Ukraine's own actions since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.
- **Data**: Ukraine has had 16 opportunities to extend martial law and has done so every single time (16/16). Since May 2022, this has become a regular, predictable 90-day cycle.
- **Reasoning**: This reference class is highly specific and relevant. The conditions that prompted the previous 16 extensions—a full-scale war of national survival against Russia—remain unchanged. This consistent pattern provides a very strong starting point.
- **Initial Prior**: Based on this perfect track record, a very high prior is warranted. Using a conservative statistical approach like Laplace's rule of succession ((16 successes + 1) / (16 trials + 2)) suggests a probability of 17/18, or approximately 94.4%. I will set my initial prior at **95%**, which corresponds to prior odds of 19-to-1 in favor of extension.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The current situation is nearly identical to the previous 16 instances where martial law was extended. There is an active, high-intensity war, Russian forces occupy Ukrainian territory, and there is no ceasefire or peace agreement in sight. The legal and military necessity for martial law to enable mobilization and manage the war effort is as strong as ever.
- **Differences**: The main difference is the sheer duration of the war. This extension will push martial law towards its fourth year, which increases general fatigue and amplifies external talking points (e.g., from Russia) about the legitimacy of President Zelenskyy's extended term. However, these are secondary political concerns that do not override the primary existential need for the legal framework of martial law.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key causal drivers. Let H be the event "Ukraine extends martial law" and ~H be "Ukraine does not extend martial law."

- **Evidence 1: The State of the War.** The research report notes the war is a "stalemate with high-intensity fighting."
    - P(E | H): It is extremely likely we would see a high-intensity stalemate if Ukraine were planning to extend martial law. This is the core justification for it.
    - P(E | ~H): It is extremely *unlikely* that Ukraine would let martial law lapse while the war is in a high-intensity phase. Doing so would cripple its ability to fight. This would only happen in the event of a sudden peace deal or surrender.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: Very high (>>1). This evidence strongly increases the probability of extension.

- **Evidence 2: Domestic Political Consensus.** The report notes Zelenskyy's approval has stabilized, and the extension process has become a political routine with overwhelming support in the Verkhovna Rada.
    - P(E | H): Political stability and a lack of opposition are highly consistent with a routine extension.
    - P(E | ~H): A decision *not* to extend would almost certainly be preceded by a major political crisis or a collapse in the pro-war consensus, which is not observed.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: High (>1). This evidence also increases the probability.

- **Evidence 3: Talk of Future Elections.** The report mentions "quiet groundwork for future elections."
    - P(E | H): It is perfectly normal for a government to engage in long-term, post-war planning even while extending emergency measures. This evidence is compatible with an extension.
    - P(E | ~H): This evidence would be stronger for ~H if the talks were about holding elections *immediately*, but they are explicitly framed as "future" and contingent on the war's end.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: Close to 1. This evidence is weak and does not meaningfully shift the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds**: 19-to-1 (from 95% probability).
- **Update Step**: The primary evidence is the continuation of the war, which is the *raison d'être* for martial law. The likelihood ratio for this evidence is extremely high. If we conservatively estimate the likelihood ratio of the combined evidence (ongoing war, political stability) as 10, the update would be:
    - **Posterior Odds** = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 19 × 10 = 190-to-1.
    - **Posterior Probability** = 190 / (190 + 1) ≈ 99.5%.
- **Summary**: The evidence strongly confirms the already high prior. The factors that could lead to non-extension are not present. The posterior probability is therefore very close to 100%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenarios**: What could cause a "No" resolution?
    1.  **Sudden Peace/Ceasefire**: A "black swan" diplomatic breakthrough before November 5. This is the most plausible path to "No," but it is extremely unlikely given the current state of the conflict and the short time remaining.
    2.  **Semantic Change**: Ukraine could replace the "martial law" framework with a new legal instrument with a different name (e.g., "State of War") for political or optical reasons. This would technically resolve the question as "No." However, there is no indication of such a move, and it would introduce unnecessary legal complexity.
    3.  **Internal Collapse**: A coup or sudden political implosion. There is no evidence to suggest this is a credible risk.
- **Best Alternative Forecast**: One could argue for 90%, citing the small but non-zero chance of a diplomatic surprise or the semantic risk.
- **Rebuttal**: While these risks exist, they are remote "tail risks." The extension of martial law is a procedural, legally necessary, and non-controversial action given the circumstances. The inertia and fundamental drivers are immense. A 99% forecast correctly prices this as a near-certainty while still acknowledging a 1-in-100 chance of a major surprise.

### 6. Final Forecast
The combination of an extremely strong base rate (16/16 previous extensions) and overwhelming current evidence (the war's continuation) makes another extension a near-certainty. The process is routine, legally required for the war effort, and politically uncontested. The only paths to a "No" outcome involve highly improbable "black swan" events.

Final: 99%
