### Reference class & base rates
1.  **DRC Ebola Outbreaks (Post-Vaccine Era, 2020-Present):** This is the most relevant reference class, as it reflects current response capabilities, including the highly effective Ervebo vaccine and established ring vaccination protocols.
    *   **Data Points:** 2021 North Kivu (12 cases, 6 deaths), 2022 Équateur (5 cases, 5 deaths), 2022 North Kivu (1 case, 1 death).
    *   **Base Rate:** The median death toll for these outbreaks is 5. This class suggests that modern outbreaks are typically contained with fewer than 10 deaths.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a very small reference class (n=3), making the estimate sensitive to single events. The current outbreak, with 43 deaths, is already a significant outlier.

2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present):** This class provides a view of the full historical distribution, highlighting the potential for catastrophic outcomes.
    *   **Data Points:** 16 outbreaks in the DRC. The distribution is highly skewed. Most outbreaks resulted in <100 deaths. However, two major outliers exist: the first-ever recorded outbreak in 1976 (280 deaths) and the Kivu epidemic of 2018-2020 (2,280 deaths).
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths is likely in the range of 30-60. The mean is much higher (~180) due to the Kivu outlier.
    *   **Limitations:** This class includes pre-vaccine, pre-modern-response eras, making it less representative of current conditions and capabilities. Its primary utility is in characterizing the "fat tail" risk.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province with 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths. — ↑ — Establishes the starting point and indicates a significant number of initial cases.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — ↑ — Shows continued, albeit slow, initial growth in case numbers.
*   **2025-10-05** Cumulative total reaches 64 cases and 43 deaths. — ↑ — The absolute number is concerning and well outside the post-2020 reference class base rate.
*   **2025-10-05** WHO reports no new cases in the preceding 10 days. — ↓↓↓ — This is the most critical recent development, strongly suggesting that contact tracing and ring vaccination have successfully contained known transmission chains.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Vaccine Efficacy & Deployment (Large, ↓):** The rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine, used in a "ring vaccination" strategy (vaccinating contacts and contacts-of-contacts), is extremely effective. The speed and completeness of its deployment is the primary lever for containment.
*   **Public Health Response Speed & Quality (Large, ↓):** Rapid case identification, contact tracing, isolation of patients, and safe burial practices are critical. The report of no new cases suggests the response, after an initial lag, has become effective.
*   **Geographic Location & Security (Moderate, ↓):** The outbreak is in Kasaï Province, not the active conflict zones of North Kivu that severely hampered the 2018-2020 response. While Kasaï has a history of instability, the current environment is likely more permissive for health workers, facilitating a more effective response.
*   **Community Trust and Cooperation (Moderate, ?):** Community acceptance of response measures is crucial. Mistrust can lead to hidden cases and resistance to vaccination, reigniting transmission. This is currently an unknown variable for Kasaï's first outbreak.
*   **Healthcare System Capacity (Moderate, ↑):** The initial infection of four healthcare workers suggests potential weaknesses in local infection prevention and control (IPC), which can amplify outbreaks. However, national and international support typically bolsters this capacity quickly.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Outlier in the Post-Vaccine Era:** With 43 deaths, this outbreak is already an order of magnitude larger than any other DRC outbreak since the massive Kivu epidemic ended in 2020. This suggests a significant "super-spreading" event or missed transmission chains early on.
*   **Novel Location:** This is the first recorded Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province. This is a double-edged sword: the population is immunologically naive and lacks experience with Ebola response, but there may be less "fatigue" or entrenched mistrust compared to regions with recurrent outbreaks like North Kivu or Équateur.
*   **Strong Containment Signal:** Despite its unusually large initial size for the modern era, the report of "no new cases in 10 days" is a powerful and unusually clear signal of successful containment efforts. In past large outbreaks, progress was often slower and less linear.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior would be anchored on the post-vaccine reference class (median ~5 deaths) but with a very fat tail informed by the broader historical distribution (acknowledging the small possibility of a Kivu-scale event). An equivalent n of ~4-5 reflects the limited but relevant recent data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑, Moderate) The initial death toll of 43 is a significant surprise, pushing probability mass out of the <10 deaths range and suggesting the prior was too optimistic about immediate containment.
    *   (↓↓↓, Large) The report of no new cases in the 10 days prior to Oct 5 is extremely strong evidence that the outbreak's growth has been halted. This sharply curtails the fat tail risk.
    *   (↓, Small) The location in Kasaï is less challenging than the Kivu conflict zone, increasing the probability of an effective response compared to the worst-case scenario.
*   **Net effect:** The initial upward revision caused by the case numbers should be almost entirely reversed by the powerful downward evidence of containment. The posterior should be heavily concentrated just above the current death toll of 43, with very little probability mass assigned to totals exceeding 100.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new confirmed cases, particularly if unlinked to known transmission chains.
    *   Geographic spread to a new health zone, province, or neighboring country (e.g., Angola).
    *   Reports of community resistance, violence against health workers, or widespread rejection of safe burial practices.
    *   Detection of a new outbreak of a different Ebola strain (e.g., Sudan) elsewhere, which could divert resources.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The 21-day mark (one full incubation period) is reached with no new cases.
    *   The 42-day mark is reached, leading to an official declaration that the outbreak is over.
    *   High reported coverage rates (>90%) for ring vaccination around the last known cases.
    *   All known contacts completing their 21-day monitoring period without symptoms.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting Lags:** The "no new cases" signal could be an artifact of reporting delays from remote areas. A sudden batch of back-dated cases would invalidate this key piece of evidence.
*   **Undetected Transmission:** A single transmission chain could be spreading silently in a community with poor access to healthcare, capable of reigniting the outbreak.
*   **Resolution Definition:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026. An outbreak can be declared over (after 42 days of no cases) and then a new case can emerge from a survivor via sexual transmission, technically restarting the same outbreak.
*   **Political Instability:** The security situation in the DRC is fluid. A sudden deterioration in Kasaï could halt response activities and allow the virus to spread.

### Final Research Summary
The outbreak is anomalously large for the post-vaccine era, but very strong recent evidence indicates that containment measures have been successful. The final death toll is therefore highly likely to be very close to the currently reported 43 deaths.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the post-vaccine era DRC Ebola outbreaks (2020-present), with a median death toll of 5. This reflects the effectiveness of modern containment strategies, including vaccination.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The median is 5, with a small sample size variance due to the limited number of outbreaks in this period.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current outbreak benefits from the same modern response capabilities, including the Ervebo vaccine and established protocols.
   - **Difference:** The current outbreak already has 43 deaths, significantly higher than the typical post-vaccine era outbreak, indicating an initial failure in containment or a super-spreading event.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Initial Death Toll (↑):** The high initial death toll suggests a more severe outbreak, increasing the likelihood of a higher total death count.
   - **Containment Signal (↓↓↓):** The report of no new cases in 10 days is strong evidence of effective containment, significantly reducing the likelihood of further deaths.
   - **Location (↓):** The outbreak's location in Kasaï, away from conflict zones, supports effective response efforts.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Start with a prior centered around the post-vaccine era median of 5 deaths but with a fat tail to account for the current 43 deaths.
   - **Update:** The strong containment signal (no new cases) significantly shifts the distribution back towards the current death toll, reducing the probability of a large outbreak.
   - **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The posterior is concentrated around the current death toll of 43, with a small probability of exceeding 100 deaths.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of reporting lags or undetected transmission chains that could reignite the outbreak.
   - **Tail Risks:** Acknowledge the small chance of a Kivu-scale event, though current evidence strongly suggests containment.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A more pessimistic forecast might consider a resurgence, but current data does not support this.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong containment evidence and the current death toll, the forecast is heavily weighted towards the current number of deaths, with a small chance of additional deaths.

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Primary Reference Class: Post-Vaccine Era DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2020-Present)**
- 2021 North Kivu: 12 cases, 6 deaths
- 2022 Équateur: 5 cases, 5 deaths
- 2022 North Kivu: 1 case, 1 death
- Median: 5 deaths
- Mean: ~4 deaths
- Range: 1-6 deaths

**Secondary Reference Class: All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present)**
- 16 outbreaks with highly skewed distribution
- Most outbreaks: <100 deaths
- Major outliers: 1976 (280 deaths), 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic (2,280 deaths)
- Median: ~45 deaths
- Mean: ~180 deaths (skewed by Kivu outlier)

I'll primarily use the post-vaccine era reference class as my base rate, but with awareness of the fat-tail risk from the historical distribution. The post-vaccine era is most relevant because it reflects current response capabilities including the Ervebo vaccine and established protocols.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Rate:**
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure
- Same disease (Ebola virus)
- Same vaccine and containment protocols available
- Similar international response mechanisms

**Differences from Base Rate:**
- Current outbreak is already at 43 deaths (as of October 5, 2025), making it significantly larger than any post-vaccine outbreak
- First outbreak in Kasaï Province, meaning population lacks prior exposure and experience
- Already exceeds the median of the broader historical reference class
- However, there's a strong containment signal with no new cases reported in 10 days

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence Pushing Forecast Higher:**
- Initial death toll of 43 already exceeds post-vaccine reference class by ~8x (Strong upward push)
- Four healthcare workers initially infected suggests potential weaknesses in local infection control (Moderate upward push)
- Novel location means population lacks experience with Ebola response (Weak upward push)

**Evidence Pushing Forecast Lower:**
- No new cases reported in 10 days prior to October 5 (Very strong downward push)
- Location in Kasaï Province is more accessible than conflict zones like North Kivu (Moderate downward push)
- Modern vaccine and containment protocols have proven highly effective (Strong downward push)
- Current date is October 11, meaning the "no new cases" period is potentially even longer now (Moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with the post-vaccine era prior (median ~5 deaths), I need to update based on the evidence:

**First Update - Current Death Toll:**
- Prior: Centered around 5 deaths
- Evidence: 43 deaths already confirmed
- Likelihood ratio: Extremely high (this outcome would be nearly impossible under the prior)
- Posterior: Must shift dramatically upward to center around at least 43 deaths

**Second Update - No New Cases in 10+ Days:**
- Prior: Now centered around 43+ deaths with fat tail risk
- Evidence: No new cases in 10+ days
- Likelihood ratio: Much higher under "outbreak contained" hypothesis than "continuing outbreak" hypothesis
- Posterior: Strong concentration of probability mass just above current death toll (43-50 range), with rapidly diminishing probability for higher values

The posterior distribution is now centered slightly above the current death toll, with a relatively narrow spread but maintaining some probability mass in the tail to account for potential undetected cases or resurgence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- Reporting delays could create false impression of containment
- Undetected transmission chains in remote areas
- Potential for viral persistence in survivors leading to sexual transmission
- Political instability could disrupt containment efforts

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- **Hidden Outbreak Scenario:** There could be unreported cases in remote areas that suddenly emerge, causing a second wave (10-15% probability)
- **Contained But Lingering Scenario:** A few additional cases emerge from the monitoring period, adding 5-10 more deaths (30-40% probability)
- **Fully Contained Scenario:** No additional cases emerge, death toll remains at 43 (45-60% probability)

**Adjustments for Overconfidence:**
- Widening my distribution slightly to account for reporting uncertainties
- Adding more probability mass to scenarios with 10-20 additional deaths
- Maintaining small but non-negligible probability for larger outbreaks (>100 deaths)

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 43
P20: 44
P40: 45
P60: 48
P80: 55
P90: 65

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary reference class is **Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the post-vaccine era (2020-present)**. This class is most relevant because it reflects modern response capabilities, including the highly effective Ervebo vaccine, established "ring vaccination" protocols, and experienced international response teams.

*   **Data:** This class includes three outbreaks: 2021 North Kivu (6 deaths), 2022 Équateur (5 deaths), and 2022 North Kivu (1 death).
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** This small dataset suggests a strong central tendency for outbreaks to be contained with very few fatalities. The median is 5 deaths, and the maximum is 6.

To account for tail risk, I will also consider a secondary reference class: **All Ebola outbreaks in the DRC (1976-present)**. This class includes catastrophic outliers like the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic (2,280 deaths). While less representative of current capabilities, it reminds us that under adverse conditions (e.g., conflict, community mistrust), Ebola can still cause mass casualties.

My initial prior, before considering the specifics of this outbreak, would be a distribution with a median around 10 deaths, but with a very long, fat tail to account for the small but real possibility of a major event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, a country with significant, albeit challenging, experience in Ebola response. The international community, including the WHO, is involved, and the modern toolkit (vaccines, therapeutics, rapid diagnostics) is available.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Initial Size:** With 43 deaths already reported, this outbreak is a massive outlier compared to the primary (post-2020) reference class. It is an order of magnitude larger, indicating a significant failure of initial detection or containment, possibly due to a super-spreader event or delayed reporting.
    *   **Location:** This is the first recorded outbreak in Kasaï Province. This is a mixed factor: the population is immunologically naive, but the region is not an active, high-intensity conflict zone like North Kivu was during the 2018-2020 epidemic, which should make the public health response more effective.
    *   **Containment Signal:** The report of "no new cases in the preceding 10 days" is an unusually strong and clear signal that containment measures are working effectively.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1.  **Initial Death Toll (43 deaths):** This is strong evidence against the hypothesis that the outbreak would follow the post-2020 base rate (1-6 deaths). It dramatically increases the probability of a higher final death toll compared to the prior. It forces a hard floor on the forecast at 43 and suggests that the initial conditions were worse than typical. This is a large **upward** adjustment.
2.  **"No New Cases in 10 Days" (as of Oct 5):** This is the most critical piece of evidence. The Ebola incubation period is 2-21 days. A 10-day period without new confirmed cases is a very strong indicator that all known transmission chains have been successfully interrupted through contact tracing and ring vaccination. This evidence makes scenarios involving hundreds or thousands of additional deaths extremely unlikely. This is a very large **downward** adjustment, primarily impacting the right tail of the distribution.
3.  **Location (Kasaï Province):** The absence of major armed conflict, compared to the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak, makes a successful response more likely. This provides a small **downward** adjustment to the probability of a catastrophic tail-risk scenario.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered on a low number of deaths (~10) but with a fat tail.
*   **Update 1 (Likelihood: 43 deaths already):** The prior is immediately invalidated. The entire distribution must shift to the right, with a new floor at 43. The evidence of a difficult start increases the perceived risk, so the median might shift to ~60-70 deaths, and the fat tail seems more plausible.
*   **Update 2 (Likelihood: No new cases in 10 days):** This powerful new evidence reverses the previous update's effect on the tail. It suggests the outbreak's growth has been arrested. The posterior distribution should now be heavily concentrated just above the current death toll of 43. The median should be only slightly higher than 43 to account for deaths among currently ill patients and minor reporting lags. The variance should be significantly reduced.

The final posterior is a sharply right-skewed distribution with most of its mass between 43 and 50 deaths, and a rapidly decaying tail for higher numbers.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk:** The "no new cases" report could be wrong due to reporting lags from remote areas or, more dangerously, a completely undetected transmission chain in a community that is not engaging with health responders. If a new, unlinked case appears, this forecast would be far too low.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** A pessimist would argue that the initial size (43 deaths) is the dominant signal, proving a fundamental breakdown in the system. They would view the "no new cases" as a temporary lull. Their forecast would have a median closer to 75-100.
*   **Rebuttal:** While the initial size is a major concern, the combination of the vaccine's effectiveness and the strong, recent signal of containment is more compelling. The lack of a major conflict zone as a complicating factor supports the idea that the response, once initiated, can be effective.
*   **Adjustment:** To account for the risk of a small, missed transmission chain or a late flare-up (e.g., from sexual transmission by a survivor), I will give the upper percentiles (P80, P90) enough room to accommodate a cluster of 10-20 additional deaths, but no more. The core of my forecast remains that the outbreak is largely contained.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My forecast is centered on the belief that the strong containment signal is accurate and the outbreak is nearly over. The final death toll will therefore be very close to the last reported number of 43, with a small allowance for deaths among existing cases, reporting lags, and a minor flare-up.
