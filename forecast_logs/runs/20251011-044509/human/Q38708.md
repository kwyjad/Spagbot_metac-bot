### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

1.  **Reference Class & Base Rates:** What is the historical precedent for elections in Cameroon under Biya? What is the precedent for long-serving incumbents in dominant-party, authoritarian-leaning states in Sub-Saharan Africa?
2.  **Mechanisms of Power:** How does the incumbent, Paul Biya, maintain control over the electoral process? What is the role of key state institutions like the electoral commission (ELECAM) and the Constitutional Council?
3.  **Opposition Landscape:** Who are the key opposition figures? What is the impact of the disqualification of Maurice Kamto, the main challenger from 2018? Is the remaining opposition unified or fragmented?
4.  **Recent Political Dynamics:** What key events in the last 6-12 months have shaped the electoral environment? This includes candidate announcements, legal challenges, government actions, and signs of elite cohesion or fragmentation.
5.  **Public Sentiment & Salient Issues:** What are the primary concerns of the Cameroonian populace (e.g., security, economy, youth unemployment)? How does this sentiment translate, if at all, into electoral outcomes within the existing political structure?
6.  **Wildcards & Uncertainties:** What are the low-probability, high-impact events that could alter the expected outcome? This primarily concerns President Biya's health and the loyalty of the security forces.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The research confirms that Cameroon operates as a dominant-party state where the incumbent, Paul Biya, exercises overwhelming control over all institutions critical to the electoral process. His personal electoral history shows a 100% success rate in multi-party elections, often with large margins amid allegations of irregularities. The key event shaping the 2025 election is the legally-sanctioned disqualification of his most credible challenger, Maurice Kamto. This has left a fragmented opposition unable to mount a unified challenge. While there is significant public discontent due to economic hardship, security crises, and Biya's advanced age, there are no viable institutional channels for this discontent to translate into an opposition victory. The system is designed to ensure the incumbent's reelection. The primary, albeit low-probability, risk to this outcome is a sudden health failure of the 92-year-old president.

**4. Draft of Comprehensive Answer:**

The following research brief is the output of this plan.

### **Research Brief**

**To:** Bayesian Forecasting Panel
**From:** Lead Researcher
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Subject:** P(Yes) for "Will Paul Biya be reelected President of Cameroon in 2025?"

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Paul Biya's Contested Elections (1992-2018):** Biya has run in and been declared the winner of all seven presidential elections since the reintroduction of multi-party politics. His official vote share has ranged from a low of 40% in a competitive 1992 race to over 70% in the last four contests. **Base Rate: 100% (7/7).** This is the most specific and powerful reference class.
*   **Incumbents in "Not Free" Dominant-Party States:** Cameroon is rated "Not Free" by Freedom House, with institutions heavily biased toward the incumbent. In such systems across Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Uganda, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea), the incumbent running for reelection is almost never defeated via the ballot box. Defeats occur through coups, death, or choosing not to run. **Base Rate: >95%.**
*   **Elections with Disqualified Main Opposition:** When a credible, primary opposition candidate is barred from running by state authorities shortly before an election in an authoritarian-leaning system, the incumbent's probability of winning becomes near-certain. **Base Rate: >98%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-16** Biya announces his candidacy for an eighth term, prompting minor defections from two allied ministers. (↓ small) — Shows hairline cracks in elite cohesion but not a systemic break.
*   **2025-07-18** Opposition leader Maurice Kamto attempts a strategic maneuver, filing his candidacy under an allied party to bypass legal hurdles. (↔) — Demonstrates opposition awareness of institutional barriers but proves ineffective.
*   **2025-07-26** The state electoral body, ELECAM, officially disqualifies Maurice Kamto from the presidential race. (↑ large) — Removes the most significant and nationally recognized challenger from the 2018 election.
*   **2025-08-05** The Constitutional Council, whose members are appointed by Biya, upholds Kamto's disqualification. (↑ large) — Confirms that the state's legal and judicial apparatus will not permit a serious challenge to Biya's rule.
*   **2025-09-10** The government postpones legislative and municipal elections until 2026. (↑ moderate) — Weakens the opposition's ability to build grassroots momentum and demonstrates the executive's total control over the electoral calendar.
*   **2025-10-09** Multiple international media reports confirm the electoral landscape: Biya is set to win, youth are disaffected, and the remaining opposition is fragmented. (↑ small) — Reinforces the dominant narrative and signals low international pressure for a competitive process.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Control of State Institutions (Large ↑):** Biya's party, the RDPC, controls the electoral commission (ELECAM), the Constitutional Council (which validates results), the judiciary, and state media. This allows them to set the rules, disqualify opponents, and certify a favorable outcome. This is the primary driver.
*   **Opposition Fragmentation (Large ↑):** The disqualification of Kamto, the main opposition figure, leaves a field of less prominent challengers like Cabral Libii and Issa Tchiroma Bakary. With a plurality (first-past-the-post) system, the anti-Biya vote will be split, allowing Biya to win with a minority of the popular vote.
*   **Incumbency & Patronage (Moderate ↑):** After 43 years in power, Biya commands a vast network of patronage. State resources, from security forces to public funds, are leveraged to support his campaign and ensure loyalty from key regional and local elites.
*   **Voter Apathy & Fear (Moderate ↑):** Decades of predictable election outcomes and occasional state repression have fostered widespread voter apathy and a belief that voting cannot produce change. This depresses turnout among opposition supporters.
*   **Public Discontent (Small ↓):** High youth unemployment, ongoing security crises (Anglophone regions, Boko Haram), and frustration with Biya's age and longevity create a strong desire for change. However, without a viable opposition candidate or fair process, this discontent is unlikely to affect the official result.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Biya's Extreme Age (92):** Even for the reference class of long-serving autocrats, Biya's age is an outlier. This introduces a significant "health" variable and makes questions of succession and fitness to govern more acute than in his previous elections.
*   **Blatant Disqualification of Main Rival:** While past elections faced accusations of fraud, the pre-emptive, legalistic removal of the undisputed main challenger from 2018 (Kamto) is a more overt and confident display of institutional control than in some prior cycles.
*   **Overt Elite Dissent:** The public withdrawal of support by two ministers from Biya's ruling coalition is a new, albeit small, development. It signals growing impatience among some elites regarding the unresolved succession issue.
*   **Multiple, Entrenched Security Crises:** The state is more stressed than in past elections, fighting both a secessionist movement in the Anglophone regions and a long-running insurgency in the north. This drains resources and fuels popular grievances.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the reference class of Biya's own electoral history (7/7 wins). This suggests a very high prior, around 95%, with a strong equivalent n (e.g

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for Paul Biya being reelected is extremely high given his historical record. He has won every election since 1982, making the base rate 100% (7/7) for his reelection in multi-party elections. Additionally, in "Not Free" dominant-party states in Sub-Saharan Africa, incumbents rarely lose elections, suggesting a base rate of over 95%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors past elections where Biya has maintained control over state institutions, ensuring his victory. The disqualification of a major opponent is consistent with past tactics to secure his position.
   - Differences: Biya's advanced age (92) introduces uncertainty regarding his health, which is more pronounced than in previous elections. There is also notable public discontent and minor elite dissent, which could slightly affect the dynamics.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Disqualification of Maurice Kamto: This significantly increases the likelihood of Biya's reelection as it removes a major challenger, aligning with past strategies to eliminate competition.
   - Control of State Institutions: The control over ELECAM and the Constitutional Council strongly favors Biya, increasing the probability of his reelection.
   - Public Discontent: While there is significant opposition to Biya, the lack of a unified opposition candidate and the control over the electoral process reduce the impact of this discontent on the election outcome.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 95% (0.95/0.05)
   - Likelihood ratio for disqualification of Kamto: High, as it removes a major threat.
   - Updated odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = Increased odds of Biya's reelection.
   - Posterior probability: Given the strong control over the electoral process and the removal of a major challenger, the posterior probability remains very high, around 98%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could stem from underestimating the impact of Biya's age and potential health issues. However, the system's robustness in maintaining his power mitigates this risk.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden health crisis could destabilize the election outcome, but this remains a low-probability event given the current information.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential uncertainties, the probability of Paul Biya being reelected is very high.

Final: 98%

# Will Paul Biya be reelected President of Cameroon in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Paul Biya's own electoral history as the most specific and relevant reference class. Biya has won all seven presidential elections since multi-party politics was reintroduced in Cameroon:
- 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018

This gives a base rate of 100% (7/7 elections won). However, using a perfect 100% would be overconfident, so I'll adjust slightly to account for uncertainty. A reasonable prior would be **95%**, which acknowledges his perfect track record while allowing for some uncertainty.

Alternative reference classes support this high prior:
- Incumbents in "Not Free" dominant-party states in Sub-Saharan Africa rarely lose elections when they choose to run
- When main opposition candidates are disqualified in authoritarian systems, incumbents almost always win

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Biya maintains control over key state institutions (ELECAM, Constitutional Council)
- The electoral system remains first-past-the-post, requiring only a plurality
- Opposition remains fragmented, as in previous elections
- State resources continue to be leveraged for the incumbent's advantage

**Differences from base case:**
- Biya's extreme age (92) introduces health uncertainty not present in previous elections
- The disqualification of Maurice Kamto is more blatant than previous electoral manipulations
- There are signs of minor elite defections (two ministers withdrawing support)
- Multiple security crises (Anglophone regions, Boko Haram) strain state resources
- Polling shows stronger public discontent than in previous cycles

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Disqualification of Maurice Kamto**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If Biya intends to win, removing his strongest challenger is expected
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.05) - If Biya were to lose, the main opposition would likely be allowed to run
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of Biya winning
- This significantly increases the probability of Biya's reelection

**Evidence 2: Fragmented opposition without Kamto**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - A divided opposition benefits the incumbent
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - For Biya to lose, opposition would likely need to unify
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5:1 in favor of Biya winning
- This moderately increases the probability of Biya's reelection

**Evidence 3: Polling showing public discontent**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even with Biya winning, public dissatisfaction is plausible
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Public discontent would be expected if Biya were to lose
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67:1 against Biya winning
- This slightly decreases the probability of Biya's reelection

**Evidence 4: Biya's advanced age (92)**
- P(E|H): This is a given fact, not evidence per se, but introduces health uncertainty
- Impact: Slightly decreases probability due to health/mortality risk during campaign

**Evidence 5: Control of state institutions**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.99) - Institutional control is necessary for Biya's continued rule
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.1) - Loss of institutional control would precede electoral defeat
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.9:1 in favor of Biya winning
- This significantly increases the probability of Biya's reelection

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability P(H) = 0.95 (Biya wins)

**Update on Evidence 1 (Kamto disqualification):**
- Prior odds: 0.95/0.05 = 19:1
- Likelihood ratio: 19:1
- Posterior odds: 19 × 19 = 361:1
- Posterior probability: 361/(361+1) ≈ 0.997

**Adjusting for other evidence:**
- Evidence 2 (fragmented opposition): Increases probability (×4.5)
- Evidence 3 (public discontent): Decreases probability (×0.67)
- Evidence 4 (Biya's age): Decreases probability slightly (×0.95)
- Evidence 5 (institutional control): Increases probability (×9.9)

Combined effect of these additional factors:
4.5 × 0.67 × 0.95 × 9.9 ≈ 28.3

This would further increase the posterior odds, but I need to be careful about double-counting evidence and overconfidence.

After considering all evidence, a reasonable posterior probability would be around **98%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Health risk underestimation**: At 92, Biya faces significant mortality and health risks. The election is still weeks away, and a sudden health crisis could force withdrawal.

2. **Military/security forces loyalty**: I may be overestimating the loyalty of security forces. If elite fragmentation is more serious than reported, a last-minute coup or intervention could occur.

3. **International pressure**: The analysis may underweight potential international pressure for a fair election, though this seems unlikely given historical precedent.

4. **Opposition unity**: There's a small chance remaining opposition figures could unite behind a single candidate, though this seems unlikely given the timeline.

5. **Overconfidence in institutional control**: While Biya controls state institutions, there's a small chance of internal sabotage or defection within these institutions.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability slightly downward to account for these tail risks, particularly the health risk given Biya's extreme age.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I adjust my forecast to **97%**. This reflects Biya's overwhelming advantages in the electoral system, the disqualification of his main challenger, and his control of state institutions, while accounting for the non-trivial health risks of a 92-year-old candidate and other potential disruptions.

Final: 97%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is Paul Biya's own electoral history in Cameroon's multi-party era. Since 1992, he has contested and been declared the winner in all seven presidential elections. This perfect record (7 wins, 0 losses) in a system he largely controls suggests a very high prior probability of success. A simple frequentist approach would yield 100%, but to account for inherent uncertainty, a Bayesian approach using a rule of succession (e.g., Laplace's rule) is more appropriate. This would suggest a prior of (7+1)/(7+2) = 8/9, or approximately 89%.

A slightly broader reference class—incumbent presidents running for reelection in dominant-party, authoritarian-leaning states in Sub-Saharan Africa—also shows a near-certain reelection rate, often exceeding 95%, unless the incumbent dies, is overthrown, or chooses not to run.

Given these, I will set a strong prior probability of **90%** for Biya's reelection. This reflects his perfect track record while leaving a 10% chance for an upset, health issue, or other unforeseen event. In odds, this is 9:1 in favor.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The core political structure remains unchanged from previous elections. Biya's party, the RDPC, maintains control over all key state institutions, including the electoral commission (ELECAM), the Constitutional Council that validates results, the security forces, and state media. The first-past-the-post electoral system, combined with a divided opposition, heavily favors the incumbent.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is Biya's advanced age (92), which introduces a non-trivial biological risk not present to the same degree in past elections. A second key difference is the pre-emptive disqualification of his most credible 2018 challenger, Maurice Kamto. While past elections were marred by irregularities, this is a more overt and decisive use of state institutions to eliminate a threat before the vote, suggesting the regime is taking even fewer chances than before.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Disqualification of Maurice Kamto.** The state electoral body (ELECAM) and the Constitutional Council (whose members Biya appoints) have legally barred Biya's main challenger from the race.
    *   P(E | H): The likelihood of the regime disqualifying the main rival, *given that Biya is going to be reelected*, is very high. It is a classic tactic to ensure a predetermined outcome.
    *   P(E | ~H): The likelihood of this action, *given that Biya is not going to be reelected*, is very low. An outcome where Biya loses would likely involve a scenario (e.g., an elite pact for a successor, a coup) where such a blatant move would be unnecessary or even counterproductive.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is strongly greater than 1. This evidence significantly increases the probability of Biya's reelection.

*   **Evidence 2: Fragmentation of the remaining opposition.** With Kamto out, the opposition is divided among several less prominent candidates, such as Cabral Libii.
    *   P(E | H): A fragmented opposition is highly likely if Biya is to be reelected, as it splits the anti-incumbent vote, allowing him to win with a simple plurality.
    *   P(E | ~H): A loss for Biya would almost certainly require a unified opposition front capable of mobilizing a massive majority. A fragmented opposition makes this scenario highly improbable.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence also increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Polling showing high public discontent.** Polls indicate a strong desire for change and opposition to another Biya term.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Close to 1. In Cameroon's political system, public opinion is largely decoupled from the official electoral result. High discontent is expected whether Biya wins or not, making this evidence neutral.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with a prior of 90% (9:1 odds), we update with the powerful evidence of Kamto's disqualification and the resulting opposition fragmentation. This evidence confirms that the regime is systematically eliminating any path to an opposition victory. This pushes the conditional probability of a Biya win, *assuming he remains a viable candidate*, extremely high. Let's say the likelihood ratio for this combined evidence is a conservative 4.

*   **Posterior Odds** = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 9:1 × 4 = 36:1.
*   **Intermediate Probability** = 36 / (36 + 1) ≈ 97.3%.

This 97.3% represents the probability of Biya winning *politically*. We must now account for the primary factor that could cause a "No" resolution: a non-political event.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

The main reason for a "No" outcome is not a political defeat at the ballot box, but an exogenous event.
1.  **Health Failure:** The most significant risk is that Biya, at age 92, dies or becomes medically incapacitated before the official results are declared. While he has access to elite medical care, the actuarial risk over the next month is real. I estimate a 2% probability for such an event preventing the resolution.
2.  **Elite Maneuvering/Coup:** A small possibility exists that elites within the regime decide he is too frail and force a last-minute change of candidate, or that the military intervenes. Given Biya's 43-year history of maintaining control, this risk is very low, but not zero. I estimate a combined 1-2% probability for these scenarios.

These risks are largely independent of the political process. Summing them gives a total probability of a "No" outcome of approximately 3-4%. Therefore, the probability of a "Yes" outcome must be adjusted downwards from the politically-derived 97.3%.

*   Final Probability ≈ 100% - (2% health risk + 1.5% other risks) = 96.5%.

My forecast of 96% seems robust, as it reflects the near-certainty of the engineered political outcome, while explicitly accounting for the primary wildcard: the candidate's advanced age and health.

### 6. Final Forecast

The combination of a perfect historical track record, total control over state institutions, and the pre-emptive disqualification of the only credible challenger makes Paul Biya's reelection almost certain from a political standpoint. The primary source of uncertainty is not the election itself, but the biological reality of his advanced age. After discounting the near-certain political outcome by the small but real risk of a health event or other instability, the final probability remains very high.

Final: 96%
