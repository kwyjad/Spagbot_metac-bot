### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), which also involved IEEPA, the Court upheld broad executive action, suggesting a high base rate for the President prevailing. **Base Rate for "Tariffs lawful": 60-70%.** This is derived from a long history of judicial restraint where the President acts with perceived congressional acquiescence in external affairs. Limitation: This case involves massive, broad-based economic action (tariffs), which may be viewed as domestic economic policy rather than pure foreign affairs.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Executive Actions Based on Ambiguous Statutes (Major Questions Doctrine):** In recent years, the Court's conservative majority has been highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming transformative power from older, ambiguous statutes without explicit congressional authorization (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, student loan cases). This action fits the pattern of a "major question." **Base Rate for "Tariffs unlawful": 65-75%.** This is derived from a string of 6-3 rulings since ~2021 striking down major executive initiatives. Limitation: IEEPA explicitly grants emergency powers related to foreign commerce, potentially making it a stronger statutory basis than in other major questions cases.
3.  **Supreme Court Affirmance Rate of a Unified Circuit/Lower Court Direction:** When multiple lower courts, including a Court of Appeals, have ruled in the same direction on an issue, the Supreme Court is statistically more likely to affirm than reverse. Here, three different federal courts (CIT, DDC, Fed. Cir.) have found the tariffs unlawful. **Base Rate for Affirmance ("Tariffs unlawful"): 60-70%.** Limitation: The Supreme Court often takes cases specifically to reverse lower courts, especially on issues of high political salience or involving novel legal questions.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms CIT ruling that tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. ↓ — A 7-4 split shows some judicial disagreement, but a key appellate court still found the tariffs unlawful, strengthening the legal case against them.
*   **2025-09-03** The government petitions the Supreme Court for review of *V.O.S. Selections*. ↑↓ — Expected procedural step. Signals the administration's commitment but also brings the issue before a skeptical Supreme Court.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court consolidates cases and grants review on an expedited schedule. ↓↓↓ — This makes "No 2025 ruling" extremely unlikely. The urgency suggests the Court sees a pressing need to resolve the issue, likely indicating a majority is prepared to rule on the merits and potentially rein in executive power.
*   **2025-09-19** Trump administration files its brief, arguing IEEPA's power to "regulate importation" includes tariffs. ↓ — This is the government's core textual argument. Its plausibility will be tested, but it faces headwinds from the specific constitutional grant of tariff power to Congress.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's conservative majority has consistently used this doctrine to invalidate major executive actions not explicitly and clearly authorized by Congress. Imposing trillions of dollars in tariffs based on a general emergency power is a textbook "major question." (Large driver towards **Tariffs unlawful**).
2.  **Textualism/Originalism:** The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises." Textualist justices (e.g., Gorsuch, Thomas, Barrett) are likely to view the administration's claim that IEEPA's power to "regulate" importation implicitly includes the power to impose tariffs (a tax) as a violation of this specific grant to the legislature. (Large driver towards **Tariffs unlawful**).
3.  **Foreign Affairs Deference:** The traditional counterweight. The government will argue the tariffs are a tool of foreign policy and national security, areas where the Court has historically deferred to the President. The "national emergency" framing is designed to invoke this deference. (Moderate driver towards **Tariffs lawful**).
4.  **Path to a "Mixed Ruling":** The Court is reviewing two distinct tariff programs (trafficking-related and reciprocal-trade-deficit-related) and two different lower court rationales. This provides a clear off-ramp to issue a split decision. The Court could find the trafficking tariffs are sufficiently linked to the national security threat to be permissible, while the much broader "reciprocal tariffs" are an impermissible overreach into general economic policy. (Moderate driver towards **Mixed ruling**).
5.  **Judicial Restraint/Procedural Off-Ramps:** The Court could try to avoid a direct confrontation with the President on a major policy issue by finding a narrow procedural ground for its decision (e.g., standing, mootness), or by issuing a fractured plurality opinion with no majority holding. (Small driver towards **Other ruling**).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Scope of Economic Impact:** Unlike past IEEPA cases that often involved targeted sanctions or asset freezes (e.g., *Dames & Moore*), these tariffs represent a fundamental reordering of U.S. trade policy affecting nearly the entire economy. The sheer scale pushes this out of the traditional "foreign affairs" box and into the "major questions" framework.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Using a trade deficit as the basis for a "national emergency" under IEEPA is legally novel and highly contentious. It appears to be a pretext for achieving a long-standing economic policy goal, which may weaken the Court's deference to the President's emergency declaration.
*   **Current Supreme Court Composition:** The Court that decided earlier deference cases is not the Court of today. The current 6-3 conservative majority has demonstrated a strong and consistent interest in curbing executive authority and reviving the non-delegation doctrine, a stark contrast to courts of the 20th century.
*   **Consolidation of Two Different Legal Theories:** The Court is simultaneously considering a narrow theory ("the tariffs don't 'deal with' the threat") and a broad one ("IEEPA never allows tariffs"). This dual-track review increases the complexity and the number of potential outcomes, including a mixed or fractured ruling.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the historical reference class of high deference to the President in foreign affairs, but with significant uncertainty. E.g., P(Lawful)=50%, P(Unlawful)=35%, P(Mixed)=10%, P(Other/No Ruling)=5%. (Equivalent n ≈ 4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓↓↓ The current Court's robust application of the Major Questions Doctrine to curb executive power. (Large magnitude shift from Lawful to Unlawful).
    *   ↓↓ The unanimous *outcome* of three lower federal courts finding the tariffs unlawful. (Large magnitude shift from Lawful to Unlawful).
    *   ↓ The specific textual argument that "regulating importation" does not include the power to "tax" imports, which is constitutionally assigned to Congress. (Moderate magnitude shift from Lawful to Unlawful).
    *   ↑ The existence of two distinct tariff programs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provides a clear pathway for a split decision. (Moderate magnitude shift towards Mixed).
    *   ↓ The expedited review schedule makes a non-ruling in 2025 highly improbable. (Large magnitude shift away from No 2025 ruling).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points away from "Tariffs lawful." The posterior should be heavily concentrated on "Tariffs unlawful," with "Mixed ruling" as the second most likely outcome. The probability of "Tariffs lawful" should be significantly reduced to a small, residual value.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Tariffs lawful/Mixed):**
    *   During Nov 5 oral arguments, questions from Chief Justice Roberts or Justice Kavanaugh focusing on the history of presidential power in foreign commerce and national security emergencies.
    *   Questions from the bench suggesting the "trafficking tariffs" are more defensible than the "reciprocal tariffs," signaling a potential mixed ruling.
    *   Amicus briefs filed by a significant number of former high-ranking national security officials supporting the President's authority.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Tariffs unlawful):**
    *   During oral arguments, extensive questioning from multiple conservative justices about the Major Questions Doctrine and the specific constitutional power of Congress to lay duties.
    *   The Solicitor General struggling to distinguish this case from recent losses for the executive branch like *West Virginia v. EPA*.
    *   Questions from the bench expressing skepticism about a "trade deficit" constituting a national emergency under the statute.
    *   Any reporting on a potential legislative deal in Congress to address tariffs, which could signal a belief that the President's executive action is doomed.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The definitions are precise. A ruling that strikes down even one minor tariff measure while upholding none resolves as "Unlawful." A ruling upholding one and striking one resolves as "Mixed." This precision is key.
*   **"Other Ruling" Possibility:** While the expedited schedule makes a merits ruling likely, the Court could still issue a GVR (Grant, Vacate, Remand) order with instructions for the lower court, or dismiss the case as improvidently granted, which would resolve as "Other."
*   **Fractured Plurality:** A 4-2-3 split with no single rationale commanding a majority could lead to a confusing outcome that might fall under "Other ruling" depending on the exact judgment.
*   **Political Volatility:** The case is politically charged. While the Court aims for legal consistency, external political pressure or events could subtly influence the framing or timing of the decision.
*   **Hypothetical Scenario:** This analysis is based on a detailed but hypothetical set of facts. Real-world briefing and arguments could introduce unforeseen legal arguments that shift the calculus.

**Final Research Summary:** The administration's use of IEEPA to impose broad tariffs clashes directly with the current Supreme Court's skepticism of major executive actions not explicitly authorized by Congress. While the President historically enjoys deference in foreign affairs, the Court's powerful Major Questions Doctrine and textualist leanings make an "Unlawful" ruling the most probable outcome, with a "Mixed ruling" being a significant secondary possibility.

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**:
   - **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential power in foreign affairs, especially under IEEPA, suggesting a base rate of 60-70%. However, given the recent trend of the Court's skepticism towards executive overreach, we adjust this to 20%.
   - **Tariffs unlawful**: The Court's recent rulings under the Major Questions Doctrine and the unanimous lower court decisions against the tariffs suggest a base rate of 65-75%. We adjust this to 50%.
   - **Mixed ruling**: The presence of two distinct tariff programs provides a pathway for a mixed ruling, suggesting a base rate of 10-20%. We adjust this to 20%.
   - **Other ruling**: Given the expedited schedule and the Court's interest in resolving the issue, the likelihood of an "Other ruling" is low, around 5%.
   - **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule makes this very unlikely, around 5%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**:
   - The current case involves broad economic actions, which differ from typical foreign affairs cases, pushing it into the "major questions" framework. The Court's composition and recent rulings suggest a shift away from historical deference.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**:
   - **Tariffs lawful**: The government's argument that IEEPA allows for such tariffs is weakened by the Court's recent skepticism of executive overreach. Likelihood is low.
   - **Tariffs unlawful**: The Major Questions Doctrine and lower court rulings strongly support this outcome. Likelihood is high.
   - **Mixed ruling**: The distinct nature of the tariffs provides a reasonable likelihood for a mixed outcome.
   - **Other ruling**: Procedural off-ramps are possible but unlikely given the Court's expedited review.
   - **No 2025 ruling**: The Court's schedule and urgency make this very unlikely.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**:
   - Start with priors: Tariffs lawful (20%), Tariffs unlawful (50%), Mixed ruling (20%), Other ruling (5%), No 2025 ruling (5%).
   - Update based on evidence: The strong likelihoods for "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling" shift probabilities further towards these outcomes.
   - Adjust for the expedited schedule, reducing "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling."

5. **Red Team Thinking**:
   - Consider overconfidence in "Tariffs unlawful" due to recent trends. The Court could surprise with deference to presidential power.
   - A mixed ruling is plausible given the distinct nature of the tariffs.
   - Adjust probabilities slightly to account for these considerations.

6. **Final Normalization**:
   - Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

7. **Output Format**:
   - Tariffs lawful: 15%
   - Tariffs unlawful: 55%
   - Mixed ruling: 25%
   - Other ruling: 3%
   - No 2025 ruling: 2%

Final forecast:
Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
Mixed ruling: 25%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Tariffs lawful:**
- Base rate: 25%
- Rationale: Historically, the Supreme Court has granted significant deference to presidential power in foreign affairs and national security (e.g., *Dames & Moore v. Regan* involving IEEPA). However, this base rate is lower than historical averages because the current Court has shown skepticism toward broad executive power claims.

**Tariffs unlawful:**
- Base rate: 50%
- Rationale: The current 6-3 conservative Supreme Court has consistently applied the Major Questions Doctrine to strike down executive actions claiming broad authority from ambiguous statutes (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, student loan forgiveness cases). When executive actions involve major economic or political significance without clear congressional authorization, this Court has been highly skeptical.

**Mixed ruling:**
- Base rate: 15%
- Rationale: The Court often seeks compromise positions, especially in politically charged cases. With two distinct tariff programs (trafficking-related and reciprocal trade deficit-related), there's a natural path to uphold one while striking down the other.

**Other ruling:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Rationale: The Court occasionally avoids deciding on the merits through procedural rulings, though this is relatively rare in high-profile cases granted expedited review.

**No 2025 ruling:**
- Base rate: 5%
- Rationale: Given the expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025, a ruling before year-end is highly likely but not guaranteed.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other major questions cases, this involves an executive action with enormous economic consequences based on a broadly worded statute.
- Like other IEEPA cases, it involves presidential action justified by a declared national emergency.
- The case follows the typical pattern of lower courts ruling against the executive, followed by Supreme Court review.

**Key differences:**
- The scale of these tariffs is unprecedented under IEEPA, affecting trillions in trade rather than targeted sanctions.
- The "national emergency" justification based on trade deficits stretches the concept of emergency far beyond traditional security threats.
- The unanimity of lower courts (CIT, DDC, Federal Circuit) in finding the tariffs unlawful is notable.
- The constitutional allocation of tariff power specifically to Congress creates a stronger textual argument against executive authority than in typical major questions cases.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Three different federal courts have ruled the tariffs unlawful, albeit on different grounds. P(E|Unlawful) = very high; P(E|~Unlawful) = low.
- The Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 against the tariffs, with judges appointed by both parties in the majority. P(E|Unlawful) = high; P(E|~Unlawful) = moderate.
- The Court's recent jurisprudence has consistently limited executive power in "major questions" cases. P(E|Unlawful) = very high; P(E|~Unlawful) = low.
- The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises," making tariffs a textually committed congressional power. P(E|Unlawful) = high; P(E|~Unlawful) = moderate.

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- IEEPA explicitly authorizes the President to "regulate importation" during declared emergencies. P(E|Lawful) = high; P(E|~Lawful) = moderate.
- Historical precedent grants significant deference to the President in foreign affairs and national security. P(E|Lawful) = high; P(E|~Lawful) = moderate.
- The trafficking-related tariffs have a more plausible connection to genuine security threats than the reciprocal tariffs. P(E|Mixed) = very high; P(E|~Mixed) = moderate.

**Evidence favoring "No 2025 ruling":**
- The Court has granted expedited review with arguments scheduled for November 2025, making a 2025 ruling highly likely. P(E|No 2025 ruling) = very low; P(E|~No 2025 ruling) = very high.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the key evidence that the current Supreme Court has consistently applied the Major Questions Doctrine to limit executive power:

Prior odds for "Tariffs unlawful" = 50/50 = 1:1
Likelihood ratio ≈ 4:1 (The evidence is about 4 times more likely if the tariffs will be ruled unlawful)
Posterior odds = 1 × 4 = 4:1
Posterior probability ≈ 4/(1+4) = 0.8 or 80%

Now let's update on the evidence that IEEPA explicitly authorizes regulating importation:

Prior probability for "Tariffs unlawful" = 80%
Likelihood ratio ≈ 1:1.5 (This evidence slightly favors lawfulness)
Posterior odds = 4 × (1/1.5) ≈ 2.67:1
Posterior probability ≈ 2.67/(1+2.67) ≈ 0.73 or 73%

Updating on the evidence that there are two distinct tariff programs with different justifications:

This increases the probability of a "Mixed ruling" at the expense of both "Tariffs lawful" and "Tariffs unlawful."
Shifting approximately 10 percentage points from "Tariffs unlawful" to "Mixed ruling."
New probability for "Tariffs unlawful" ≈ 63%
New probability for "Mixed ruling" ≈ 25%

Updating on the expedited review schedule:

This significantly reduces the probability of "No 2025 ruling" to near zero.
Redistributing those probability points proportionally to other outcomes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent Major Questions Doctrine cases and underestimating the Court's traditional deference in foreign affairs.
- The Court might view tariffs as fundamentally different from other regulatory actions, given their historical use as tools of foreign policy.
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a fractured opinion with no clear majority rationale.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would place much higher probability on "Tariffs lawful" (40-45%) based on:
- The explicit statutory language of IEEPA authorizing regulation of imports
- The Court's historical reluctance to second-guess presidential determinations of national emergency
- The trafficking-related tariffs having a more plausible security justification

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The current Court has shown it's willing to break with historical deference patterns
- The Constitution's explicit allocation of tariff power to Congress creates a stronger textual argument against executive authority
- The "trade deficit as national emergency" stretches the concept beyond recognition

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly increasing probability of "Mixed ruling" to account for the distinct nature of the two tariff programs
- Slightly decreasing "No 2025 ruling" given the expedited schedule
- Maintaining high probability on "Tariffs unlawful" given the consistent pattern of lower court rulings and the Court's recent jurisprudence

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting probabilities to ensure they sum to 100%:

Tariffs lawful: 15%
Tariffs unlawful: 60%
Mixed ruling: 23%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 0%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%
Tariffs unlawful: 60%
Mixed ruling: 23%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 0%
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information, following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three potential reference classes:

1.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in foreign affairs and national security. Cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), which involved the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), suggest a high base rate for the President's actions being upheld. This would imply a high prior for "Tariffs lawful" (~60-70%).
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** The current Supreme Court (post-2020) has consistently used the MQD to invalidate major executive actions based on broad interpretations of older statutes (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, student loan cases). The imposition of sweeping tariffs fits this pattern, suggesting a high base rate for "Tariffs unlawful" (~65-75%).
3.  **Supreme Court Decision Timing:** For cases argued in early November, a decision before the end of December is possible but not typical. The median time from argument to decision is closer to three months. This suggests a significant base rate for "No 2025 ruling". A rough estimate might be a 60-70% chance the ruling comes in 2026, not 2025.

The most relevant reference class for the merits of the case is the MQD, as the current Court's composition and judicial philosophy are more predictive than historical deference patterns from a different era. For the timing, the base rate strongly suggests a high probability of no ruling in 2025. I will synthesize these to form a prior, starting with a high probability for "No 2025 ruling" and then distributing the remaining probability with a heavy weight on "Tariffs unlawful".

Initial Prior:
*   P(No 2025 ruling): 60%
*   P(Tariffs unlawful): 25% (most of the remaining probability, based on MQD)
*   P(Mixed ruling): 8%
*   P(Tariffs lawful): 5% (low, reflecting rejection of the historical deference base rate)
*   P(Other ruling): 2%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities to MQD cases:** The executive branch is claiming vast, economy-wide power (imposing tariffs, a form of tax) from a general grant of authority in an old statute (IEEPA), which is the classic fact pattern for applying the MQD.
*   **Differences from MQD cases:** Unlike purely domestic regulatory cases, this action is grounded in IEEPA, a statute explicitly concerning foreign threats and national emergencies. This provides the President with his strongest argument for deference, making the case more complex than a standard MQD case. Furthermore, the existence of two distinct tariff programs (trafficking-related vs. trade-deficit-related) creates a natural opportunity for a split decision ("Mixed ruling") that is not always present in other cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Three lower courts ruled the tariffs unlawful.** This includes the Court of International Trade, the D.C. District Court, and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
    *   This evidence is highly likely if the tariffs are indeed unlawful (P(E|Unlawful) is high).
    *   It is very unlikely if the tariffs are lawful (P(E|Lawful) is very low).
    *   This strongly increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" at the expense of "Tariffs lawful".

*   **Evidence 2: The Supreme Court granted review on an expedited schedule.**
    *   This makes "No 2025 ruling" less likely than the base rate would suggest. An expedited schedule signals urgency to resolve the issue quickly. While a 2026 ruling is still more likely than not, the chance of a 2025 ruling increases significantly.
    *   This evidence also makes "Other ruling" (e.g., dismissal) less likely, as the Court is signaling its intent to decide the important question presented.

*   **Evidence 3: The case involves two distinct tariff programs.** The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible national security justification than the reciprocal tariffs based on trade deficits.
    *   This structure makes a "Mixed ruling" much more plausible (P(E|Mixed) is high). The Court can strike down the broader economic tariffs via the MQD while upholding the more targeted national security tariffs under a traditional deference model.
    *   This evidence pulls probability away from the "clean sweep" outcomes of "Tariffs lawful" and "Tariffs unlawful" and moves it toward "Mixed ruling".

*   **Evidence 4: The textual argument regarding Congress's constitutional power to lay duties.** The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to tax and impose tariffs. The argument that IEEPA implicitly delegated this core power is weak, especially for the textualist and originalist justices on the Court.
    *   This is a powerful argument that would invalidate *all* the tariffs, regardless of their justification.
    *   This evidence strongly supports the "Tariffs unlawful" option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(No 2025 ruling) = 60%, P(Unlawful) = 25%, P(Mixed) = 8%, P(Lawful) = 5%, P(Other) = 2%.
2.  **Update for Expedited Schedule:** The expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling more likely. Let's adjust the probability of "No 2025 ruling" down from 60% to 35%. This frees up 25 percentage points to be redistributed among the merits outcomes.
    *   New P(No 2025 ruling) = 35%.
    *   Let's add the 25 points proportionally to the other options: P(Unlawful) becomes ~41%, P(Mixed) becomes ~13%, P(Lawful) becomes ~8%, P(Other) becomes ~3%.
3.  **Update for Merits Arguments (Lower Courts, MQD, Textualism):** The unanimous lower court rulings and the strong textualist/MQD arguments are powerful evidence against the tariffs' legality. This should shift probability mass heavily from "Lawful" to "Unlawful". The odds of Unlawful vs. Lawful (~41:8 or ~5:1) should increase significantly. Let's move most of the probability from "Lawful" to "Unlawful".
    *   Decrease P(Lawful) from 8% to 5%.
    *   Increase P(Unlawful) from 41% to 44%.
4.  **Update for Two-Program Structure:** The existence of two distinct tariff programs makes the "Mixed ruling" a very attractive compromise for the Court. This should pull probability from the clean-sweep "Unlawful" option.
    *   Decrease P(Unlawful) from 44% to 37%.
    *   Increase P(Mixed) from 13% to 20%.

This leaves a posterior distribution of: P(Unlawful) = 37%, P(Mixed) = 20%, P(Lawful) = 5%, P(Other) = 3%, P(No 2025 ruling) = 35%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast makes "No 2025 ruling" a very high-probability outcome. Is this correct? An expedited schedule with argument in early November creates immense pressure for a quick ruling due to the massive economic uncertainty. It is plausible the Court prioritizes speed and issues a decision in December. If I underestimate this, my probability for the merits outcomes is too low.

Let's consider an alternative where the Court is more likely to rule in 2025. If I set P(No 2025 ruling) to 30%, that frees up 5% to distribute. This would likely increase "Unlawful" and "Mixed".

However, the institutional norm is for cases to take a few months. A decision in under eight weeks for a complex, high-stakes case would be unusually fast, even if not unprecedented. 35% seems like a reasonable estimate of this uncertainty.

The biggest risk on the merits is underestimating the "Mixed ruling" option. It offers a perfect judicial compromise: check the executive's most extreme power grab while still respecting presidential authority in national security. My final distribution has "Unlawful" at nearly double "Mixed". This seems reasonable because a single, clean legal theory (e.g., "IEEPA does not authorize tariffs") could invalidate both programs and might be preferred by justices who favor clear rules. I will slightly adjust to reflect the strength of the "Mixed" option.

Final Adjustment: Move 2% from "Unlawful" to "Mixed".
*   P(Unlawful): 37% -> 35%
*   P(Mixed): 20% -> 22%
*   P(Other): 3% -> 3% (no change)
*   P(Lawful): 5% -> 5% (no change)
*   P(No 2025 ruling): 35% -> 35% (no change)
Let's round P(Other) to 5% to account for the non-trivial risk of a fractured plurality, taking 2% from "Unlawful".
*   P(Unlawful): 35% -> 33%
*   P(Other): 3% -> 5%

Final check: 33 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 35 = 100%. This feels like a well-calibrated distribution of probabilities across the key uncertainties: the merits of the case and the timing of the decision.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are normalized and sum to 100%.

*   **Tariffs unlawful:** 33%
*   **Mixed ruling:** 22%
*   **Tariffs lawful:** 5%
*   **Other ruling:** 5%
*   **No 2025 ruling:** 35%

This distribution reflects that (1) there is substantial uncertainty whether a ruling will even occur in 2025; and (2) if a ruling does occur, it is most likely to be unfavorable to the tariffs, with a complete invalidation being more likely than a partial, mixed ruling.

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 33%
Mixed ruling: 22%
Other ruling: 5%
No 2025 ruling: 35%
