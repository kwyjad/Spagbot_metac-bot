### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Planned Capital City Relocations:** Governments occasionally move capitals (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Egypt's ongoing project). These are multi-decade, multi-billion dollar projects. They involve moving government functions and incentivizing population shifts, not ordering mass evacuations of the old capital. The base rate of a country initiating a capital relocation in a given year is very low (<0.5%), and the rate of it involving a forced evacuation of the prior capital is near zero.
2.  **Large-Scale, Non-Imminent Disaster Evacuations:** Governments rarely order large-scale (100,000+) evacuations for chronic, slow-moving crises like water scarcity or pollution. Such orders are typically reserved for acute, immediate threats like hurricanes, industrial accidents, or military invasion. Forced relocations for chronic issues are historically associated with extreme authoritarian regimes (e.g., Khmer Rouge and Phnom Penh), a class to which modern Iran does not belong. The base rate for this is extremely low, effectively <0.1%.
3.  **Major Policy Threats by Political Leaders:** Leaders often issue dramatic threats or ultimatums to galvanize public opinion, force bureaucratic action, or demonstrate resolve on a difficult issue. More often than not, these threats are not followed through literally, especially when they involve high economic and political costs. Instead, they lead to lesser, more politically palatable actions. The base rate of such threats being fully implemented on schedule is low, perhaps 10-20%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-14** President Pezeshkian states the government might have to "evacuate Tehran" if there is no rain by November 21 and the drought continues. — ↑ (large) — Creates a specific, public, and very short-term deadline, staking presidential credibility on a radical action.
*   **2025 (ongoing)** Reports highlight Tehran's extreme land subsidence rates, strengthening the environmental and infrastructural case for drastic action. — ↑ (small) — Adds technical weight and urgency to the long-standing debate, but doesn't force an immediate decision.
*   **2025-01-07** The Iranian government formally states it "will relocate its capital" to the Makran coast, citing overpopulation and resource scarcity. — ↑ (moderate) — Moves the relocation from a debated proposal to stated government policy, providing a destination and official rationale.
*   **2024 (late)** President Pezeshkian orders a formal study into relocating the capital, reviving the long-dormant proposal. — ↑ (small) — Signals presidential backing and initiates the bureaucratic process, making the idea more concrete than in previous decades.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Water Crisis Severity:** The primary driver. A genuine, catastrophic failure of the water supply for a city of 10+ million could force unprecedented action. The stated trigger (no rain by Nov 21) makes this acute. (Size: Large)
2.  **Presidential Credibility:** Pezeshkian has publicly tied his administration to this specific threat and timeline. Backing down without a face-saving alternative would damage his authority. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **State Capacity & Logistics:** Iran's capacity to organize, transport, house, and support 100,000 evacuees on short notice is highly questionable. Logistical failure would be chaotic and politically disastrous. (Size: Large, acts as a strong brake)
4.  **Economic Costs:** The immediate cost of an evacuation, in a sanctions-constrained economy, would be immense and divert resources from other critical areas, including the military and foreign policy objectives mentioned in sources. (Size: Large, acts as a strong brake)
5.  **Internal Political Opposition:** Such a drastic move would face enormous resistance from Tehran's population, businesses, and powerful political factions (including potentially the IRGC) who have vested interests in the capital. The President's power is not absolute. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Rhetorical vs. Literal Intent:** The "evacuation" threat may be a political tool to shock the system into accepting severe water rationing, funding desalination plants, or supporting a more gradual, voluntary relocation of government agencies. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Acute Trigger for a Chronic Problem:** Unlike typical capital relocations which are proactive, long-term projects, this is framed as a reactive, emergency measure tied to a specific, short-term trigger (rainfall by Nov 21).
*   **Evacuation vs. Relocation:** The proposal is not merely to move government functions (the base rate) but to evacuate a significant portion of the existing population, which is historically unprecedented for this type of crisis.
*   **Presidential Sponsorship:** While the idea is old, it now has a specific, named champion in the President who has escalated his rhetoric to an ultimatum, a significant departure from the vague discussions of the past.
*   **Compressed Timeline:** The resolution window is extremely short (~6 weeks), contrasting sharply with the multi-year or multi-decade timelines of all reference class examples.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the extreme rarity of both planned capital relocations involving evacuations and non-disaster-driven mass evacuations of major cities. The "equivalent n" is high, reflecting strong historical precedent against this event.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Long-standing discussion of the issue: ↑ (small)
    *   Formal government policy announcement (Jan 2025): ↑ (moderate)
    *   Pezeshkian's specific, time-bound public ultimatum: ↑ (large)
    *   Overwhelming logistical, economic, and political barriers: ↓ (large)
*   **Net effect:** The recent, high-level political rhetoric dramatically increases the probability from its near-zero baseline. However, the immense and immediate practical constraints act as a powerful counterweight. The posterior should move up significantly from the prior, but likely remain low in absolute terms (e.g., moving from <1% to the 5-15% range). The evidence makes a highly improbable event plausible, but not yet probable.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   No significant rainfall in the Tehran region by November 21.
    *   Official announcements of specific evacuation plans, logistics, or designated relocation zones.
    *   State media campaigns preparing the public for "necessary sacrifices" or "national mobilization."
    *   Statements of support or operational involvement from the IRGC or other security forces.
    *   Reports of severe, widespread water cuts or rationing being implemented in Tehran.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Significant precipitation in the Tehran watershed before or shortly after November 21.
    *   President Pezeshkian "clarifies" his statement, walking back the evacuation threat in favor of other measures.
    *   Announcement of a massive, emergency infrastructure project (e.g., water pipelines, desalination) as an alternative.
    *   Public criticism of the plan from other senior Iranian leaders (e.g., the Supreme Leader's office, Speaker of Parliament).
    *   Organized protests against the potential evacuation in Tehran.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution requires an "order" for an evacuation. This could be a symbolic decree not meant for immediate, full implementation, potentially creating ambiguity. The 100,000 threshold is precise and could be missed.
*   **Information Opacity:** Reliable, unbiased information on Iranian domestic policy-making and implementation is scarce. State media reports may be propaganda, and official statements may not reflect reality on the ground.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Action:** The primary evidence is a political statement. There is a high risk of misinterpreting a rhetorical threat designed to force other actions as a literal statement of intent.
*   **Internal Power Dynamics:** The President is not the ultimate authority. The Supreme Leader or the IRGC could countermand or simply obstruct any such order, a factor difficult to observe from the outside.
*   **Partial Implementation:** The government could announce a "voluntary, compensated relocation program" for 100,000 people, which may not meet the criteria of an "ordered evacuation."

**Final Research Summary:** The event is historically unprecedented and faces extreme logistical and political barriers, suggesting a very low probability. However, the President has staked his credibility on a specific, short-term ultimatum, making a highly improbable action surprisingly plausible if the climate trigger is met and he chooses to follow through on his threat.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a government ordering a large-scale evacuation due to chronic issues like water scarcity is extremely low, effectively <0.1%. This is because such actions are historically unprecedented for chronic problems and are typically reserved for acute, immediate threats.
   - The base rate for a country initiating a capital relocation in a given year is also very low (<0.5%), and the rate of it involving a forced evacuation of the prior capital is near zero.
   - Given the rarity of both scenarios, we start with a very low prior probability, less than 1%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a chronic issue (water scarcity) and a political leader making a dramatic statement, which aligns with the base case of low probability events.
   - Differences: The acute trigger (no rain by November 21) and the President's specific, time-bound ultimatum are unusual and increase the plausibility compared to typical base cases.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Pezeshkian's Ultimatum (2025-11-14):** This creates a specific, public, and short-term deadline, significantly increasing the likelihood of the event if the ultimatum is taken literally. Likelihood ratio: High.
   - **Environmental Case (2025 ongoing):** Strengthens the rationale for drastic action but doesn't force an immediate decision. Likelihood ratio: Moderate.
   - **Formal Policy Announcement (2025-01-07):** Moves the relocation from a debated proposal to stated policy, increasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio: Moderate.
   - **Logistical and Political Barriers:** These act as strong brakes, decreasing the likelihood of the event occurring. Likelihood ratio: Low.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: Let's assume a prior probability of 0.5% (odds of 0.005).
   - Likelihood ratio for Pezeshkian's ultimatum: Let's assume a factor of 10 increase due to the specific and public nature of the threat.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.005 × 10 = 0.05.
   - Posterior probability = 0.05 / (1 + 0.05) ≈ 4.76%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate the likelihood due to the dramatic nature of the ultimatum without considering the practical constraints.
   - Alternative scenario: The President might use the threat to push for severe water rationing or infrastructure projects instead of an actual evacuation.
   - Adjustments: Given the logistical and political barriers, the probability should remain low, even with the ultimatum.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, the final probability reflects a significant increase from the prior but remains low due to the practical constraints and historical rarity of such events.

Final: 5%

# Will Iran announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a government ordering a large-scale evacuation of its capital city due to a chronic environmental crisis.

Looking at historical precedents:
- Governments rarely order large-scale evacuations (100,000+ people) for slow-moving crises like water scarcity
- Capital city relocations do occur (Brazil, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Egypt) but these are planned, gradual processes, not evacuations
- Forced mass relocations for non-imminent threats are extremely rare in modern history

The most appropriate base rate would be the frequency of governments ordering large-scale evacuations of major cities due to chronic environmental issues. This is extremely rare - effectively near 0%. Even considering all types of government-ordered evacuations for any reason, the base rate for a city of Tehran's size would be well below 1%.

**Prior probability: 0.5%** (1:199 odds against)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Tehran faces genuine environmental challenges (water scarcity, land subsidence)
- The Iranian government has discussed capital relocation for decades without action
- Large-scale evacuations face enormous logistical, economic and political barriers

**Key differences:**
- President Pezeshkian has made a specific, time-bound threat tied to rainfall by November 21, 2025
- The government has formally announced intent to relocate the capital (January 2025)
- The environmental situation appears to have worsened significantly
- The timeline is extremely compressed (weeks rather than years)
- This is framed as an emergency response rather than a planned relocation

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's specific evacuation threat**
- P(E|H): If Iran will announce an evacuation, the President would very likely make such a threat first (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran will not announce an evacuation, such a specific threat is still possible but much less likely (~10%)
- Likelihood ratio: 9:1 in favor of evacuation
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Formal government statement on capital relocation (January 2025)**
- P(E|H): If evacuation will happen, a formal policy statement would likely precede it (~80%)
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation will happen, such statements might still occur as political posturing (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio: 4:1 in favor of evacuation
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Extreme logistical and economic barriers**
- P(E|H): If evacuation will happen, these barriers would need to be overcome (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation will happen, these barriers would be a major reason why (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1:3.17 against evacuation
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Compressed timeline (only weeks remaining in 2025)**
- P(E|H): If evacuation will happen before 2026, it must occur very soon (~50%)
- P(E|~H): If no evacuation will happen, the compressed timeline makes action less likely (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1:1.9 against evacuation
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:199 (0.5%)

Update on Evidence 1 (President's threat):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:199 × 9:1 = 9:199 ≈ 1:22.1
- New probability ≈ 4.3%

Update on Evidence 2 (Formal relocation policy):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:22.1 × 4:1 = 4:22.1 ≈ 1:5.5
- New probability ≈ 15.3%

Update on Evidence 3 (Logistical barriers):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:5.5 × 1:3.17 = 1:17.4
- New probability ≈ 5.4%

Update on Evidence 4 (Compressed timeline):
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:17.4 × 1:1.9 = 1:33.1
- New probability ≈ 2.9%

However, I need to consider that the November 21 rainfall deadline is imminent (today is November 19), which could trigger immediate action if no rain occurs. This creates a short-term spike in probability.

Adjusting for the imminent deadline: ~8%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of Tehran's water crisis
- The President's statement might reflect internal government discussions already in progress
- Iran might define "evacuation" differently than the resolution criteria (e.g., as a phased relocation)
- I might be overestimating the logistical barriers for a government willing to accept significant disruption

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could announce a "voluntary relocation program" that technically meets the 100,000 threshold
- The government might announce an evacuation plan with implementation extending beyond 2026
- A partial evacuation of specific districts might be ordered as a compromise solution

**Best alternative forecast:**
A stronger case could be made for ~15-20% probability if:
1. The water crisis is truly catastrophic and imminent
2. The President's statement reflects consensus among power centers
3. A phased evacuation could begin with 100,000 people from most affected areas

**Rebuttal:**
Even in this scenario, the enormous economic costs, political resistance, and logistical challenges make a full evacuation order extremely unlikely. The government would likely pursue alternatives like emergency water rationing, infrastructure projects, or a more limited voluntary relocation program.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the imminent rainfall deadline, I believe there is a small but significant chance Iran will announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026. The President has staked his credibility on this threat, but the enormous practical barriers and political costs make follow-through unlikely.

Final: 8%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate for this event is the frequency of large-scale (100,000+ people), ordered evacuations of major capital cities due to chronic, non-military, non-acute-disaster crises (e.g., water scarcity, pollution, subsidence). Historically, this event is exceptionally rare. While governments sometimes relocate capital functions over decades (e.g., Brazil, Kazakhstan), a rapid, forced evacuation of a significant portion of the population from a megacity like Tehran due to environmental decline is virtually unprecedented in modern history. Therefore, the base rate is extremely low.
- **Prior Probability P(H):** I will set the prior at **0.1%**. This reflects the extraordinary nature of the event, which has almost no direct historical parallel. This is equivalent to prior odds of 1:999 against the event occurring in a given short-term period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The underlying drivers (water stress, subsidence) are chronic, slow-moving problems that typically lead to adaptation, mitigation, or gradual decline, not sudden, state-ordered evacuation.
- The logistical, economic, and political costs of evacuating and resettling 100,000 people from a functioning, 10-million-person metropolis are immense, which is the primary reason such events are absent from the historical record.

**Differences:**
- **Acute Trigger:** The key difference is that President Pezeshkian has artificially created an acute trigger for this chronic problem. By setting a specific deadline ("no rain by Azar," Nov 21), he has transformed a long-term issue into a short-term political crisis.
- **Presidential Ultimatum:** The President has publicly staked his credibility on taking drastic action if this trigger is met. This is no longer a background environmental risk but a central political test for the administration.
- **Stated Policy:** The threat of evacuation exists within the context of a stated government policy (from Jan 2025) to relocate the capital, lending it a degree of official seriousness that was previously absent.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most crucial piece of evidence is the President's statement. We must evaluate the likelihood of him making such a statement if an evacuation order is planned, versus if it is not.

- **Evidence (E):** President Pezeshkian's Nov 14 statement that the government would have to "potentially evacuate Tehran" if there is no rain by Nov 21.
- **P(E | H):** If the government genuinely intends to order an evacuation before 2026 (H), it is highly likely that the President would make a strong public statement beforehand to prepare the nation and justify the decision. P(E | H) is high, perhaps ~0.9.
- **P(E | ~H):** If the government does not intend to order an evacuation (~H), how likely is this statement? It is quite plausible. The threat could be a powerful rhetorical tool to force through deeply unpopular but necessary policies like severe water rationing, or to galvanize support for massive infrastructure spending. The word "potentially" is a crucial hedge, providing an easy off-ramp. A leader can claim that these alternative measures successfully averted the need for the evacuation, thus turning the threat into a political victory without following through. Therefore, P(E | ~H) is also reasonably high, perhaps ~0.7.
- **Likelihood Ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** 0.9 / 0.7 ≈ 1.3. This suggests the statement itself is only weak evidence in favor of the hypothesis.

However, the sheer extremity of the threat makes it stand out. A better approach might be to treat the threat itself as creating a new reference class: "How often are extreme political ultimatums followed through?" The research report suggests a 10-20% base rate for this. This seems like a more useful starting point than the near-zero historical base rate.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with a new prior based on the "political threat" reference class, say **15%**. Now, we adjust based on the specifics.

- **Prior Odds:** 15:85, or roughly 1:5.7.

- **Updating Factors:**
    - **(Negative) Extreme Impracticality:** The logistical and economic barriers are far greater than for a typical political threat. Evacuating 100,000 people in weeks is a monumental undertaking that the Iranian state may not have the capacity for. This strongly pushes the probability down.
    - **(Negative) Plausible Alternatives:** The government can claim victory by implementing severe water rationing and stating that this action made the evacuation unnecessary. This provides a politically viable "out."
    - **(Positive) Plausible Path to Resolution:** The order may not be for a chaotic evacuation of the general populace. It could be a more manageable, "symbolic" evacuation of specific government ministries and their families, designed to just cross the 100,000 threshold. This would serve as the first concrete step in the capital relocation plan and allow the President to follow through on his threat.

The negative factors (impracticality, political outs) are very strong, but the plausible path of a "managed" government evacuation prevents the probability from collapsing. The outcome is highly dependent on whether it rains by the deadline. Let's model this:
- Assume a 50% chance of "no significant rain" by the deadline.
- If it rains, the government has an easy excuse to stand down. P(Evac | Rain) ≈ 1%.
- If it does not rain, the pressure to act is immense. The "managed evacuation" scenario becomes a real possibility. Let's estimate P(Evac | No Rain) at 25%.
- **Posterior Probability:** P(Evac) = P(Evac | No Rain) * P(No Rain) + P(Evac | Rain) * P(Rain) = (0.25 * 0.50) + (0.01 * 0.50) = 0.125 + 0.005 = **13%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 13% could be too low if the water crisis is even more dire than is publicly known, forcing the government's hand regardless of logistics. It could also be that President Pezeshkian has already secured the backing of the Supreme Leader and the IRGC for a "managed" evacuation of government personnel as a way to consolidate power and begin the capital move, making the follow-through much more likely if the rain trigger is met.

Conversely, the forecast could be too high. I may be overweighting the public rhetoric of a single politician whose power is not absolute. The Iranian system has many veto players (Supreme Leader, IRGC) who may see this as a reckless and destabilizing move and block it. The entire affair is most likely political theater to justify extreme water rationing, and the probability should be closer to 5%.

I believe the 13% forecast correctly balances these opposing factors. It acknowledges that the event is unlikely in absolute terms but treats the President's high-stakes ultimatum as a serious factor that has made a near-impossible event plausible.

### Final Forecast
The final probability is derived by updating a very low base rate with strong but ambiguous evidence. The President's public ultimatum has made a historically unprecedented event plausible. However, the immense practical barriers and the existence of politically viable off-ramps (e.g., claiming severe rationing averted the crisis) keep the probability low. The most likely path to a "Yes" resolution is a managed, symbolic evacuation of government personnel, not a general public evacuation. Balancing the political pressure to act against the practical constraints leads to my final estimate.

Final: 13%
