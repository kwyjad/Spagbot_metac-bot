### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Max Intraday VIX, Last Two Weeks of the Year (2010-2024).** This period often features lower trading volume, which can either dampen volatility or exacerbate it on unexpected news.
    -   **Base Rate:** The median maximum intraday VIX in this period over the last 15 years is approximately **22.5**. The range is wide, from a low of ~15 in quiet years (e.g., 2017) to a high of ~36 during the late 2018 market correction. The distribution has a significant right tail.
    -   **Reasoning:** This is the most direct historical analogue for the specific calendar period.
-   **Reference Class 2: Max Intraday VIX in Periods Following a Pivotal Fed Meeting (Post-2010).** This class captures market reactions after significant monetary policy decisions or shifts in guidance.
    -   **Base Rate:** In the two weeks following a highly anticipated Fed meeting where the outcome was uncertain or surprising, the VIX has shown a tendency to spike. A ballpark median max value is around **28**, with spikes occasionally exceeding 40 if the Fed's action signals a major economic shift.
    -   **Reasoning:** The provided sources frame the December 2025 Fed meeting as a pivotal event, making this a relevant behavioral reference class.
-   **Limitations:** Historical data may not fully capture the current unique macroeconomic environment (e.g., post-pandemic inflation dynamics). Low holiday liquidity is a consistent but unpredictable variable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-12-08] Kiplinger/STL.News articles note the VIX has jumped in caution ahead of the final Fed meeting of 2025, with markets in "wait-and-see" mode. — ↑ — Matters because it shows heightened current sensitivity and nervousness around the Fed decision.
-   [2025-12-05] Thrivent Mutual Funds market update highlights the "return of stock volatility" and the market's expectation of a December rate cut due to sticky inflation. — ↑ — Matters because it confirms a recent shift away from the low-volatility regime and frames the Fed's decision as complex.
-   [2025-09-17] Moomoo reports the VIX hit its lowest point since early 2025 due to confidence in a dovish Fed, but warns of "unmet expectations" risk. — ↑/↓ — Matters because it establishes the baseline of low volatility for much of the year but explicitly identifies the key risk factor for a spike.
-   [2025-09-16] Capital.com's forecast highlights Fed policy, recession risks, and geopolitics as key drivers for 2025, reinforcing the major themes. — ↑ — Matters because it provides a broader context of ongoing risks that could fuel a volatility event.
-   [2025-07-01] J.P. Morgan's mid-year outlook pointed to increased macroeconomic volatility for H2 2025 due to policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks. — ↑ — Matters because this institutional forecast set the stage for a more volatile environment in the period in question.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Federal Reserve Policy Decision (Large):** The outcome of the December Fed meeting is the primary driver. A decision that disappoints the market (e.g., no cut, a hawkish statement) would likely cause a significant VIX spike. An expected cut with dovish language would suppress it.
-   **Economic Data Surprises (Moderate-to-Large):** Any key inflation (CPI, PCE) or employment data released just before or during the period that contradicts the narrative justifying the Fed's decision could trigger a sharp repricing and VIX spike.
-   **Geopolitical Shocks (Large):** An unexpected negative geopolitical event (e.g., escalation of a conflict, major terrorist attack) is a constant background risk that can cause an immediate, sharp VIX spike, especially in thin holiday markets.
-   **Year-End Market Dynamics (Small-to-Moderate):** Low liquidity during the holiday season can amplify price swings on any news. Institutional portfolio rebalancing or tax-loss harvesting can also add to short-term volatility.
-   **Underlying Economic Health (Moderate):** The "sticky inflation" and potential recession risks mentioned in sources mean the market is sensitive to any signs of weakening corporate health or consumer demand, which could cause a flight to safety.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Singular Event Focus:** Unlike a typical year-end, the market's attention is intensely focused on a single, binary event—the December Fed meeting—which occurs immediately before the forecast period. This concentrates risk, making the reaction potentially more severe than in a period with diffuse news flow.
-   **High-Stakes Expectations:** The market has a strong consensus expectation for a rate cut. The base rate for holiday periods doesn't typically have such a clear, widely-held, and fragile precondition for calm. A disappointment would be a significant violation of expectations.
-   **Contradictory Pressures:** The Fed is expected to cut rates due to "sticky inflation" (per Thrivent), which is an unusual and potentially unstable justification. Typically, cuts are for slowing growth or falling inflation. This internal tension adds to uncertainty.
-   **Pre-Existing Jitters:** The VIX has already started to rise ahead of the meeting (per Kiplinger), indicating the market is not complacent. This contrasts with many past holiday periods that began from a state of low, stable volatility.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the historical median max VIX for the late-December period (~22.5), but with a wide, right-skewed distribution reflecting the possibility of tail events (equivalent n≈10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) The forecast period's volatility is contingent on the outcome of a pivotal Fed meeting, where a consensus expectation for a cut creates a high risk of a sharp negative surprise ("unmet expectations").
    -   (↑ Moderate) Recent commentary from J.P. Morgan and Thrivent explicitly forecasts/notes a return to higher volatility in late 2025, shifting the baseline environment.
    -   (↑ Small) The VIX has already shown sensitivity by rising ahead of the meeting, indicating a lower threshold for a spike.
    -   (↓ Moderate) If the Fed delivers the expected rate cut and dovish guidance, the resolution of uncertainty would be a powerful downward force on the VIX, potentially leading to a very quiet holiday period.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the distribution of possible outcomes has fatter tails than the historical base rate. The risk is asymmetric to the upside. The posterior median should be moved moderately higher (e.g., to the 24-26 range), with a significantly increased probability assigned to values above 30.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   The FOMC statement (mid-December) is hawkish, or the Fed holds rates steady.
    -   Key inflation data (e.g., CPI, PCE) released before Dec 22 comes in significantly above expectations.
    -   A major credit event or negative pre-announcement from a bellwether company.
    -   Sudden escalation in a major geopolitical conflict.
    -   A sharp, unexplained rise in Treasury yields.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The Fed cuts rates by 25bps as expected and the statement is interpreted as dovish.
    -   Inflation data comes in at or below expectations, confirming the Fed's rationale.
    -   Major market indices break out to new highs post-Fed meeting, confirming a risk-on mood.
    -   Trading volumes fall sharply after the Fed meeting with no follow-on news.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Binary Outcome:** The forecast is highly dependent on the outcome of a single event (the Fed meeting). The analysis of the *reaction* is key, not just the event itself.
-   **Holiday Illiquidity:** This is a double-edged sword. It can mean nothing happens, or a small piece of news can cause an outsized move. This makes precise prediction difficult.
-   **Geopolitical "Black Swans":** Unforecastable by nature, these events are a primary driver of extreme VIX spikes and represent a constant source of model error.
-   **VIX Mean Reversion:** The VIX tends to revert to its mean (~19-20). A spike may be sharp but short-lived. The question asks for the *maximum intraday* value, which is designed to capture the peak of such a spike.
-   **Source Interpretation:** The provided sources are hypothetical snippets. The real-world information environment would be richer and potentially contain conflicting signals not represented here.

Final Research Summary: The maximum VIX during this period is overwhelmingly contingent on the market's reaction to the December Fed meeting. While an expected rate cut could ensure a calm holiday season, the current nervous sentiment and high expectations create a significant, asymmetric risk of a sharp VIX spike (to 30+) if the Fed disappoints.

To forecast the maximum intraday value of the VIX for the period from December 22, 2025, to January 2, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1**: The median maximum intraday VIX for the last two weeks of the year (2010-2024) is approximately 22.5, with a range from ~15 to ~36. This period often features lower trading volume, which can either dampen volatility or exacerbate it on unexpected news.
   - **Reference Class 2**: In periods following pivotal Fed meetings, the median max VIX is around 28, with spikes occasionally exceeding 40.
   - **Chosen Base Rate**: Given the timing and context, the base rate should be a blend of these two, with a median around 25, reflecting both the typical year-end behavior and the potential for heightened volatility due to the Fed meeting.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities**: The period includes the typical year-end dynamics of low liquidity and potential for volatility spikes.
   - **Differences**: The upcoming Fed meeting is a singular, high-stakes event that could significantly impact market sentiment, unlike typical year-end periods.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Fed Meeting Sensitivity**: The market's heightened sensitivity to the Fed meeting increases the likelihood of a VIX spike if expectations are not met. This suggests a higher likelihood of values above the base rate.
   - **Recent Volatility Trends**: Recent reports indicate a return to higher volatility, supporting an upward adjustment.
   - **Potential for Calm**: If the Fed meets expectations with a dovish cut, the VIX could remain subdued, suggesting a downward pressure.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior**: Start with a median of 25, reflecting the historical base rate with a right-skewed distribution.
   - **Evidence Impact**: The likelihood of a significant spike due to the Fed meeting and recent volatility trends suggests shifting the median upward to around 27, with increased probability for values above 30.
   - **Posterior**: The distribution is adjusted to reflect a higher median and increased right tail, accounting for the asymmetric risk of a spike.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of overestimating the impact of the Fed meeting. The market could react calmly if the decision aligns with expectations.
   - **Alternative Scenarios**: A dovish Fed decision could lead to a very quiet period, pulling the median back toward the lower 20s.
   - **Tail Risks**: Geopolitical events or unexpected economic data could further skew the distribution upward.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the potential for a significant VIX spike while considering the possibility of a calm period if the Fed meets expectations.

P10: 20  
P20: 23  
P40: 26  
P60: 28  
P80: 32  
P90: 36

# Forecasting Maximum Intraday VIX Value for Dec 22 - Jan 2, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two primary reference classes for my base rate:

1. **Holiday Period VIX Maximums (2010-2024)**: The median maximum intraday VIX during the final two weeks of December is approximately 22.5, with a range from about 15 in calm years to 36 during market stress periods like 2018. This distribution is right-skewed.

2. **Post-Fed Meeting VIX Reactions**: When a pivotal Fed meeting precedes the holiday period, the median maximum intraday VIX tends to be higher, around 28, with occasional spikes above 40 if the Fed surprises markets.

For my prior, I'll use a right-skewed distribution with a median of 23, a 10th percentile around 17, and a 90th percentile around 35, reflecting the historical tendency for this period to have moderate volatility with the possibility of significant spikes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The period occurs during typical end-of-year low liquidity conditions
- It follows a Fed meeting, which is a common calendar feature
- Normal seasonal patterns of portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting apply

**Key differences:**
- Heightened focus on a single binary event (December Fed meeting) immediately preceding the period
- Strong market consensus for a rate cut creates asymmetric risk if expectations are unmet
- VIX has already begun rising ahead of the meeting, indicating pre-existing nervousness
- Unusual economic context of "sticky inflation" creating contradictory pressures on Fed policy
- J.P. Morgan and other sources explicitly forecast higher volatility for late 2025

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast higher:**
- The VIX has already jumped in caution ahead of the Fed meeting (Kiplinger/STL.News) - This suggests markets are nervous, making a likelihood ratio of ~1.5x for higher values
- Thrivent notes "return of stock volatility" and market expectation of a rate cut due to sticky inflation - This unusual combination increases likelihood of higher values by ~1.7x
- Moomoo explicitly warns of "unmet expectations" risk despite low VIX earlier in 2025 - This identified risk factor increases likelihood of higher values by ~2x
- J.P. Morgan's mid-year outlook pointed to increased volatility for H2 2025 - This institutional forecast increases likelihood of higher values by ~1.3x

**Evidence pushing forecast lower:**
- If the Fed delivers the expected rate cut with dovish guidance, uncertainty resolution could lead to a quiet period - This decreases likelihood of higher values by ~0.6x

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 23, I'll update based on the key evidence:

1. **Update on pre-meeting VIX jump and nervousness:**
   - Prior median: 23
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.5x for higher values
   - Posterior median shifts to ~25

2. **Update on "unmet expectations" risk:**
   - Prior median (after first update): 25
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2x for higher values
   - Posterior median shifts to ~27

3. **Update on possibility of Fed meeting resolving uncertainty positively:**
   - Prior median (after second update): 27
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.6x for higher values
   - Posterior median shifts to ~25

The net effect is a posterior distribution with:
- Median around 25 (higher than historical average)
- Wider right tail (increased probability of values above 30)
- 10th percentile around 18 (slightly higher than prior)
- 90th percentile around 38 (higher than prior)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the importance of the Fed meeting, as markets could have already priced in various outcomes
- I might be underestimating the calming effect of low holiday trading volumes
- I haven't fully accounted for potential geopolitical shocks that could occur during this period
- The research report doesn't provide quantitative data on current VIX levels or recent trends

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a forecast centered lower (around 21-22) based on:
- Historical tendency for year-end periods to be calm
- Market participants may have already hedged against Fed disappointment
- Low liquidity could dampen rather than amplify volatility

However, this alternative seems less plausible given the explicit warnings about volatility in the research report and the noted pre-meeting VIX jump.

**Adjustments:**
I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for uncertainty about geopolitical risks and the true state of market positioning, while maintaining the elevated median.

Answering the user's question based on the provided instructions.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
My primary base rate is the distribution of the maximum intraday VIX during the last two weeks of the year, using the period from 2010-2024 as the reference class. This is the most direct historical analogue for the specified time frame. According to the research report, this reference class has a median of approximately **22.5** and a range from a low of ~15 to a high of ~36. The distribution is right-skewed, as VIX spikes during panics are much larger in magnitude than its dips during calm periods. A secondary, context-specific reference class is the VIX behavior following pivotal Federal Reserve meetings, which tends to have a higher median (~28) and fatter tails. My prior will be anchored on the primary base rate but will incorporate the higher variance suggested by the secondary one.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that it occurs during the year-end holiday period, which is typically characterized by low trading liquidity. However, it differs in several crucial ways:
-   **Concentrated Event Risk:** Unlike a typical year-end, market volatility is highly contingent on a single, discrete event: the December Fed meeting, which occurs immediately before the forecast period.
-   **Fragile Expectations:** The market has a strong consensus expectation for a rate cut. This creates an asymmetric risk profile, where a disappointment could trigger a much sharper negative reaction than the positive reaction to an expected outcome.
-   **Elevated Starting Point:** The research notes that the VIX has already risen in anticipation of the meeting, suggesting the market is more nervous than in a typical year-end period. This raises the likely floor for the maximum VIX.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact:
-   **Pivotal Fed Meeting (Large Impact, Increases Variance):** The high-stakes nature of the Fed meeting, with a strong consensus for a rate cut, makes extreme outcomes more likely. A disappointing (hawkish) outcome would likely cause a VIX spike into the 30s or even 40s. An expected (dovish) outcome would resolve uncertainty and likely lead to a low VIX max, perhaps in the 15-22 range. This evidence strongly suggests a bimodal or at least very wide distribution with fat tails, skewed to the upside.
-   **Shift to Higher Volatility Regime (Moderate Upward Shift):** Commentary from J.P. Morgan and Thrivent indicates that the market environment in H2 2025 is expected to be more volatile than in H1. This shifts the entire expected distribution of the VIX to the right, making values below 20 less likely and values above 25 more likely, even in a "calm" scenario.
-   **Pre-existing Jitters (Small Upward Shift):** The report that the VIX has "jumped in caution" ahead of the meeting suggests the market's baseline anxiety is already elevated. This trims the extreme left tail of the distribution, making a maximum VIX below 16 less probable.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
I start with a prior distribution centered on the historical holiday median of ~22.5, with a right skew. I then update this based on the evidence. The most significant update comes from the binary nature of the Fed meeting. I can conceptualize the posterior as a mixture of two scenarios:
1.  **Dovish Resolution (~60% probability):** The Fed delivers the expected cut, and volatility subsides. The max VIX distribution in this world is centered around ~20.
2.  **Hawkish Disappointment (~40% probability):** The Fed holds rates or issues a hawkish statement, causing a market sell-off and a VIX spike. The max VIX distribution here is centered much higher, around ~32.

Blending these two scenarios (0.6 * 20 + 0.4 * 32 = 24.8) pushes the overall median of my posterior distribution up from the base rate of 22.5 to around **24-25**. More importantly, it dramatically increases the variance and right skew. The probability of seeing a VIX max above 30 is now substantial.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily dependent on the market's reaction to a single event. A key risk is that I have misjudged the probabilities of the Fed's action or the market's subsequent reaction.
-   **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is that the Fed meeting is a "nothingburger." The decision is perfectly priced in, and the holiday doldrums take over immediately, leading to an exceptionally calm period with a max VIX below 20. This would imply the market is more efficient at pricing in the Fed than I've assumed.
-   **Rebuttal:** While possible, the provided evidence of "pre-existing jitters" and a general shift to a "higher volatility regime" makes a completely placid outcome less likely. Furthermore, even an expected Fed cut could be a "sell the news" event if investors worry it signals underlying economic weakness, which also points to upside risk for the VIX.
-   **Tail Risks:** A geopolitical shock or a credit event during the low-liquidity holiday window could cause a VIX spike that is completely unrelated to the Fed. This risk is always present and justifies maintaining a very fat right tail in the forecast (a high P90). I will ensure my P80 and P90 values reflect the potential for a spike well into the 30s or low 40s.
