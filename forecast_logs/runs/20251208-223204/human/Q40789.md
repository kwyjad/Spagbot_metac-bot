### Reference class & base rates
-   **Full History of the Index (1997-Present):** The most direct reference class is the entire history of the FRED series BAMLH0A0HYM2.
    -   **Mean:** 5.22% (as cited in sources). This reflects a mix of economic expansions, recessions, and crises.
    -   **Median:** 4.55%. The median is lower than the mean, indicating the distribution is right-skewed by periods of extreme stress (e.g., 2008, 2020).
    -   **Range:** The historical high is 21.82% (Dec 2008) and the low is 2.41% (June 2007). The current level is near the historical low.
-   **Non-Recessionary Periods:** A more tailored reference class would exclude major recessions (e.g., 2001-02, 2008-09, 2020). In these periods, the spread typically trades in a lower range.
    -   **Ballpark Range:** Approximately 3.0% to 5.5%. The current value of ~2.85% is at the very bottom of this typical "good times" range.
-   **Late Q4 / Early Q1 Periods:** Historically, this period can experience lower liquidity, which can either suppress volatility (if there is no news) or amplify it (if a shock occurs). There is no strong, consistent directional base rate for this specific biweekly period, but increased variance is a plausible feature.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The forecast horizon is very short (<3 months), so the last 6 months are most relevant. The provided sources are all from December 2025, capturing the most immediate context.

-   [2025-12-08] Advisor Perspectives commentary notes spreads ended November at 2.7%, well below the 20-year average of 4.9%. — **(↑)** — Highlights that investors are not being well-compensated for risk, suggesting spreads are more likely to rise than fall further.
-   [2025-12-08] TradingEconomics reports the December 2025 value at 2.89%, near the historical low. — **(↔)** — Establishes the current very low baseline for the forecast period.
-   [2025-12-05] The official FRED series (BAMLH0A0HYM2) closes at 2.85%. — **(↔)** — This is the most direct and recent data point, anchoring the starting point for the forecast.
-   [2025-06-24] A Lord Abbett report noted the high-yield market's resilience, citing improved credit quality and sound fundamentals. — **(↓)** — Provides the fundamental justification for why spreads have become and remained so tight through 2025.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Economic Growth Outlook:** Market expectations for GDP growth, employment, and corporate earnings are primary drivers. Stronger growth expectations reduce default risk and compress spreads. A negative outlook widens them. (Size: Large)
-   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** Unexpected changes in the Fed funds rate or forward guidance directly impact borrowing costs and risk appetite. A hawkish surprise would likely widen spreads. (Size: Large)
-   **Corporate Default Rate Trajectory:** The actual and forecasted rate of corporate defaults is a core component of the spread. A sudden increase in defaults or a high-profile bankruptcy would cause spreads to widen significantly. (Size: Large)
-   **Market Sentiment & Risk Aversion:** Broader market sentiment, often measured by indicators like the VIX, heavily influences demand for risky assets. A "risk-off" event would cause a flight to safety, widening high-yield spreads. (Size: Moderate to Large, especially short-term)
-   **Year-End Market Liquidity:** Trading volumes typically decline in late December. This can lead to price stability if no news emerges, but can also cause exaggerated moves on any unexpected catalyst. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extremely Low Starting Point:** The current spread of ~2.85% is in the bottom ~5% of its historical range and significantly below the long-term average (~5.2%) and median (~4.5%). There is very little room for further compression.
-   **Asymmetric Risk Profile:** Given the low starting point, the potential for spreads to widen is much greater than the potential for them to tighten further. The market is priced for continued economic stability.
-   **Implied Economic Stability:** Unlike the full historical base rate, which includes multiple recessions, the current market pricing reflects a strong consensus of a "soft landing" or continued stable growth, with low default risk priced in.
-   **High Underlying Credit Quality:** As noted in the June 2025 source, the resilience of the high-yield market has been supported by fundamentally stronger corporate balance sheets and improved credit quality within the index compared to past cycles.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior distribution centered near the most recent reading of **2.85%** seems appropriate. Given the proximity to historical lows and the potential for sharp reversals, this prior should be right-skewed (e.g., a log-normal or gamma distribution). The strength should be moderate (equivalent n of ~15-20), reflecting confidence in the current regime but acknowledging its fragility.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓) **Resilient Fundamentals:** Evidence of strong corporate health and credit quality supports spreads remaining tight. (Magnitude: Moderate)
    -   (↔) **Market Momentum:** The trend in H2 2025 has been stable and tight, suggesting inertia will keep spreads in the current range absent a shock. (Magnitude: Moderate)
    -   (↑) **Valuation Risk:** Spreads are historically low, offering minimal compensation for risk. This creates a fragile equilibrium where any negative news could trigger a significant widening. (Magnitude: Moderate)
    -   (↑) **Year-End Illiquidity:** Reduced market depth increases the potential for a sharp upward move if a negative catalyst emerges. (Magnitude: Small, but increases variance)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is balanced for the central tendency but points to asymmetric risk. The posterior mean should remain very close to the prior of ~2.85-2.95%. However, the posterior distribution should have a fatter right tail than the prior to account for the heightened risk of a sharp upward move.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    -   Any surprise hawkish commentary from the December FOMC meeting.
    -   A sharp spike in the VIX index above 20.
    -   Unexpectedly high inflation data (CPI/PCE) that challenges the "stable" narrative.
    -   Negative pre-announcements for Q4 2025 corporate earnings.
    -   A significant credit event (e.g., a large, unexpected bankruptcy filing).
-   **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten/stay low):**
    -   Continued low readings on the VIX and other risk gauges.
    -   Dovish FOMC statement or press conference.
    -   Economic data (e.g., jobs, ISM) that reinforces the "soft landing" or stable growth scenario.
    -   Absence of any negative market shocks through the thinly traded holiday period.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Asymmetry:** The distribution of spreads is not normal. They are floored near zero but have a long right tail. A forecast based on a normal distribution will underestimate the probability of a large spike.
-   **Year-End Illiquidity:** The final reading could be influenced by low trading volumes, potentially making it an unrepresentative "noisy" print.
-   **Event Risk:** The short forecast horizon is highly susceptible to unpredictable events (geopolitical, financial, etc.). The current low-spread environment is particularly vulnerable to such shocks.
-   **Fragility of Complacency:** The market's current pricing reflects a high degree of confidence. A shift in this narrative could lead to a rapid and non-linear repricing of risk.
-   **Resolution Specifics:** The resolution depends on the *last available daily value* for the period. A sharp move on the final day (e.g., Friday, Jan 2, 2026) could determine the outcome, even if the average for the period was different.

### Final Research Summary
The high-yield spread enters the final weeks of 2025 at a very low level (~2.85%), supported by strong fundamentals and a stable economic outlook. While the most probable outcome is a value near this current level, the risk is skewed asymmetrically to the upside due to minimal risk compensation and potential for illiquidity-driven volatility.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the biweekly period of December 22, 2025, to January 2, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical average of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS from 1997 to present is a suitable base rate. The mean is 5.22%, and the median is 4.55%, indicating a right-skewed distribution due to periods of economic stress.
- **Current Context:** The current spread is around 2.85%, which is near historical lows and below the non-recessionary range of 3.0% to 5.5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current spread is consistent with periods of economic stability and low default risk, similar to non-recessionary periods.
- **Difference:** The current spread is at the lower end of historical ranges, indicating a potential for upward movement if economic conditions change or if market sentiment shifts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Resilient Fundamentals (↓):** Strong corporate health supports tight spreads.
- **Market Momentum (↔):** Stability in H2 2025 suggests spreads may remain in the current range.
- **Valuation Risk (↑):** Historically low spreads suggest potential for widening if risk perception changes.
- **Year-End Illiquidity (↑):** Reduced liquidity could lead to volatility, increasing the likelihood of spread widening.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 2.85%, reflecting current levels.
- **Evidence:** While fundamentals support stability, valuation risk and illiquidity suggest a potential for upward movement.
- **Posterior:** The mean remains near 2.85-2.95%, but with a fatter right tail to account for the risk of a sharp increase.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risk:** The forecast should account for the possibility of unexpected economic or geopolitical events.
- **Tail Risks:** Given the low starting point, the potential for a significant increase is greater than for a decrease.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A dovish Fed or continued economic stability could keep spreads low, but this is less likely given the current low compensation for risk.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 2.80  
P20: 2.85  
P40: 2.90  
P60: 3.00  
P80: 3.20  
P90: 3.50

# Forecasting the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Dec 22 - Jan 2, 2025-26

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the recent history of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS, with emphasis on the most current data:
- Current value (Dec 2025): 2.85-2.89% (from multiple sources)
- Long-term historical average: 5.22%
- Long-term historical median: 4.55%
- Historical range: 2.41% (June 2007) to 21.82% (Dec 2008)

Given the short forecast horizon (just a few weeks), I'll center my prior distribution around the current value of 2.85%, with a right-skewed distribution to account for the asymmetric nature of credit spreads (they can spike quickly but compress slowly).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're in a period of economic stability, similar to other non-recessionary periods
- Corporate fundamentals appear strong, supporting tight spreads
- No immediate signs of financial stress in the market

**Differences from base rate:**
- Current spread (2.85%) is extremely low - in the bottom 5% of historical range
- We're forecasting for a holiday period (Dec 22-Jan 2) which typically has lower liquidity
- The spread has almost no room to compress further but significant room to widen
- The asymmetric risk profile is more pronounced than usual given the starting point

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for stable/tighter spreads:**
- Recent market momentum shows spreads remaining tight through late 2025
- Lord Abbett report highlighted improved credit quality and sound fundamentals
- Absence of recent negative catalysts suggests market stability

**Evidence for wider spreads:**
- Current spread (2.85%) is well below the 20-year average of 4.9%, suggesting limited value
- Year-end illiquidity could amplify any negative news
- The holiday period can experience unexpected volatility if any negative catalysts emerge

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered at 2.85% with a right-skewed distribution:

- **Update 1:** The extremely low starting point (2.85%) relative to historical averages (5.22%) suggests mean reversion pressure. This shifts my posterior slightly upward.
- **Update 2:** The year-end holiday period introduces additional variance due to lower liquidity. This widens my distribution, particularly on the upside.
- **Update 3:** Strong corporate fundamentals (Lord Abbett report) provide some downward pressure, partially offsetting the mean reversion tendency.

The resulting posterior has:
- A median slightly above the current 2.85% (around 2.95%)
- A wider right tail to account for spike risk
- Limited downside potential given the already compressed spreads

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the likelihood of mean reversion in such a short time frame
- I might be underestimating the market's ability to maintain extremely tight spreads
- The forecast period is very short (2 weeks), limiting the probability of major moves

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Bullish scenario:** Strong year-end rally in risk assets pushes spreads even tighter, to new historical lows (~2.4%)
- **Bearish scenario:** An unexpected credit event during low liquidity causes spreads to spike to 4-5%
- **Extreme tail risk:** A major financial shock causes a dramatic widening to 7%+ (very low probability)

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should ensure my lower percentiles don't compress too much given the historical floor
- I should maintain a fat right tail to account for spike risk

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 2.65%
P20: 2.75%
P40: 2.90%
P60: 3.10%
P80: 3.45%
P90: 3.90%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate for the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) is its own history since 1997, as tracked by the FRED series BAMLH0A0HYM2. This long-term view provides a comprehensive picture of the spread's behavior across various economic cycles.

*   **Mean:** The long-term historical mean is approximately 5.22%.
*   **Median:** The median is lower, at 4.55%, indicating the distribution is right-skewed by infrequent but severe credit crises (e.g., 2008, 2020).
*   **Spread/Range:** The historical range is vast, from a low of 2.41% (June 2007) to a high of 21.82% (December 2008).

A more refined reference class for the current environment is the behavior of the spread during non-recessionary periods. In these times, the spread typically trades in a much lower range, roughly between 3.0% and 5.5%. This "calm regime" base rate is more relevant than the full history, given the current economic context.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from the long-term base rate in one critical aspect: the starting point. As of early December 2025, the spread is approximately 2.85%.

*   **Similarity:** The current economic environment, characterized by stable growth and strong corporate fundamentals (as noted in the June 2025 Lord Abbett report), is similar to the "calm regime" reference class.
*   **Difference:** The current value of ~2.85% is at the very bottom of even this "calm regime" range and is in the lowest decile of its entire history. This is a crucial difference because it creates a strong asymmetry. There is very little room for spreads to compress further (the all-time low is 2.41%), but there is substantial room for them to widen if sentiment shifts. The market is priced for continued stability, making it vulnerable to negative surprises.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to adjust the prior distribution.

*   **Recent Data & Momentum (Anchor):** The most recent reading is 2.85%. Over a short forecast horizon (<1 month), market inertia is a powerful force. This strongly suggests the central tendency of the forecast should be very close to the current level. This is the strongest piece of evidence for the median outcome.
*   **Strong Fundamentals (Likelihood shifts down/narrows variance):** The June 2025 report highlighting resilient corporate credit quality provides a fundamental justification for why spreads are tight. This evidence supports the idea that spreads can remain low and reduces the probability of a spontaneous widening without a catalyst. It makes lower outcomes more likely than they would be otherwise.
*   **Valuation & Asymmetry (Likelihood shifts up/skews right):** The December 2025 commentary notes that spreads are well below their long-term average, implying investors are not being well-compensated for risk. This is a powerful argument for mean reversion. Given the low starting point, any negative news is likely to have a much larger upward impact on spreads than positive news would have a downward impact. This evidence dramatically increases the likelihood of higher outcomes relative to lower ones, creating a right skew.
*   **Year-End Illiquidity (Likelihood increases variance):** The forecast period (Dec 22 - Jan 2) is known for low trading liquidity. This can amplify moves on any unexpected news. While it could mean a quiet market if no news emerges, it increases the probability of a sharp move (a "gap up") in response to a negative catalyst. This fattens the tails of the distribution, particularly the right tail.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My reasoning follows a conceptual Bayesian update:

*   **Prior:** I start with a prior distribution anchored at the current level of **2.85%**. Given the proximity to the historical floor, this prior is already slightly right-skewed.
*   **Likelihood (Evidence):** I combine the likelihoods from the evidence. The strong fundamentals support the low anchor point. However, the evidence from valuation, asymmetry, and illiquidity provides a strong multiplicative factor for higher outcomes. For example, a negative shock that might normally widen spreads by 30 bps could widen them by 60 bps in this environment. This means the likelihood function is skewed, favoring values above the current level.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution's median (P50) remains close to the starting point, perhaps nudged slightly higher to ~2.95%, reflecting the balance of forces. However, the distribution becomes significantly right-skewed. The mean is pulled further to the right of the median, and the distance between the 90th and 50th percentiles will be much larger than the distance between the 50th and 10th percentiles.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must challenge my own forecast.

*   **Alternative Forecast: "The Calm Before the Calm."** What if nothing happens? The holiday period is exceptionally quiet, and the spread ends the period almost exactly where it started. This is a very high-probability scenario, and my central percentiles (P40-P60) should be tightly clustered around the current 2.85% to reflect this.
*   **Alternative Forecast: "Risk-Off Shock."** What if a negative event occurs in the illiquid market? A geopolitical event, a surprise Fed comment, or a credit event could cause a rapid flight to safety. A move of 100-150 basis points (to ~3.85-4.35%) is not unprecedented in a few weeks during a risk-off period. My P90 must be high enough to account for this plausible tail risk. A value around 4.00% seems appropriate to capture such an event.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My main risk is underestimating the right tail. The current low-volatility, low-spread environment can breed complacency. I have explicitly made the distribution right-skewed to counter this, with the P80-P90 range being much wider than the P10-P20 range. The P90 at 4.00% represents a significant (+115 bps) but historically plausible shock.

This red-teaming exercise confirms the need for a tight central distribution but with a fat right tail, which is reflected in my final percentiles.
