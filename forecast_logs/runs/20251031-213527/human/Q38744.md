### Reference class & base rates
1.  **ZANU-PF Leadership Tenures:** Zimbabwe has had only two leaders since 1980. Robert Mugabe ruled for 37 years, and was only removed via an intra-party coup when he was 93. Emmerson Mnangagwa has been in power for 8 years. This reference class suggests extreme leader durability. The base rate of a ZANU-PF leader being removed in any given two-month period is exceptionally low, likely <1%, based on one removal event in over 45 years of party rule.
2.  **Sub-Saharan African Incumbents (Non-Democratic Regimes):** Leaders in such regimes face a persistent, low-level risk of removal through coups or elite pacts. Data from Powell & Thyne's coup dataset shows roughly 4-5 successful coups per year in Africa on average over the last two decades. Spread across ~50 countries, this suggests a ~10% annual risk per country, or a ~1.7% risk in any given two-month period. This is a broader, more volatile class than ZANU-PF alone.
3.  **Leaders Over 80 in Semi-Authoritarian States:** Actuarial risk becomes a significant factor. Mnangagwa will be 83 years old. The base rate for mortality/severe incapacitation for an 83-year-old male over a two-month period is non-trivial, estimated at approximately 0.5-1.0%, though this is likely lower for a head of state with access to premium healthcare.

*Reasoning:* The most specific class (ZANU-PF) suggests high stability, while the broader class (African incumbents) suggests a higher risk of disruption. The actuarial risk is a small but real floor. A blended prior should anchor on the high stability of ZANU-PF but acknowledge the mechanisms for change seen elsewhere.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-15** Mnangagwa reshuffles provincial ZANU-PF leadership, installing loyalists in key positions in Mashonaland provinces. — ↑ — A classic move to consolidate power and preempt challenges from within the party structure.
*   **2025-06-22** Vice President Chiwenga gives a speech at a military commemoration event, emphasizing the army's role as "the ultimate guarantor of the revolution." — ↓ — Widely interpreted as a veiled warning to Mnangagwa and a reminder of the military's power, echoing the rhetoric used before the 2017 coup.
*   **2025-08-18** ZANU-PF Politburo meeting concludes with a public declaration of "unwavering support" for President Mnangagwa, but fails to discipline war veteran leaders who have been critical. — (neutral) — The public statement supports the incumbent, but the inaction against dissenters signals internal division and Mnangagwa's potential weakness.
*   **2025-09-05** The Zimbabwean dollar experiences another sharp devaluation, leading to protests by civil service unions over salaries. — ↓ — Economic instability erodes Mnangagwa's popular standing and provides a pretext for elites to argue he is failing to govern effectively.
*   **2025-10-12** Reports circulate, later denied, that Mnangagwa traveled to Dubai for unscheduled medical treatment. — ↓ — Health rumors, whether true or not, can create a perception of weakness and accelerate succession plotting among rivals.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Intra-Party "Coup" (The 2017 Playbook):** The most plausible removal mechanism. Key elites within ZANU-PF and the military decide Mnangagwa is a liability and force his resignation. This would likely be led by VP Chiwenga. (Size: Large)
2.  **Presidential Health:** At 83, a sudden health crisis or death is a real possibility. This would trigger a constitutional succession process, making a VP (likely Chiwenga) acting president. (Size: Small but non-zero)
3.  **Elite Cohesion vs. Fragmentation:** Mnangagwa's survival depends on his ability to manage ZANU-PF factions through patronage and coercion. The public dissent from war veterans shows this cohesion is fracturing. Further high-level defections would be a critical signal. (Size: Large)
4.  **Economic Crisis:** Hyperinflation and economic mismanagement provide the backdrop and justification for a leadership challenge. A sudden worsening (e.g., fuel or food shortages) could be a catalyst for elite action. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Mnangagwa's Consolidation of Power:** The incumbent is not passive. He actively uses the state security apparatus (CIO) and party structures to monitor and neutralize rivals. His success in these efforts is the primary force for stability. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Recent Precedent for Removal:** Unlike the long period of stability under Mugabe, Zimbabwe has a very recent and successful playbook for a military-backed, intra-party removal of a sitting president (2017). This lowers the activation energy for a similar event.
*   **Challenger from Within:** The primary challenger, Constantino Chiwenga, is not an outside rival but the Vice President and the man who orchestrated the 2017 coup. He is positioned inside the halls of power, unlike typical opposition figures.
*   **Fractured Support Base:** Mnangagwa was brought to power by a coalition of the military and war veterans. The public opposition from the latter group is a significant deviation from the norm, indicating his founding coalition has collapsed.
*   **Extreme Short Horizon:** The key difference moderating all risks is the time frame. A political plot that might unfold over 6-12 months is highly unlikely to reach its conclusion in the next 8 weeks. Only a very rapid, decisive event could change the outcome.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior favoring the incumbent, Mnangagwa, based on the ZANU-PF reference class and the extreme rarity of leadership changes in a two-month window. An equivalent n of ~30, with P(Mnangagwa) ≈ 95%.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ The extremely short time horizon (2 months) is a powerful force for inertia. (Large)
    *   ↓ Public dissent from war veterans, a core ZANU-PF constituency, signals deep elite fracture. (Large)
    *   ↓ VP Chiwenga's clear ambition and position as the 2017 coup leader presents a uniquely potent and credible internal threat. (Moderate)
    *   ↓ Persistent economic crisis provides a permissive environment and justification for a challenge. (Small)
    *   ↑ Mnangagwa's control over state security and demonstrated skill in political maneuvering. (Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of elite fracture and a credible internal challenger is significant and should substantially lower the probability for Mnangagwa compared to the initial prior. The posterior for Mnangagwa should move down significantly, but he should remain the odds-on favorite due to the short time horizon.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favor Mnangagwa):**
    *   High-profile arrests or purges of Chiwenga's allies within the party or military.
    *   A major cabinet reshuffle that demotes or sidelines Chiwenga.
    *   Successful negotiation of a new international loan or credit line, easing economic pressure.
    *   Mnangagwa makes several vigorous, unscripted public appearances.
*   **DOWN indicators (favor a change):**
    *   Unusual or unexplained military deployments around Harare.
    *   Chiwenga or other senior ZANU-PF figures making public statements about "discipline" or "correcting the course of the revolution."
    *   Mnangagwa canceling public appearances or traveling abroad unexpectedly.
    *   The state-run newspaper, *The Herald*, publishing articles subtly critical of government corruption or policy failures.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opacity of ZANU-PF:** Decision-making is highly centralized and secretive. A plot could be far advanced before any public signals emerge.
*   **Rumor Mill:** Harare's political scene is rife with rumors. Differentiating credible signals from deliberate disinformation is extremely difficult.
*   **Succession Uncertainty:** Even if Mnangagwa is removed, the constitution dictates the VP takes over. This would be Chiwenga. The question is whether he would be formally appointed President by Jan 1, 2026, or remain "Acting President." The resolution criteria would likely count an Acting President.
*   **Black Swan Event:** A sudden health event (death/stroke) would immediately change the outcome in a way that is fundamentally unpredictable.
*   **Grace Mugabe/Kembo Mohadi:** Both are extremely low probability. Mugabe has no power base. Mohadi is a junior VP with little influence compared to Chiwenga. They are effectively noise options.

**Final Research Summary:**
Emmerson Mnangagwa is the strong favorite to be president on January 1, 2026, primarily due to the short two-month time horizon. However, his position is more precarious than a simple base rate would suggest due to a fractured elite, a credible internal challenger in VP Chiwenga, and the recent precedent of the 2017 coup.

To forecast who will be President of Zimbabwe on January 1, 2026, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each candidate.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Emmerson Mnangagwa**: Based on the ZANU-PF leadership tenures, the base rate for a leader remaining in power is very high. Historically, Zimbabwean leaders have shown extreme durability. Given Mnangagwa's current position and the short time frame, a prior probability of around 95% seems reasonable.
  
- **Grace Mugabe**: She has no significant power base or current political influence. The base rate for someone in her position becoming president is extremely low, likely less than 1%.

- **Constantino Chiwenga**: As Vice President and a key figure in the 2017 coup, he is a credible challenger. However, the short time frame and Mnangagwa's current control suggest a lower base rate, perhaps around 3%.

- **Kembo Mohadi**: As a junior VP with little influence, his base rate is very low, similar to Grace Mugabe, likely less than 1%.

- **Someone else**: The probability of an unexpected candidate emerging is low, given the political structure and short time frame. A base rate of around 1% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the entrenched power structures within ZANU-PF and the historical stability of leadership.

- **Differences**: The recent public dissent from war veterans and economic instability are significant deviations, indicating potential vulnerabilities in Mnangagwa's position.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Mnangagwa's Power Consolidation**: His reshuffling of provincial leadership to install loyalists increases the likelihood of him remaining in power (P(E | Mnangagwa) high).

- **Chiwenga's Ambitions**: His speech emphasizing the military's role suggests a credible threat (P(E | Chiwenga) moderate).

- **Economic Instability**: The economic crisis provides a context for potential change, but the short time frame limits its impact (P(E | Mnangagwa) moderate, P(E | Chiwenga) moderate).

- **Health Rumors**: These rumors slightly increase the likelihood of a sudden change, but are not decisive (P(E | Mnangagwa) slightly lower).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Mnangagwa**: Starting with a prior of 95%, the evidence of elite fracture and economic instability reduces his probability. However, his power consolidation efforts and the short time frame maintain him as the favorite. Posterior probability: ~85%.

- **Chiwenga**: Starting with a prior of 3%, the evidence of his ambitions and the fractured elite increases his probability. Posterior probability: ~10%.

- **Grace Mugabe, Kembo Mohadi, Someone else**: The evidence does not significantly alter their low probabilities. Posterior probabilities remain low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The short time frame heavily favors Mnangagwa, but the internal dissent and economic issues are notable risks. Adjusting for these factors is crucial.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: A sudden health crisis or an unexpected coup could shift probabilities dramatically. These are low-probability but high-impact events.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Emmerson Mnangagwa: 85%  
Grace Mugabe: 1%  
Constantino Chiwenga: 10%  
Kembo Mohadi: 1%  
Someone else: 3%  

These probabilities reflect the current political landscape and the short time frame until January 1, 2026.

# Forecasting Zimbabwe's President on January 1, 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each candidate:

**Emerson Mnangagwa (incumbent):**
- Base rate: 85%
- Rationale: Incumbency advantage is extremely strong in Zimbabwe's political system. ZANU-PF has only had two leaders since 1980, with Mugabe ruling for 37 years and Mnangagwa for 8 years so far. Leadership changes are extremely rare, especially in short timeframes. The probability of a ZANU-PF leader being removed in any two-month period is historically <1%.

**Constantino Chiwenga:**
- Base rate: 10%
- Rationale: As current Vice President and former military leader who orchestrated the 2017 coup against Mugabe, Chiwenga is the most plausible successor. He has constitutional standing as VP and military connections that would be crucial in any transition.

**Kembo Mohadi:**
- Base rate: 1%
- Rationale: As a junior Vice President with limited power base compared to Chiwenga, his chances are minimal.

**Grace Mugabe:**
- Base rate: 0.5%
- Rationale: She has effectively no power base since her husband's removal and subsequent death. Her G40 faction was purged from ZANU-PF.

**Someone else:**
- Base rate: 3.5%
- Rationale: This accounts for other ZANU-PF elites or military figures who might emerge in a crisis, as well as opposition figures in an extremely unlikely scenario.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- ZANU-PF remains the dominant political force in Zimbabwe
- The military continues to be the ultimate power broker
- Constitutional mechanisms favor orderly succession to the VP if needed
- Economic challenges persist, as they have throughout Zimbabwe's modern history

**Key differences:**
- War veterans, a crucial support base, are now publicly calling for Mnangagwa's resignation
- At 83, Mnangagwa faces higher health risks than the typical incumbent
- There is a recent precedent for intra-party removal (2017 Mugabe ouster)
- VP Chiwenga has been making statements emphasizing military power
- Economic conditions have worsened with recent currency devaluation
- Rumors about Mnangagwa's health have emerged (unscheduled medical trip to Dubai)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: War veterans calling for Mnangagwa's resignation**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Moderate (0.4) - This could be managed through patronage/coercion
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): High (0.8) - This would be expected before a removal
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 against Mnangagwa

**Evidence: Chiwenga's military commemoration speech**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Moderate (0.5) - Some tension is normal
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): High (0.9) - Signaling to military would precede action
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8:1 against Mnangagwa

**Evidence: ZANU-PF's failure to discipline war veteran critics**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Moderate (0.4) - Shows weakness but not fatal
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): High (0.7) - Indicates eroding party control
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75:1 against Mnangagwa

**Evidence: Currency devaluation and protests**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): High (0.7) - Economic problems are chronic
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): High (0.8) - Slightly more likely in a transition scenario
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14:1 against Mnangagwa

**Evidence: Mnangagwa's reported medical trip**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Moderate (0.5) - Could be routine or minor
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): High (0.8) - More likely if health is failing
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6:1 against Mnangagwa

**Evidence: Short time horizon (only 2 months)**
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): Very low (0.2) - Coups/transitions typically take longer to organize
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Very high (0.9) - Status quo highly favored in short timeframes
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5:1 in favor of Mnangagwa

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with Mnangagwa's prior of 85%:

**Update on war veterans' opposition:**
- Prior odds: 85:15 = 5.67:1
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 against
- Posterior odds: 5.67 ÷ 2 = 2.83:1
- Posterior probability: 2.83/(1+2.83) = 74%

**Update on short time horizon:**
- Prior odds: 74:26 = 2.85:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5:1 in favor
- Posterior odds: 2.85 × 4.5 = 12.83:1
- Posterior probability: 12.83/(1+12.83) = 93%

**Qualitative updates on remaining evidence:**
The combined effect of Chiwenga's speech, ZANU-PF's failure to discipline critics, currency devaluation, and health rumors all push against Mnangagwa, with a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 5:1 against him.

- Prior odds: 93:7 = 13.3:1
- Likelihood ratio: 5:1 against
- Posterior odds: 13.3 ÷ 5 = 2.66:1
- Posterior probability: 2.66/(1+2.66) = 73%

For Chiwenga, the evidence collectively supports his position as the most likely alternative:
- Prior: 10%
- Posterior after considering evidence: ~20%

The remaining candidates see minimal changes due to lack of specific supporting evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which a coup could unfold. The 2017 transition happened rapidly once military action began.
- Health risks for an 83-year-old may be higher than estimated, especially given limited transparency.
- The "Someone else" category deserves more consideration given Zimbabwe's volatile politics.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden health crisis for Mnangagwa could trigger immediate constitutional succession.
- Military action could occur with little warning if elite consensus against Mnangagwa solidifies.
- A compromise candidate (neither Mnangagwa nor Chiwenga) could emerge from factional negotiations.

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce Mnangagwa's probability to account for health risks and coup speed.
- Slightly increase "Someone else" to account for compromise candidates in a crisis.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:

- Mnangagwa: 70%
- Chiwenga: 22%
- Mohadi: 1%
- Grace Mugabe: 0.5%
- Someone else: 6.5%

## 7. Final Forecast

Emerson Mnangagwa: 70%
Constantino Chiwenga: 22%
Kembo Mohadi: 1%
Grace Mugabe: 0.5%
Someone else: 6.5%
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three reference classes:

1.  **ZANU-PF Leadership Stability:** Since 1980, Zimbabwe has had only two leaders. Robert Mugabe was removed after 37 years in a coup, the only instance of an involuntary transfer of power within the ruling party. This gives a base rate of one removal event in approximately 45 years. For a two-month period, this implies an extremely low probability of change, roughly 1 / (45 years * 6 two-month periods) ≈ 0.4%. This suggests a prior for the incumbent, Mnangagwa, of **~99.6%**.

2.  **Sub-Saharan African Autocratic Leaders:** A broader reference class includes leaders in similar political systems. The research report notes a ~10% annual risk of a coup per country in Africa. Over a two-month period (1/6th of a year), this translates to a ~1.7% chance of removal. This suggests a prior for Mnangagwa of **~98.3%**.

3.  **Actuarial Risk:** President Mnangagwa is 83 years old. The base rate mortality/incapacitation risk for a male of this age over two months is non-trivial, estimated at 0.5-1.0%. This acts as a floor for the probability that he is no longer president due to natural causes.

**Synthesized Prior:** I will blend these, anchoring on the more volatile African Autocrat class but acknowledging ZANU-PF's historical stability. I'll set a prior probability of **P(Mnangagwa remains President) = 97%**, which implies a 3% chance of a change for any reason (coup, health, resignation) in the next two months.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Zimbabwe remains a de facto one-party state dominated by ZANU-PF, with a weak and fragmented opposition. The incumbent wields significant control over state security and patronage networks.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Recent Precedent:** The 2017 coup that removed Mugabe provides a successful and recent "playbook" for an internal power transfer, lowering the barrier for a repeat.
    *   **Credible Internal Challenger:** Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the architect of the 2017 coup, is a uniquely positioned and ambitious rival inside the government.
    *   **Fractured Elite:** The public dissent from war veterans, a core pillar of the regime, signals a significant crack in the coalition that brought Mnangagwa to power. This is a major deviation from the historical norm of enforced party discipline.

These differences suggest the current situation is significantly more volatile than the historical base rate implies.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the recent evidence provided in the report against the hypothesis (H) that Mnangagwa remains president.

*   **Evidence (Pro-Mnangagwa):** Mnangagwa's reshuffling of party leadership to install loyalists (May 2025) is evidence of his continued power and active efforts to counter threats. This is more likely to be seen if he successfully remains in power (P(E|H) > P(E|~H)).
*   **Evidence (Anti-Mnangagwa):**
    *   **Chiwenga's Speech (June 2025):** His reminder of the army's role as "guarantor of the revolution" is a veiled threat. This rhetoric is much more likely if a challenge is being prepared (P(E|~H) > P(E|H)).
    *   **Failure to Discipline Dissenters (Aug 2025):** The public declaration of support for Mnangagwa is undermined by the failure to punish his critics. This signals weakness and that his internal authority is contested, a condition more likely if he is vulnerable to removal (P(E|~H) > P(E|H)).
    *   **Health Rumors (Oct 2025):** Rumors of ill health, true or not, create a perception of weakness and accelerate succession plotting. This is a classic precursor to a leadership challenge (P(E|~H) > P(E|H)).

The combined weight of the negative evidence, particularly the elite fracture and Chiwenga's positioning, is significant.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Prior Odds:** P(Mnangagwa) / P(Not Mnangagwa) = 97 / 3 ≈ 32:1.
*   **Conceptual Update:** The evidence of a credible internal challenger, a fractured support base, and signs of incumbent weakness are strong signals of instability. The likelihood ratio of this combined evidence strongly favors the "Not Mnangagwa" outcome. While the short two-month time horizon is a powerful force for inertia, the signals are too clear to ignore. A simple coup plot, if already planned, can be executed very quickly.
*   **Posterior Calculation:** The combined likelihood ratio of the negative evidence (Chiwenga's ambition, elite fracture, perceived weakness) is substantial. I estimate it reduces the odds in favor of Mnangagwa by a factor of 5 to 10. Let's use a factor of 7 for a significant but not overwhelming update.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds / 7 = 32 / 7 ≈ 4.6:1.
    *   Posterior Probability P(Mnangagwa) = 4.6 / (1 + 4.6) ≈ 4.6 / 5.6 ≈ **82%**.

This leaves an 18% probability that Mnangagwa is not president. I will now distribute this probability among the other candidates.

*   **Constantino Chiwenga:** If Mnangagwa is removed via coup, resignation under duress, or incapacitation, Chiwenga is the constitutional and practical successor as the First Vice President. He is the only plausible alternative. I assign ~80% of the remaining probability to him. P(Chiwenga) = 18% * 0.80 = **14.4%**.
*   **Kembo Mohadi:** As the Second VP with a much lower profile and power base, his chances are minimal. He would only ascend if something happened to both Mnangagwa and Chiwenga. I assign a small probability.
*   **Grace Mugabe:** She has no current power base and is politically irrelevant. Her probability is effectively zero.
*   **Someone Else:** This covers scenarios like a dark horse candidate emerging from a ZANU-PF stalemate or a period of unresolved chaos. This is unlikely but possible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 82% for Mnangagwa might still be too high. The 2017 coup demonstrated that once the military decides to act, events can unfold very rapidly. The public signals from war veterans and Chiwenga could be the final stage-setting before a move. An alternative forecast could place Mnangagwa at 70-75%, reflecting a more imminent threat. However, Mnangagwa is a shrewd political operator with his own loyalists in the security services, making him a harder target than Mugabe was. The two-month time frame remains the strongest argument in his favor. My 82% estimate acknowledges the significant risk while still heavily favoring the incumbent due to inertia.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will round and normalize the probabilities based on the reasoning above.

*   **Emmerson Mnangagwa:** 82% (Strong favorite due to incumbency and short timeline, but with significant risk).
*   **Constantino Chiwenga:** 15% (The only credible challenger and successor).
*   **Kembo Mohadi:** 1% (Extremely low probability placeholder).
*   **Someone else:** 2% (Covers chaotic or unexpected outcomes).
*   **Grace Mugabe:** 0% (No plausible path to power).

The sum is 82 + 15 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 100%.

Emmerson Mnangagwa: 82%
Grace Mugabe: 0%
Constantino Chiwenga: 15%
Kembo Mohadi: 1%
Someone else: 2%
