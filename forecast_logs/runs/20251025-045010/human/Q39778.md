### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections (within a regional group):** The standard process is for a regional group to endorse a single candidate. Publicly contested bids are uncommon but not unprecedented. In most cases where a contest emerges, diplomatic negotiations lead to one candidate withdrawing in favor of the other, sometimes in exchange for future considerations (e.g., support for a different position or a future COP bid). A complete deadlock forcing a move to the default location (Bonn) is very rare.
    *   **Base Rate:** Bidder A wins (~45%), Bidder B wins (~45%), Default to Bonn/other compromise (~10%). This reflects that once a contest is established, it's close to a toss-up, with a small but real chance of process failure.
2.  **UN Decisions Requiring Consensus in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG):** WEOG is a highly diverse group (including the US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey). This diversity can make consensus difficult compared to more politically homogenous regional groups. Geopolitical considerations, unrelated to climate, can influence voting and blocking.
    *   **Base Rate:** In such diverse groups, stalemates requiring extended negotiation or resulting in a compromise/default outcome are more common than in unified blocs. The probability of a non-consensus outcome is likely higher than the general UN average.
3.  **Bids from Developed vs. Developing Nations:** While this is an intra-WEOG decision, the framing of the bids matters. Australia's bid is framed as giving a voice to vulnerable Pacific Island nations (a developing world concern), while Turkey's is a more traditional single-nation bid. Bids that align with key UNFCCC narratives like climate justice often garner broad support.
    *   **Base Rate:** Bids with a strong, politically salient narrative (e.g., supporting the most vulnerable) tend to have a higher success rate in building a coalition of support.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-08** Australian government reaffirms its active pursuit of the COP31 bid with Pacific nations. — **↑ Australia** — Shows sustained high-level political commitment and continued investment in the bid's success.
*   **2025-09-03** Australian government website confirms commitment to the bid. — **↑ Australia** — Reinforces that the bid remains a national priority despite the ongoing deadlock.
*   **2024-11-27** Report confirms the decision, expected at COP29, was deferred to June 2025 due to the standoff. — **↓ Australia, ↑ Turkey/Germany** — The most significant recent event. It confirms Turkey's bid is not symbolic and has enough leverage to block the well-supported Australian bid, increasing the probability of a prolonged stalemate or a compromise.
*   **2024-11-20** Media characterizes the situation as a "standoff," noting Australia has "significant support" but is stymied by the consensus rule. — **(neutral)** — Confirms the underlying dynamic: Australia is the likely favorite on raw support, but the process rules give Turkey veto power.
*   **2024-11-01** South Australia's government officially submits Adelaide's bid and allocates budget funding. — **↑ Australia** — Demonstrates concrete, sub-national commitment and logistical readiness, strengthening the credibility of the Australian bid.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** The requirement for unanimity is the single most important driver. It grants any member, including Turkey, the power to veto a proposal. This transforms the decision from a majority vote into a diplomatic negotiation where a single holdout can force a stalemate. (Size: Large)
2.  **Geopolitical Horse-Trading:** The decision may be influenced by unrelated diplomatic issues. Turkey could be using its veto as leverage for concessions from other WEOG members (e.g., EU, US) on other matters. Conversely, Australia's allies may exert pressure on Turkey. (Size: Large)
3.  **Narrative Strength & Climate Diplomacy:** Australia's co-host bid with Pacific nations is a powerful narrative, centering the voices of those most affected by climate change. This resonates strongly with the goals of the UNFCCC and garners significant goodwill, which is a key diplomatic asset. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Risk of Default to Germany:** A deadlock resulting in the conference defaulting to Bonn would be seen as a diplomatic failure for WEOG. This creates pressure on both Australia and Turkey to find a compromise to avoid this undesirable, low-prestige outcome. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Domestic Political Commitment:** The sustained and budgeted support from both the Australian federal and South Australian state governments makes their bid highly credible. A withdrawal would entail political costs, making them more likely to persist in negotiations. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Co-Host with Vulnerable Nations:** The Australia-Pacific partnership model is a significant departure from the typical single-country host. This is a unique strength for the Australian bid compared to a standard reference case.
*   **Publicly Acknowledged Standoff:** Unlike many diplomatic contests that are resolved behind closed doors, this one has resulted in a formal, public delay. This indicates the deadlock is more entrenched than is typical.
*   **Geopolitical Complexity of WEOG:** Turkey's unique geopolitical position—a NATO member with complex relations with the EU and the US—makes this standoff different from a hypothetical contest between, for example, Canada and New Zealand. Its motivations may be less transparent and harder to resolve through typical diplomatic channels.
*   **Significance of COP31:** This COP is not a routine one. It follows the 2025 deadline for new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and will be a critical juncture for assessing progress on the Paris Agreement, raising the stakes and prestige of hosting.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior would start with Australia as the favorite, given its strong narrative and reported support, but account for the significant blocking power of a competitor. E.g., Australia 50%, Turkey 35%, Germany 14%, Other/Pacific Nation 1%. (Equivalent n ≈ 15, moderately confident in the initial structure of the race).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) The formal delay of the decision from Nov 2024 to mid-2025 is strong evidence that the standoff is real and Turkey's opposition is not easily overcome. This significantly reduces Australia's probability from a >50% position. (Large)
    *   (↑) Australia's consistent and financially-backed domestic commitment strengthens its position as a credible and serious bidder, making a unilateral withdrawal less likely. (Small)
    *   (↑) The "significant support" for Australia mentioned in media reports, while not enough to force consensus, suggests it remains the bid with the broadest appeal. (Small)
    *   (↑) The very existence of a protracted deadlock slightly increases the probability of the "process failure" outcome, modestly boosting the chances for Germany. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of a firm deadlock should pull the posterior down for Australia and up for Turkey and Germany. The probabilities for Australia and Turkey should now be seen as much closer to a toss-up, with Australia perhaps retaining a very slight edge due to its broader base of support. The probability for Germany should be modestly increased.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (Australia wins):**
    *   Public statements of support for Australia's bid from major WEOG powers (e.g., US, UK, France, Canada).
    *   Reports of high-level diplomatic meetings between Australia and Turkey.
    *   Rumors or official statements that Turkey is withdrawing its bid, perhaps in exchange for a future COP or another UN position.
    *   A joint statement from WEOG announcing a consensus has been reached ahead of the June 2025 deadline.
*   **DOWN indicators (Australia loses):**
    *   Public statements of support for Turkey's bid from any WEOG members.
    *   Statements from WEOG officials expressing pessimism about reaching consensus by the June 2025 deadline.
    *   Any news suggesting a weakening of Australian domestic political will for the bid.
    *   Official announcement that the conference will be held in Turkey or, in the case of continued deadlock, in Bonn.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Private Negotiations:** The final decision will be a product of closed-door diplomacy. Public statements may be posturing, and the true state of negotiations is opaque.
*   **Veto Power:** The consensus rule means the outcome is not about who has the *most* support, but whether anyone has a single, determined opponent. The reasons for Turkey's opposition are not fully clear from the provided sources.
*   **Bid Swaps/Withdrawal:** A sudden resolution could occur if one party withdraws. This could be triggered by domestic events (e.g., a change in government) or a diplomatic "grand bargain" completely unrelated to climate change.
*   **Resolution Definition:** The bid is "Australia in partnership with the Pacific," but the resolution hinges on the host *city's country*. Adelaide is in Australia, so this would resolve to Australia. "Another Pacific Island Nation" is only a plausible outcome if the entire bid structure changes, which is highly unlikely.

**Final Research Summary:** This is a two-way contest between Australia and Turkey, complicated by the consensus-based decision rule of the WEOG. Australia appears to have broader support and a stronger narrative, but Turkey holds effective veto power, creating a diplomatic standoff that has already forced a significant delay and makes the outcome highly uncertain.

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the strong narrative of co-hosting with Pacific nations and significant support, a base rate of 50% is reasonable. This reflects Australia's broad appeal and the political salience of its bid.
- **Turkey**: With Turkey being the only other official bidder and having enough leverage to block Australia's bid, a base rate of 35% is appropriate. This reflects its significant, albeit minority, support.
- **Germany**: As the default host city in case of a deadlock, Germany should have a base rate of 14%. This reflects the low but real possibility of a stalemate.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is highly unlikely given the current bid structure, so a base rate of 0.5% is reasonable.
- **Other**: Given the current bids and the process, the likelihood of another country hosting is minimal, so a base rate of 0.5% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The bid's strength lies in its alignment with UNFCCC narratives, which is a significant advantage over typical bids.
- **Turkey**: The geopolitical complexity and Turkey's veto power make this situation different from a typical contest.
- **Germany**: The possibility of a deadlock is higher than usual due to the entrenched standoff.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation/Other**: These options remain unlikely unless there is a significant change in the bid structure.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia's sustained commitment**: Increases the likelihood of Australia winning (P(E | Australia) > P(E | ~Australia)).
- **Turkey's blocking power**: Increases the likelihood of Turkey winning or a deadlock (P(E | Turkey) > P(E | ~Turkey)).
- **Public standoff and delay**: Increases the likelihood of a deadlock (P(E | Germany) > P(E | ~Germany)).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 50/50. Evidence of sustained commitment and support slightly increases the odds.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 35/65. Evidence of blocking power and geopolitical leverage increases the odds.
- **Germany**: Prior odds = 14/86. Evidence of a prolonged standoff increases the odds slightly.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Consider the possibility of a diplomatic breakthrough or unforeseen geopolitical shifts.
- **Alternative scenarios**: A sudden withdrawal or compromise could change the dynamics.
- **Rebuttals**: Australia's broad support might not overcome Turkey's veto power.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 45%  
Turkey: 35%  
Germany: 18%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%  
Other: 1%  

These probabilities reflect the current dynamics, with Australia slightly favored but Turkey and Germany having significant chances due to the geopolitical complexities and the consensus requirement.

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on the WEOG hosting rotation and the current bidding situation:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: One of two official bidders within WEOG, with reported "significant support"
- Reference class: In contested bids within a regional group, each major bidder typically has a 40-50% chance

**Turkey**: 40% 
- Rationale: The other official bidder from WEOG, with enough leverage to cause a standoff
- Reference class: Same as Australia, but slightly lower due to reported broader support for Australia

**Germany**: 10%
- Rationale: Default host if consensus fails, as Bonn houses UNFCCC headquarters
- Reference class: In contested bids requiring consensus, deadlock occurs ~10% of the time

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 3%
- Rationale: Only plausible if Australia's co-hosting arrangement changes dramatically
- Reference class: Major structural changes to established bids are rare

**Other**: 2%
- Rationale: Covers unexpected outcomes like a new bidder emerging or hosting outside WEOG
- Reference class: Unexpected outcomes in diplomatic processes with established procedures

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The host country rotates among UN regional groups, with WEOG's turn in 2026
- The decision requires consensus within the regional group
- There are two competing bids from countries within the eligible group

**Key differences:**
- Australia's bid is unusual as it involves co-hosting with Pacific nations, creating a stronger narrative around climate justice
- The standoff has already caused a formal delay in the decision process (from Nov 2024 to June 2025)
- This COP follows the 2025 deadline for new NDCs, making it particularly significant
- The publicly acknowledged deadlock suggests an unusually entrenched disagreement

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for Australia:**
- Strong narrative of co-hosting with vulnerable Pacific nations (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- Reported "significant support" within WEOG (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)
- Concrete financial commitments from both federal and state governments (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- Adelaide officially submitted as host city with budget allocations (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- Continued government reaffirmation of the bid (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)

**Evidence for Turkey:**
- Ability to block consensus despite Australia's broader support (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) moderate)
- Forced delay of decision from Nov 2024 to June 2025 (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- Antalya widely speculated as host city (P(E|H) moderate, P(E|~H) low)

**Evidence for Germany:**
- Prolonged standoff increases chance of default to Bonn (P(E|H) high, P(E|~H) low)
- WEOG's diversity makes consensus difficult (P(E|H) moderate, P(E|~H) moderate)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the key evidence of the formal delay in decision-making:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: The formal delay suggests Turkey's opposition is serious. P(delay|Australia wins) = 0.4, P(delay|Australia loses) = 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 0.5 = 0.41
- Posterior probability: 0.41/(1+0.41) ≈ 29%

This is a significant downward adjustment, but let's also consider Australia's continued commitment and strong narrative:
- Likelihood ratio for continued commitment: 1.2
- New posterior odds: 0.41 × 1.2 = 0.492
- New posterior probability: 0.492/(1+0.492) ≈ 33%

For Turkey:
- Prior probability: 40%
- The delay evidence strongly favors Turkey's chances
- Updating similarly yields a posterior around 48%

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 10%
- The evidence of prolonged deadlock increases Germany's chances
- Posterior probability increases to approximately 15%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the power of behind-the-scenes diplomacy to resolve the standoff
- The consensus requirement might make the outcome more binary than I've estimated
- Turkey's motivations remain unclear, making it difficult to assess how resolvable the standoff is
- I might be overweighting recent events (the delay) compared to structural factors

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A diplomatic grand bargain could suddenly resolve the standoff in either direction
- Domestic political changes in either country could alter their commitment to hosting
- The co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations could evolve in unexpected ways

**Adjustments:**
- I should slightly increase the probability for "Other" to account for unforeseen diplomatic solutions
- I should slightly decrease Germany's probability as the diplomatic cost of defaulting creates pressure to find a solution

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations, my final probabilities are:

Australia: 35%
Turkey: 47% 
Germany: 13%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%

These sum to 100% and reflect the evidence that Turkey currently has the upper hand due to the consensus requirement, though Australia remains a strong contender with significant support.

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 35%
Turkey: 47%
Germany: 13%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The appropriate base rate is the outcome of contested bids for hosting major UN conferences within a regional group that requires consensus. Such contests are uncommon, as groups usually pre-negotiate a single candidate. When a contest does occur, it's typically between two main bidders. A plausible base rate distribution for a two-bidder contest with a default option is:
*   **Bidder A (initial favorite) wins:** 45%
*   **Bidder B (challenger) wins:** 45%
*   **Default/Compromise (e.g., Bonn):** 10%

This reflects that once a contest is established, it is highly competitive, and the consensus rule gives the challenger significant blocking power. The 10% for the default option accounts for the non-trivial risk of a complete deadlock, which is seen as a diplomatic failure for the group. In this case, Australia, with its broad reported support and strong narrative, can be considered the initial favorite (Bidder A), and Turkey the challenger (Bidder B).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The situation is a two-bidder contest (Australia vs. Turkey) within a UN regional group (WEOG).
*   The decision mechanism is consensus, which empowers any single member to block a decision.
*   There is a clear default option (Bonn, Germany) if no consensus is reached.

**Differences:**
*   **Australia's Bid Strength:** Australia's bid is unusually strong from a narrative perspective, as it is a co-bid with vulnerable Pacific Island nations. This aligns perfectly with the UNFCCC's focus on climate justice and likely garners it more widespread support than a typical bid.
*   **Entrenched Standoff:** This contest is no longer hypothetical. A public, formal delay in the decision has already occurred (from Nov 2024 to mid-2025). This indicates the deadlock is more severe and entrenched than in a typical base case, where disputes are often resolved more quickly behind the scenes. This increases the probability of a non-standard outcome (i.e., the challenger winning or a default to Germany).
*   **Geopolitical Context:** Turkey's position within WEOG is unique. Its motivations for blocking may extend beyond simply wanting to host the COP and could be linked to broader geopolitical leverage with other powerful WEOG members (EU, US). This could make its opposition more rigid than a typical rival bidder.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Australia's co-bid with Pacific nations.**
    *   P(E1 | Australia wins) is high. This narrative is a key asset.
    *   This evidence makes an Australian win more likely than in a standard contest, as it builds a powerful diplomatic coalition.
*   **Evidence 2: The decision was formally delayed due to a "standoff".**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence.
    *   P(Delay | Australia was a clear favorite heading for victory) is very low.
    *   P(Delay | Turkey has effective veto power and is willing to use it) is very high.
    *   Therefore, this evidence significantly lowers the probability of an Australian victory and increases the probability of a Turkish victory or a default to Germany. It demonstrates the challenger's blocking power is not just theoretical but has been successfully deployed.
*   **Evidence 3: Australia has "significant support" but is stymied by the consensus rule.**
    *   This confirms the underlying dynamic. It supports the idea that Australia is the preferred candidate of a majority but is being held up by a veto. This prevents Australia's probability from collapsing entirely; it remains a very strong contender if a diplomatic solution can be found.
*   **Evidence 4: Sustained, funded commitment from Australian federal and state governments.**
    *   This shows Australia is not a "soft" bidder. They are unlikely to withdraw their bid easily. This slightly increases the chances of a prolonged deadlock (favoring Germany) or an eventual Australian win through persistence, while making a simple Turkish win (via Australian withdrawal) less likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** Australia (45%), Turkey (45%), Germany (10%).
2.  **Update on Key Evidence (The Delay):** The formal delay is strong evidence that Turkey's blocking power is real and effective. This evidence has a high likelihood ratio against Australia winning easily. It forces a significant downward revision for Australia and an upward revision for both Turkey and Germany, as both outcomes become more plausible in a real deadlock.
3.  **Conceptual Update:** Let's shift probability mass away from the two bidders winning and towards the deadlock option (Germany), and also equalize the chances of the two bidders more. The prior assumes a generic contest, but the evidence points to a particularly stubborn one. The delay suggests the base rate of 10% for a deadlock is too low for this specific case.
    *   Let's pull 10 points from Australia (down to 35%) and 7 points from Turkey (down to 38%) to reflect the difficulty both are having in closing the deal.
    *   This frees up 17 points. Let's add this to Germany, reflecting the increased chance of a persistent deadlock. Germany moves from 10% to 27%.
    *   This leaves us at Australia 35%, Turkey 38%, Germany 27%. This reflects Turkey having a slight edge because in a consensus system, the power to block is often more decisive than the power of broad support. It also gives a substantial probability to the default outcome.
4.  **Final Adjustment:** Australia's strong narrative and broad support should not be underestimated. Other WEOG members will likely exert significant diplomatic pressure on Turkey to break the impasse. This provides a countervailing force. I will adjust slightly to make the two main contenders closer and pull a little from the deadlock option, as there is still time for a deal. This leads to a final distribution where Australia is a very slight favorite due to its broader support base, but Turkey is nearly as likely due to its demonstrated veto power, and Germany remains a significant possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **My forecast might be underestimating Turkey's resolve.** Turkey could be using this as a major geopolitical bargaining chip and may be unwilling to back down unless it receives a significant concession on an unrelated issue. If so, Turkey's probability should be higher.
*   **My forecast might be underestimating the pressure on Turkey.** Blocking a popular, climate-focused bid from Australia and the Pacific could come with significant diplomatic costs. Major WEOG powers (US, UK, Canada, EU nations) may lean heavily on Turkey to relent, making an Australian victory more likely than I have estimated.
*   **The "Other" option:** A compromise candidate (e.g., Canada, New Zealand) could be proposed to break the deadlock. This is a plausible "black swan" scenario to avoid the embarrassment of defaulting to Bonn. I have assigned a low probability, but it's a real possibility.
*   **The "Another Pacific Island Nation" option:** This is highly improbable. The existing bid is the "Pacific" bid, and the logistical capacity for a COP is concentrated in Australia. This option would require the current bid to fail and an entirely new, logistically viable bid to emerge and win consensus, all before the deadline. Its probability should be minimal.

Considering these points, the high uncertainty is the key takeaway. The distribution should be relatively flat across the main three outcomes, which my current forecast reflects. I will stick with the distribution that places Australia and Turkey in a virtual tie, with a significant chance of failure leading to Germany.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed among the plausible outcomes, accounting for the high uncertainty of the diplomatic standoff.

*   **Australia:** Has broad support and a strong narrative, but is blocked by the consensus rule. Remains the slight favorite to eventually find a diplomatic solution. (42%)
*   **Turkey:** Has demonstrated effective veto power, which is decisive in a consensus system. A very strong contender. (38%)
*   **Germany:** The default option. The probability of this outcome increases the longer the deadlock persists. The formal delay is strong evidence that this is a real possibility. (18%)
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** Extremely unlikely as a standalone host. (1%)
*   **Other:** A compromise WEOG candidate could emerge, but this is speculative. (1%)

The sum is 42 + 38 + 18 + 1 + 1 = 100%.

### Output Format

Australia: 42%
Turkey: 38%
Germany: 18%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 1%
