### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Previous Ukrainian Martial Law Extensions (2022-2025):** Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times since February 2022. The base rate for extension, conditional on the war continuing, is 100% (16 out of 16). This is the most relevant reference class.
2.  **States Under Martial Law During Active Invasion:** Countries facing a full-scale, existential invasion of their territory almost universally maintain martial law or equivalent states of emergency until the cessation of major hostilities. The base rate for lifting martial law *before* a ceasefire or peace treaty is extremely low, likely <5%.
3.  **Legislative Approvals in Wartime Parliaments:** In democracies facing existential external threats, legislative bodies tend to show high levels of solidarity with the executive on core national security measures. Approval rates for such measures typically exceed 90%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-23** National Bank of Ukraine lowers 2025 GDP growth forecast to 1.9%, citing war-related energy and labor shortages. (↑) — Reinforces that the war's severe economic and social impacts are ongoing, necessitating state-of-emergency measures like martial law.
*   **2025-08-08** President Zelenskyy signs the 16th extension of martial law and general mobilization for another 90 days, until November 5, 2025. (↑) — Continues the unbroken, predictable pattern of 90-day extensions, setting a strong precedent for the upcoming decision.
*   **2025-07-24** Economic forecasts for 2025 show defense spending remains a massive burden on public finances. (↑) — High defense spending is intrinsically linked to the mobilization and economic controls enabled by martial law.
*   **2025-02-25** A joint assessment estimates Ukraine's reconstruction needs at $524 billion, highlighting the war's devastating and ongoing physical destruction. (↑) — The scale of damage underscores that the conditions of war persist, making a return to normalcy and the lifting of martial law untenable.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **State of the War (Large):** The primary driver. As long as a full-scale, active conflict with Russia persists, including occupation of territory and regular attacks, the legal and practical justification for martial law remains absolute. The provided sources confirm the war is expected to be a grinding conflict of attrition through 2025.
2.  **Legal Necessity for Mobilization (Large):** Martial law provides the legal framework for general mobilization, which is critical for sustaining Ukraine's military manpower. Ending martial law would severely disrupt the state's ability to conscript and deploy troops.
3.  **Political Consensus (Moderate):** There is a broad, cross-party consensus in the Verkhovna Rada and among the public that martial law is a necessary evil for national survival. Ending it prematurely would be seen as a catastrophic weakening of the state.
4.  **Postponement of Elections (Moderate):** The Ukrainian constitution prohibits national elections under martial law. Lifting it would trigger a constitutional requirement to hold elections, which is widely considered logistically impossible and dangerously divisive during the war.
5.  **International Acceptance (Small):** Ukraine's key international partners, while stressing democratic principles, have accepted the necessity of martial law and postponed elections under the current circumstances. There is no significant external pressure to lift it.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unbroken Precedent:** Unlike a novel decision, this is the 17th potential extension. The procedural and political path is well-established, creating immense institutional inertia.
*   **Existential Nature of the Conflict:** This is not a limited conflict or internal unrest. The war is a fight for national survival, which creates a level of political unity and justification for emergency powers not present in many other historical cases of martial law.
*   **Clear Legal Trigger:** The justification for martial law is not ambiguous; it is tied directly to the publicly visible, full-scale invasion by a foreign power, leaving little room for political debate about its necessity.
*   **Short Horizon:** The decision is due in approximately 11 days. There is no plausible scenario in which a war of this scale could end and the state demobilize in such a short timeframe.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very high prior (e.g., 99%) based on the reference class of 16 prior extensions under identical circumstances. This is equivalent to a strong prior with n > 50.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The war continues as a high-intensity conflict of attrition, with no peace process in sight.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The legal necessity for mobilization and economic control remains unchanged.
    *   (↑ Small) The domestic political consensus and international acceptance for martial law remain solid.
    *   (→) No new countervailing evidence has emerged suggesting a change in strategy or legal interpretation.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly confirms the prior. The posterior probability should move even closer to 100%, effectively treating this as a near-certainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
Given the ~11-day horizon, the only relevant indicators are procedural and imminent.
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   President Zelenskyy submitting a draft law to the Verkhovna Rada to extend martial law (expected in the next few days).
    *   The relevant Rada committee approving the draft law.
    *   The Rada placing the extension bill on its official agenda for a vote.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A sudden, verifiable, and comprehensive ceasefire agreement signed by both Ukraine and Russia.
    *   A joint declaration by President Zelenskyy and the Rada leadership that an extension is no longer necessary (extremely unlikely).
    *   The non-submission of an extension bill by the President by ~November 1, 2025.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Event:** The only realistic path to a "No" resolution is a sudden, transformative event like a coup or a complete collapse of the Russian front, neither of which is indicated.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The question is straightforward. An extension is a formal, legislative act. A failure to act would mean it expires. There is little room for ambiguity.
*   **Information Lag:** While unlikely to matter on this timeline, there could be secret peace negotiations. However, their successful conclusion and implementation before November 5 is not credible.

**Final Research Summary:** The continuation of the full-scale war with Russia makes the extension of martial law a political and military necessity for Ukraine. The unbroken pattern of 16 previous extensions creates overwhelming institutional momentum, making another extension a near-certainty.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of martial law extensions in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in 2022. Ukraine has extended martial law 16 times consecutively, resulting in a base rate of 100% for extensions under ongoing war conditions. This is supported by the reference class of states under martial law during active invasions, where lifting martial law before a ceasefire is extremely rare.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors the past 16 extensions, with ongoing conflict and no peace agreement in sight. The legal and political frameworks supporting martial law remain unchanged.
   - **Differences:** There are no significant differences that would suggest a deviation from the established pattern of extensions. The war's existential nature and the need for mobilization continue to justify martial law.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Ongoing War:** The likelihood of martial law being extended is high given the continued conflict (P(E | H) is high), while the likelihood of it not being extended despite the war is low (P(E | ~H) is low). This evidence strongly supports an extension.
   - **Economic and Social Impact:** The severe economic and social impacts of the war reinforce the need for martial law, increasing the probability of extension.
   - **Political and Legal Consensus:** The broad political consensus and legal necessity for mobilization further increase the likelihood of extension.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** Start with a prior probability of 99% (odds of 99:1) based on historical extensions.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence supporting an extension, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1.
   - **Posterior Odds:** The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio, resulting in odds approaching certainty.
   - **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is effectively 100%, given the overwhelming evidence and lack of countervailing factors.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden peace agreement or political shift, but these are highly unlikely within the short timeframe.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A black swan event, such as a dramatic change in the war's dynamics, could alter the outcome, but there is no indication of such an event.
   - **Rebuttals:** The consistent pattern of extensions and the current state of the war strongly rebut any alternative forecasts.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the historical precedent, ongoing conflict, and strong political and legal support for martial law, the probability of Ukraine extending martial law beyond November 5, 2025, is extremely high.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the historical pattern of martial law extensions in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began as my primary base rate:

- Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times since February 2022
- Each extension since May 2022 has been for 90-day periods
- The extension rate is 16/16 = 100% when the war is ongoing

This gives us a very strong prior of approximately 99%. I'm not using exactly 100% to account for some minimal uncertainty, as perfect certainty is rarely justified in forecasting.

Secondary reference classes:
- Countries under active invasion almost universally maintain martial law until major hostilities cease
- Wartime parliaments typically show >90% approval rates for core national security measures

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental condition (active war with Russia) remains unchanged
- The legal framework requiring extensions every 90 days is the same
- The institutional process for extension is well-established after 16 iterations
- The political consensus supporting martial law appears stable

**Differences from base case:**
- We are now 3.5+ years into the conflict, which could theoretically create "emergency fatigue"
- However, the existential nature of the threat has not diminished
- No peace negotiations or ceasefire appear imminent
- The 11-day timeline until the decision makes any major change in circumstances extremely unlikely

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key evidence #1: Ongoing active conflict**
- P(E|H): The probability of seeing an active war if martial law will be extended is ~100%
- P(E|~H): The probability of seeing an active war if martial law will NOT be extended is ~5% (would require extraordinary circumstances)
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

**Key evidence #2: Legal necessity for mobilization**
- P(E|H): The probability that Ukraine needs continued mobilization if martial law will be extended is ~100%
- P(E|~H): The probability Ukraine needs continued mobilization but won't extend martial law is ~10% (would require alternative legal framework)
- Likelihood ratio: ~10:1 in favor of extension
- This substantially increases the probability

**Key evidence #3: Recent economic indicators showing war impacts**
- The National Bank of Ukraine lowered 2025 GDP growth forecasts on October 23, 2025, citing war-related factors
- P(E|H): ~90% (economic strain is consistent with continued martial law)
- P(E|~H): ~50% (economic strain alone wouldn't prevent lifting martial law)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases the probability

**Key evidence #4: Unbroken pattern of extensions**
- P(E|H): The probability of seeing 16 consecutive extensions if the 17th will occur is ~95%
- P(E|~H): The probability of seeing 16 consecutive extensions if the 17th won't occur is ~20% (would require sudden change)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75:1 in favor of extension
- This substantially increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 99% (odds of 99:1):

Update based on ongoing active conflict:
- Prior odds: 99:1
- Likelihood ratio: 20:1
- Posterior odds: 99 × 20 = 1,980:1
- Posterior probability: 1,980/1,981 ≈ 99.95%

This already pushes us to near certainty, but let's continue with one more update:

Update based on legal necessity for mobilization:
- Prior odds: 1,980:1
- Likelihood ratio: 10:1
- Posterior odds: 1,980 × 10 = 19,800:1
- Posterior probability: 19,800/19,801 ≈ 99.995%

The remaining evidence would push this even higher, but we're already at a very high confidence level.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots:
- **Secret negotiations**: There could be undisclosed peace talks that might lead to a sudden ceasefire, but implementing this before November 5 (11 days away) is extremely implausible
- **Procedural failure**: The extension requires parliamentary approval, but given the 16 previous approvals and national security implications, a failure to pass is highly unlikely
- **Legal reinterpretation**: Ukraine could theoretically develop an alternative legal framework for mobilization, but creating and implementing this in 11 days is virtually impossible
- **Symbolic gesture**: Ukraine could make a symbolic decision to end martial law while maintaining de facto emergency measures, but this would be strategically risky during active conflict

The most plausible alternative scenario is some form of procedural delay or technical issue that prevents formal extension by the deadline. However, given the critical nature of martial law for Ukraine's defense, any such issue would likely be resolved through emergency measures.

After considering these alternatives, I see no compelling reason to significantly adjust my forecast downward.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming evidence from:
1. The unbroken pattern of 16 previous extensions
2. The ongoing active conflict with Russia
3. The legal necessity for mobilization
4. The short 11-day timeline until the decision
5. The recent economic indicators confirming war impacts
6. The absence of peace negotiations or ceasefire

And after considering potential alternative scenarios, I assess that Ukraine will almost certainly extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025.

Final: 99%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the history of martial law extensions within this specific conflict. Since the full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government has faced the decision to extend martial law 16 times. On all 16 occasions, it has chosen to extend it. This provides a perfect, albeit small, dataset.

- **Reference Class:** Decisions to extend martial law in Ukraine during the 2022-present war.
- **Base Rate:** 16 extensions out of 16 opportunities, or 100%.

While a 100% historical rate can be brittle, it establishes an extremely strong prior belief that, under the current conditions of active warfare, extension is the default and necessary action. I will set a strong initial prior of **98%**. This is slightly backed off from 100% to allow for the logical possibility of a change, but reflects the overwhelming precedent. In odds, this is 98/2 = 49:1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case consists of the 16 previous extension decisions made between May 2022 and August 2025.

- **Similarities:** The current situation is functionally identical to the base case. A high-intensity war of attrition with Russia continues, Ukraine requires the legal framework of martial law for general mobilization and to manage the war economy, and the same political leadership is in place. The fundamental reasons for martial law have not changed.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the very short time horizon for this specific forecast. The decision is due by November 5, 2025, which is only 11 days from the date of this analysis (October 25, 2025). This short timeframe dramatically reduces the likelihood of any fundamental change in the strategic situation (e.g., a peace treaty, a decisive military victory) that could negate the need for martial law. This difference makes an extension *more* certain, not less.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "Ukraine extends martial law," and ~H be the alternative.

- **Evidence 1: Continuation of high-intensity war.** The research report confirms that analysts expect a "grinding conflict of attrition" through 2025.
    - P(E1 | H): It is nearly certain that the war would be ongoing if Ukraine extends martial law; this is the primary justification. P(E1 | H) ≈ 1.
    - P(E1 | ~H): It is almost inconceivable that Ukraine would let martial law expire while the war is still raging. This would only happen if the war had suddenly and unexpectedly stopped. P(E1 | ~H) is extremely low.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very high (>>1), strongly favoring H.

- **Evidence 2: Legal necessity for mobilization and governance.** The research report highlights that martial law is the legal basis for mobilization and managing the war economy.
    - P(E2 | H): This necessity is a core reason for the extension. P(E2 | H) ≈ 1.
    - P(E2 | ~H): Ending martial law would cripple the state's ability to conscript soldiers and direct resources, a catastrophic outcome during an active war. P(E2 | ~H) is extremely low.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very high (>>1), strongly favoring H.

- **Evidence 3: The 11-day time horizon.**
    - P(E3 | H): An extension is a routine legislative procedure that can easily be completed in this timeframe.
    - P(E3 | ~H): For martial law *not* to be extended, a "black swan" event like a sudden peace treaty or a total military collapse would need to occur and be resolved within 11 days. The probability of such a rapid, transformative event is minuscule.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very high (>>1), strongly favoring H.

All key pieces of evidence strongly confirm the hypothesis and argue against the alternative.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 49:1 (equivalent to 98%).
- **Likelihood Ratio (Combined):** The evidence is mutually reinforcing and points in one direction. The short time horizon alone provides a very powerful update. Let's estimate a conservative combined likelihood ratio of 10. This implies the observed evidence is 10 times more likely if Ukraine extends martial law than if it doesn't.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 49 × 10 = 490:1.
- **Posterior Probability:** 490 / (490 + 1) ≈ 99.8%.

The formal update confirms the intuitive conclusion: the probability is extremely high, moving from an already strong prior to near-certainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong.
1.  **Sudden End to the War:** A "black swan" event, such as a sudden political collapse in Moscow or a secret, comprehensive peace deal being announced and implemented in the next 11 days. The probability of this is exceedingly low.
2.  **Internal Political Upheaval:** A sudden coup or constitutional crisis in Kyiv that paralyzes the government and prevents the legislative process from occurring. This is also a tail risk with no current indicators.
3.  **Definitional Change:** Ukraine could replace "martial law" with a different legal state of emergency that is functionally identical but technically has a different name. While possible, it's unlikely they would change a well-established procedure for no clear reason. The path of least resistance is to extend the existing law.

The most plausible failure mode is a "black swan" event. Assigning a 1% chance to such an event occurring and preventing the extension within this short timeframe seems reasonable and appropriately cautious. Therefore, a probability of 99% is a robust estimate that accounts for these remote possibilities.

### Final Forecast
The forecast is based on an extremely strong precedent of 16 prior extensions, a strategic situation that continues to make martial law a necessity for national survival, and a very short time horizon that precludes any plausible alternative scenario from unfolding. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that an extension is a near-formality.

Final: 99%
