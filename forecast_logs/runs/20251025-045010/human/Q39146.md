Here is my research plan.

### **1. Core Questions to Investigate**

1.  **What is the historical base rate for winning the World Championship?** This involves analyzing past winners by team, region, and prior achievements (e.g., winning the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) or their domestic summer split).
2.  **What is the current state of the 2025 World Championship?** The provided sources indicate the tournament is in progress as of October 25, 2025. I need to synthesize which teams are performing well, who has been eliminated, and what stage the tournament is in.
3.  **What has been the recent performance of the top contenders in 2025?** The recency guideline (<3 months) points to the last 6 months. This includes MSI 2025, the regional summer splits (especially LCK and LPL), and the early stages of the World Championship itself.
4.  **What are the fundamental drivers of success at Worlds?** This involves identifying the key causal mechanisms, such as player skill, team synergy, adaptability to the tournament's evolving "meta" (dominant strategies), and coaching.
5.  **How does the 2025 season and tournament differ from historical patterns?** Are there any unusual factors, such as a single super-dominant team, a shift in regional power balance, or significant format changes that might alter expected outcomes?
6.  **What is the status of the specific teams listed in the options?** I need to map the gathered information to the provided teams (T1, HLE, KT, Gen.G, BLG, etc.) to assess their individual probabilities.

### **3. Synthesis of Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** The World Championship has been exclusively won by teams from South Korea (LCK) or China (LPL) since 2013. This makes the "An Asia-Pacific team" option a near certainty. The historical split is roughly 8 titles for LCK and 4 for LPL in that period. Therefore, an LCK team is the stronger prior. Winning MSI is a strong signal but doesn't guarantee a Worlds win.
*   **Recent Developments:** The 2025 season has been dominated by Gen.G, who won MSI and had a 23-series win streak. HLE also appears very strong, having won a new tournament and reaching the LCK finals. At the ongoing Worlds, KT Rolster has emerged as a surprise powerhouse with a perfect 3-0 in the Swiss Stage. T1 (defending champs) and BLG (a top Chinese team) are also advancing, while teams from the Americas are already being eliminated.
*   **Key Mechanisms:** Success hinges on meta adaptability, individual player form (especially in the mid-lane and jungle roles), team cohesion, and psychological resilience in high-stakes best-of-five series.
*   **Differences vs. Base Rate:** The primary difference in 2025 is the sustained, season-long dominance of a single team, Gen.G, which is rarer than having 2-3 co-favorites. The LCK appears to have exceptional depth, with at least four teams (Gen.G, HLE, T1, KT) looking like legitimate title contenders, potentially more than in recent years. The tournament being held in China could provide a slight advantage to LPL teams.
*   **Conclusion:** The evidence strongly points to an LCK team winning. Gen.G is the clear favorite based on year-long performance, but HLE's domestic success and KT's current tournament form make them extremely dangerous challengers. T1 remains a threat due to their championship pedigree.

### **4. Comprehensive Answer**

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **World Championship Winners (2013-2024):** In the last 12 championships, the winner has always been from either South Korea's LCK (8 wins, ~67%) or China's LPL (4 wins, ~33%). The base rate for an Asia-Pacific team winning is effectively 100% in the modern era. The probability of an EMEA or Americas team winning is historically negligible (<1%).
*   **MSI-to-Worlds Conversion:** Winning the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) is a strong indicator of elite status, but converting it to a Worlds title in the same year is not guaranteed. Historically, this has happened only a few times (e.g., SKT T1 in 2016, RNG in 2018 did not, G2 in 2019 did not). This suggests being the MSI champion increases a team's chances but is not a decisive predictor.
*   **Regional Champions at Worlds:** Winning a major region's summer split (the season immediately preceding Worlds) is a strong qualifier. However, the World Champion is often not the summer champion from their own region, indicating that peak form at the tournament itself is more critical.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-07-12] Gen.G wins the 2025 Mid-Season Invitational, defeating T1 3-2. ↑↑ (Gen.G) — Establishes them as the world's best team mid-season, capping a 23-series win streak and securing a Worlds spot.
*   [2025-09-24] HLE secures a spot in the LCK Summer Finals as defending champions. ↑ (HLE) — Confirms their status as a top-tier team in the world's strongest region, demonstrating consistent high-level performance.
*   [2025-09-28] HLE wins the inaugural First Stand Tournament earlier in the year. ↑ (HLE) — Provides another data point of HLE winning an international-style tournament, though against weaker competition than MSI/Worlds.
*   [2025-10-20] KT Rolster becomes the first team to reach the Worlds quarterfinals with a perfect 3-0 record. ↑↑ (KT Rolster) — Signals exceptional adaptation to the tournament meta and peak current form, significantly outperforming pre-tournament "underdog" expectations.
*   [2025-10-24] T1 and Bilibili Gaming (BLG) advance from elimination matches at Worlds. ↑ (T1, BLG) — Shows resilience and confirms they are still contenders, though having to play elimination matches suggests they are not as dominant as the 3-0 teams.
*   [2025-10-24] 100 Thieves (Americas) is eliminated from Worlds. ↓↓ (An Americas team) — Reinforces the significant competitive gap between the major Eastern regions (LCK/LPL) and the West.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Meta Adaptability:** A team's ability to quickly identify and master the most powerful champions and strategies on the specific Worlds game patch. This is a large driver, as teams that fail to adapt are quickly eliminated.

To forecast which team will win the 2025 League of Legends World Championship, I will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **T1, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster, Gen.G**: These are all South Korean teams from the LCK, which historically has a strong track record at Worlds. The base rate for an LCK team winning is approximately 67% based on historical data.
- **Bilibili Gaming, Anyone's Legend, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming**: These are Chinese teams from the LPL, which also has a strong historical performance with a base rate of about 33%.
- **An Asia-Pacific team**: Given that all LCK and LPL teams fall under this category, the base rate is effectively 100%.
- **An EMEA team, An Americas team**: Historically, these regions have not won Worlds in the modern era, so the base rate is negligible (<1%).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The current tournament structure and regional dominance are consistent with historical patterns.
- **Differences**: Gen.G's dominance throughout the year and KT Rolster's unexpected strong performance in the Swiss Stage are notable deviations from typical patterns.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Gen.G**: Winning the MSI and having a 23-series win streak suggests a high likelihood of success at Worlds. P(E | H) is high for Gen.G.
- **KT Rolster**: Their perfect 3-0 record in the Swiss Stage indicates strong current form. P(E | H) is high for KT Rolster.
- **Hanwha Life Esports**: Consistent high-level performance and recent tournament wins make them a strong contender. P(E | H) is moderate to high.
- **T1**: As defending champions, they have pedigree, but their need to play elimination matches suggests they are not as dominant. P(E | H) is moderate.
- **Bilibili Gaming**: Advancing from elimination matches shows resilience, but they are not as dominant as the top LCK teams. P(E | H) is moderate.
- **An EMEA or Americas team**: The elimination of 100 Thieves and historical performance suggests a very low likelihood. P(E | H) is very low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Gen.G**: Starting with a prior of 67% for LCK teams, the evidence of their dominance increases their posterior probability significantly.
- **KT Rolster**: Their unexpected strong performance boosts their probability from the LCK base rate.
- **Hanwha Life Esports**: Consistent performance keeps them competitive, but slightly below Gen.G and KT Rolster.
- **T1**: Their pedigree keeps them in the running, but their performance so far suggests they are less likely than Gen.G or KT Rolster.
- **Bilibili Gaming**: As a strong LPL team, they remain a contender but are less likely than the top LCK teams.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Ensure not to overestimate Gen.G based solely on past performance; consider current tournament dynamics.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: KT Rolster's current form could lead to an upset. Adjust probabilities to account for this possibility.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the evidence and base rates.

### 7. Output Format

Gen.G: 30%  
KT Rolster: 25%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 15%  
T1: 10%  
Bilibili Gaming: 10%  
Anyone's Legend: 2%  
Top Esports: 2%  
Invictus Gaming: 2%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 4%  
An EMEA team: <1%  
An Americas team: <1%  

(Note: The "An Asia-Pacific team" option is included to account for the possibility of a team not explicitly listed winning, but the probability is low given the specific teams listed are the primary contenders.)

# Forecasting the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on historical World Championship results:

**Regional Base Rates:**
- South Korean (LCK) teams: ~67% (8 out of 12 championships since 2013)
- Chinese (LPL) teams: ~33% (4 out of 12 championships since 2013)
- EMEA teams: <1% (0 championships in modern era)
- Americas teams: <1% (0 championships in modern era)
- Other Asia-Pacific: <1% (0 championships in modern era)

**Team-Specific Base Rates:**
- T1: ~25% (3 championships in modern era, defending champion)
- Gen.G: ~8% (1 championship as Samsung Galaxy)
- Other LCK teams (HLE, KT): ~8% each (based on LCK's overall dominance)
- LPL teams (BLG, AL, TES, IG): ~8% each (dividing LPL's 33% among 4 teams)

These base rates reflect the historical dominance of LCK and LPL teams, with T1 having the strongest historical record.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The tournament structure remains similar to previous years
- The regional qualification system is consistent
- The dominance of LCK and LPL teams continues in 2025

**Differences from base case:**
- Gen.G has shown exceptional dominance in 2025, winning MSI and having a 23-series win streak
- KT Rolster is showing unexpectedly strong performance at Worlds 2025 (perfect 3-0 in Swiss Stage)
- HLE won the inaugural First Stand Tournament and reached LCK Summer Finals
- The tournament is being held in China, potentially giving a slight home advantage to LPL teams

These differences suggest we should adjust our priors to give more weight to Gen.G, KT Rolster, and HLE compared to a purely historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Gen.G won MSI 2025**
- P(E|Gen.G wins Worlds): ~70% (MSI winners often perform well at Worlds)
- P(E|Gen.G doesn't win Worlds): ~30% (MSI winners sometimes fail to convert at Worlds)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.33

**Evidence 2: KT Rolster's perfect 3-0 record in Swiss Stage**
- P(E|KT wins Worlds): ~80% (teams showing this form early often go deep)
- P(E|KT doesn't win Worlds): ~20% (early tournament form doesn't always translate to finals)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.0

**Evidence 3: HLE's domestic success (LCK Finals, First Stand Tournament)**
- P(E|HLE wins Worlds): ~60% (domestic success correlates with Worlds performance)
- P(E|HLE doesn't win Worlds): ~40% (many domestic champions fail internationally)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5

**Evidence 4: T1 and BLG advancing from elimination matches**
- P(E|T1 wins Worlds): ~40% (champions often have early struggles)
- P(E|T1 doesn't win Worlds): ~60% (elimination matches suggest vulnerability)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67

**Evidence 5: Americas team elimination**
- P(E|Americas team wins): ~95% (almost certain to see some eliminations)
- P(E|Americas team doesn't win): ~99% (extremely likely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.96

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update Gen.G's probability as an example:
- Prior probability: 8%
- Likelihood ratio from MSI win: 2.33
- Prior odds: 0.08/0.92 = 0.087
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 2.33 = 0.203
- Posterior probability: 0.203/(1 + 0.203) = 16.9%

Further updating with the general strength of LCK in 2025 (likelihood ratio ~1.5):
- Updated odds: 0.203 × 1.5 = 0.304
- Updated probability: 0.304/(1 + 0.304) = 23.3%

For KT Rolster:
- Prior probability: 8%
- Likelihood ratio from perfect Swiss Stage: 4.0
- Prior odds: 0.08/0.92 = 0.087
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 4.0 = 0.348
- Posterior probability: 0.348/(1 + 0.348) = 25.8%

Similar updates for other teams based on their evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent tournament performance (KT Rolster's 3-0)
- The research doesn't mention the specific matchups in the knockout stage, which could significantly impact outcomes
- I might be underestimating T1's championship experience and ability to improve throughout a tournament
- The report doesn't mention player injuries or team dynamics issues that could emerge

**Alternative scenarios:**
- An LPL team could surge in the knockout stage as the tournament progresses in China
- T1 could repeat their championship run by peaking at the right time
- An unexpected meta shift could benefit teams not currently favored

Considering these factors, I should slightly reduce KT Rolster's probability and increase T1's and the LPL teams' chances.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and red team considerations, I'll normalize to ensure probabilities sum to 100%.

## 7. Final Forecast

T1: 18%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 15%  
KT Rolster: 22%  
Gen.G: 23%  
Bilibili Gaming: 8%  
Anyone's Legend: 4%  
Top Esports: 5%  
Invictus Gaming: 3%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 1%  
An EMEA team: 0.5%  
An Americas team: 0.5%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the historical distribution of winners of the League of Legends World Championship, focusing on the modern era (2013-2024).

*   **P(LCK team wins):** 8 wins in the last 12 years = **67%**
*   **P(LPL team wins):** 4 wins in the last 12 years = **33%**
*   **P(Asia-Pacific team wins):** 12 wins in the last 12 years ≈ **99.9%** (This region includes LCK, LPL, and others like PCS/VCS).
*   **P(EMEA or Americas team wins):** 0 wins in the last 12 years ≈ **0.1%**

For individual teams, a naive prior would distribute the regional probability among its qualifying teams. For instance, the 67% LCK probability would be split among its four representatives, giving each a prior of ~17%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The tournament structure, with a group/swiss stage followed by a single-elimination knockout bracket, remains. The fundamental drivers of success—player skill, team coordination, and meta adaptation—are unchanged. The LCK and LPL remain the dominant regions.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is that we are not forecasting from the beginning of the season. The tournament is *currently in progress* as of October 25, 2025. This means we have crucial, recent evidence about team form and their adaptation to the specific "meta" of the Worlds patch. This evidence should heavily outweigh the initial base rates.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate several key pieces of evidence from the research report:

*   **E1: Gen.G won the 2025 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) and had a dominant season.**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if Gen.G is the true world champion (P(E|H)) than if they are not (P(E|~H)). It establishes them as the world's best team for a significant portion of the year. This provides a strong positive update to Gen.G's probability.
*   **E2: KT Rolster is the first team to qualify for quarterfinals with a perfect 3-0 Swiss Stage record.**
    *   This is a powerful signal of current form and mastery of the tournament's meta. A perfect start is highly indicative of a potential champion. The likelihood ratio for this evidence is very high, significantly boosting KT's chances from their pre-tournament standing.
*   **E3: T1 and Bilibili Gaming (BLG) advanced through elimination matches.**
    *   This is mixed evidence. On one hand, it shows resilience. On the other, it suggests they are not as dominant as the teams with perfect records. Compared to a flawless run, this evidence is more likely if they are *not* the eventual champion. This slightly lowers their probabilities relative to the top performers like KT.
*   **E4: Hanwha Life Esports (HLE) had a strong domestic season, reaching the LCK finals.**
    *   This confirms HLE's status as a top-tier team from the world's strongest region. It's a necessary credential for a champion contender. This provides a solid positive update, placing them in the top cluster of teams.
*   **E5: An Americas team (100 Thieves) has already been eliminated.**
    *   This confirms our strong prior that Western teams are not competitive at the highest level. It pushes the already-low probability for an Americas/EMEA win even closer to zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update.

*   **Prior Odds (LCK vs. LPL):** ~2:1 (67% vs 33%)
*   **Evidence:** The evidence strongly favors the LCK teams. Three LCK teams (Gen.G, KT, HLE) are highlighted for exceptional performance, while the defending LCK champion (T1) is still in the running. The main LPL contender mentioned (BLG) has shown some weakness. This collection of evidence is much more probable if an LCK team is the eventual winner.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|LCK win) / P(E|LPL win)):** I estimate this to be around 2.5:1, given the strength shown across multiple LCK teams.
*   **Posterior Odds:** (2:1) * (2.5:1) = 5:1.
*   **Posterior Probability (LCK win):** 5 / (5+1) ≈ **83%**.

I will now distribute this 83% among the LCK teams and the remaining ~17% among other regions, primarily the LPL.

*   **Gen.G & KT Rolster:** Gen.G has season-long dominance, while KT has current-form dominance. They appear to be the two strongest candidates. I will assign them the highest probabilities.
*   **T1, HLE, & BLG:** This tier includes the defending champions (T1), a consistent domestic finalist (HLE), and the best hope for the LPL (BLG). They are all extremely dangerous but have shown slightly less convincing form *at this tournament* than KT or over the whole year than Gen.G. I will assign them equal, significant probabilities.
*   **Other Teams:** The remaining listed teams (AL, TES, IG) are not mentioned in recent news, suggesting they are not major factors. They receive very low probabilities. The regional options receive minimal probability to account for upsets.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My main risk is over-weighting the Swiss Stage results. A team like KT could have had a favorable draw and might be less prepared for the pressure of a best-of-five series against a seasoned opponent like T1 or Gen.G. Conversely, I might be underestimating T1's proven ability to "level up" in the knockout stage, a well-known phenomenon. I have tried to account for this by keeping T1's probability substantial (14%) despite their less-than-perfect Swiss stage, making them co-equal with HLE and BLG. I am also keeping Gen.G as the slight favorite over KT, valuing season-long performance slightly more than a short, hot streak. The distribution feels reasonably spread among the top five contenders, acknowledging the high level of uncertainty in a knockout bracket.

### 6. Final Normalization

I have distributed the probabilities among the top five contenders (Gen.G, KT, T1, HLE, BLG), assigning them a total of 96%. The remaining 4% is distributed among other long-shot teams and regional options to sum to 100%.

T1: 14%
Hanwha Life Esports: 14%
KT Rolster: 26%
Gen.G: 28%
Bilibili Gaming: 14%
Anyone's Legend: 0.5%
Top Esports: 1%
Invictus Gaming: 1%
An Asia-Pacific team: 0.5%
An EMEA team: 0.5%
An Americas team: 0.5%
