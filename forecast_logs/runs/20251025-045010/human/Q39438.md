### Reference class & base rates
*   **Major Separation-of-Powers Cases:** In landmark cases where the President asserts broad domestic authority against a claim of congressional power, the Supreme Court has historically sided against the President. The canonical example is *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* (1952), which invalidated President Truman's seizure of steel mills. A base rate of the Court striking down such executive actions is roughly 50-60%.
*   **Challenges to Presidential Foreign Policy/National Security Actions:** The Court is traditionally highly deferential to the President in foreign affairs and national security. In cases like *United States v. Curtiss-Wright* (1936) and *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), the Court upheld broad executive actions based on statutory delegations. The base rate of the Court upholding presidential action in this domain is high, perhaps 80-90%.
*   **Statutory Interpretation of Agency Authority (Major Questions Doctrine):** In recent years, the current Court has frequently invalidated executive agency actions that have "vast economic and political significance" unless Congress has "clearly" authorized them. In cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), the Court has used this "major questions doctrine" to rein in the executive. The base rate for the government losing such cases before the current Court is high, perhaps 70-80%.
*   **Limitations:** This case uniquely blends all three classes. It involves foreign policy (trade, cartels) but has massive domestic economic effects, and it hinges on the statutory interpretation of a broad delegation. The rise of the major questions doctrine makes historical base rates less reliable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases — ↑ for a merits ruling (vs. Other/No ruling) — The Court's decision to take the case on an expedited schedule makes a ruling in 2025 highly probable and a procedural dismissal less likely.
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms ruling against tariffs (7-4) — ↑ for Unlawful/Mixed — A majority on a key appellate court, including one Republican appointee, found the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority, strengthening the legal case against them.
*   **2025-06-17** Plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* petition for cert before judgment — ↑ for a merits ruling — This move, combined with the government's own later petition, showed both sides sought a rapid and final resolution from the Supreme Court.
*   **2025-05-28** Two different federal courts rule tariffs unlawful — ↑ for Unlawful/Mixed — The fact that both the Court of International Trade and a D.C. District Court found the tariffs illegal, albeit for different reasons, created a strong early consensus against the government's position.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Major Questions Doctrine (Large, ↓ Lawful):** The Court's 6-3 conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming transformative powers without explicit congressional approval. Imposing a universal tariff regime is an action of vast economic and political significance, making it a prime candidate for invalidation under this doctrine.
*   **Statutory Textualism (Large, ↓ Lawful):** The text of the IEEPA allows the President to "regulate" importation but does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties," which are traditionally the domain of Congress's taxation power. A textualist-heavy Court is likely to find this omission significant and refuse to read such a major power into the statute.
*   **Foreign Affairs Deference (Moderate, ↑ Lawful):** The government's strongest argument is that the tariffs are a tool of foreign and national security policy, an area where the Court owes the President maximum deference. Justices concerned with limiting judicial intrusion into foreign policy may be swayed by this, particularly for the trafficking tariffs.
*   **Non-Delegation Doctrine (Small, ↓ Lawful):** Some justices (notably Gorsuch, Thomas) may argue that if Congress *did* delegate the power to set tariffs in the IEEPA, it was an unconstitutionally broad delegation of legislative power. This provides a separate, constitutional basis for striking down the tariffs.
*   **Severability (Moderate, ↑ Mixed):** The Court could easily separate the two tariff regimes. The "trafficking tariffs" are more plausibly linked to a traditional national security emergency than the "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits. This provides a clear off-ramp for a split decision, upholding one while striking the other.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** While IEEPA has been used for sanctions and asset freezes, it has never been used to implement a wholesale restructuring of U.S. tariff policy. This is a far more expansive claim of authority than in past IEEPA cases.
*   **Dominance of the Major Questions Doctrine:** Unlike in previous eras, this modern legal doctrine is a central feature of the current Court's jurisprudence. This significantly weakens the relevance of older precedents that were more deferential to executive interpretations of broad statutes.
*   **Clear Path to a "Mixed" Ruling:** The existence of two distinct tariff policies (trafficking vs. reciprocal) based on two different declared emergencies creates a natural dividing line for the Court, making a mixed outcome more plausible than in cases challenging a single, monolithic policy.
*   **Lower Court Consensus:** The fact that three different sets of lower court judges (CIT, DDC, and a majority of the en banc Federal Circuit) all concluded the tariffs were unlawful creates significant legal momentum against the government's position.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, blending the competing reference classes, would place the highest probability on **Tariffs unlawful** (~50%), followed by **Mixed ruling** (~30%), with low probabilities for **Tariffs lawful** (~15%) and **Other/No ruling** (~5%). This reflects a baseline skepticism of executive overreach in the domestic economic sphere.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Unlawful/Mixed) **Major Questions Doctrine as a primary judicial tool:** Large.
    *   (↑ Unlawful) **Absence of "tariff" in IEEPA's text:** Large.
    *   (↑ Mixed) **Distinct rationales for the two tariff types:** Moderate.
    *   (↑ Lawful) **Strong tradition of foreign affairs deference:** Moderate.
    *   (↑ Unlawful/Mixed) **Consensus outcome in lower courts:** Moderate.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior should shift further away from "Tariffs lawful" and concentrate probability on "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling." The likelihood of a complete victory for the government appears very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (probability of Lawful/Mixed increases):**
    *   Oral argument questions from key justices (Roberts, Kavanaugh, Barrett) focus heavily on the President's need for flexible tools in foreign policy.
    *   Questions from the bench analogize this case to *Trump v. Hawaii* (upholding the travel ban) rather than *West Virginia v. EPA*.
    *   Amicus briefs from former national security officials of both parties supporting the President's authority.
*   **DOWN indicators (probability of Unlawful increases):**
    *   Oral argument questions from conservative justices focus on the lack of the word "tariff" in the statute and the "major questions" doctrine.
    *   Questions from Justice Gorsuch or Thomas raise the non-delegation doctrine.
    *   The Solicitor General struggles to distinguish the tariffs from a pure tax or to define a limiting principle for the President's IEEPA power.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Justice Personalities:** The outcome could depend heavily on the views of one or two swing justices (e.g., Roberts, Kavanaugh) who must balance their preference for executive power in foreign affairs against their skepticism of broad regulatory authority.
*   **"Off-Ramps":** The Court could issue a narrow or procedural ruling that qualifies as "Other." For example, it could vacate the lower court rulings and remand for further consideration on a technical point, though the expedited schedule makes this less likely.
*   **Defining "Mixed":** A ruling could be complex. For instance, the Court could find the *declaration* of emergency for trade deficits is invalid, thereby striking down the reciprocal tariffs, while upholding the trafficking tariffs. This would clearly be a "Mixed" ruling.
*   **External Events:** A significant escalation in the "national emergencies" (e.g., a major cartel-related attack on U.S. soil) before the decision could subtly influence the justices' perception of the President's need for power, though this is unlikely to override core legal principles.

**Final Research Summary:** The legal headwinds against the tariffs are exceptionally strong, primarily due to the current Supreme Court's skepticism of broad executive power claims under the major questions doctrine and a textualist reading of the IEEPA statute. The most probable outcomes are that the Court will find all tariffs unlawful or issue a mixed ruling striking down the broad "reciprocal tariffs" while potentially upholding the more narrowly justified "trafficking tariffs."

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Court has shown deference to presidential authority in foreign policy and national security matters, with a base rate of 80-90% for upholding such actions. However, given the current Court's skepticism towards broad executive powers, especially under the major questions doctrine, a more conservative prior of 15% is appropriate.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The major questions doctrine and the textualist approach of the current Court suggest a high likelihood of striking down executive actions lacking explicit congressional authorization. The base rate for the government losing such cases is 70-80%. Given the lower court consensus against the tariffs, a prior of 50% is reasonable.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: The presence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provides a natural basis for a mixed ruling. Historical cases with complex issues often result in mixed outcomes. A prior of 30% reflects this possibility.
  
- **Other ruling**: Procedural dismissals or rulings without a merits decision are less likely given the expedited schedule and the Court's decision to hear the case. A prior of 3% is reasonable.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: The Supreme Court has already agreed to hear the case on an expedited basis, making the likelihood of no ruling by the end of 2025 very low. A prior of 2% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves presidential authority in foreign policy and national security, areas where the Court has traditionally shown deference.
  
- **Differences**: The major questions doctrine and the textualist approach are more prominent now, and the tariffs have significant domestic economic implications, which differ from typical foreign policy cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Major Questions Doctrine**: Strong evidence against "Tariffs lawful" due to the Court's recent trend of requiring clear congressional authorization for significant actions. Likelihood of evidence if tariffs are unlawful is high.
  
- **Textualism**: The absence of "tariff" in IEEPA's text is significant for a textualist Court, increasing the likelihood of finding the tariffs unlawful.
  
- **Foreign Affairs Deference**: Provides moderate support for "Tariffs lawful," but is countered by the domestic economic impact and statutory interpretation issues.
  
- **Lower Court Consensus**: The unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs increase the likelihood of the Supreme Court finding them unlawful or issuing a mixed ruling.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds = 15%, Likelihood ratio (considering major questions doctrine and textualism) = low, Posterior probability decreases.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds = 50%, Likelihood ratio (considering lower court consensus and major questions doctrine) = high, Posterior probability increases.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds = 30%, Likelihood ratio (considering severability and distinct tariff regimes) = moderate, Posterior probability remains stable or slightly increases.
  
- **Other ruling**: Prior odds = 3%, Likelihood ratio = low, Posterior probability decreases.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds = 2%, Likelihood ratio = very low, Posterior probability decreases.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of a procedural ruling or unexpected judicial reasoning.
  
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant geopolitical event could influence the Court's perception of national security needs.
  
- **Adjustments**: Slightly increase "Mixed ruling" probability to account for the possibility of a nuanced decision.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- **Tariffs lawful**: 10%
- **Tariffs unlawful**: 55%
- **Mixed ruling**: 30%
- **Other ruling**: 3%
- **No 2025 ruling**: 2%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
Mixed ruling: 30%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Tariffs lawful (15%)**: 
- In cases involving presidential authority in foreign affairs/national security, the Court has historically been deferential (e.g., Trump v. Hawaii upholding travel ban)
- However, this case involves domestic economic impact beyond typical foreign affairs cases

**Tariffs unlawful (45%)**:
- The current Court has consistently applied the "major questions doctrine" to limit executive power without clear congressional authorization
- Recent precedents like West Virginia v. EPA (2022) show the Court's skepticism of broad agency interpretations
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against the tariffs

**Mixed ruling (30%)**:
- The case involves two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) with different justifications
- This creates a natural path for the Court to distinguish between them
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically sensitive cases

**Other ruling (5%)**:
- Procedural dismissals are possible but unlikely given the expedited schedule
- The Court rarely takes cases on expedited review only to dismiss them

**No 2025 ruling (5%)**:
- The Court has already granted cert and scheduled argument for November 2025
- The expedited schedule suggests a ruling before year-end is highly likely

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major questions cases, this involves an agency claiming broad economic power
- Like other foreign affairs cases, it involves presidential authority in international matters
- Like other statutory interpretation cases, it hinges on the scope of delegated authority

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented scope: Never before has IEEPA been used to impose such sweeping tariffs
- Dual nature: This case uniquely blends foreign affairs (traditionally deferential) with major domestic economic regulation (traditionally skeptical)
- Lower court consensus: All lower courts ruled against the tariffs, though with different reasoning
- Clear dividing line: The two tariff regimes provide a natural path to a mixed ruling

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Lower courts unanimously ruled against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~10%): If tariffs were clearly lawful, at least some lower courts would likely have ruled that way
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%): This consensus strongly suggests legal problems with the tariffs
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~40%): Different reasoning in lower courts suggests potential for partial upholding

**Evidence: Major Questions Doctrine dominance in current Court**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~15%): This doctrine directly challenges broad agency interpretations
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~85%): The Court has consistently applied this doctrine to limit executive power
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~50%): The doctrine might apply differently to the two tariff regimes

**Evidence: Absence of "tariff" in IEEPA text**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%): The textualist-dominated Court is unlikely to read in powers not explicitly granted
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~75%): This textual gap provides a clear basis for invalidation
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~40%): The Court might find the text supports some tariffs but not others

**Evidence: Distinct rationales for two tariff types**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Moderate (~30%): Both could potentially be justified under different analyses
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = Low (~20%): The distinct rationales make it less likely both fail for the same reason
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~80%): This creates a natural path for upholding one while striking down the other

**Evidence: Expedited review granted**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very Low (~5%): The Court rarely expedites cases it doesn't intend to decide promptly
- P(E|Other ruling) = Low (~15%): Expedited review suggests the Court wants to address the merits

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the key evidence of lower court consensus against the tariffs:

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 15%
- Likelihood ratio: 10%/80% = 0.125
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.125 = 0.022
- Posterior probability: 0.022/(1+0.022) ≈ 2.2%

This dramatically reduces the probability of a fully lawful ruling.

For "Mixed ruling", updating on the distinct rationales evidence:
- Prior probability: 30%
- Likelihood ratio: 80%/20% = 4
- Prior odds: 30/70 = 0.429
- Posterior odds: 0.429 × 4 = 1.716
- Posterior probability: 1.716/(1+1.716) ≈ 63.2%

This significantly increases the probability of a mixed ruling.

For "Tariffs unlawful", updating on the major questions doctrine evidence:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Likelihood ratio: 85%/15% = 5.67
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.818
- Posterior odds: 0.818 × 5.67 = 4.638
- Posterior probability: 4.638/(1+4.638) ≈ 82.3%

This substantially increases the probability of an unlawful ruling.

After considering all evidence qualitatively, I need to balance these competing updates.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs
- The Court's conservative majority might be more sympathetic to Trump's policy goals than I've accounted for
- I might be overweighting the major questions doctrine relative to other interpretive approaches
- The Court could find a narrow procedural ground to avoid the merits entirely

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs based on national security while striking down the reciprocal tariffs
- The Court might issue a narrow ruling that limits IEEPA authority without completely invalidating the tariffs
- The Court could remand for further factual development on the connection between tariffs and emergencies

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should increase probability of "Mixed ruling" given the natural dividing line between tariff types
- I should decrease "Tariffs unlawful" somewhat given the foreign affairs deference tradition
- "No 2025 ruling" probability should be minimal given the expedited schedule

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, my final probabilities are:

**Tariffs lawful**: 5% (reduced from initial 15% due to lower court consensus and major questions doctrine)

**Tariffs unlawful**: 40% (slightly reduced from 45% to account for foreign affairs deference)

**Mixed ruling**: 50% (increased from 30% due to the distinct rationales for different tariffs)

**Other ruling**: 4% (slightly reduced from 5% given the expedited schedule suggests merits ruling)

**No 2025 ruling**: 1% (reduced from 5% given the expedited schedule makes this highly unlikely)

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 50%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will blend three relevant reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

*   **Major Separation-of-Powers Cases:** In cases where the President asserts broad domestic authority against Congress (e.g., *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*), the President often loses. This suggests a base rate of ~50-60% against the tariffs being lawful.
*   **Presidential Foreign Policy/National Security Actions:** The Court is traditionally highly deferential to the President in this domain (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*). This suggests a high base rate, perhaps 80-90%, for the tariffs being lawful.
*   **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** The current Court is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming vast, transformative power without explicit congressional authorization (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*). This suggests a high base rate, perhaps 70-80%, against the tariffs being lawful.

This case uniquely combines all three elements. However, the current Court's strong reliance on the MQD and textualism makes that reference class the most pertinent. Blending these competing base rates, with a heavy weight on the MQD, leads to a prior that is skeptical of the tariffs' lawfulness. A plausible starting point is:
*   P(Unlawful) = 50%
*   P(Mixed) = 30% (A common outcome in complex cases with multiple issues)
*   P(Lawful) = 15%
*   P(Other/No Ruling) = 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The case involves a President invoking a national emergency to take actions with significant economic impact, fitting patterns of both foreign policy deference and separation-of-powers challenges.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the unprecedented scale and nature of using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to set broad tariff policy, rather than for targeted sanctions. This novelty pushes the case squarely into the "major questions" framework. Furthermore, the existence of two distinct tariff regimes (trafficking vs. reciprocal) on separate justifications makes a "Mixed ruling" a particularly clean and logical outcome, more so than in cases challenging a single, unified policy.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence:** The consensus among lower courts (Court of International Trade, D.C. District Court, and a 7-4 majority of the en banc Federal Circuit) that the tariffs are unlawful.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence is much more likely if the tariffs are indeed unlawful or at least partially unlawful (P(E | Unlawful or Mixed)) than if they are fully lawful (P(E | Lawful)). This consensus creates strong legal momentum against the government's position.
*   **Evidence:** The current Supreme Court's robust application of the Major Questions Doctrine and textualism.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is the strongest evidence against the tariffs. Imposing a new, nationwide tariff regime is an action of "vast economic and political significance." The absence of the specific words "tariff" or "duty" in the IEEPA is a critical omission for a textualist court. This evidence makes an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" outcome highly likely (high P(E | Unlawful or Mixed)) and a "Lawful" outcome very unlikely (low P(E | Lawful)).
*   **Evidence:** The existence of two distinct tariff policies (trafficking-related and trade deficit-related).
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This feature of the case significantly increases the probability of a "Mixed ruling." It provides the Court a clear path to strike down the more economically-based "reciprocal tariffs" under the MQD while potentially upholding the "trafficking tariffs" by granting foreign policy deference. The likelihood P(E | Mixed) is very high.
*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court granting certiorari on an expedited schedule.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This action is highly probable if the Court intends to issue a merits ruling in 2025. It makes the "No 2025 ruling" option extremely unlikely. It also makes a procedural "Other ruling" less likely, as it signals an intent to resolve the substantive legal question.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with the prior (Unlawful 50%, Mixed 30%, Lawful 15%, Other/No Ruling 5%):

1.  The lower court consensus strongly reinforces the initial skepticism. This shifts probability away from "Lawful" and towards "Unlawful" and "Mixed".
2.  The powerful combination of the Major Questions Doctrine and textualism is the key factor. This decimates the probability of "Tariffs lawful," as it would require the Court's conservative majority to act against its established jurisprudence. Let's update the odds: Prior odds of Lawful vs. Not-Lawful are 15:85 (or ~0.18). The evidence (MQD, textualism) has a very strong likelihood ratio against Lawfulness, perhaps 1:10. The posterior odds become ~0.018, which is a probability of around 2-3%.
3.  The severability of the two tariff types provides a clear off-ramp for a compromise decision. This pulls probability from a clean sweep "Unlawful" ruling towards a "Mixed ruling." This makes these two outcomes nearly equally likely.
4.  The expedited schedule all but eliminates the "No 2025 ruling" option and reduces the chance of an "Other" procedural ruling.

After updating for all evidence, the probability mass is concentrated on "Unlawful" and "Mixed," with a small tail risk for "Lawful" or "Other."

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary forecast is that the government will lose, either completely or in part. The best argument for the alternative ("Tariffs lawful") is that the 6-3 conservative majority prioritizes executive power in national security above all else, viewing the MQD as applicable only to domestic agencies. They could read IEEPA's broad language deferentially, similar to the *Trump v. Hawaii* decision. The 7-4 split in the Federal Circuit, with four judges dissenting, shows there is a non-frivolous argument for the government's position. This suggests that a "Lawful" outcome, while unlikely, should not be dismissed entirely and warrants a probability higher than a mere 2-3%. I will adjust the "Lawful" probability upward slightly, drawing primarily from the "Unlawful" category, as the logic for a "Mixed" ruling remains very compelling as a compromise.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the reasoning, I will distribute the probabilities as follows: "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling" are the most likely and roughly equiprobable outcomes. "Tariffs lawful" is a small but non-trivial possibility. "Other ruling" is a small procedural possibility, and "No 2025 ruling" is nearly impossible given the timeline.

*   **Tariffs unlawful:** 45%
*   **Mixed ruling:** 45%
*   **Tariffs lawful:** 8%
*   **Other ruling:** 2%
*   **No 2025 ruling:** 0%

This distribution sums to 100%.

Tariffs lawful: 8%
Tariffs unlawful: 45%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 0%
