### Reference class & base rates
*   **First successful landing of a new orbital-class reusable booster:** This is the most relevant class. SpaceX's Falcon 9 is the only successful precedent. It took them five dedicated attempts before their first successful booster landing in December 2015. This suggests a base rate for success on any given *early* attempt is low, perhaps **20-25%**. This is a strong reference but limited by a sample size of one company.
*   **Maiden flight of a new heavy-lift launch vehicle:** Historically, the success rate for the absolute first flight of a new large rocket is around 50-60%. New Glenn already succeeded on this front by reaching orbit on its first attempt (NG-1). This question concerns the *second* flight and a specific secondary objective (landing). The success rate for a second flight is generally higher, perhaps **75-85%**, but this applies to the primary mission (reaching orbit), not the experimental landing.
*   **Blue Origin's suborbital booster landings (New Shepard):** Blue Origin has a near-perfect record of landing its suborbital New Shepard booster. However, the physics are vastly different and less demanding (lower altitude, lower velocity, less aerodynamic stress) than an orbital-class booster return. This provides a weak positive signal about institutional competence in vertical landings but is not directly comparable. Base rate here is >95%, but its applicability is low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-09] Launch schedule lists the EscaPADE mission for November 2025. ↑ — Reinforces the company's public commitment to a launch within the resolution window.
*   [2025-10-23] Report notes completion of stage separation and booster recovery tests in September. ↑ — Indicates successful ground testing of key systems required for a landing attempt, de-risking the procedure.
*   [2025-10-08] "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster rolled out to the launch pad. ↑ — A major physical milestone demonstrating the hardware is ready for pre-flight processing and launch is imminent.
*   [2025-06-01] Previous March-May 2025 launch window was missed. ↓ — Demonstrates a history of schedule slips, increasing the risk of the current Nov/Dec target also being delayed into 2026.
*   [2025-01-16] First New Glenn (NG-1) reached orbit but the booster was lost. ↑↓ — The successful ascent is a massive de-risking factor for the rocket overall (↑). The failed landing provides invaluable data for this second attempt (↑), but also proves the difficulty of the task (↓).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Learning from NG-1 Failure (Large):** Blue Origin now has a complete set of real-world flight data from a full launch and landing attempt. The specific failure mode of the first booster is known internally, allowing for targeted fixes. This is the single largest driver increasing the probability of success.
*   **Corporate Philosophy (Moderate):** Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" (step-by-step, ferociously) motto implies a cautious, test-heavy approach. This suggests they will not launch unless they have high confidence, which increases the chance of success *if a launch occurs*, but also increases the chance of a delay into 2026 if any anomalies are found.
*   **Schedule Pressure (Moderate):** With only two months left in 2025, the timeline is extremely tight. Any technical issue, software glitch, or unfavorable weather could push the launch into 2026. They also have a NASA mission (EscaPADE) on board, adding external pressure to launch but also a higher bar for mission assurance.
*   **Technical Complexity of Landing (Large):** The terminal phase of landing is a complex, high-energy event involving engine relights, precise GNC (guidance, navigation, and control), and deployment of landing gear. A failure in any one of these sub-systems results in failure for this question.
*   **BE-4 Engine Performance (Moderate):** The BE-4 engines are relatively new. Their reliability, particularly during the high-stress relight and throttling sequence required for the landing burn, is a key variable. The successful ascent of NG-1 provides confidence, but the landing burn is a different operational profile.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Not a True "First Attempt":** Unlike the reference class of a company's very first landing attempt, this is Blue Origin's second. They possess invaluable flight data from the first failed attempt, which SpaceX did not have on its first try. This significantly improves their odds relative to the base rate.
*   **Extensive Suborbital Experience:** While not directly comparable, Blue Origin's years of successful New Shepard landings provide a deep well of institutional knowledge in GNC, engine restart, and vertical landing procedures that SpaceX did not have at the outset of its Falcon 9 program.
*   **Patient Capital:** Blue Origin is funded by Jeff Bezos's personal fortune, making it less sensitive to the commercial pressures that drove SpaceX's rapid "fail to learn" iteration cycle. This allows for a more methodical, but slower, development pace.
*   **Single Integrated System:** Blue Origin designs and builds the engines (BE-4) and the rocket itself. This tight integration can accelerate problem-solving and optimization based on data from the first flight.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of **~25%** seems appropriate, anchored on the Falcon 9 reference class for a first *successful* landing being difficult and taking multiple attempts (equivalent n ≈ 4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The wealth of data gathered from the NG-1 flight and failed landing attempt is the most significant positive update, allowing for targeted improvements.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Recent hardware milestones (pad rollout, completed ground tests) show tangible progress toward a near-term launch.
    *   ↑ (Small): Institutional knowledge from the successful New Shepard program provides a solid, if not directly applicable, foundation.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The very tight schedule with less than nine weeks remaining in 2025. The company has a demonstrated history of slipping launch targets.
    *   ↓ (Small): The inherent technical complexity of the landing maneuver means a high chance of failure remains, even with good data.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision. The data from NG-1 is a powerful counterweight to the low base rate. The posterior should move significantly upward, likely more than doubling the prior, with schedule risk being the primary remaining uncertainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a successful Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR).
    *   Completion of a successful static fire test of the booster on the pad.
    *   Firm launch date announced by Blue Origin or NASA for November/early December.
    *   Issuance of an FAA launch license for the EscaPADE mission.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Scrubbed static fire or WDR attempt, or news of an anomaly during testing.
    *   Booster being rolled back from the pad to the integration facility.
    *   Official statements pushing the launch target to "late December" or "end of year."
    *   Significant weather delays (e.g., tropical storm) impacting the Florida launch site.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The question requires *both* a launch in 2025 *and* a successful landing. A successful launch in 2025 with another lost booster resolves as NO. A successful landing in January 2026 resolves as NO.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously less transparent than SpaceX. Key information about the cause of the first failure and the specific fixes implemented is not public, forcing reliance on external observation and official press releases.
*   **"Success" Definition:** "Successful landing" is not precisely defined. It is generally understood to mean the booster lands intact on the recovery ship in a condition suitable for refurbishment and reuse, but edge cases (e.g., a hard landing causing significant damage but not destruction) could be ambiguous.
*   **Weather Risk:** Florida weather in November/December can be unpredictable, and multiple weather-related scrubs could easily push the attempt into 2026.
*   **Conflating Launch with Landing:** Media reports may focus on a successful launch to orbit for the EscaPADE payload, while downplaying or delaying news on the secondary objective of the booster landing. The resolution hinges entirely on the latter.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a new orbital booster's first successful landing is low. However, Blue Origin has crucial flight data from its first attempt and has hit key pre-launch milestones, suggesting a significantly higher probability of technical success; the primary remaining risk is the tight schedule and the company's history of delays pushing the launch attempt past the 2025 deadline.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a first successful landing of a new orbital-class reusable booster is approximately 20-25%, based on SpaceX's Falcon 9 experience. This is a strong reference class, albeit limited to one company. Given Blue Origin's cautious approach and the fact that this is their second attempt, a prior probability of 25% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are attempting to land a reusable orbital-class booster. Blue Origin has the advantage of learning from a previous failed attempt, similar to SpaceX's iterative learning process.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard, which SpaceX did not have initially. Blue Origin's cautious approach contrasts with SpaceX's rapid iteration, potentially increasing the chance of success if a launch occurs but also increasing the risk of delay.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Successful ground tests and hardware milestones (e.g., stage separation and booster recovery tests) suggest readiness and increase the probability of success (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - The tight schedule and history of delays decrease the probability of a 2025 launch (Likelihood ratio < 1).
   - The failed landing of NG-1 provides valuable data, increasing the probability of a successful landing on the second attempt (Likelihood ratio > 1).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 25% / 75% = 1/3
   - Considering the positive evidence from NG-1 data and recent milestones, the likelihood ratio for success is greater than 1. Assuming a moderate increase, let's say the likelihood ratio is 2.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (1/3) × 2 = 2/3
   - Posterior probability = (2/3) / (1 + 2/3) = 2/5 = 40%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The tight schedule and Blue Origin's history of delays are significant risks that could push the launch into 2026.
   - Alternative scenario: A delay into 2026 is plausible given the tight timeline and potential for technical issues.
   - Adjustments: Considering the schedule risk, a slight downward adjustment to account for the possibility of delay is warranted.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final probability of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launching before 2026 and successfully landing is 35%.

Final: 35%

# Probability Analysis: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" Launch and Land Successfully Before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a successful orbital-class booster landing on an early attempt, combined with the probability of launch occurring within the timeframe.

The most relevant reference class is SpaceX's Falcon 9 development, which took 5 attempts before achieving a successful landing. This suggests a ~20% success rate per early attempt. However, Blue Origin's case differs in important ways:

- This is their second attempt, not their first
- They have data from the first failure
- They have extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard

Given these factors, I'll start with a base rate of 25% for a successful landing if the launch occurs. But I must also factor in the probability of launching before 2026, with only about 2 months remaining in 2025 and Blue Origin's history of delays.

**Prior probability: 25% × 70% = 17.5%** (where 70% represents the chance of launching in the remaining 2 months of 2025)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Attempting to land an orbital-class first stage booster
- Early in the program's development cycle
- Similar technical challenges (engine restart, precision guidance, landing gear deployment)

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has flight data from their first attempt (SpaceX didn't have this advantage on their first try)
- Blue Origin has extensive experience with vertical landings from their New Shepard program
- Blue Origin's development approach is more methodical and cautious than SpaceX's rapid iteration
- The timeline is extremely constrained (less than 9 weeks remaining in 2025)
- Blue Origin has already demonstrated orbital capability with New Glenn

These differences suggest a higher probability of technical success than the base rate would indicate, but also a significant risk of schedule slippage beyond 2025.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent hardware milestones**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If they will launch and land successfully in 2025, we would expect to see the booster at the pad now
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if they won't succeed, they might still roll out hardware
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Data from NG-1 failure**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.99) - A successful landing would almost certainly require learning from the first failure
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Even with this data, success is not guaranteed due to complexity
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Tight schedule with only 2 months left in 2025**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - If they will succeed, the schedule must be achievable
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Schedule pressure is a common reason for failure or delay
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75
- This evidence decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Blue Origin's history of schedule slips**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If they will succeed on time, they must overcome this pattern
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Past behavior predicts future behavior
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 17.5% / 82.5% = 0.212

Updating with evidence:
- Evidence 1: 0.212 × 1.9 = 0.403
- Evidence 2: 0.403 × 1.4 = 0.564
- Evidence 3: 0.564 × 0.75 = 0.423
- Evidence 4: 0.423 × 0.375 = 0.159

Converting back to probability: 0.159 / (1 + 0.159) = 13.7%

However, I need to consider additional factors not fully captured in this calculation:

1. The recent rollout to the pad and completion of stage separation tests are strong signals of readiness
2. The "Never Tell Me The Odds" name suggests internal confidence
3. The NASA EscaPADE mission provides external schedule pressure

These factors suggest an upward adjustment to approximately 18-20%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the technical difficulty of landing an orbital-class booster
- I might be overestimating Blue Origin's ability to maintain their current schedule
- Weather risks in Florida during November/December could cause multiple delays
- The question requires both launch in 2025 AND successful landing - two separate hurdles

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would place the probability around 10%, arguing that:
1. Blue Origin's methodical approach makes them more likely to delay than risk failure
2. The tight timeline leaves no margin for error or technical issues
3. Even with data from the first attempt, landing remains extremely challenging

**Rebuttal:**
The recent hardware milestones and completed tests suggest they are on track for a 2025 attempt. The data from the first flight significantly improves their chances compared to a true first attempt.

After considering these perspectives, I believe my estimate of 18-20% is reasonable but should be adjusted slightly downward to account for the dual requirement of both launching in 2025 AND achieving a successful landing.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the base rate, and the specific requirements of the question, I arrive at a final probability of 18%.

Final: 18%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

The question asks for the probability of two conditions being met: the launch of "Never Tell Me The Odds" must happen before 2026, AND the booster must land successfully. I will analyze the probability of each condition separately and then multiply them to get the final forecast.

Let P(A) = The probability of a launch attempt in 2025.
Let P(B) = The probability of a successful landing, conditional on a launch attempt in 2025.
The final forecast is P(A) × P(B).

### Analysis of P(A): Launch in 2025

1.  **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
    -   **Reference Class**: New, heavy-lift launch vehicles attempting to meet a near-term (in this case, ~9-week) launch window after having already experienced previous schedule slips.
    -   **Base Rate**: This reference class has a very high rate of delays. Programs like SLS, Ariane 6, and Vulcan all experienced multi-year delays. The base rate probability of a new vehicle in this class meeting a tight, publicly-stated deadline is low. I'll set a skeptical prior of **P(A) = 40%**.

2.  **Comparison to Base Case**
    -   **Similarities**: New Glenn has already missed a previous 2025 launch window, fitting the pattern of delays common to this reference class. The remaining timeline is very tight.
    -   **Differences**: Unlike many vehicles at this stage, New Glenn has already had a successful orbital flight (NG-1). This removes a massive amount of risk and potential for major redesigns that cause long delays. Furthermore, the hardware for this second flight is physically assembled and on the launch pad, a major milestone that many delayed rockets fail to reach for years.

3.  **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
    -   **Evidence for a 2025 Launch (Increases Probability)**:
        -   **Booster on the launch pad (Oct 8)**: This is very strong evidence. It moves the project from the abstract world of schedules into the physical world of launch processing. Likelihood Ratio (LR) is high.
        -   **Key ground tests completed (Sep)**: This de-risks the pre-flight campaign. LR is moderately high.
        -   **Public target of Nov 2025**: This signals company intent, though such targets are often missed. LR is slightly high.
    -   **Evidence Against a 2025 Launch (Decreases Probability)**:
        -   **Tight Schedule**: With ~9 weeks left in 2025, there is little room for error during the final tests (Wet Dress Rehearsal, Static Fire), weather delays, or technical scrubs. LR is low.
        -   **Blue Origin's Cautious Culture**: The company's motto and history suggest they will favor a delay over rushing to meet a deadline if any anomaly is found. LR is moderately low.

4.  **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability for P(A))**
    -   The prior is a skeptical 40%. However, the evidence of the booster being physically on the pad is a powerful update. It indicates the long-lead integration and manufacturing challenges are overcome. While the schedule risk remains significant, the vehicle's physical readiness suggests a launch attempt is more likely than not. I will update the probability significantly upwards from the base rate.
    -   My posterior estimate is **P(A) = 65%**.

### Analysis of P(B): Successful Landing (Conditional on Launch)

1.  **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
    -   **Reference Class**: An organization's first successful landing of an orbital-class booster.
    -   **Base Rate**: The only successful precedent is SpaceX's Falcon 9. It took them five dedicated attempts to achieve their first successful landing. This implies a low per-attempt success rate in the early phase. I'll set the prior at **P(B) = 20%**, reflecting a 1-in-5 success rate.

2.  **Comparison to Base Case**
    -   **Similarities**: The physics of re-entering and propulsively landing a massive first stage are fundamentally the same as what SpaceX faced. It is an extremely complex maneuver with many potential points of failure.
    -   **Differences**: This is Blue Origin's *second* attempt, not its first. They have a complete set of flight data from the first attempt's failure, which is an enormous advantage. SpaceX also learned from its failures, but Blue Origin gets to apply lessons from a full flight profile to its second attempt. Additionally, Blue Origin has years of successful suborbital landing experience with New Shepard, which provides deep institutional knowledge in relevant GNC and engine control systems.

3.  **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
    -   **Evidence for a Successful Landing (Increases Probability)**:
        -   **Data from NG-1 Failure**: This is the single most important factor. Knowing what went wrong allows for targeted fixes. This evidence makes success on this attempt much more likely than on a generic "early attempt". The LR is very high.
        -   **New Shepard Program Success**: Demonstrates proven competence in the core concepts of vertical propulsive landing. The LR is moderately high.
        -   **Cautious Culture**: Implies that the fixes for the NG-1 failure have been thoroughly vetted and tested, increasing confidence in their efficacy. The LR is moderately high.
    -   **Evidence Against a Successful Landing (Decreases Probability)**:
        -   **Inherent Technical Complexity**: The maneuver remains one of the most difficult in rocketry. A new, unknown failure mode could emerge, or the implemented fix could be incomplete. The base rate is low for a reason.

4.  **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability for P(B))**
    -   Starting with a prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), the evidence provides a strong upward push. The data from the NG-1 flight is a game-changer. I estimate this evidence has a likelihood ratio of at least 4:1, as it allows them to solve a known problem rather than flying blind.
    -   *Update Step*: Prior odds (1/4) × LR (4) = Posterior odds (1). This translates to a 50% probability.
    -   Factoring in the secondary evidence from the New Shepard program and their methodical approach, I will apply a further small upward adjustment.
    -   My posterior estimate is **P(B) = 60%**.

### Red Team Thinking

I've broken the problem into two parts. The primary risk to my forecast is that I have misjudged one or both of these probabilities. An alternative forecast of ~25% would be plausible if one believes the schedule risk is higher (e.g., P(A)=50%) and that the lessons from one failed flight are not enough to overcome the immense difficulty of landing (e.g., P(B)=50%). However, I believe this view underweights the significance of having the hardware on the pad and having real-world flight data to analyze. My forecast of 39% acknowledges that success is still less likely than failure, but gives appropriate weight to the major positive developments.

### Final Forecast

To calculate the final probability, I multiply the probabilities of the two necessary conditions:
P(Event) = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025)
P(Event) = 0.65 × 0.60 = 0.39

Final: 39%
