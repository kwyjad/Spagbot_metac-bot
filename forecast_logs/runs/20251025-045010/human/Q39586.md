### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Virginia Gubernatorial Elections with an Incumbent President (1977-2021):** This is the strongest reference class for the Virginia race. In the 12 elections held since 1977, the party holding the White House has lost the Virginia governorship 11 times. The only exception was in 2013 (Democrat Terry McAuliffe won with Democrat Barack Obama in the White House).
    *   **Base Rate (VA):** ~92% (11/12) chance the party opposite the president wins. With a Democrat in the White House, this implies a ~92% base rate for a Republican victory.
2.  **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (1981-2021):** This is a straightforward reference class for New Jersey. Over the last 11 gubernatorial elections, Democrats have won 6 and Republicans have won 5. However, Democrats have won 4 of the last 6.
    *   **Base Rate (NJ):** ~55-60% chance of a Democratic victory. The state has a strong Democratic lean in federal elections, but has shown a willingness to elect Republican governors (e.g., Christie Whitman, Chris Christie).
3.  **Combined Base Rate:** Based on these two independent historical patterns, the most likely outcome is a split decision.
    *   **Base Rate (Combined):** The probability of "Only New Jersey" (GOP wins VA, Dem wins NJ) would be the highest, at roughly 0.92 * 0.60 ≈ 55%. The probability of "Both elections" would be very low, at 0.08 * 0.60 ≈ 5%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-22** Spanberger and Earle-Sears hold final debate in Virginia. — **↑ Both/Only VA** — Spanberger was widely seen as having a stronger performance, focusing on kitchen-table issues and portraying Earle-Sears as an extremist on abortion, which resonates in moderate Northern Virginia suburbs.
*   **2025-10-17** Major Virginia newspaper endorses Spanberger. — **↑ Both/Only VA** — The Richmond Times-Dispatch, which has previously endorsed Republicans, backed Spanberger, citing her pragmatism and bipartisan record in Congress. This provides cover for moderate Republicans and independents.
*   **2025-10-15** New Jersey poll shows Sherrill with a 7-point lead. — **↑ Both/Only NJ** — A Monmouth University poll shows Sherrill leading Ciattarelli 51-44. While a solid lead, it is within the margin of error of a polling miss, similar to the 2021 election where polls underestimated GOP support.
*   **2025-10-10** Ciattarelli launches major ad campaign focused on NJ property taxes. — **↑ Only VA/Neither** — The campaign is a significant, well-funded push on Ciattarelli's strongest issue, which was highly effective for him in 2021 and could tighten the race in its final weeks.
*   **2025-09-28** National inflation report shows a slight uptick. — **↓ Both/Only VA/Only NJ** — Unfavorable economic news, even if minor, hurts the incumbent party (Democrats) at the national level, providing a headwind for both Spanberger and Sherrill.
*   **2025-09-15** Virginia poll shows Spanberger with a 4-point lead. — **↑ Both/Only VA** — A poll from Virginia Commonwealth University shows Spanberger leading Earle-Sears 49-45, providing consistent evidence that she is outperforming the historical trend against the president's party.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Approval:** The single most important driver in off-year elections. A low approval rating for the Democratic president creates a strong headwind for both Democratic candidates, energizing the opposition and depressing base turnout. (Size: Large)
2.  **Candidate Quality and Ideological Fit:** Spanberger (VA) and Sherrill (NJ) are both former federal officials (CIA, Navy) with records as moderates who have won in competitive districts. This contrasts with Earle-Sears (VA), who is more closely aligned with the national GOP's conservative wing, and Ciattarelli (NJ), who nearly won in 2021 but may have a ceiling on his support. (Size: Large)
3.  **The Salience of Abortion Rights:** In the post-Dobbs era, abortion access has become a powerful mobilizing issue for Democrats and independents, particularly in suburban areas like Northern Virginia and North Jersey. This may be a key factor overriding traditional off-year dynamics. (Size: Moderate to Large)
4.  **State-Specific Economic Concerns:** In New Jersey, high property taxes are a perennial and potent issue that Republicans effectively leverage. In Virginia, the economic health of the D.C. suburbs and state budget issues are key. These can decouple the races from the national environment. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Gubernatorial Legacy:** The popularity of the outgoing governor can be a factor. In NJ, Phil Murphy's legacy is mixed, potentially creating an opening for Ciattarelli. In VA, Glenn Youngkin's term provides a recent GOP benchmark for voters to judge Earle-Sears against. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Virginia's Changing Demographics:** The "Virginia curse" reference class is based on a state that was politically different. The massive growth of the bluer, more diverse Northern Virginia suburbs has made the state significantly less conservative than it was for most of the 1977-2021 period.
*   **Weakness of the "Curse":** The curse was broken in 2013, and the 2021 Youngkin victory was by a narrow 1.9% margin. This suggests the effect, while real, may be weakening and is not an insurmountable barrier for a strong candidate.
*   **Strong Democratic Candidate in VA:** Abigail Spanberger is arguably a stronger, more moderate Democratic candidate than Terry McAuliffe was in his 2021 loss. Her profile as a former CIA officer may appeal to Virginia's large population of federal workers and veterans.
*   **Ciattarelli's Known Quantity in NJ:** Unlike a fresh challenger, Ciattarelli ran a very strong race in 2021. This gives him high name recognition but also means his opposition is well-defined. He may struggle to win over voters who rejected him once already, limiting his upside.
*   **The Post-Dobbs Political Environment:** The base rate period does not account for the political realignment around abortion rights following the 2022 Supreme Court decision. This issue provides a structural advantage to Democrats that did not exist in most prior off-year elections.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior should be anchored to the reference classes, favoring the "Only New Jersey" outcome with a probability of ~50-60%, and a very low prior (~5%) on "Both elections" due to the powerful Virginia historical trend.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** Consistent polling showing Spanberger leading in Virginia directly contradicts the strong historical prior and is the most significant piece of new evidence.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The post-Dobbs political environment and Spanberger's strong candidate profile provide a clear mechanism for why the Virginia base rate might fail this cycle.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Polling in New Jersey confirms the base-rate expectation of a Democratic-favored race, slightly strengthening the "Both" and "Only New Jersey" outcomes.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Ciattarelli's proven strength in 2021 and the persistent headwind of a Democratic president prevent the NJ race from being a lock, providing some evidence for the "Only Virginia" and "Neither" outcomes.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the Virginia prior is wrong. The posterior should move significantly away from "Only New Jersey" and towards "Both elections." The probability of a Democratic win in Virginia should be updated from <10% to something closer to 50-60%, making "Both elections" a highly plausible, if not the most likely, outcome.

To forecast the outcomes of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections for the Democrats, let's apply Bayesian reasoning step-by-step:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Virginia**: Historically, Virginia has elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President in 11 out of the last 12 elections. With a Democrat in the White House, the base rate suggests a 92% chance for a Republican victory. However, recent demographic changes and Spanberger's strong candidacy suggest this base rate may be less applicable.
  
- **New Jersey**: Democrats have won 6 out of the last 11 gubernatorial elections, with a stronger recent trend (4 out of the last 6). This suggests a base rate of 55-60% for a Democratic victory.

- **Combined Base Rate**: The most likely outcome based on historical trends is "Only New Jersey" (Democrats win NJ, Republicans win VA) with a base rate of approximately 55%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia**: The historical trend is strong, but Spanberger's lead in polls and her moderate profile suggest a significant deviation from the base rate. The "Virginia curse" may be weakening due to demographic shifts and Spanberger's appeal.

- **New Jersey**: The base rate aligns with current polling, showing Sherrill leading. However, Ciattarelli's strong campaign on property taxes could tighten the race.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia Polls**: Spanberger's consistent lead in polls suggests a higher likelihood of a Democratic win than the historical base rate indicates. This evidence is strong and shifts the probability towards "Both elections" and "Only Virginia."

- **New Jersey Polls**: Sherrill's lead in polls supports the base rate expectation of a Democratic win, reinforcing "Both elections" and "Only New Jersey."

- **Economic Concerns**: National inflation and NJ property taxes are headwinds for Democrats, slightly increasing the likelihood of "Only Virginia" and "Neither."

- **Candidate Quality**: Spanberger and Sherrill's moderate profiles and strong campaigns increase the likelihood of Democratic wins in both states.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia**: The prior of 8% for a Democratic win is significantly updated by polling and demographic evidence. A reasonable posterior might be around 50-60% for a Democratic win.

- **New Jersey**: The prior of 55-60% for a Democratic win is reinforced by polling, suggesting a posterior of around 60-65%.

- **Combined Outcomes**:
  - **Both elections**: With updated probabilities for both states, this outcome becomes plausible, around 30-40%.
  - **Only Virginia**: Less likely given NJ polling, around 10-15%.
  - **Only New Jersey**: Still plausible but less dominant, around 35-45%.
  - **Neither election**: Least likely, around 5-10%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The historical trend in Virginia is strong, but current evidence suggests a significant shift. The forecast should account for the possibility of polling errors or late shifts in voter sentiment.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the impact of last-minute campaign developments or national events that could sway undecided voters.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- **Both elections**: 35%
- **Only Virginia**: 10%
- **Only New Jersey**: 45%
- **Neither election**: 10%

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 35%  
Only Virginia: 10%  
Only New Jersey: 45%  
Neither election: 10%

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical base rate: In 11 out of 12 gubernatorial elections since 1977, the party opposite the White House has won in Virginia.
- With a Democrat in the White House in 2025, this gives Republicans a ~92% chance historically.
- Prior probability for Democratic win in Virginia: 8%

**New Jersey:**
- Democrats have won 6 of the last 11 gubernatorial elections (~55%).
- More recently, Democrats have won 4 of the last 6 elections.
- New Jersey leans Democratic in federal elections but has elected Republican governors.
- Prior probability for Democratic win in New Jersey: 60%

**Combined prior probabilities:**
- Both elections (Dem): 8% × 60% = 4.8%
- Only Virginia (Dem): 8% × 40% = 3.2%
- Only New Jersey (Dem): 92% × 60% = 55.2%
- Neither election (Dem): 92% × 40% = 36.8%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- These are still off-year elections where the president's party typically faces headwinds
- New Jersey remains a state that leans Democratic but can elect Republican governors
- Virginia still has its historical pattern of alternating parties

**Key differences:**
- Virginia's demographics have shifted significantly with growth in blue Northern Virginia suburbs
- The post-Dobbs political environment has changed electoral dynamics, particularly for Democrats
- Both Democratic candidates (Spanberger and Sherrill) have strong moderate profiles
- Current polling shows Democrats leading in both states, contradicting the historical Virginia pattern
- Ciattarelli in NJ is a known quantity who narrowly lost in 2021, not a fresh challenger

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia evidence:**
- Polling shows Spanberger with a 4-point lead (49-45%)
  - P(E|Dem wins): Very high (~90%)
  - P(E|Dem loses): Low (~15%)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~6:1 favoring Democratic win
- Spanberger's strong debate performance
  - P(E|Dem wins): Moderately high (~70%)
  - P(E|Dem loses): Moderate (~40%)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~1.75:1 favoring Democratic win
- Major Virginia newspaper endorsement
  - P(E|Dem wins): Moderately high (~65%)
  - P(E|Dem loses): Moderate (~35%)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~1.86:1 favoring Democratic win

**New Jersey evidence:**
- Polling shows Sherrill with a 7-point lead (51-44%)
  - P(E|Dem wins): Very high (~85%)
  - P(E|Dem loses): Low (~20%)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~4.25:1 favoring Democratic win
- Ciattarelli's property tax campaign
  - P(E|Dem wins): Moderate (~50%)
  - P(E|Dem loses): Moderately high (~70%)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.71:1 (favoring Republican win)

**Shared evidence:**
- Slight uptick in inflation
  - P(E|Dem wins): Moderate (~50%)
  - P(E|Dem loses): Moderately high (~65%)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.77:1 (favoring Republican wins)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia update:**
- Prior odds for Democratic win: 8:92 = 0.087:1
- Combined likelihood ratio from evidence: ~6 × 1.75 × 1.86 × 0.77 ≈ 15.1:1
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 15.1 ≈ 1.31:1
- Posterior probability: 1.31/(1+1.31) ≈ 57%

This represents a massive shift from the 8% prior to a 57% posterior probability of a Democratic win in Virginia, driven primarily by polling evidence and candidate quality.

**New Jersey update:**
- Prior odds for Democratic win: 60:40 = 1.5:1
- Combined likelihood ratio from evidence: ~4.25 × 0.71 × 0.77 ≈ 2.32:1
- Posterior odds: 1.5 × 2.32 ≈ 3.48:1
- Posterior probability: 3.48/(1+3.48) ≈ 78%

This represents a significant increase from the 60% prior to a 78% posterior probability of a Democratic win in New Jersey.

**Combined posterior probabilities:**
- Both elections (Dem): 57% × 78% ≈ 44.5%
- Only Virginia (Dem): 57% × 22% ≈ 12.5%
- Only New Jersey (Dem): 43% × 78% ≈ 33.5%
- Neither election (Dem): 43% × 22% ≈ 9.5%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polling errors: Polls have systematically underestimated Republican support in recent cycles
- Late shifts: Off-year elections often break late toward the out-party (Republicans)
- Turnout uncertainty: Lower turnout elections are more volatile
- Overconfidence in Virginia trend reversal: The historical pattern is extremely strong

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Economic concerns could dominate in the final weeks, hurting Democrats
- Ciattarelli's property tax campaign could gain more traction than expected
- Earle-Sears could benefit from Youngkin's moderate Republican governance model
- The "Virginia curse" could reassert itself despite polling

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce confidence in Virginia Democratic win from 57% to 52%
- Slightly reduce New Jersey Democratic win from 78% to 75%
- These adjustments account for historical patterns and polling uncertainties

## 6. Final Normalization

**Recalculated combined probabilities:**
- Both elections (Dem): 52% × 75% = 39%
- Only Virginia (Dem): 52% × 25% = 13%
- Only New Jersey (Dem): 48% × 75% = 36%
- Neither election (Dem): 48% × 25% = 12%

Sum check: 39% + 13% + 36% + 12% = 100%

## 7. Output Format

Both elections: 39%  
Only Virginia: 13%  
Only New Jersey: 36%  
Neither election: 12%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will analyze the historical outcomes in each state and combine them, assuming they are independent events for the initial base rate.

*   **Virginia:** The strongest reference class is the "Virginia curse," where the party holding the White House has lost the Virginia gubernatorial election in 11 of the last 12 contests since 1977. With a Democrat in the White House, this establishes a strong prior for a Republican victory.
    *   Prior P(Democrat wins VA) = 1/12 ≈ 8%
    *   Prior P(Republican wins VA) = 11/12 ≈ 92%

*   **New Jersey:** The state is more of a toss-up in gubernatorial races despite its blue lean in federal elections. Over the last 11 elections, Democrats have won 6 and Republicans 5.
    *   Prior P(Democrat wins NJ) = 6/11 ≈ 55%
    *   Prior P(Republican wins NJ) = 5/11 ≈ 45%

*   **Combined Priors:** Based on these independent probabilities, the initial base rates for the four options are:
    *   **Both elections (Dem VA & Dem NJ):** 0.08 * 0.55 = 4.4%
    *   **Only Virginia (Dem VA & GOP NJ):** 0.08 * 0.45 = 3.6%
    *   **Only New Jersey (GOP VA & Dem NJ):** 0.92 * 0.55 = 50.6%
    *   **Neither election (GOP VA & GOP NJ):** 0.92 * 0.45 = 41.4%

The clear prior favorite is "Only New Jersey," driven by the powerful historical trend in Virginia.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from the historical base case in several crucial ways:

*   **Virginia's Changing Demographics:** The base rate period covers a Virginia that was, for many years, much more conservative. The growth of the heavily Democratic Northern Virginia suburbs has fundamentally changed the state's electorate, making the historical "curse" less predictive.
*   **The Post-Dobbs Political Environment:** The Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs decision has made abortion rights a powerful motivating issue for Democratic and independent voters. This factor, which was not present in most of the reference class elections, provides a structural advantage for Democrats, especially in suburban areas.
*   **Candidate Quality:** The report suggests the Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger (VA) and Mikie Sherrill (NJ), are strong moderates with backgrounds (CIA, Navy) that may appeal to a broader electorate. This may give them an edge over a generic candidate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will now evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the report.

*   **Evidence 1: Consistent polling showing Democrats leading in both states.** (Spanberger +4 in VA, Sherrill +7 in NJ).
    *   This evidence is much more likely if Democrats are on track to win than if they are on track to lose. This is especially true in Virginia, where any Democratic lead directly contradicts the strong historical prior.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: This evidence strongly favors outcomes where Democrats win, particularly "Both elections" and "Only Virginia," as it provides the strongest counter-signal to the Virginia curse.

*   **Evidence 2: Spanberger's campaign strength in Virginia.** (Strong debate, key newspaper endorsement).
    *   This evidence provides a causal mechanism for why she might overcome the historical trend. It suggests she is building a broad coalition.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: This moderately increases the probability of a Democratic win in Virginia, thus boosting the "Both elections" and "Only Virginia" options.

*   **Evidence 3: Ciattarelli's known strength and focused campaign in New Jersey.** (Near-win in 2021, major ad campaign on taxes).
    *   This evidence tempers enthusiasm for a Democratic win in NJ. It reminds us that the 2021 race was very close and that polls can underestimate GOP support.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: This slightly favors outcomes where the Republican wins New Jersey, boosting the "Only Virginia" and "Neither election" options.

*   **Evidence 4: Unfavorable national environment.** (Inflation uptick).
    *   This is a headwind for the party in power (Democrats). It reinforces the general dynamic of off-year elections.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: This slightly favors outcomes where Republicans win, boosting "Only New Jersey" and "Neither election."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

The most significant update comes from the Virginia polling.

*   **Prior Odds (GOP win VA / Dem win VA):** 92% / 8% ≈ 11.5 to 1.
*   **Evidence:** Consistent polling lead for Spanberger, strong campaign indicators, and structural changes (demographics, Dobbs). This combination of evidence is highly unlikely if the 92% prior were correct. The likelihood ratio of this evidence favoring a Spanberger win is very strong. A conservative estimate for the combined LR might be 20:1 (i.e., this evidence is 20 times more likely if she wins than if she loses).
*   **Posterior Odds (GOP win VA / Dem win VA):** (11.5 to 1) / (20 to 1) ≈ 0.575 to 1.
*   **Posterior P(Dem win VA):** 1 / (1 + 0.575) ≈ 63%.

This is a massive shift, but it is justified by strong, direct evidence contradicting a historical trend whose underlying conditions have changed. Let's round this to **P(Dem win VA) ≈ 60%**.

For New Jersey, the polling confirms the prior, but Ciattarelli's strength and the 2021 polling miss warrant caution. I will slightly increase the prior based on the polling lead.
*   **Posterior P(Dem win NJ) ≈ 65%**.

Combining these updated, independent probabilities:
*   Both: 0.60 * 0.65 = 39%
*   Only VA: 0.60 * 0.35 = 21%
*   Only NJ: 0.40 * 0.65 = 26%
*   Neither: 0.40 * 0.35 = 14%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis assumes the races are independent. However, a national political wave could affect both. A strong anti-Democrat sentiment (worse-than-expected economy, presidential unpopularity) would correlate the outcomes, making "Neither" more likely. Conversely, Democratic overperformance could make "Both" more likely. Therefore, I will adjust the probabilities by taking some mass from the split outcomes ("Only VA", "Only NJ") and adding it to the correlated outcomes ("Both", "Neither").

I will shift 4% from "Only VA" and 4% from "Only NJ" (total 8%) and distribute it, adding 4% to "Both" and 4% to "Neither".

*   **Both elections:** 39% + 4% = 43%
*   **Only Virginia:** 21% - 4% = 17%
*   **Only New Jersey:** 26% - 4% = 22%
*   **Neither election:** 14% + 4% = 18%

This distribution makes "Both elections" the most likely outcome, reflecting the current polling. However, it gives a combined 40% chance to the scenarios where the historical Virginia trend holds ("Only New Jersey" + "Neither"), acknowledging the significant remaining uncertainty. "Only Virginia" is rightly the least likely, as it requires the stronger historical trend to fail while the weaker one holds.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are internally consistent and sum to 100%.

*   Both elections: 43%
*   Only Virginia: 17%
*   Only New Jersey: 22%
*   Neither election: 18%
*   (Sum = 100%)

This forecast reflects that while Democrats are favored to win both races based on current evidence, the historical headwinds and potential for a Republican-leaning environment make other outcomes highly plausible.

Both elections: 43%
Only New Jersey: 22%
Only Virginia: 17%
Neither election: 18%
