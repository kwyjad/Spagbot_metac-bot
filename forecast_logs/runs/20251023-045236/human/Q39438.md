### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Supreme Court Cases on Presidential Foreign Affairs/Emergency Powers:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases like *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936) and *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), the Court upheld broad executive actions. In this class, the President wins a large majority of the time (>70%). This reference class suggests a high base rate for **Tariffs lawful**.
2.  **Supreme Court Cases Involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) or Non-Delegation:** The current Court has shown increasing skepticism toward broad delegations of authority from Congress to the Executive branch, especially on issues of major economic and political significance. In cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), the Court required a clear statement from Congress to authorize major agency actions. This reference class suggests a high base rate for **Tariffs unlawful** (>60%), as imposing tariffs is a quintessential legislative power.
3.  **Supreme Court Review of U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit:** The Supreme Court reverses the Federal Circuit at a notably high rate, often cited as being over 70-80% in patent cases, and generally higher than its reversal rate for other circuits. While this case is not about patents, the trend suggests the Supreme Court often disagrees with the Federal Circuit's reasoning. This would imply a base rate against affirming the *V.O.S. Selections* decision, pointing away from a simple **Tariffs unlawful** ruling on those grounds.

**Synthesis:** These reference classes are in direct conflict, which is the central tension of the case. The traditional deference to the President (Class 1) clashes with the current Court's skepticism of administrative power (Class 2). Given the current Court's composition and recent jurisprudence, Class 2 likely has more predictive power. The high reversal rate for the Federal Circuit (Class 3) adds noise but could suggest the Court will not simply adopt the lower court's reasoning, perhaps opting for a different rationale or a **Mixed ruling**. A blended base rate would place **Tariffs unlawful** as the most likely outcome (~45%), followed by **Mixed ruling** (~30%), **Tariffs lawful** (~20%), with **Other/No ruling** as highly unlikely (~5%).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-28** Court of International Trade rules tariffs unlawful in *V.O.S. Selections*. ↑ (Unlawful) — Establishes the initial judicial consensus against the tariffs on the grounds they don't "deal with" the threat.
*   **2025-05-29** D.C. District Court rules tariffs unlawful in *Learning Resources*. ↑ (Unlawful) — Broadens the legal attack, arguing IEEPA provides no authority for tariffs at all, creating a second, stronger argument against the President.
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms the *V.O.S. Selections* ruling. ↑ (Unlawful) — A 7-4 appellate court decision, including one Republican-appointed judge in the majority, solidifies the judicial opposition and sets the stage for Supreme Court review.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. ↓ (No 2025 ruling) — The Court's decision to fast-track the case makes a ruling before the end of 2025 extremely likely, virtually eliminating this option.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Statutory Interpretation (Textualism):** The core of the case is whether IEEPA's text—authorizing the President to "regulate...any...importation"—includes the power to set tariffs. Challengers argue this is a strained reading of "regulate" and that such a core congressional power would have been granted explicitly. This is the most likely basis for the Court's decision. (Large impact)
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The conservative majority may view the unilateral imposition of broad-based tariffs as an issue of "vast economic and political significance" that Congress did not clearly delegate to the President. Invoking the MQD would lead to an "unlawful" ruling. (Large impact)
3.  **Deference to Executive in Foreign Policy/National Security:** The government's strongest argument rests on historical precedent granting the President wide latitude in these domains. Justices may be wary of constraining a President's ability to respond to perceived foreign threats. (Large impact, but pushes in the opposite direction of MQD).
4.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court could treat the "trafficking tariffs" (linked to a national security threat) differently from the "reciprocal tariffs" (linked to an economic issue, trade deficits). This provides a clear path to a **Mixed ruling**. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Judicial Institutionalism (Chief Justice Roberts):** The Chief Justice may seek a narrow ruling to avoid a major clash with the executive branch or a sweeping decision that dramatically alters the separation of powers. This could favor a narrow statutory holding (e.g., focusing on the "deal with" language) over a broad constitutional one. (Moderate impact)
6.  **Pretextual Nature of the Emergency:** While courts are reluctant to second-guess a President's emergency declaration, the use of IEEPA to address trade deficits may be seen as a pretext to circumvent Congress's tariff authority, weakening the government's case for deference. (Small-to-Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** While IEEPA has been used for sanctions and freezing assets, its application to impose broad, economy-wide tariffs is novel and pushes the statute's authority into a traditional legislative domain.
*   **Current Court's Jurisprudence:** Unlike the courts of the *Curtiss-Wright* or *Dames & Moore* eras, the current 6-3 conservative majority is actively developing and applying doctrines (like MQD) to limit executive power, making historical deference less certain.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Using a trade deficit as the basis for a "national emergency" is a significant departure from IEEPA's traditional use against hostile states or terrorist groups, making the claim for deference weaker.
*   **Consensus in Lower Courts:** Three different courts (CIT, DDC, Fed. Cir.) have ruled against the administration, albeit with slightly different reasoning. This creates a strong headwind for the government's appeal.
*   **Explicit Constitutional Role:** The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power "To lay and collect...Duties, Imposts and Excises" (Article I, Section 8). This makes delegation of that power more sensitive than other foreign policy powers.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior favoring **Tariffs unlawful** (~45%) but with substantial probability on **Mixed ruling** (~30%) seems appropriate, reflecting the conflict between modern judicial doctrines and historical deference. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Unlawful:** The consistent rulings from three lower courts provide strong evidence that the government's legal position is weak. (Large)
    *   **↑ Unlawful/Mixed:** The current Court's demonstrated skepticism of broad executive delegations via the Major Questions Doctrine strongly favors a ruling against the tariffs, at least the reciprocal ones. (Large)
    *   **↑ Mixed:** The plausible distinction between a national security-based tariff (trafficking) and a purely economic one (reciprocal) offers the Court an off-ramp to a split decision. (Moderate)
    *   **↓ Lawful:** The unprecedented and arguably pretextual use of IEEPA for general tariffs weakens the case for traditional executive deference. (Moderate)
    *   **↓ No 2025 ruling:** The Court's grant of expedited review makes a decision by year-end almost certain. (Large)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the initial prior. The posterior for **Tariffs unlawful** should increase, becoming the clear modal outcome. The probability for **Mixed ruling** should hold steady or slightly increase as a plausible alternative. The probability for **Tariffs lawful** should decrease significantly.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Unlawful/Mixed):**
    *   Oral arguments (Nov 2025): Conservative justices (Gorsuch, Thomas, Kavanaugh, Roberts) press the Solicitor General on the lack of an explicit "tariff" power in IEEPA's text.
    *   Questions from the bench invoking *West Virginia v. EPA* or the Major Questions Doctrine.
    *   Amicus briefs filed by prominent conservative/libertarian legal scholars arguing against the tariffs on separation-of-powers grounds.
    *   Questions distinguishing the legal basis for the trafficking tariffs versus the reciprocal tariffs.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Lawful):**
    *   Oral arguments: Justices focus on the broad statutory language ("any...importation") and historical precedents for presidential power (*Dames & Moore*).
    *   Questions from the bench expressing concern about limiting the President's tools to address foreign threats.
    *   The Solicitor General

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential powers in foreign affairs and national emergencies, with a base rate of >70% in similar cases. However, given the current Court's skepticism towards broad executive powers, a more conservative base rate of 20% is appropriate.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The current Court has increasingly applied the Major Questions Doctrine, requiring clear congressional authorization for significant executive actions. This suggests a base rate of >60% for unlawful rulings. Given the Court's composition and recent trends, a base rate of 45% is reasonable.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: The possibility of distinguishing between different types of tariffs (e.g., trafficking vs. reciprocal) suggests a base rate of 30% for a mixed ruling.
  
- **Other ruling**: Historically rare, but possible if procedural issues arise. A base rate of 4% is reasonable.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, this is highly unlikely. A base rate of 1% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves presidential powers under IEEPA, similar to past cases where the Court has shown deference.
  
- **Differences**: The current Court's application of the Major Questions Doctrine and skepticism towards broad delegations of power are significant departures from historical trends.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Court of International Trade and D.C. District Court rulings**: Both courts ruled the tariffs unlawful, providing strong evidence against the tariffs' legality. This increases the likelihood of an unlawful ruling.
  
- **Federal Circuit affirmation**: The appellate court's affirmation of the unlawful ruling further supports this outcome.
  
- **Supreme Court's expedited review**: Suggests the Court sees the issue as significant, reducing the likelihood of no ruling.
  
- **Current Court's jurisprudence**: The Court's recent decisions favoring the Major Questions Doctrine increase the likelihood of an unlawful ruling.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds of 45% increase with strong evidence from lower courts and the Court's recent trends. Posterior probability increases to 55%.
  
- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds of 30% are supported by the possibility of distinguishing between tariff types. Posterior probability remains at 30%.
  
- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds of 20% decrease due to strong evidence against the tariffs and the Court's recent skepticism. Posterior probability decreases to 10%.
  
- **Other ruling**: Prior odds of 4% remain stable due to the low likelihood of procedural issues.
  
- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds of 1% decrease further due to the expedited schedule. Posterior probability decreases to 0%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The forecast may overestimate the likelihood of an unlawful ruling. Consideration of the Court's deference to executive power in emergencies is necessary.
  
- **Alternative scenarios**: A mixed ruling remains plausible if the Court distinguishes between tariff types. This should be considered in the final probabilities.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and adjust for any overconfidence or blind spots.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
Mixed ruling: 30%  
Other ruling: 4%  
No 2025 ruling: 1%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and trends, with a focus on the Court's recent jurisprudence and the specific context of the case.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 45%)**
- The current Supreme Court has shown skepticism toward broad executive power in cases involving the Major Questions Doctrine (e.g., West Virginia v. EPA)
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against the tariffs (Court of International Trade, DC District Court, Federal Circuit)
- The Constitution explicitly grants Congress tariff authority (Article I, Section 8)

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 30%)**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases
- There's a clear distinction between the "trafficking tariffs" (national security) and "reciprocal tariffs" (economic)
- Chief Justice Roberts often seeks narrow, institutionally protective rulings

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 20%)**
- Historical deference to executive authority in foreign affairs (Curtiss-Wright, Dames & Moore)
- IEEPA's text authorizes the President to "regulate...any...importation"
- National security justifications traditionally receive judicial deference

**Other ruling (Prior: 3%)**
- Procedural dismissals are rare after the Court grants certiorari and hears oral arguments
- The Court has consolidated cases and expedited review, indicating intent to rule on merits

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 2%)**
- The Court has granted expedited review with arguments in November 2025
- The Court typically issues decisions within 2-3 months of arguments

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major questions cases, this involves executive action with significant economic impact
- Like other foreign affairs cases, it involves presidential authority in international matters
- Like other statutory interpretation cases, it centers on the scope of delegated authority

**Key differences:**
- The unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariffs pushes beyond historical precedent
- The 6-3 conservative majority is more skeptical of executive power than previous Courts
- The "emergency" justification for reciprocal tariffs (trade deficits) appears pretextual
- Three different courts have ruled against the administration, creating strong headwinds
- The constitutional allocation of tariff authority to Congress makes this delegation particularly sensitive

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Lower court rulings against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = Very high (~90%) - We would expect consistent lower court rulings if the legal case against tariffs is strong
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%) - Unlikely to see unanimous lower court opposition if tariffs are clearly lawful
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Federal Circuit's 7-4 decision including a Republican appointee in majority**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%) - Bipartisan judicial opposition suggests legal rather than political reasoning
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Moderate (~40%) - Some Republican-appointed judges dissented
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Different legal rationales in lower courts**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~75%) - Different rationales provide the Court options for a nuanced ruling
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful/lawful) = Moderate (~50%) - The Court could adopt either rationale wholesale
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Mixed ruling"

**Evidence: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~5%) - Expedited schedule strongly suggests intent to rule in 2025
- P(E|Any ruling in 2025) = Very high (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly disfavors "No 2025 ruling"

**Evidence: Distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~80%) - This distinction provides a clear path to uphold some tariffs while striking others
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful/lawful) = Moderate (~40%) - The Court could still rule categorically
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Mixed ruling"

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Update on "Lower court rulings against tariffs":**
- Prior odds for "Tariffs unlawful" = 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio = 90/20 = 4.5
- Posterior odds = 0.82 × 4.5 = 3.69
- Posterior probability = 3.69/(1+3.69) = 78.7%

This is too dramatic a shift given the complexity of the case. The Supreme Court often reverses lower courts, especially the Federal Circuit. Adjusting for this and other factors:

**Revised posterior for "Tariffs unlawful" ≈ 55%**

**Update on "Distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs":**
- Prior odds for "Mixed ruling" = 30/70 = 0.43
- Likelihood ratio = 80/40 = 2
- Posterior odds = 0.43 × 2 = 0.86
- Posterior probability = 0.86/(1+0.86) = 46.2%

Again, this is too dramatic. Adjusting for the Court's tendency to make categorical rulings:

**Revised posterior for "Mixed ruling" ≈ 35%**

**Update on "Expedited review schedule":**
- Prior probability for "No 2025 ruling" = 2%
- After considering the expedited schedule and the Court's typical timeline:

**Revised posterior for "No 2025 ruling" ≈ 1%**

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to executive authority in national security matters
- The Court's conservative majority may be more sympathetic to Trump's policy goals than I've accounted for
- I might be overweighting the lower court consensus, as the Supreme Court often takes cases to reverse

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would give "Tariffs lawful" a higher probability (~30-35%) based on:
- The Court's historical deference to the executive in foreign affairs
- The broad statutory language of IEEPA
- The Court's reluctance to second-guess national security determinations

**Rebuttal:**
While these factors are relevant, the current Court has shown increasing skepticism of broad delegations of authority (West Virginia v. EPA, NFIB v. OSHA). The pretextual nature of the "emergency" for reciprocal tariffs and the explicit constitutional allocation of tariff authority to Congress make this case different from typical foreign affairs cases.

**Adjustments:**
I'll slightly increase "Tariffs lawful" probability to account for these considerations.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:

- **Tariffs unlawful:** 52%
- **Mixed ruling:** 35% 
- **Tariffs lawful:** 10%
- **Other ruling:** 2%
- **No 2025 ruling:** 1%

Total: 100%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 52%
Mixed ruling: 35%
Tariffs lawful: 10%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three conflicting reference classes:

1.  **Presidential Foreign Affairs/Emergency Powers Cases:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas (e.g., *United States v. Curtiss-Wright*, *Dames & Moore v. Regan*). This reference class suggests a high base rate for **Tariffs lawful** (>70%), as the President is acting under a declared national emergency and a statute governing foreign commerce.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) / Non-Delegation Cases:** The current Supreme Court has shown a strong inclination to limit broad delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, especially on issues of major economic and political significance (*West Virginia v. EPA*). The power to set tariffs is a core congressional power (Article I, Section 8), making this a prime candidate for MQD application. This reference class suggests a high base rate for **Tariffs unlawful** (>60%).
3.  **Supreme Court Reversal Rate of the Federal Circuit:** The Supreme Court reverses the Federal Circuit at a higher rate than other circuits. Since the Federal Circuit ruled the tariffs unlawful, this base rate suggests a higher-than-average chance of reversal, which points away from a simple affirmation of the "unlawful" ruling and could favor a "Lawful" or "Mixed" outcome.

**Synthesis of Priors:** The central tension is between historical deference (Class 1) and the current Court's skepticism of executive power (Class 2). Given the Court's recent and clear jurisprudential direction, Class 2 is more predictive. The novelty of using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for broad tariffs further strengthens the case for judicial skepticism. Therefore, I will establish a prior that favors an outcome against the government but acknowledges the conflict.

*   **Prior:** Tariffs unlawful (45%), Mixed ruling (30%), Tariffs lawful (20%), Other ruling (3%), No 2025 ruling (2%).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case has several unusual features that distinguish it from the base rates:

*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** The statute has been used for targeted sanctions, not for imposing broad, economy-wide tariffs. This novelty weakens the government's reliance on historical precedent.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Declaring a "trade deficit" a national emergency under IEEPA is a significant stretch of the statute's purpose, which is to address "unusual and extraordinary threats." This makes the "reciprocal tariffs" particularly vulnerable.
*   **Lower Court Consensus:** Three different federal courts (the Court of International Trade, the D.C. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) have all ruled against the tariffs, creating a strong judicial consensus that the government must overcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the background information:

*   **E1: Unanimous Lower Court Rulings Against the Tariffs.** Three courts have found the tariffs unlawful. The likelihood of this happening if the tariffs were truly lawful is very low (P(E1 | Lawful) is low). The likelihood of this happening if the tariffs are indeed unlawful is high (P(E1 | Unlawful) is high). This evidence strongly increases the probability of "Tariffs unlawful" and decreases the probability of "Tariffs lawful."
*   **E2: Two Distinct Types of Tariffs.** The case involves both "trafficking tariffs" (linked to a national security threat) and "reciprocal tariffs" (linked to an economic issue). This distinction provides a clear path for a compromise. The likelihood of this fact existing, given a "Mixed ruling," is very high, as it's the primary mechanism for such a ruling. This evidence makes the **Mixed ruling** option highly plausible, as the Court can strike down the economically-based tariffs as overreach while upholding the security-based ones out of deference.
*   **E3: Expedited Supreme Court Review.** The Court granted certiorari and scheduled arguments for November 2025. The likelihood of this happening if there were to be "No 2025 ruling" is extremely low. This evidence effectively reduces the probability of the "No 2025 ruling" option to near zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Prior Odds:** (Unlawful / Lawful) ≈ 45 / 20 = 2.25 to 1.
*   **Likelihood Ratio from E1 (Lower Court Consensus):** The consensus against the government is strong evidence. Let's estimate this evidence is 5 times more likely if the tariffs are unlawful than if they are lawful.
*   **Posterior Odds (Unlawful / Lawful):** 2.25 × 5 = 11.25 to 1. This suggests "Unlawful" is now over 10 times more likely than "Lawful." My updated probabilities should reflect this, drastically lowering P(Lawful) and increasing P(Unlawful).
*   **Qualitative Update from E2 (Two Tariff Types):** This evidence provides a compelling off-ramp for the Court. A "Mixed ruling" allows the justices to apply the MQD to the more egregious overreach (reciprocal tariffs) while still showing deference on the more traditional national security issue (trafficking tariffs). This is a classic compromise that could appeal to a majority, especially Chief Justice Roberts. This pulls probability away from a clean "Unlawful" sweep and towards "Mixed."
*   **Qualitative Update from E3 (Expedited Review):** The probability for "No 2025 ruling" drops to a tail risk of ~1%. This probability mass is redistributed to the other options.

After these updates, the probability mass has shifted significantly away from "Lawful" and is now concentrated on "Unlawful" and "Mixed." The plausible compromise path makes "Mixed" a very strong contender.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast favors a "Mixed" or "Unlawful" ruling. I must consider why I might be wrong.

*   **Case for "Tariffs lawful":** I might be underestimating the power of the foreign affairs deference doctrine. A majority of the Court could decide that the MQD does not apply in the national security context, that the IEEPA's text ("regulate... importation") is broad enough, and that courts should not second-guess the President's emergency declarations. This outcome, while unlikely given the Court's recent trends, is not impossible. I have assigned it a 12% chance to reflect this possibility.
*   **Case for "Mixed" over "Unlawful":** A mixed ruling is the path of least resistance. It allows the Court to rein in executive overreach without creating a politically explosive ruling that completely strips the President of a powerful economic tool in a perceived emergency. This balancing act is characteristic of the Roberts Court.
*   **Case for "Unlawful" over "Mixed":** Textualist justices like Gorsuch might prefer a cleaner, brighter-line rule: the power to "regulate" in IEEPA does not include the power to "tariff," a distinct power explicitly given to Congress. This would lead them to strike down all the tariffs, regardless of their justification.

Considering these points, the slight edge for "Mixed ruling" over "Tariffs unlawful" seems justified, as it represents the most likely compromise position for a majority of the Court.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will adjust my final probabilities to reflect the analysis above, ensuring they sum to 100%. The highest probability goes to "Mixed ruling" as the most plausible judicial compromise, followed closely by "Tariffs unlawful" as the most likely clean-sweep outcome based on the Court's recent jurisprudence. "Tariffs lawful" is a small but non-trivial possibility, while "Other" and "No 2025 ruling" are tail risks.

Tariffs lawful: 12%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
