### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine (2019+) Ebola Outbreaks in DRC:** This is the most relevant class. Since the approval of the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine, DRC has contained several outbreaks quickly.
    *   **Data:** 2020 Équateur (130 cases, 55 deaths), 2021 North Kivu (12 cases, 6 deaths), 2021 Maniema (resurgence, 8 cases, 6 deaths), 2022 Équateur (5 cases, 5 deaths), 2022 North Kivu (1 case, 1 death).
    *   **Base Rate:** The median death toll for these outbreaks is 6. The mean is skewed by the 2020 event to ~15. This class suggests a high probability of containment with a death toll in the low double digits.
    *   **Limitations:** This class has a small sample size (n=5). The 2020 Équateur outbreak shows that even with vaccines, a toll over 50 is possible.

2.  **All Historical Ebola Outbreaks in DRC (Zaire ebolavirus):** This class provides a broader historical perspective, including catastrophic failures before modern tools were available.
    *   **Data:** Since 1976, the DRC has had over 15 outbreaks. These range from a single case to the massive Kivu epidemic (2,280 deaths). Other significant outbreaks include Yambuku 1976 (280 deaths) and Kikwit 1995 (254 deaths).
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is extremely right-skewed. The median number of deaths is low (likely <30), but the mean is very high (~200) due to a few massive outliers. This class highlights the "fat tail" risk of catastrophic escalation.
    *   **Limitations:** Pre-2019 data is of limited relevance due to the game-changing impact of vaccines and therapeutics. It primarily serves to define the worst-case scenarios.

3.  **Recent Non-DRC Outbreak (Uganda 2022):** This serves as a specific, recent comparison for an outbreak that exceeded initial containment.
    *   **Data:** Caused by Sudan ebolavirus, for which there was no approved vaccine at the time. It resulted in 164 cases and 55 deaths.
    *   **Base Rate:** A single data point of 55 deaths.
    *   **Limitations:** The key driver (lack of a specific vaccine) is different from the current situation, assuming the Kasaï outbreak is the Zaire strain. However, it provides a benchmark for what happens when the primary tool (vaccination) is less effective or delayed.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province, DRC. — **(↑)** — The start of the event. Kasaï is a region with a history of instability and weaker health infrastructure, increasing risk.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — **(↑↑)** — This is a very rapid initial growth rate. Most recent DRC outbreaks had single-digit cases in the first week, suggesting this outbreak either had a delayed detection or is spreading very efficiently.
*   **2025-09-10** (Hypothetical) WHO and Africa CDC confirm deployment of response teams and vaccine stockpiles to the region. — **(↓)** — Standard, but crucial, response. The speed and scale of this deployment are a key variable for containment.
*   **2025-10-15** (Hypothetical) Reports indicate vaccination campaigns are facing community resistance in several hotspots. — **(↑)** — Echoes challenges from the Kivu epidemic. Community trust is a critical factor for the effectiveness of the public health response.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed and Efficacy of Public Health Response:** The single most important driver. Rapid case identification, contact tracing, and isolation can halt an outbreak. Delays of even a week can lead to exponential growth. (Large impact)
2.  **Vaccine and Therapeutic Efficacy & Deployment:** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective against the Zaire strain. A "ring vaccination" strategy (vaccinating contacts of known cases) is the primary containment tool. Availability of therapeutics (e.g., Inmazeb, Ebanga) reduces the case fatality rate. (Large impact)
3.  **Community Trust and Cooperation:** Mistrust of health workers and government officials, fueled by misinformation or historical grievances, can lead to hiding cases, avoiding contact tracing, and resisting vaccination, which severely hampers containment. This was a major driver of the Kivu epidemic. (Large impact)
4.  **Geographic and Social Context:** The outbreak's location matters. Kasaï province has areas of high population density, but also poor transportation infrastructure which can slow both viral spread and the health response. Proximity to international borders or major transport hubs increases spread risk. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Security and Political Stability:** Conflict or instability in the region can prevent health workers from safely accessing affected areas, directly enabling the virus to spread unchecked. (Moderate to Large impact)
6.  **Virus Strain:** The default assumption is Zaire ebolavirus, for which vaccines exist. If it were a different strain (e.g., Sudan, Bundibugyo), the vaccine would be ineffective, dramatically increasing the expected death toll. (Large impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Faster Initial Spread:** Compared to the post-vaccine reference class (Ref. Class 1), 32 cases and 15 deaths within days of declaration is anomalously high. This suggests either a significant period of undetected spread before the alarm was raised or a highly effective transmission environment.
*   **Experienced Response System:** Unlike in the pre-2018 era, the DRC, WHO, and Africa CDC now have a well-oiled, battle-hardened response system with recent, large-scale experience from the Kivu epidemic. This is a significant advantage over the base rate of all historical outbreaks (Ref. Class 2).
*   **Location-Specific Challenges:** Kasaï is not North Kivu. While it has experienced conflict, it is not the same active, multi-front warzone that plagued the Kivu response. However, its health infrastructure is generally considered weaker than in the eastern provinces where most recent outbreaks have occurred.
*   **Established Toolkit:** Unlike all pre-2019 outbreaks, the response now begins with proven vaccines and therapeutics available from global stockpiles. This fundamentally changes the dynamic from one of pure containment to one of treatment and prevention, lowering the expected case fatality rate and transmission.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the post-vaccine reference class (median ~10-20 deaths), but with a very fat tail to account for the historical possibility of catastrophic failure (>1000 deaths). The low number of recent outbreaks suggests a low "equivalent n" (e.g., n=5), meaning the prior is weak and highly responsive to new evidence.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑↑ (Large):** The initial report of 32 cases/15 deaths is a strong signal that this outbreak is not like the recent, quickly contained ones (2021-2022). It significantly increases the probability of the final toll being in the mid-to-high double digits or more.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The location in Kasaï province, with its known logistical and potential security challenges, moderately increases the expected difficulty of containment compared to an "average" location.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The existence of a highly experienced response apparatus and proven medical countermeasures acts as a strong countervailing force, already incorporated into the prior but worth re-emphasizing as the primary reason the forecast should not approach Kivu-levels.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift significantly upward from the post-vaccine median. The evidence strongly suggests this will not be another <10 death event. The central mass of the distribution should move into the 50-150 deaths range, while the probability of a >500 death catastrophe, though still small, should increase.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in a major urban center (e.g., Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi) or across an international border.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or treatment centers.
    *   Weekly new case numbers continuing to accelerate or holding steady rather than declining.
    *   Genetic sequencing confirming a non-Zaire strain of Ebola.
    *   Low reported uptake of ring vaccination (<80% of contacts).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A consistent week-over-week decline in new confirmed cases.
    *   No new cases reported outside of the initial health zone for >14 days.
    *   High percentage (>95%) of new cases arising from known contact lists, indicating successful tracing.
    *   Reports of high community engagement and vaccine acceptance.
    *   Successful deployment of mobile labs, reducing sample testing turnaround time.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Reliability:** Initial case and death counts from remote regions can be inaccurate and subject to large revisions. The official numbers may lag the reality on the ground.
*   **Virus Strain Uncertainty:** The assumption is Zaire ebolavirus. If sequencing reveals a different strain (e.g., Sudan), this forecast is invalid, and the expected death toll would be significantly higher as the primary vaccine is ineffective.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** With resolution on Jan 1, 2026 (in ~2 months), the outbreak must either be contained quickly or escalate explosively. A slow, grinding epidemic like Kivu is less likely to produce thousands of deaths *within this specific timeframe*.
*   **Definition of "Linked":** The resolution criteria include deaths in other countries "linked to this outbreak." A single case crossing a border could create a new cluster that is difficult to track but still counts, introducing forecast uncertainty.
*   **Political Factors:** Regional or national political instability could divert resources and attention, undermining an otherwise effective public health response.

**Final Research Summary:**
This outbreak's rapid initial spread significantly distinguishes it from recent, easily-contained events, suggesting a higher final death toll. However, a robust, experienced response system armed with effective vaccines and therapeutics provides a powerful brake on catastrophic escalation, making a repeat of the massive Kivu epidemic unlikely.

To forecast the number of deaths from the new Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province, DRC, before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Post-Vaccine (2019+) Ebola Outbreaks in DRC**: This is the most relevant reference class due to the availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. The median death toll for these outbreaks is 6, with a mean of ~15 due to the 2020 Équateur event. This suggests a high probability of containment with a death toll in the low double digits.
   - **Historical Outbreaks in DRC**: Provides a broader perspective, with a median of <30 deaths but a mean of ~200 due to outliers. This highlights the risk of catastrophic escalation.
   - **Recent Non-DRC Outbreak (Uganda 2022)**: Provides a benchmark for outbreaks exceeding initial containment, with 55 deaths.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current outbreak's rapid initial spread (32 cases, 15 deaths) is anomalous compared to recent DRC outbreaks, suggesting a higher risk of escalation.
   - The presence of an experienced response system and effective vaccines/therapeutics is a significant advantage over historical outbreaks.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **↑↑ (Large)**: The rapid initial spread significantly increases the likelihood of a higher death toll.
   - **↑ (Moderate)**: Kasaï's logistical challenges increase containment difficulty.
   - **↓ (Moderate)**: The experienced response system and medical countermeasures reduce the likelihood of catastrophic escalation.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on the post-vaccine reference class (median ~10-20 deaths), the evidence suggests shifting the distribution upward. The central mass of the distribution should move into the 50-150 deaths range, with a small increase in the probability of >500 deaths.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider tail risks such as the outbreak spreading to urban centers or across borders, and the possibility of a non-Zaire strain.
   - Adjust for potential overconfidence by considering the worst-case scenarios from historical data.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the number of deaths are as follows:

P10: 20  
P20: 35  
P40: 60  
P60: 90  
P80: 130  
P90: 200

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a combination of reference classes to establish my prior:

**Primary Reference Class: Post-Vaccine (2019+) Ebola Outbreaks in DRC**
- 2020 Équateur: 55 deaths
- 2021 North Kivu: 6 deaths
- 2021 Maniema: 6 deaths
- 2022 Équateur: 5 deaths
- 2022 North Kivu: 1 death

This gives a median of 6 deaths and a mean of ~15 deaths, with a right-skewed distribution.

**Secondary Reference Class: Major Outbreaks (including pre-vaccine era)**
- 2018-2020 Kivu: 2,280 deaths
- 2022 Uganda (Sudan strain): 55 deaths
- 1976 Yambuku: 280 deaths
- 1995 Kikwit: 254 deaths

These establish the potential for catastrophic outcomes, though they're less relevant given modern containment capabilities.

For my prior, I'll use a right-skewed distribution with a median around 20 deaths (slightly higher than the post-vaccine median due to the already concerning initial case count), but with a fat tail to account for the possibility of containment failure.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same country (DRC) with experience handling Ebola outbreaks
- Likely the same Zaire ebolavirus strain for which vaccines exist
- Modern response capabilities including vaccines and therapeutics
- Similar rural/semi-urban setting

**Key differences:**
- Unusually high initial case count (32 cases, 15 deaths already reported by September 7)
- Kasaï Province has weaker health infrastructure than some other DRC regions
- The outbreak is occurring in a region with historical instability
- Only ~2 months remain until the resolution date (January 1, 2026)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- **Initial case count (32) and death toll (15)**: This suggests either delayed detection or unusually efficient transmission. Most recent outbreaks had single-digit cases in the first week. This strongly suggests this outbreak will exceed the median of recent outbreaks (likelihood ratio ~5:1 favoring higher outcomes).
- **Location in Kasaï Province**: This region has weaker health infrastructure than eastern provinces where recent outbreaks occurred. This moderately increases the likelihood of higher death tolls (likelihood ratio ~2:1).
- **Short time window until resolution**: With only ~2 months until January 1, 2026, the outbreak must either be contained quickly or will likely grow substantially. This creates a bimodal distribution possibility.

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- **Availability of vaccines and therapeutics**: The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has proven highly effective against Zaire ebolavirus. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a massive outbreak like Kivu (likelihood ratio ~1:3 against extreme outcomes).
- **Experienced response system**: DRC, WHO, and partners have substantial experience with Ebola containment. This moderately reduces expected death toll (likelihood ratio ~1:2).
- **Limited time for extreme growth**: The ~2 month window until resolution also limits how catastrophic the outbreak can become, as even the Kivu epidemic took many months to reach thousands of deaths.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 20 deaths but with a fat right tail:
- P10: ~10 deaths
- P50: ~20 deaths
- P90: ~100 deaths

First update based on the high initial case count (32 cases, 15 deaths already):
- This strongly suggests we're not in the lowest outcome scenario
- Shifts the distribution rightward by a factor of ~3-5x
- Updated P10: ~30 deaths (can't be lower than current count)
- Updated P50: ~60-80 deaths
- Updated P90: ~300 deaths

Second update based on containment capabilities:
- Modern vaccines and response systems make catastrophic outcomes less likely
- This compresses the right tail somewhat
- Final P10: ~30 deaths (floor set by current deaths)
- Final P50: ~70 deaths
- Final P90: ~250 deaths

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- **Strain uncertainty**: If this is not Zaire ebolavirus, vaccines may be ineffective, dramatically increasing the death toll.
- **Security deterioration**: If conflict erupts in Kasaï, health workers could be prevented from accessing affected areas.
- **Urban spread**: If cases reach major urban centers like Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi, the outbreak could accelerate beyond containment.
- **Cross-border spread**: The resolution criteria include deaths in other countries linked to this outbreak, which could significantly increase the total.

**Alternative forecast scenario**: The outbreak could be contained quickly, resulting in a final death toll of only 20-30. This is plausible if:
- The initial cluster represents most of the undetected cases
- Ring vaccination is implemented effectively
- No cases reach urban centers

However, the already high initial case count makes this less likely than in typical outbreaks.

**Adjustments for uncertainty**:
- Widening my confidence intervals, especially on the upper end
- Increasing my P80 and P90 estimates to account for catastrophic tail risks

## 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 40

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the set of Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since the approval and widespread availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in 2019. This is the most relevant reference class because it reflects the modern toolkit of vaccines, therapeutics, and experienced response teams.

*   **Reference Class Data (DRC, 2019+):**
    *   2020 Équateur: 55 deaths
    *   2021 North Kivu: 6 deaths
    *   2021 Maniema: 6 deaths
    *   2022 Équateur: 5 deaths
    *   2022 North Kivu: 1 death
*   **Distribution:** This class is highly skewed. The median number of deaths is 6, while the mean is 14.6. This suggests that most post-vaccine outbreaks are contained very quickly, but there's a possibility of a more significant event (like the 55 deaths in 2020).

My prior distribution, therefore, is centered low (median ~10-15 deaths) but has a fat right tail to account for the possibility of an outcome in the mid-double digits. I also consider the broader history of Ebola in the DRC (including the catastrophic Kivu epidemic with >2,000 deaths) as evidence for the *potential* for extreme tail risks, even if modern tools make them less likely.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, where the response system is experienced. It is assumed to be the Zaire ebolavirus strain, against which the standard vaccine is effective. The global health apparatus (WHO, Africa CDC) is mobilizing as it has for past outbreaks.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the **initial velocity** of the outbreak. With 32 cases and 15 deaths reported just three days after the official declaration, this outbreak is already larger and has spread faster than the initial stages of the other outbreaks in the post-vaccine reference class. This strongly suggests that the current situation is not analogous to the quickly contained outbreaks (1-6 deaths) and is already on a trajectory more similar to, or worse than, the 2020 Équateur outbreak (55 deaths). The location in Kasaï, with weaker infrastructure, also presents a greater challenge than some previous locations.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1.  **High Initial Case Count (32 cases / 15 deaths by Sep 7):** This is the most significant piece of evidence. It is highly inconsistent with a final death toll in the single digits or low double-digits. It implies either a prolonged period of undetected community transmission before the declaration or a very high transmission rate. This evidence makes a final death toll of >50 substantially more likely than the base rate would suggest. This is a strong upward update.
2.  **Location in Kasaï Province:** The research report notes Kasaï has weaker health infrastructure and a history of instability. This makes containment efforts (contact tracing, vaccination, safe burials) more difficult. This factor moderately pushes the forecast upward, as it increases the probability that the response will be less effective than in a more stable, accessible region.
3.  **Reports of Community Resistance (Hypothetical Oct 15 report):** This is a critical negative indicator. Community mistrust was a primary driver that escalated the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic into a catastrophe. Resistance to vaccination and contact tracing directly undermines the most effective containment tools. This evidence provides another strong push upward on the expected death toll and significantly fattens the right tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution with a median around 15 deaths and a P90 around 55 deaths, reflecting the post-2019 DRC base rate.
*   **Update Step:** I begin with this prior. The evidence of rapid initial spread (32 cases/15 deaths) is a powerful likelihood update. If the base rate suggests a ~10% chance of exceeding 50 deaths, this new evidence might increase that likelihood to 50% or more. This shifts the entire distribution to the right. My new median is no longer 15, but likely in the 50-70 range, anchored by the outcomes of the 2020 Équateur (55 deaths) and 2022 Uganda (55 deaths) outbreaks, which serve as models for when containment isn't immediate.
*   **Further Updating:** Adding the evidence of a challenging location (Kasaï) and community resistance further shifts the distribution rightward and increases its variance. These factors make the "successful containment" scenario less likely and the "prolonged outbreak" scenario more likely. My final posterior median moves into the 70-100 range. The probability of exceeding 100 deaths, which was low in the prior, is now substantial.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence in Negative Signals:** Am I overreacting to the initial bad news? It's possible the initial cluster was a single superspreader event and that the now-mobilized, experienced response team will successfully implement ring vaccination and halt further spread. In this scenario, the final death toll might only be double the current count, finishing in the 30-50 range. This suggests I should not place my lower percentiles too high.
*   **Underestimation of Tail Risk:** Conversely, am I underestimating the potential for catastrophic failure? The combination of rapid spread, a difficult region, and community resistance is a recipe for disaster. While a Kivu-level event (>2000 deaths) is unlikely to unfold before the Jan 1, 2026 resolution date (~2.5 months away), a rapid escalation to several hundred deaths is plausible if the virus reaches a dense urban area and containment fails. This argues for keeping the P80 and P90 values high.
*   **Key Uncertainty (Virus Strain):** The forecast assumes the Zaire strain. If genetic sequencing revealed the Sudan strain (for which the vaccine is ineffective), this forecast would be far too low. I must implicitly account for this small possibility by slightly widening my distribution.
*   **Time Constraint:** The short timeframe until resolution (Jan 1, 2026) acts as a cap on the extreme upper tail. An outbreak would have to spread with incredible speed to cause more than 500-1000 deaths in the remaining time. This makes an outcome in the 200-400 range a plausible worst-case scenario for this specific question.

Based on this, I will set my median (between P40 and P60) around 80-90. My lower percentiles will reflect the "containment now works" scenario, while my upper percentiles will reflect a serious, but not unprecedented, escalation.
