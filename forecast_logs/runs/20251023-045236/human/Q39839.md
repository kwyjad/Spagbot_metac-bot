### Reference class & base rates
*   **Second Attempt to Land a New Orbital Booster (SpaceX Falcon 9):** This is the most relevant class. SpaceX's first five attempts to land a Falcon 9 first stage on an autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) failed. Their first success came on the sixth attempt (flight 20, Orbcomm OG2). The success rate on the *second* attempt was 0%. This suggests a very low base rate, perhaps **10-20%**, reflecting the steep learning curve for mastering the complex physics of orbital booster recovery. Limitation: This is an n-of-1 reference class, and Blue Origin's engineering approach differs significantly.
*   **First Successful Landing of Any New Orbital Booster Program:** This class considers the overall difficulty of achieving the first success, regardless of attempt number. SpaceX took 6 ASDS attempts. Blue Origin failed on its first. This suggests the task is fundamentally hard and success is not immediate. The base rate for any given early attempt being the *first* success is low, likely **<25%**. Limitation: This class doesn't account for the learning from prior failures, which is central to this question.
*   **Blue Origin Suborbital Landings (New Shepard):** This class speaks to institutional competence in vertical propulsive landings. New Shepard has a near-perfect landing record over more than 20 flights. This demonstrates mastery of the core guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) software and engine throttling required for landing. This would suggest a high base rate, perhaps **>90%**. Limitation: This is a suborbital vehicle with a much less energetic and complex reentry profile than an orbital-class booster like New Glenn, making it a poor direct analogue for the difficulty of the task.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** Booster "Never Tell Me The Odds" rolls out to Launch Complex 36. ↑ This is a major hardware-in-the-loop milestone, indicating the vehicle is assembled and ready for pre-flight processing, keeping the November launch on track.
*   **2025-10-08** Launch target for NASA's EscaPADE mission confirmed for early November 2025. ↑ A specific, near-term launch window for a critical NASA science mission adds significant schedule pressure and credibility, making a launch attempt in 2025 highly likely.
*   **2025-01-16** New Glenn's maiden flight successfully reaches orbit but fails booster landing. ↔ This event established the rocket's primary function works but confirmed the difficulty of landing, providing a critical (but painful) data set for the team to analyze.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Learning from the First Failure:** The primary driver. The probability of success depends almost entirely on whether Blue Origin correctly diagnosed the root cause of the January 2025 landing failure and implemented an effective fix. (Large)
*   **Institutional Competence in Propulsive Landing:** Blue Origin's extensive and successful experience with New Shepard's landing system provides a strong foundation in GNC, software, and operational procedures, even if the physics are different. (Moderate)
*   **Launch Window Pressure:** The EscaPADE mission is a planetary science mission to Mars, which has a constrained launch window that closes in late 2025. This external pressure forces a launch attempt, preventing indefinite delays, but could also rush preparations. (Moderate)
*   **"Slow and Steady" Corporate Philosophy:** Blue Origin's risk-averse culture ("Gradatim Ferociter") contrasts with SpaceX's iterative approach. This could mean they have been exceptionally thorough in their failure analysis, potentially increasing the per-attempt probability of success. (Small)
*   **BE-4 Engine Performance:** The seven BE-4 engines must perform flawlessly through ascent and then execute a complex relighting and throttling sequence for the landing burns. Any anomaly here would cause failure. (Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Corporate Philosophy:** Unlike the SpaceX reference class, which embraced rapid, iterative testing and public failures, Blue Origin is famously secretive and cautious. This may lead to more robust pre-flight analysis and a higher probability of success on this specific attempt compared to a typical SpaceX early attempt.
*   **Engine Technology:** New Glenn uses methalox (liquid methane/liquid oxygen) BE-4 engines, whereas the Falcon 9 reference class uses RP-1/LOX Merlin engines. Methane offers potential benefits but also presents different challenges, particularly regarding relight reliability.
*   **Existing Landing Expertise:** When SpaceX was attempting its first landings, no one had ever landed an orbital-class booster. Blue Origin is attempting this with the benefit of its own extensive suborbital landing data (New Shepard) and a decade of public data from SpaceX's successes and failures.
*   **Single Data Point:** Blue Origin has only one data point for an orbital landing failure. SpaceX had a series of failures, allowing them to find and fix multiple independent failure modes. Blue Origin may have fixed the first problem only to be caught by a second, unknown issue.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior anchored to the reference class of second landing attempts, which is very low. A reasonable starting point is **P(Success) ≈ 25%**, with a low equivalent n of ~4, reflecting the sparse but pessimistic data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ **Successful Maiden Flight to Orbit:** Significantly de-risks the ascent phase and proves the fundamental vehicle systems work. (Moderate)
    *   ↑ **Extensive New Shepard Landing Success:** Demonstrates deep institutional knowledge of the core software and control logic for propulsive landing. (Small, due to regime difference)
    *   ↑ **On-Schedule Progress for a Critical NASA Mission:** The booster is at the pad for a time-sensitive mission, signaling high internal confidence and readiness. (Moderate)
    *   ↓ **Single Failure Data Point:** They have only learned from one specific failure mode; other unknown issues may exist, unlike SpaceX which uncovered multiple issues through more attempts. (Small)
    *   ↑ **Cautious Engineering Culture:** Blue Origin's philosophy suggests they will not proceed unless they have high confidence in their analysis and fixes, raising the conditional probability of success given they attempt the launch. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence points towards a significant upward revision from the low base rate. The combination of proven orbital capability, institutional landing expertise, and high-confidence signals from the launch campaign should push the posterior significantly higher, likely into the **45-60%** range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Successful completion of a full Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR) and static fire test.
    *   NASA officially confirms a firm launch date in November after the Flight Readiness Review.
    *   Public statements from Blue Origin leadership expressing high confidence in the implemented fixes.
    *   Favorable weather forecasts in the week leading up to the launch attempt.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any slip of the launch date, particularly if it pushes the mission to the very end of or past the Mars window.
    *   Scrubbed static fire or WDR attempts due to technical issues with the booster.
    *   Unofficial reports or rumors of unresolved technical problems from the first flight analysis.
    *   Delays in shipping the landing platform, the *Jacklyn*, to the recovery zone.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously secretive. The public does not know the specific cause of the January 2025 landing failure or the details of the supposed fix. The assessment relies on interpreting their external actions (like rolling to the pad) as signals of internal confidence.
*   **Conflating Launch and Landing:** The question requires both a launch in 2025 AND a successful landing. A last-minute launch scrub due to weather or a minor technical issue could push the attempt into 2026, resolving the question as "No" even if the landing would have succeeded.
*   **Definition of "Successful Landing":** The resolution criteria implies a controlled, vertical touchdown on the deck of the landing platform where the booster remains upright and intact. A landing that results in the booster tipping over or suffering major damage would likely not count as a success.
*   **Unknown Unknowns:** The first failure may have masked other underlying problems that will only manifest on a second attempt. The system is complex, and a single successful fix does not guarantee overall success.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for a second orbital booster landing attempt is very low. However, Blue Origin's demonstrated suborbital landing mastery, the successful orbital insertion on the first flight, and strong recent signals of readiness for a time-sensitive mission suggest they are well-prepared, warranting a significant upward update from the prior.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the success rate of second attempts to land a new orbital booster, particularly referencing SpaceX's early attempts. SpaceX's first five attempts to land a Falcon 9 first stage on an autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) failed, with the first success on the sixth attempt. The success rate on the second attempt was 0%, suggesting a very low base rate. However, considering Blue Origin's cautious approach and institutional competence, a more optimistic base rate of **25%** is reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are attempting to land orbital-class boosters, a complex task with a steep learning curve.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has extensive experience with suborbital landings (New Shepard), a cautious engineering culture, and is attempting this with the benefit of public data from SpaceX's successes and failures. These differences suggest a potentially higher probability of success for Blue Origin compared to SpaceX's early attempts.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Successful Maiden Flight to Orbit**: This significantly de-risks the ascent phase and proves the fundamental vehicle systems work. This increases the probability of success.
   - **Extensive New Shepard Landing Success**: Demonstrates institutional knowledge of landing systems, albeit in a different regime. This slightly increases the probability.
   - **On-Schedule Progress for a Critical NASA Mission**: Indicates high internal confidence and readiness, increasing the probability.
   - **Single Failure Data Point**: Limits learning to one specific failure mode, slightly decreasing the probability.
   - **Cautious Engineering Culture**: Suggests thorough analysis and fixes, slightly increasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 25% / 75% = 1/3
   - Evidence suggests a significant upward revision. The combination of proven orbital capability, institutional landing expertise, and high-confidence signals from the launch campaign should push the posterior probability higher.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (qualitatively assessed as >1 due to positive evidence)
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds)
   - Resulting posterior probability is estimated in the **45-60%** range.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The single failure data point and unknown unknowns could lead to overconfidence. Consider the possibility of other failure modes.
   - Alternative forecast: A more conservative estimate might focus on the complexity of the task and the limited data, suggesting a lower probability.
   - Adjustments: Consider the potential for unforeseen technical issues or delays, which could lower the probability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, the final forecast reflects a cautious optimism based on Blue Origin's capabilities and recent developments.

Final: 55%

# Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a successful launch and landing of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster before 2026.

The most relevant reference class is the success rate of second landing attempts for orbital-class boosters. SpaceX's experience with Falcon 9 provides the closest analogue:
- SpaceX failed on their first five attempts to land a Falcon 9 booster on a drone ship
- Their first success came on the sixth attempt
- The success rate specifically on the second attempt was 0%

This suggests a very low base rate, perhaps 10-20%. However, this is an n-of-1 reference class.

Another relevant reference class is Blue Origin's own experience with vertical landings of their New Shepard suborbital vehicle, which has a >90% success rate. However, orbital-class booster landings are significantly more challenging than suborbital landings.

Considering these factors, I'll start with a prior probability of **25%** for a successful launch and landing before 2026. This reflects the fundamental difficulty of the task while acknowledging Blue Origin's institutional experience with vertical landings.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like SpaceX's early attempts, Blue Origin is trying to land an orbital-class booster after a first failure
- The physics challenges of deceleration, precision guidance, and controlled touchdown remain similar
- Both companies face the challenge of relighting engines in flight after orbital velocities

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has the benefit of SpaceX's decade of public data on successes and failures
- Blue Origin has extensive experience with suborbital landings via New Shepard
- Blue Origin's corporate culture is more cautious and methodical than SpaceX's rapid iteration approach
- New Glenn uses methalox BE-4 engines versus Falcon 9's RP-1/LOX Merlin engines
- Blue Origin has only one data point (failure) to learn from, whereas SpaceX had multiple failures to analyze

These differences suggest Blue Origin might have a higher chance on their second attempt than SpaceX did, but they also have less iterative learning experience.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Successful orbital insertion on first flight (January 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful landing would almost certainly be preceded by successful orbital insertion
- P(E|~H): Also high (~0.8) - Even with a landing failure, orbital insertion could succeed (as it did in January)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.19 (slightly positive)
- This moderately increases probability as it demonstrates core vehicle systems work properly

**Evidence 2: "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster rolled out to Launch Complex 36 (October 8, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - For a successful launch and landing, the vehicle must be at the pad
- P(E|~H): Also high (~0.9) - Even with an eventual landing failure, the vehicle would still roll out
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.06 (slightly positive)
- This slightly increases probability as it confirms the launch is on track for 2025

**Evidence 3: NASA's EscaPADE mission confirmed for early November 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful mission would have a firm launch date
- P(E|~H): Moderately high (~0.7) - Even with an eventual landing failure, the mission would have a date
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.36 (positive)
- This significantly increases probability as it indicates high internal confidence and a time-sensitive mission

**Evidence 4: Blue Origin's cautious engineering culture**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - A successful landing would be consistent with thorough preparation
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Their cautious approach might still miss unknown failure modes
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (positive)
- This significantly increases probability as it suggests they won't attempt landing unless highly confident

**Evidence 5: Only one data point from previous failure**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Success could occur even with limited data if the primary failure mode was obvious
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Limited data increases the chance of missing other potential failure modes
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63 (negative)
- This decreases probability as it suggests they may not have uncovered all potential issues

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 25% (odds of 1:3), I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior odds = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3 = 0.333

Applying the likelihood ratios:
- Evidence 1 (successful orbit): 0.333 × 1.19 = 0.396
- Evidence 2 (booster rollout): 0.396 × 1.06 = 0.420
- Evidence 3 (firm launch date): 0.420 × 1.36 = 0.571
- Evidence 4 (cautious culture): 0.571 × 1.6 = 0.914
- Evidence 5 (limited data): 0.914 × 0.63 = 0.576

Posterior odds = 0.576

Converting back to probability:
Posterior probability = 0.576 / (1 + 0.576) = 0.366 ≈ 37%

This represents a significant increase from my prior of 25%, reflecting the positive signals from Blue Origin's progress toward the November launch.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the transferability of New Shepard landing experience to orbital-class boosters
- I might be underestimating the time pressure of the Mars launch window, which could force shortcuts
- The question requires both a launch before 2026 AND a successful landing - I need to consider both components

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Technical issues could delay the launch past December 2025, making success impossible regardless of landing capability
- Weather conditions in November-December could force multiple scrubs, pushing the launch into 2026
- The landing could be "partially successful" (e.g., touches down but tips over), creating resolution ambiguity

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would put the probability at 20-25%, arguing that:
- The physics of orbital-class booster landings are inherently difficult
- Blue Origin's cautious approach means they haven't had enough iterations to master all failure modes
- The time pressure of the Mars window could force them to attempt landing before they're fully ready

Rebuttal: While these concerns are valid, the strong signals of readiness (booster at pad, firm launch date) and Blue Origin's institutional landing experience provide meaningful counterevidence.

After this red-teaming, I believe my 37% estimate is reasonable but should be adjusted slightly downward to account for the dual requirement of both launching in 2025 AND landing successfully.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, including the base rate, evidence updates, and red-team considerations, I assess the probability that Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" will launch before 2026 and successfully land at 35%.

Final: 35%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event requires two conditions: a launch in 2025 and a successful landing. The most uncertain and critical part is the landing. Therefore, the base rate should focus on the probability of a successful landing on an early attempt with a new orbital-class rocket.

*   **Reference Class:** Early attempts to land an orbital-class rocket booster on a sea-based platform.
*   **Data:** The most relevant data comes from SpaceX's Falcon 9 program. Their first five attempts to land on an Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS) failed. Success came on the sixth attempt. The success rate for the second attempt was 0%. The success rate over the first six attempts was 1/6, or ~17%.
*   **Chosen Prior:** I will select a prior probability of **P(H) = 20%** for a successful landing. This reflects the historical difficulty of this specific task, as demonstrated by the only company to have achieved it. This is a low-confidence prior due to the small sample size (essentially n=1 program), but it correctly anchors the forecast in the reality that this is an exceptionally difficult engineering challenge.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation with Blue Origin's New Glenn differs from the SpaceX Falcon 9 base case in several important ways.

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental task is the same: propulsively landing a large, high-velocity orbital-class first stage on a moving ship. The physics and control challenges are directly comparable.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Learning from a Predecessor:** Blue Origin has had the benefit of observing SpaceX's decade of successes and failures. They are not starting from a blank slate and can incorporate lessons learned from Falcon 9's development into their design and operational procedures. This should increase their probability of success relative to the base case.
    *   **Internal Experience:** Blue Origin has extensive, successful experience with propulsive vertical landings via its suborbital New Shepard program. While the flight regime is much less demanding, this demonstrates mature institutional competence in the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) software and engine systems required for landing. This is a significant advantage SpaceX did not have at the start.
    *   **Corporate Philosophy:** Blue Origin's cautious, methodical approach ("Gradatim Ferociter") contrasts with SpaceX's rapid iterative model. This suggests Blue Origin is less likely to attempt a launch unless they have high internal confidence that they have fully understood and fixed the cause of the first landing failure. This increases the conditional probability of success, given that they proceed with the launch.
    *   **Single Failure Data Point:** A key disadvantage is that Blue Origin has only experienced one failure. They may have fixed the specific cause of that failure, but other unknown failure modes may exist that SpaceX uncovered through its larger number of early attempts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The overall probability is a product of two components: P(Launch in 2025) and P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025).

**A) Probability of Launch in 2025:**
*   **Evidence:** The booster is on the launch pad (as of Oct 8), and the launch is targeted for early November 2025 to send a time-sensitive NASA planetary mission (EscaPADE) to Mars.
*   **Likelihood:** A specific, near-term target for a critical customer with a fixed planetary launch window makes a launch attempt in 2025 highly probable. P(E | Launch in 2025) is very high. Conversely, P(E | Slip to 2026) is very low, as such a major delay would likely have been announced already. This evidence strongly supports a 2025 launch.
*   **Update:** While delays are common in rocketry, the hard deadline imposed by the Mars launch window creates immense pressure to launch on time. I estimate the probability of a launch attempt occurring before the end of 2025 to be high, around **85%**.

**B) Probability of Successful Landing (given a 2025 launch):**
Let's update our 20% prior.
*   **Evidence 1 (Positive):** Proven orbital flight and institutional landing competence (New Shepard). This demonstrates the rocket is fundamentally sound and the company has deep expertise in the core landing technologies. This is evidence you would expect to see if they were on a path to success. Likelihood Ratio (LR) > 1.
*   **Evidence 2 (Positive):** Cautious culture and learning from SpaceX. This suggests a thorough failure analysis and a design that avoids known pitfalls. This also makes success more likely than the base case. LR > 1.
*   **Evidence 3 (Negative):** Single failure data point. This means "unknown unknowns" remain a significant risk. They may have fixed one problem only to be defeated by a second, undiscovered issue. This makes failure more likely. LR < 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's combine the updates for the landing probability.
*   **Prior Odds:** P(Success) = 20% → 0.2 / 0.8 = 1:4.
*   **Update:** The positive evidence (learning from SpaceX, New Shepard experience, cautious culture) significantly outweighs the negative evidence (single failure data point). The fact that this cautious company is proceeding with a critical NASA mission is a strong signal of their internal confidence. This warrants a substantial update from the very low prior. A combined likelihood ratio of ~3 seems appropriate, reflecting that success appears significantly more likely now than the base rate would suggest.
*   **Posterior Odds:** (1:4) * 3 = 3:4.
*   **Posterior Probability:** 3 / (3 + 4) = 3/7 ≈ 43%.

Let's round this conditional probability of a successful landing to **45%**.

**Final Calculation:**
The final probability is the product of the two independent probabilities:
P(Event) = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025)
P(Event) = 0.85 × 0.45 = 0.3825

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 38% hinges on a landing success probability of 45%. Is this too high? The only historical data point for a second attempt is 0%. A jump to 45% is very large. The primary justification is that Blue Origin is not operating in the same environment as early SpaceX; they have a decade of data to learn from. However, the physics remain unforgiving. An alternative, more pessimistic forecast might put the landing probability at only 30%, arguing that the "unknown unknowns" are the dominant factor and that a second attempt is only marginally more likely to succeed than the first. This would yield a final probability of 0.85 * 0.30 = 25.5%.

Conversely, is 45% too low? A cautious, well-funded company with years of relevant experience, having analyzed its first failure, might have a very high chance of success. One could argue their internal P(Success) must be >70% for them to risk a critical NASA mission. This would yield a final probability of 0.85 * 0.70 = 59.5%.

My 45% estimate for the landing sits between these two views, acknowledging both the strong positive signals and the immense, inherent difficulty of the task. The final 38% forecast reflects this balance.

### Final Forecast

The final probability is calculated by multiplying the high likelihood of a launch attempt in 2025 (85%) by the moderate, coin-flip-like probability of the landing itself succeeding on this second attempt (45%). This accounts for both schedule risk and technical risk.

Final: 38%
