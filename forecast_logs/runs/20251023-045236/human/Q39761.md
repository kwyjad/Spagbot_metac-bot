Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **What is the legal and political mechanism for extending martial law in Ukraine?** Is it a routine process or does it face significant debate and opposition?
2.  **What is the primary condition for martial law to be in effect?** What conditions would need to be met for it to be lifted?
3.  **What is the current status and near-term outlook of the Russo-Ukrainian War?** Are there active, large-scale hostilities? Is there a stable ceasefire? Are there credible, high-level peace negotiations underway?
4.  **What is the recent rhetoric from Ukrainian leadership regarding the war's duration and the necessity of martial law?** Do their statements and actions suggest an imminent end to the conflict?
5.  **What are the domestic and international pressures related to martial law?** Is there significant internal or external pressure to lift it and hold elections, even if the war is not fully resolved?

### **Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

1.  **For Mechanism:**
    *   `"Ukraine Verkhovna Rada martial law extension vote"`
    *   `"process for extending martial law Ukraine constitution"`
    *   `"political opposition to martial law extension Ukraine"`
2.  **For Conditions:**
    *   `"Ukrainian law conditions for lifting martial law"`
    *   `"Ukraine constitution elections during martial law"`
3.  **For War Status (using provided sources and projecting):**
    *   `"Russo-Ukrainian war frontline status October 2025"`
    *   `"prospects for Ukraine Russia ceasefire 2025"`
    *   `"ISW report Ukraine October 2025"` (hypothetical search for a typical source of military analysis)
4.  **For Leadership Rhetoric:**
    *   `"Zelenskyy speech war end date 2025"`
    *   `"Ukrainian Ministry of Defence statements recent"`
    *   `"Ukraine National Security and Defense Council priorities 2025"`
5.  **For Pressures:**
    *   `"US European Union pressure Ukraine elections"`
    *   `"Ukrainian public opinion martial law fatigue"`
    *   `"Ukrainian civil society call to end martial law"`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Mechanism:** The process is well-established. The President issues a decree, which is then approved by the Verkhovna Rada (parliament). This has happened 16 times, evolving from a 30-day to a 90-day cycle, indicating it has become a routine legislative procedure during the war. There is no significant political opposition to the extensions as long as the existential threat from Russia persists.
*   **Conditions:** Martial law is tied directly to the state of war and Russian aggression. The Ukrainian Constitution (Article 83) explicitly prohibits parliamentary elections during a state of martial law or emergency. Therefore, lifting martial law is not just a security decision but a political one that would trigger a new election cycle, something unfeasible and destabilizing during active hostilities. The only realistic condition for lifting it is a stable and lasting cessation of hostilities, such as a formal peace treaty or a long-term, guaranteed ceasefire.
*   **War Status:** The provided sources indicate the war is very much active. The most recent source (Oct 21, 2025) details Zelenskyy's plans to ramp up domestic weapons production *by the end of 2025*. This is a forward-looking statement about sustaining a war effort, not winding one down. The Nov 2024 statement about a "chance" the war could end in 2025 appears to have been aspirational and is superseded by more recent, concrete actions focused on continued fighting.
*   **Leadership Rhetoric:** The focus is on military resilience and long-term defense industrial capacity. This is not the rhetoric of a government preparing to declare victory or end emergency measures in the next two weeks. The consistent theme since 2022 has been one of enduring a long fight for victory.
*   **Pressures:** While international partners value Ukrainian democracy, their primary goal is to ensure Ukraine's survival and victory. There is no evidence of them pressuring Ukraine to hold elections (and thus lift martial law) while under intense military attack, as this would be seen as destabilizing and counterproductive to the war effort. Domestic consensus remains strong around the "victory first" principle.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Ukraine's own past extensions (2022-2025):** Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times since February 2022. Conditional on the war continuing, the base rate for extension has been 100%. This is the most relevant reference class.
*   **Modern states in defensive interstate wars:** Countries facing full-scale invasions and existential threats (e.g., UK in WWII, South Korea post-1950) maintain states of emergency or martial law until the primary threat is neutralized or a stable armistice is achieved. The rate of lifting such measures *during* active, high-intensity conflict is near zero.
*   **Ballpark Base Rate:** Given the continuation of active hostilities, the base rate for extension is extremely high, likely **>95%**. The primary uncertainty is not the process, but the small chance of a sudden, conflict-ending event.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-21** Zelenskyy announces goal to produce half of Ukraine's weapons domestically by end of 2025. — ↑ — Signals a long-term war footing and focus on industrial capacity, not an imminent end to the conflict that would allow martial law to lapse.
*   **2025-08-07** (Inferred) Verkhovna Rada approves the 16th extension of martial law and general mobilization for 90 days, until November 5, 2025. — ↑ — Reinforces the routine, non-controversial nature of the extension process as a necessary administrative step during the war.
*   **2025-03-03** Analysis highlights Zelenskyy's continued role as a wartime leader, rallying support. — ↑ — Emphasizes that the fundamental context of his presidency remains defined by the ongoing war, the very reason for martial law.
*   **2024-11-24** Zelenskyy states there is "every chance" the war could end in 2025. — ↓ — This year-old aspirational statement is the strongest piece of evidence against extension, but its relevance has faded significantly over time.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **State of the Conflict (Large):** This is the master driver. If active, large-scale hostilities are ongoing, extension is a near-certainty. Only a durable, comprehensive ceasefire or peace treaty would drive a decision to let it lapse.
*   **Legal Necessity for Mobilization (Large):** Martial law provides the legal framework for military mobilization, resource allocation, and civil defense. Lifting it would cripple the state's ability to prosecute the war.
*   **Constitutional Prohibition on Elections (Large):** The constitution forbids elections under martial law. Lifting it would trigger a complex and distracting election period, which leadership sees as a dangerous vulnerability during wartime. This creates a high barrier to reversal.
*   **Domestic Political Consensus (Moderate):** The shared sense of existential threat ensures broad political and public support for wartime measures. A collapse in this unity could create pressure, but this is unlikely while the threat remains acute.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Routinization:** Unlike the first few extensions, the 17th extension is now a standard operating procedure. The institutional momentum is immense, making non-extension the radical choice requiring a dramatic change in circumstances.
*   **Cumulative War Fatigue:** While the base rate is strong, this will be the 17th extension after more than 3.5 years of full-scale war. While fatigue is a real factor, it has not yet translated into political pressure to abandon necessary war measures.
*   **Shift in Focus to Sustainability:** Recent rhetoric (e.g., domestic arms production) differs from earlier phases of the war. It reflects an acceptance of a long war, which paradoxically strengthens the case for extending the legal frameworks needed to sustain it.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very strong prior based on the reference class of 16 prior extensions during an ongoing war. A prior of ~95% with an equivalent n of ~20 seems appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The Oct 2025 focus on future weapons production is powerful, recent evidence that leadership is planning for continued conflict beyond the resolution date.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The well-oiled, routine legislative process for extension creates a powerful status quo bias.
    *   (↑ Moderate)

To forecast whether Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for extending martial law in Ukraine is extremely high, given the historical context. Since February 2022, martial law has been extended 16 times, each time for 90 days. This suggests a base rate of nearly 100% for extension during ongoing conflict. For the purpose of this analysis, I'll use a base rate of 95% to account for any unforeseen developments.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The situation remains largely unchanged from previous extensions. The war is ongoing, and martial law is a routine legislative process. The existential threat from Russia persists, and the legal framework for mobilization and defense is still necessary.
   - **Differences:** There is some war fatigue, and the focus on domestic arms production suggests a long-term conflict strategy. However, these factors do not significantly alter the likelihood of extending martial law.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Evidence 1:** Zelenskyy's announcement to ramp up domestic weapons production by the end of 2025 indicates a long-term war effort. This evidence strongly supports the continuation of martial law. Likelihood ratio: High (↑).
   - **Evidence 2:** The routine nature of martial law extensions, with no significant political opposition, suggests a high probability of continuation. Likelihood ratio: High (↑).
   - **Evidence 3:** Zelenskyy's earlier statement about the war potentially ending in 2025 is outdated and less relevant given recent developments. Likelihood ratio: Low (↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 95% probability translates to odds of 19:1.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong evidence for continuation, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1.
   - **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 19:1 × High likelihood ratio.
   - **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability remains very high, close to the prior, given the strong supporting evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast could be overconfident if there is a sudden, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough. However, current evidence does not support this scenario.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A rapid de-escalation or peace agreement could change the situation, but these are unlikely given the current war status and leadership rhetoric.
   - **Rebuttals:** The focus on long-term military capacity and the absence of significant pressure to lift martial law reinforce the forecast.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the high base rate, strong supporting evidence, and lack of credible counter-evidence, the probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025, remains extremely high.

Final: 98%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Ukraine's own history of martial law extensions during the current conflict as the most relevant reference class.

- Since February 2022, Ukraine has extended martial law 16 consecutive times, with a 100% extension rate during the ongoing war
- The extensions have become routine, shifting from 30-day to 90-day periods
- For countries in defensive interstate wars facing existential threats, martial law or emergency measures typically remain until the threat is neutralized or a stable armistice is achieved

**Prior probability:** 95% that martial law will be extended

This high prior reflects the strong historical pattern of extensions during active conflict, with only a small allowance for unexpected developments that could rapidly end hostilities.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental condition for martial law (active Russian invasion) remains unchanged
- The legal and political mechanism for extension is well-established and routine
- The constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law creates a strong institutional incentive to maintain it

**Differences from base case:**
- Duration: By November 2025, martial law will have been in effect for nearly 4 years, potentially creating war fatigue
- Zelenskyy stated in November 2024 there was "every chance" the war could end in 2025, suggesting some optimism
- The war has evolved into a more static, attritional conflict compared to earlier phases

The differences don't significantly alter the probability because recent evidence suggests Ukraine is preparing for continued conflict, not winding down.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Zelenskyy's October 2025 announcement about domestic weapons production**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Planning for domestic weapons production "by the end of 2025" strongly indicates expectation of continued conflict
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.05) - Such long-term military planning would be inconsistent with imminent end to martial law
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of extension
- This significantly increases probability of extension

**Evidence 2: Constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.99) - The legal barrier creates strong institutional momentum for extension
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Lifting martial law would trigger elections, creating political instability during wartime
- Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases probability of extension

**Evidence 3: Zelenskyy's November 2024 statement about war possibly ending in 2025**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Such statements are compatible with continued martial law if "ending" meant favorable developments but not complete resolution
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - This would be more consistent with preparations to end martial law
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67:1 against extension
- This slightly decreases probability of extension, but is outweighed by more recent evidence

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 95:5 (19:1)

Update based on Evidence 1 (weapons production plans):
- Posterior odds = 19:1 × 19:1 = 361:1
- Posterior probability ≈ 99.7%

Adjusting for Evidence 2 (constitutional prohibition):
- Posterior odds = 361:1 × 5:1 = 1805:1
- Posterior probability ≈ 99.9%

Adjusting for Evidence 3 (Zelenskyy's 2024 statement):
- Posterior odds = 1805:1 × 0.67:1 ≈ 1209:1
- Posterior probability ≈ 99.9%

This mathematical update seems too extreme. Let me recalibrate based on the overall weight of evidence and uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough**: A sudden ceasefire agreement or peace framework could emerge in the next two weeks, though this seems highly unlikely given current battlefield conditions and negotiating positions.

2. **Domestic political pressure**: After nearly 4 years of war, internal pressure to return to normal democratic processes could build, though there's no evidence of this in current Ukrainian politics.

3. **International pressure**: Western allies might push for elections as a democratic signal, though this would be counterproductive during active conflict.

4. **Overconfidence in continuity**: I may be overweighting the status quo and underestimating the chance of rapid change in a volatile conflict.

5. **Limited recent information**: My analysis relies on limited recent data points, which increases uncertainty.

Given these considerations, I should moderate my extremely high posterior probability. While the evidence strongly supports extension, the inherent uncertainty of wartime conditions warrants some caution.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the strong base rate of extensions, recent evidence of Ukraine preparing for continued conflict through 2025, the constitutional barriers to elections during martial law, and the absence of any credible peace process, I assess there is a very high probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025.

I'll adjust my mathematically derived probability downward to account for inherent uncertainty in conflict situations, but maintain a high confidence in extension.

Final: 93%

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own record of extending martial law since the full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022.

*   **Reference Class:** Extensions of martial law by the Ukrainian government during the 2022-present Russo-Ukrainian War.
*   **Data:** As of October 2025, martial law has been extended 16 consecutive times. Every time the measure was set to expire while the war was ongoing, it was renewed.
*   **Calculation:** The historical frequency within this highly specific reference class is 16 out of 16, or 100%.
*   **Prior Probability:** A raw base rate of 100% is too strong, as it allows for no uncertainty. A more cautious Bayesian approach would start with a very high prior that reflects this perfect track record but allows for the possibility of a change in circumstances. I will set the initial prior at **98%**. This corresponds to prior odds of 98:2, or 49:1, in favor of extension.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is remarkably similar to the previous 16 instances where martial law was extended.

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental condition—an active, large-scale war of national survival against Russia—persists. The legal framework, which links martial law to mobilization and prohibits elections, remains unchanged. The same political leadership is in place and has consistently framed the extensions as a non-negotiable necessity for the war effort.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the sheer duration of the war, now over 3.5 years. One might expect cumulative war fatigue to create political pressure against another extension. However, there is no evidence this fatigue has translated into a political movement to lift essential wartime measures. In fact, the opposite appears true: the long duration has routinized the extension process, making it a standard, expected administrative act by the Verkhovna Rada.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "Ukraine extends martial law beyond November 5, 2025," and ~H be the hypothesis that it does not.

*   **Evidence 1: Legal and Constitutional Necessity.** The Ukrainian Constitution (Article 83) forbids parliamentary elections during martial law. Lifting martial law would trigger a distracting and potentially destabilizing election cycle during a war. Furthermore, martial law provides the legal basis for general mobilization.
    *   P(E1 | H): Very high. These legal facts are a primary *reason* to extend martial law.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): Very low. To let martial law lapse, the government would have to be willing to abandon the legal basis for mobilization and trigger elections, an almost unthinkable act during active hostilities.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (>> 1). This evidence increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Recent Government Rhetoric.** A (hypothetical) October 21, 2025 statement by President Zelenskyy outlines plans to significantly ramp up domestic weapons production *by the end of 2025*.
    *   P(E2 | H): High. This rhetoric is perfectly aligned with a government planning for a continued, long-term war effort, which requires the legal framework of martial law.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): Extremely low. It is highly contradictory for a leader to announce long-term war production goals just two weeks before voluntarily dismantling the legal authority to conduct the war.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors H (>> 1). This recent evidence significantly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Lack of Significant Opposition.** The extensions have become a routine procedure, passed with overwhelming support in the Verkhovna Rada. There is no significant political or social movement calling for an end to martial law while the existential threat remains.
    *   P(E3 | H): High. This is the expected state of affairs if extension is seen as a necessity.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): Very low. A decision not to extend would likely be preceded by intense public debate and political fracturing, none of which is evident.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (> 1). This evidence increases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 49:1 (from 98% probability).
*   **Updating with Evidence:** Each piece of evidence strongly supports the hypothesis (H). The legal necessity and the recent rhetoric on war production are particularly powerful.
    *   Let's consider the combined likelihood ratio of the evidence. Given that the evidence is recent, directly relevant, and points uniformly in one direction, a combined LR of at least 2 seems conservative.
    *   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 49:1 × 2 = 98:1.
*   **Posterior Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 98 / (1 + 98) = 98/99 ≈ 98.99%.
*   **Summary:** The very high prior is confirmed and slightly strengthened by all available current evidence. The probability is extremely high.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong. For martial law *not* to be extended, one of the following low-probability events would likely need to occur in the next ~13 days:

1.  **A Sudden, Decisive End to the War:** This could be a sudden collapse of the Russian front or the signing of a surprise peace treaty. There are no current indicators of either.
2.  **A Major Political Rupture in Ukraine:** A collapse of the government or a successful coup that leads to a new regime unwilling or unable to pass the extension. This is highly unlikely given the demonstrated political unity in the face of the invasion.
3.  **Extreme International Pressure:** A key ally, like the United States, could theoretically threaten to cut off all aid unless elections are held, forcing Ukraine to let martial law lapse. This would be counter-productive to the ally's stated goal of ensuring Ukraine's victory and is therefore extremely improbable.

The best argument for a lower probability (e.g., 90%) would be to assign a higher weight to the "unknown unknowns" or the possibility of a "black swan" event. However, given the short time frame (the decision is due by Nov 5) and the immense institutional momentum behind extension, the probability of such a disruptive event is minimal. My posterior of ~99% already accounts for a 1% chance of such an unforeseen event.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate of 16 consecutive extensions during the war establishes an extremely strong prior. The current evidence—the legal necessity, the routine nature of the process, and recent leadership rhetoric focused on a long-term war effort—all reinforce this prior. The conditions for not extending martial law require a fundamental, rapid, and unforeseen change in the military or political situation, which is highly improbable in the next two weeks.

Final: 99%
