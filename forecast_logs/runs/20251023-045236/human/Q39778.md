### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections (within a regional group):** This is the most relevant class. Historically, it is uncommon for competing bids within a regional group to lead to a prolonged public stalemate. More often, a consensus candidate emerges through internal negotiations well before a formal decision deadline. In the recent contested bid for COP29 (Eastern European Group), a deal was struck where one candidate (Bulgaria) withdrew in exchange for geopolitical concessions, allowing the other (Azerbaijan) to proceed. This suggests that stalemates are resolved through diplomatic deals, not by forcing a vote or defaulting. **Base Rate:** The base rate of a stalemate proceeding to the default location (Bonn) is very low, likely <5%. The base rate for the candidate with broader initial support eventually winning after a compromise is high, perhaps 70-80%.
2.  **All COP Host Selections:** In the vast majority of cases (~95%), the designated regional group puts forward a single, consensus candidate without public contestation. The process is typically a formality. This highlights how unusual the current Australia-Turkey situation is.
3.  **WEOG Decision-Making:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is politically diverse (incl. USA, EU nations, Canada, Australia, Israel, Turkey). Decisions are made by consensus, meaning any member can effectively veto a proposal. This mechanism elevates the power of a single dissenting member, making stalemates more possible than in more homogenous groups.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-04-17** ↑ (Australia) — A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute highlights the bid's strategic importance, but also notes surprise among Pacific partners about the choice of Adelaide, indicating potential friction in the co-hosting arrangement.
*   **2025-02-26** ↑ (Australia) — South Australia's government highlights its local climate initiatives, reinforcing the sub-national commitment and logistical readiness for hosting in Adelaide.
*   **2024-11-26** ↓ (Australia) / ↑ (Turkey/Germany) — Reports confirm the decision, expected at COP29, was postponed to June 2025 due to the standoff. This is a significant indicator that Turkey's opposition is not symbolic and has successfully stalled the process.
*   **2024-11-24** ↓ (Australia) / ↑ (Turkey/Germany) — Analysis from *The Conversation* frames the bid as being "in limbo," underscoring the seriousness of the deadlock and the failure to achieve consensus within WEOG.
*   **2024-11-20** ↔ (Neutral) — The Guardian explicitly reports an Australia-Turkey "standoff," confirming the two-way nature of the contest and the consensus-based decision mechanism as the primary obstacle.
*   **2024-10-01** ↑ (Australia) — The South Australian government confirms its active engagement and planned presence at COP30, signaling continued investment and political will behind the Adelaide-based bid.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** This is the primary mechanism. Turkey does not need to build a coalition; its sole objection is sufficient to block Australia's bid and prevent a decision. This gives it immense leverage. **Size: Large.**
2.  **Diplomatic Horse-Trading:** The resolution likely hinges on a deal unrelated to climate policy. Turkey may be using its veto as leverage to secure support for another international candidacy, a geopolitical goal, or a guaranteed WEOG nomination for a future COP (e.g., COP36). **Size: Large.**
3.  **Reputational Cost of Failure:** The prospect of the conference defaulting to Bonn represents a collective failure for WEOG. This puts pressure on *both* Australia and Turkey to find a compromise, as neither wants to be blamed for the failure. This pressure increases as the deadline approaches. **Size: Moderate.**
4.  **Strength of the Australia-Pacific Narrative:** The "co-hosted with frontline nations" narrative gives Australia a strong moral and political argument. This likely secured the broad support it already has and makes it politically costly for other WEOG members to abandon Australia's bid. **Size: Moderate.**
5.  **Australian Domestic Politics:** The Australian government has invested significant political capital in this bid. A failure to secure it would be a domestic and international setback. This strengthens its resolve to negotiate a solution rather than withdraw. **Size: Small.**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Co-Hosting Model:** Australia's bid is not for itself alone but in "partnership with Pacific nations." This is a novel arrangement for a developed country host and is a central part of its political appeal, distinguishing it from a standard single-nation bid.
*   **Prolonged Public Stalemate:** Unlike the COP29 case which was resolved relatively quickly behind the scenes, this standoff has been public for nearly a year and has already forced a formal postponement of the decision. This suggests the diplomatic gap is wider than usual.
*   **Geopolitical Diversity of WEOG:** The reference class of "regional group" is broad. WEOG is arguably the most politically fragmented UN group, containing old Europe, North America, and geopolitical outliers like Israel and Turkey. This makes consensus harder to achieve than in more cohesive groups.
*   **Lack of a Clear "Quid Pro Quo":** In past disputes, the outlines of a potential deal were often visible (e.g., resolving other regional conflicts). Here, it is not publicly known what Turkey wants in exchange for dropping its bid, making the path to resolution opaque.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior favoring Australia (~60%) based on its broad WEOG support and well-developed bid, with Turkey as a significant challenger (~25%) and a non-trivial chance for the Bonn default (~15%). Equivalent n: ~10 (reflecting some confidence in the initial reports of broad support but acknowledging the uncertainty of consensus).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The formal postponement of the decision from late 2024 to mid-2025 (and the continued silence since) is strong evidence that Turkey's opposition is not symbolic and that Australia's support is not sufficient to force consensus. This significantly increases the probability of Turkey and Germany.
    *   (↑ Small) Continued public commitment and funding from Australian federal and state governments shows their resolve, slightly increasing the chance they will find a way to make a deal rather than withdraw.
    *   (↔ Neutral) The "moral weight" of the Pacific partnership appears to have solidified Australia's existing support but has not been sufficient to overcome Turkey's veto.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the initial prior was too optimistic for Australia. The posterior probability for Australia should be revised downwards significantly. The probabilities for Turkey (succeeding via a deal) and Germany (default host) should be revised upwards commensurately. The situation is closer to a toss-up between the three main outcomes than a clear Australian lead.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP (Australia):**
    *   Official statement from Turkey withdrawing its bid.
    *   Joint statement from Australia and Turkey announcing a cooperative agreement.
    *   High-level diplomatic visits between Australian, Turkish, and key WEOG leaders (e.g., US, Germany, France).
    *   Leaked reports of a deal being offered to Turkey (e.g., support for a different international post).
*   **DOWN (Australia) / UP (Turkey/Germany):**
    *   Official announcement of another delay in the decision beyond COP30 (Nov 2025).
    *   Statements from WEOG officials expressing frustration with the deadlock.
    *   Turkey announcing a high-profile launch event or campaign for its own bid.
    *   UNFCCC secretariat begins preliminary logistical planning for a Bonn-based COP31.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Diplomacy:** The final decision will be made in closed-door negotiations. Public statements may be posturing, and the true state of play is likely hidden. A surprise resolution is highly possible.
*   **"Host Country" Definition:** If Australia wins, the resolution is clear. But a complex compromise could emerge (e.g., a co-presidency with Turkey, even if the event is in Australia) that might complicate the resolution criteria. The criteria state "home country of the announced host city," which seems robust.
*   **Possibility of a New Bidder:** While unlikely this late, another WEOG country could theoretically be put forward as a compromise candidate, falling under the "Other" category.
*   **Information Lag:** The most critical information (the status of negotiations) is not public. We are relying on media reports that are months old, and the situation could have changed significantly.

**Final Research Summary:**
The selection of the COP31 host is deadlocked between Australia's broadly-supported bid with Pacific nations and Turkey's blocking bid. The decision, which requires consensus within the WEOG group, has been delayed, indicating the stalemate is serious and significantly reduces Australia's chances from being a clear favorite to one of three plausible outcomes: a negotiated Australian win, a Turkish win via concession, or a default to Germany.

To forecast which country will host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP 31) in 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia:** Historically, the candidate with broader initial support within the regional group often wins after negotiations. Given Australia's broad support and the strategic importance of its bid, a reasonable base rate might be 60%.
- **Turkey:** As the only other official bid, Turkey's base rate could be around 25%, reflecting its ability to block consensus and leverage for concessions.
- **Germany (Bonn):** The base rate for a stalemate leading to the default location is low, around 10%, based on historical precedent.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation:** Unlikely given the current bids, so a base rate of 2% seems reasonable.
- **Other:** The possibility of a new bidder emerging is low, so a base rate of 3% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The situation reflects typical WEOG decision-making, where consensus is required, and diplomatic negotiations are key.
- **Differences:** The prolonged public stalemate and Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations are unusual, suggesting a more complex negotiation process.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia's Strategic Importance:** The Australian Strategic Policy Institute highlights the bid's importance, suggesting a likelihood of 0.7 if Australia is the host.
- **Turkey's Opposition:** The postponement of the decision due to Turkey's opposition suggests a likelihood of 0.6 if Turkey is the host.
- **Germany as Default:** The lack of resolution and the possibility of a default to Bonn suggest a likelihood of 0.5 if Germany is the host.
- **Australia's Continued Commitment:** The ongoing commitment from Australian governments slightly increases the likelihood of Australia hosting to 0.65.
- **Stalemate and Deadlock:** The deadlock and lack of consensus increase the likelihood of Turkey or Germany hosting to 0.55.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia:** Prior odds = 60/40. Evidence (strategic importance and commitment) increases likelihood to 0.65. Posterior odds = (60/40) * (0.65/0.35) ≈ 1.11. Posterior probability ≈ 52%.
- **Turkey:** Prior odds = 25/75. Evidence (opposition and deadlock) increases likelihood to 0.6. Posterior odds = (25/75) * (0.6/0.4) ≈ 0.5. Posterior probability ≈ 33%.
- **Germany:** Prior odds = 10/90. Evidence (default possibility) increases likelihood to 0.5. Posterior odds = (10/90) * (0.5/0.5) ≈ 0.11. Posterior probability ≈ 10%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation:** Remains at 2% due to lack of evidence.
- **Other:** Remains at 3% due to lack of evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** The forecast might overestimate Australia's chances given the deadlock. Adjusting for this, Turkey's probability could be slightly higher.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider the possibility of a surprise resolution or a new bid emerging.
- **Alternative Forecast:** Turkey could leverage its position more effectively, increasing its probability.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

- Australia: 52%
- Turkey: 33%
- Germany: 10%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
- Other: 3%

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 52%  
Turkey: 33%  
Germany: 10%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%  
Other: 3%

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia has a formal bid with apparent broad support within WEOG
- The co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations gives it political and moral weight
- Australia has committed significant resources and political capital

**Turkey**: 30%
- Rationale: Turkey has a formal bid and has successfully blocked consensus
- The consensus requirement gives Turkey significant leverage
- Historical patterns show that persistent objectors often extract concessions

**Germany**: 15%
- Rationale: As the default option if consensus fails, this has a non-trivial probability
- The prolonged stalemate increases this likelihood
- Historical precedent suggests default options are rarely needed (~5%), but this case has unusual features

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 5%
- Rationale: This would likely only occur as part of a compromise with Australia
- The infrastructure requirements make a standalone Pacific host unlikely

**Other**: 5%
- Rationale: This covers other WEOG members emerging as compromise candidates
- Also includes the small possibility of procedural changes or unexpected developments

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical COP host selection:**
- The process follows the established regional rotation system
- The decision requires consensus within the regional group
- Diplomatic negotiations are the primary mechanism for resolution

**Key differences:**
- The public, prolonged nature of the Australia-Turkey standoff is unusual
- The formal postponement of the decision indicates a serious impasse
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations is novel
- WEOG is particularly diverse politically, making consensus harder to achieve
- The lack of a visible path to compromise distinguishes this from other contested bids

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring Australia:**
- Broad initial support within WEOG (P(E|Australia) = 0.8, P(E|~Australia) = 0.3)
- Continued investment and commitment from federal and state governments (P(E|Australia) = 0.9, P(E|~Australia) = 0.5)
- The moral weight of the Pacific partnership (P(E|Australia) = 0.7, P(E|~Australia) = 0.4)

**Evidence favoring Turkey:**
- Successfully blocked consensus despite Australia's support (P(E|Turkey) = 0.8, P(E|~Turkey) = 0.3)
- Forced a formal postponement of the decision (P(E|Turkey) = 0.7, P(E|~Turkey) = 0.2)
- No public signs of Turkey withdrawing its bid (P(E|Turkey) = 0.9, P(E|~Turkey) = 0.6)

**Evidence favoring Germany (default):**
- Prolonged stalemate with no resolution (P(E|Germany) = 0.7, P(E|~Germany) = 0.3)
- Lack of visible compromise path (P(E|Germany) = 0.6, P(E|~Germany) = 0.2)
- Precedent of UNFCCC headquarters as fallback (P(E|Germany) = 0.9, P(E|~Germany) = 0.1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the key evidence of the formal postponement:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: P(postponement|Australia)/P(postponement|~Australia) = 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 0.43 = 0.35
- Posterior probability: 0.35/(1+0.35) = 26%

For Turkey:
- Prior probability: 30%
- Prior odds: 30/70 = 0.43
- Likelihood ratio: P(postponement|Turkey)/P(postponement|~Turkey) = 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 0.43 × 2.33 = 1.00
- Posterior probability: 1.00/(1+1.00) = 50%

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.18
- Likelihood ratio: P(postponement|Germany)/P(postponement|~Germany) = 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 0.18 × 2.33 = 0.42
- Posterior probability: 0.42/(1+0.42) = 30%

Updating on continued Australian commitment:
- This slightly increases Australia's probability (perhaps by 2-3 percentage points)
- It slightly decreases both Turkey and Germany

Updating on lack of visible compromise:
- This slightly decreases Australia's probability
- It slightly increases Germany's probability
- It has a neutral effect on Turkey

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the likelihood of the default option (Germany). Historically, diplomatic solutions are almost always found.
- I might be underestimating Australia's ability to offer Turkey sufficient concessions to withdraw.
- The information available is limited and potentially outdated. Negotiations could be much further along than public reports suggest.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A compromise candidate from another WEOG country could emerge.
- A novel co-hosting arrangement between Australia and Turkey could be negotiated.
- The decision could be further postponed beyond 2025, potentially changing the dynamics.

**Best alternative forecast:**
- A stronger case could be made for Australia (40-45%) based on its initial support and the political cost to Turkey of being seen as obstructionist.
- However, this is countered by the evidence of Turkey's successful blocking so far and the lack of visible progress toward resolution.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I'll adjust my probabilities:

Australia: 35%
Turkey: 40%
Germany: 18%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 4%

Total: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 35%
Turkey: 40%
Germany: 18%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 4%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is **contested host selections for UN conferences within a regional group that requires consensus**. This is a narrow but highly relevant class.

*   **Base Rate for the Favorite:** In such contests, there is typically a "favorite" with broader initial support and a "challenger" using procedural rules (like a veto) to block them. The favorite usually wins, but often only after making concessions. A reasonable prior for the favorite (Australia) winning would be around **60%**.
*   **Base Rate for the Challenger:** The challenger (Turkey) has a non-trivial chance of either being bought off with the hosting rights themselves or another significant concession. A prior for the challenger winning is lower, perhaps **25%**.
*   **Base Rate for Default/Failure:** The option of the conference defaulting to the headquarters location (Bonn, Germany) represents a collective failure for the regional group. There is strong pressure to avoid this. The base rate for this outcome is low, around **15%**.
*   **Base Rate for Others:** The emergence of a new compromise candidate ("Other") or a fundamental change to the bid ("Another Pacific Island Nation") is very rare this late in the process. I'll assign a prior of **<1%** to each.

So, my initial prior distribution is: Australia 60%, Turkey 25%, Germany 15%, Another Pacific Island Nation 0%, Other 0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation fits the base case well: a WEOG group decision requiring consensus, a clear favorite (Australia, with its Pacific partnership narrative), and a challenger (Turkey) using its veto power to create a stalemate.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Prolonged Public Stalemate:** The key difference is that this stalemate is not being resolved quickly behind the scenes. The decision was officially postponed from late 2024 to mid-2025, and as of late 2025, there is still no public resolution. This is a much longer and more public deadlock than is typical, suggesting the diplomatic gap is wider than usual.
    2.  **Geopolitical Diversity of WEOG:** The Western European and Others Group is exceptionally diverse (containing the US, EU nations, Canada, but also Turkey and Israel). This diversity can make consensus-building more difficult than in more politically homogenous regional groups.

These differences suggest that the base rate probabilities for the challenger (Turkey) and the default option (Germany) should be considered higher than in a typical case, while the favorite's (Australia) chances are lower.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most crucial piece of evidence is **(E): The official postponement of the decision due to the Australia-Turkey standoff.** Let's assess its likelihood under each hypothesis (H).

*   **P(E | Australia wins):** Low to Moderate. If Australia were a guaranteed winner, they would have likely secured consensus already. A long delay indicates their initial support was insufficient to overcome Turkey's block, forcing them into difficult negotiations they might not win.
*   **P(E | Turkey wins):** High. Forcing a stalemate and delaying the decision is the primary strategy for a challenger with veto power. This is precisely the path they would take to extract a concession, which might be the hosting rights themselves.
*   **P(E | Germany wins):** Very High. A default to Germany can *only* happen after a prolonged and failed negotiation. A public postponement is a necessary precondition for this outcome.

The evidence of the postponement strongly disconfirms the hypothesis that Australia is a clear favorite and significantly increases the likelihood of the Turkey and Germany outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update the priors based on the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:**
    *   Australia vs. (Turkey or Germany): 60 / 40 = 1.5
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence (postponement) is much more likely if Turkey or Germany wins than if Australia wins. The likelihood ratio P(E|Turkey or Germany) / P(E|Australia) is significantly greater than 1. This will substantially reduce Australia's odds.
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    1.  Start with the prior: Australia 60%, Turkey 25%, Germany 15%.
    2.  The strong evidence of a prolonged stalemate significantly damages Australia's chances. I will cut its probability roughly in half, from 60% to around 35-40%.
    3.  This probability mass must be redistributed to Turkey and Germany, as the evidence is highly consistent with both of those outcomes. The stalemate makes both a Turkish victory (as a concession) and a German default (as a failure to agree) much more plausible. I will distribute the ~25 points lost by Australia primarily to these two options.
    4.  Given that a default is a sign of total failure, and diplomatic efforts will continue, Turkey winning via a deal seems slightly more probable than a complete collapse of negotiations. Therefore, I'll assign slightly more of the new probability to Turkey than to Germany.

This leads to a posterior that looks something like: Australia ~38%, Turkey ~34%, Germany ~25%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Blind Spots:** The entire process is happening in opaque, closed-door negotiations. Public information is scarce and potentially months out of date. A deal could have been struck recently, or the positions could have hardened further. My forecast is based on the last known state of public play (a stalemate).
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is that Australia is still the clear favorite (>50%). The argument would be that Turkey is using this as leverage for something entirely unrelated to COP, and once they get it, they will drop their bid. In this view, the stalemate is just part of the price, not a genuine threat to Australia's bid.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, the length of the stalemate and the missed deadline suggest this is more than simple horse-trading. The reputational cost of forcing a default to Bonn is high for *all* parties, which creates a "game of chicken." This makes the outcome highly uncertain and brings the three main possibilities (Australia, Turkey, Germany) much closer together in probability than a "favorite vs. longshot" model would suggest.
*   **The "Other" options:**
    *   "Another Pacific Island Nation": This is part of Australia's bid, not a separate one. The host city is Adelaide, Australia. For this option to resolve, the bid would have to be fundamentally changed, which is extremely unlikely. I will keep its probability very low.
    *   "Other": A compromise candidate from WEOG (e.g., Canada, Switzerland) could be proposed to break the deadlock. This is a real, albeit low-probability, possibility. I will assign a small percentage here.

After red-teaming, I feel my distribution, which reflects high uncertainty and three viable outcomes, is appropriate.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will slightly adjust the probabilities to sum to 100% while reflecting the core reasoning.

*   **Australia (38%):** Still the slight favorite due to its broad initial support and the strong political narrative of the Pacific partnership. However, the path to consensus is now clearly blocked.
*   **Turkey (34%):** Has demonstrated significant leverage. Winning the bid as a concession is a very plausible outcome.
*   **Germany (25%):** The probability of a complete failure of negotiations leading to the default host is now substantial, far higher than the base rate, due to the prolonged and public nature of the stalemate.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation (1%):** A tail-risk scenario involving a radical change to the existing Australian bid.
*   **Other (2%):** A compromise WEOG candidate emerges to break the deadlock.

The sum is 38 + 34 + 25 + 1 + 2 = 100%.

### Output Format

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 34%
Germany: 25%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 2%
