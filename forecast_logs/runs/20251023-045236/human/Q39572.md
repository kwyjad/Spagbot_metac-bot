### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Bilateral Financial Rescues of Major Economies:** This class includes instances where the US, often through the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) or Fed swap lines, directly intervened to stabilize a major economy outside of standard IMF/World Bank channels. The most prominent modern example is the 1995 Mexico "Tequila Crisis" bailout. Such direct, large-scale interventions are rare, typically reserved for countries with significant systemic or geopolitical importance to the US.
    *   **Base Rate:** **5-10%**. Derived from the handful of such events over the past 50+ years across dozens of financial crises. The default US posture is to work through the IMF.
2.  **Activation of Fed Swap Lines for Emerging Markets:** The Federal Reserve maintains standing swap lines with several major central banks but has also extended them to emerging markets during crises (e.g., 2008, 2020). Activation is more common than a full Treasury-led bailout but still infrequent and usually part of a coordinated global response.
    *   **Base Rate:** **15-20%**. This rate is higher because swap lines are a more established, less politically intensive tool than direct loans, but their use by a specific, non-core country in an idiosyncratic crisis remains uncommon.
3.  **Argentine Sovereign Debt Crises Leading to External Support:** Argentina has a long history of economic crises requiring external financial support. In almost all modern cases, the primary interlocutor has been the IMF, not the US directly.
    *   **Base Rate (for US *direct* bailout):** **<5%**. Historically, the US has used its influence within the IMF to shape rescue packages for Argentina rather than acting unilaterally.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-04-12] Argentina lifts most currency controls and allows the peso to float freely. — ↑ — Creates the conditions for currency volatility that could necessitate intervention and support.
*   [2025-07-07] OECD forecasts strong GDP growth of 5.2% for Argentina in 2025. — ↓ — Positive economic outlook reduces the perceived immediate need for an emergency bailout.
*   [2025-09-19] Argentina's central bank (BCRA) intervenes to defend the peso amid sharp depreciation. — ↑ — Demonstrates that despite positive forecasts, the currency is under significant stress, depleting reserves and making external support more likely.
*   [2025-09-24] US announces plans for a $20 billion swap line with Argentina's central bank. — ↑↑ — The single most important development. It establishes a clear mechanism for a bailout and signals high-level US political will to prevent a collapse.
*   [2025-09-24] President Trump downplays the plan as a "bailout" but vows to "help" Argentina. — ↑ (net effect) — While the rhetoric is cautious, the confirmation of "help" from the highest level reinforces US commitment, even if it's framed differently for political reasons.
*   [2025-10-17] Report notes Argentina's fiscal surplus relies on temporary measures. — ↑ — Suggests underlying economic fragility and that the positive macro story could unravel, increasing the probability of needing the swap line.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Severity of Currency Crisis:** A sudden, uncontrollable depreciation of the peso that depletes BCRA's net foreign reserves is the most direct trigger for drawing on the swap line. (Size: Large)
2.  **US Geopolitical & Ideological Alignment:** The Milei government's strong pro-US alignment, in contrast to previous Peronist governments, makes the US administration (especially a Trump one) far more willing to offer direct support to ensure the success of a free-market ally in the region. (Size: Large)
3.  **Domestic Political Feasibility in Argentina:** Milei's government must be willing to accept the political implications of using US support, which could be framed by opponents as a loss of sovereignty. However, his ideology makes this highly probable if needed. (Size: Small)
4.  **Alternative Funding Sources:** Argentina's ability to secure financing from the IMF, China, or private capital markets. If these are unavailable or too slow, the US swap line becomes the only option. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **US Domestic Politics:** The US administration's willingness to expend political capital on a foreign bailout, which can be unpopular. Trump's framing of it as "help" rather than a "bailout" is a tactic to manage this. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Ideological Alignment:** Unlike most historical Argentine crises where the government was ideologically distant or hostile to Washington, the Milei-Trump alignment creates a powerful political incentive for a US-led success story, bypassing typical institutional channels.
*   **Proactive Support Mechanism:** The US has already announced the swap line *before* a full-blown collapse. In most reference cases (e.g., Mexico '95), the rescue package is assembled reactively *during* the acute phase of the crisis. This pre-positioning makes activation easier and faster.
*   **Bypass of the IMF:** The clear preference for a bilateral US-Argentina solution is a departure from the standard playbook of directing crisis-hit countries to the IMF, where the US is a major shareholder but not the sole actor.
*   **Conflicting Economic Signals:** The situation is unusual in that a severe currency crisis is unfolding against a backdrop of positive (or at least improving) macroeconomic forecasts (GDP growth, receding inflation). This suggests a crisis of confidence and currency stability rather than a wholesale economic collapse.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the "Geopolitically aligned Latin American country in crisis" reference class, a prior of ~25% seems appropriate, reflecting that such direct support is possible but not guaranteed (n≈4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑↑ Large) The public announcement of a $20B swap line is powerful evidence of intent and mechanism, dramatically increasing the odds.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The strong ideological alignment between Milei and the US administration provides a robust political motive absent in most historical cases.
    *   (↑ Small) Active currency intervention by the BCRA confirms that stress is real and reserves are being spent, moving Argentina closer to needing the facility.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Strong GDP and inflation forecasts from credible sources (OECD, BBVA) act as significant counter-evidence, questioning the *necessity* of a bailout within the short time horizon.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability up. The pre-arranged swap line is a "Chekhov's gun." While the positive economic data provides a strong reason for doubt, the political will and existing currency stress suggest the posterior should be revised significantly upward from the base rate, likely landing above 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Sharp, sustained drop in BCRA's net international reserves.
    *   Widening gap between the official peso exchange rate and parallel rates (e.g., "blue-chip swap").
    *   Statements from Argentine or US officials explicitly mentioning the potential activation of the swap line.
    *   Failure of Argentina to roll over significant domestic or international debt.
    *   Social unrest in Argentina due to deteriorating economic conditions.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Stabilization of the peso exchange rate without significant BCRA intervention.
    *   BCRA successfully accumulating foreign reserves.
    *   Argentina securing a major investment or alternative credit line (e.g., from a sovereign wealth fund).
    *   Stronger-than-expected monthly economic activity or inflation data.
    *   US political rhetoric shifting away from supporting Argentina.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires the swap line to be *drawn upon*, not just agreed to. An agreement could be a symbolic deterrent that successfully stabilizes the market without ever being used, which would resolve the question as "No."
*   **Political Volatility:** The US administration's stance is a key driver. A sudden shift in priorities or a political tweet could alter the calculus instantly. Trump's "downplaying" of the bailout is a prime example of this ambiguity.
*   **Data Opacity:** Real-time, accurate data on Argentina's net reserves can be difficult to obtain, making it hard to assess their true proximity to a crisis point.
*   **Scenario Plausibility:** The provided background contains a tension between a recovering economy and a currency crisis. The resolution may depend on which of these conflicting forces dominates in the short term.
*   **Speed of Crisis:** A financial crisis can erupt and necessitate a bailout in a matter of days. The short ~2-month horizon means the situation is highly sensitive to sudden shocks.

**Final Research Summary:** The US has established both the political will and a specific financial mechanism to bail out a key ideological ally. The primary uncertainty is whether Argentina's currency pressures will become severe enough to force them to use this facility before year-end, especially given conflicting signals of an underlying economic recovery.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this event is the "Activation of Fed Swap Lines for Emerging Markets," with a base rate of 15-20%. This is because the US has already announced a $20 billion swap line with Argentina, which aligns with the historical use of swap lines for emerging markets during crises. The base rate reflects the likelihood of such an intervention being activated, given the current economic stress in Argentina.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation in Argentina is similar to past crises where the US has intervened with swap lines, as there is significant currency stress and a pre-existing mechanism (the swap line) is in place.
   - Differences: Unlike typical cases, there is a strong ideological alignment between the US and Argentine governments, which may increase the likelihood of activation. Additionally, the swap line has been announced proactively, rather than reactively during a crisis.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Announcement of the $20 billion swap line: This is strong evidence (↑↑) that the US is prepared to support Argentina, increasing the likelihood of activation.
   - Ideological alignment: The political alignment between Milei and the US administration (↑) increases the probability of support being utilized.
   - Currency intervention by BCRA: The active intervention (↑) indicates stress, making the use of the swap line more likely.
   - Positive economic forecasts: The OECD's positive GDP growth forecast (↓) suggests that a full-blown crisis may not materialize, reducing the immediate need for a bailout.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 0.175 (average of 15-20% base rate) / (1 - 0.175) = 0.212
   - Likelihood ratio: The announcement of the swap line and ideological alignment significantly increase the odds, while positive economic forecasts decrease them. Overall, the net effect is an increase in probability.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.212 × (increased likelihood due to swap line and alignment) = approximately 0.4
   - Posterior probability: 0.4 / (1 + 0.4) = 0.2857 or 28.57%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate the likelihood due to the strong political alignment and pre-announced swap line. However, the positive economic indicators suggest caution.
   - Alternative scenario: Argentina's economy stabilizes without needing to draw on the swap line, especially if alternative funding sources are secured.
   - Adjustments: Given the conflicting signals, a slight downward adjustment from the initial posterior probability is warranted to account for the positive economic outlook.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the final calibrated probability is slightly adjusted to reflect the uncertainty and conflicting signals.

Final: 25%

# Will the United States bailout Argentina before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll select a base rate by examining the most relevant reference classes:

1. **US Direct Bilateral Financial Rescues of Major Economies**: These are rare events where the US directly intervenes to stabilize a major economy outside standard IMF channels. The most notable example is the 1995 Mexico bailout.
   - Base rate: ~5-10%

2. **Fed Swap Line Activations for Emerging Markets**: The Fed maintains swap lines with major central banks and occasionally extends them to emerging markets during crises.
   - Base rate: ~15-20%

3. **Argentine-Specific Sovereign Debt Crises Leading to US Direct Support**: Argentina has a history of economic crises, but almost always with the IMF as the primary interlocutor, not the US directly.
   - Base rate: <5%

Given the specific context of this situation - where a swap line has already been announced but not yet activated - I'll use a weighted combination of these reference classes, with emphasis on the second category. This gives us a prior probability of approximately **20%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Argentina is experiencing currency instability and economic challenges
- The US has geopolitical interests in Latin America's stability
- The situation involves a potential currency/financial crisis requiring external support

**Key differences:**
- The US has already announced a $20 billion swap line, which is a concrete mechanism already in place
- There is unusually strong ideological alignment between the Milei and Trump administrations
- The US appears to be bypassing the traditional IMF-led approach in favor of direct bilateral support
- The swap line was established proactively before a full crisis, unlike most historical cases
- There are mixed economic signals: currency pressure alongside some positive economic indicators

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to the base rate, as the mechanism for support is already established and political will appears present.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Announcement of $20 billion swap line (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US intends to bail out Argentina, establishing a swap line is a necessary first step
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If the US does not intend to bail out Argentina, establishing a swap line would be unusual
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This strongly increases the probability of a bailout

**Evidence 2: Argentina's central bank intervention to defend the peso (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Active currency defense depleting reserves is often a precursor to needing external support
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Central banks often intervene without eventually requiring bailouts
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Trump's statement downplaying "bailout" but promising "help"**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Political framing to make support more palatable domestically
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Could be genuine indication that full bailout is unnecessary
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: OECD forecasting strong GDP growth (5.2%) for Argentina in 2025**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Countries requiring bailouts typically don't have strong growth forecasts
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Strong growth reduces the need for external support
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.43
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Report noting Argentina's fiscal surplus relies on temporary measures**
- P(E|H): High (~0.7) - Suggests underlying fragility that could trigger need for support
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many countries have temporary fiscal measures without requiring bailouts
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), let's update based on the most significant pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (swap line announcement):**
- Prior odds: 0.2/(1-0.2) = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 4.5 = 1.125
- Posterior probability: 1.125/(1+1.125) ≈ 53%

**Update on Evidence 4 (strong GDP growth forecast):**
- Prior odds: 0.53/(1-0.53) = 1.13
- Likelihood ratio: 0.43
- Posterior odds: 1.13 × 0.43 = 0.49
- Posterior probability: 0.49/(1+0.49) ≈ 33%

**Update on Evidence 2 (central bank intervention):**
- Prior odds: 0.33/(1-0.33) = 0.49
- Likelihood ratio: 2
- Posterior odds: 0.49 × 2 = 0.98
- Posterior probability: 0.98/(1+0.98) ≈ 49%

**Update on Evidence 5 (fiscal surplus relying on temporary measures):**
- Prior odds: 0.49/(1-0.49) = 0.96
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.96 × 1.75 = 1.68
- Posterior probability: 1.68/(1+1.68) ≈ 63%

After incorporating these key pieces of evidence, our posterior probability is approximately 63%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of the swap line announcement. Swap lines are often established as precautionary measures and never drawn upon.
- The time horizon is short (only about 2 months until the end of 2025), which significantly reduces the probability of activation.
- I might be underestimating Argentina's ability to stabilize its currency through other means or access alternative funding sources.
- The resolution criteria specifically require the swap line to be drawn upon, not just established.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Argentina's economic situation stabilizes in the short term, removing the immediate need for US support.
- The US administration changes its stance due to domestic political considerations.
- Argentina secures alternative funding from private markets or other international sources.

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would be around 30-35%, emphasizing that while the mechanism exists, the actual activation of the swap line within the short timeframe is less likely given some positive economic indicators and the fact that such facilities are often established as deterrents rather than with the expectation they'll be used.

Considering these points, I should adjust my forecast downward from 63%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability that the United States will bailout Argentina before 2026 is approximately 45%.

The key factors supporting this probability are:
- The established $20 billion swap line mechanism
- Strong ideological alignment between the US and Argentine administrations
- Evidence of active currency intervention by Argentina's central bank
- Signs of underlying economic fragility

The key factors limiting this probability are:
- The short time horizon (only about 2 months remaining in 2025)
- Some positive economic indicators (GDP growth forecast)
- The fact that swap lines are often established as precautionary measures
- The specific requirement that the swap line be drawn upon, not just established

Final: 45%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a direct bilateral bailout of a country by the United States, bypassing multilateral institutions like the IMF. The appropriate reference class is "US bilateral financial rescues of major economies." Historically, these are very rare. The 1995 Mexico "Tequila Crisis" bailout is the most prominent modern example. Over the past 50 years, across dozens of global financial crises, the US has acted directly only a handful of times. The default US policy is to work through the IMF. This suggests a low base rate.
Based on the research report's analysis, a base rate of 5-10% for such an event occurring in a crisis year is appropriate. I will select a prior probability of **10%** (or 1:9 odds), acknowledging that while rare, it is a possibility for a country of Argentina's regional importance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current situation involves a major Latin American economy facing a severe currency crisis, similar to Mexico in 1995. A collapse could have regional geopolitical consequences.

**Differences:**
*   **Unprecedented Ideological Alignment:** The strong political and ideological alignment between Argentina's President Milei and the current US administration (Trump) creates a powerful incentive for the US to ensure the success of a key free-market ally. This is a much stronger political driver than in most historical cases.
*   **Proactive Mechanism:** Crucially, the US has already announced plans for a specific $20 billion swap line. In most historical bailouts, the rescue package is assembled reactively during the peak of the crisis. Here, the tool for the bailout has been prepared in advance, lowering the activation barrier.
*   **Conflicting Economic Signals:** Unlike typical crises that occur during deep recessions, Argentina is experiencing currency pressure against a backdrop of positive GDP growth forecasts. This creates a tension: the crisis may be one of confidence rather than fundamentals, which could mean a bailout isn't strictly necessary, or it could make the US more willing to provide a "bridge" to protect a promising recovery.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence and its impact on the probability.

*   **Evidence 1: US announces plans for a $20 billion swap line.** This is extremely strong evidence. A bailout via a swap line cannot happen unless the line is first established. While it could be a bluff to deter markets, creating such a specific public facility is a very credible signal of intent. This evidence **strongly increases** the probability. (Likelihood Ratio >> 1).
*   **Evidence 2: Argentina's central bank is actively intervening to defend the peso.** This confirms that the crisis is not hypothetical. The country is actively burning through its foreign reserves to prevent a currency collapse. This increases the likelihood that external support will be needed soon. This evidence **increases** the probability. (LR > 1).
*   **Evidence 3: Positive economic forecasts (e.g., OECD forecasting 5.2% GDP growth).** This is the strongest piece of counter-evidence. A country with strong underlying growth is less likely to need an emergency bailout. It suggests the economy might be able to stabilize on its own, making a drawdown on the swap line unnecessary. This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability. (LR < 1).
*   **Evidence 4: Strong Milei-Trump political alignment.** This provides the "why" for the US's unusual bilateral approach. It makes the US politically invested in Milei's success, increasing the chance they will follow through with tangible support. This evidence **increases** the probability. (LR > 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I start with my prior of 10% (1:9 odds).

1.  The announcement of the $20B swap line is a "Chekhov's gun." It's a powerful signal that dramatically changes the landscape. I estimate this increases the odds by at least a factor of 3, moving the probability from 10% to roughly 25% (odds of 1:3).
2.  The evidence of active currency intervention and strong political alignment further pushes the probability up. This confirms the need is current and the political will is present. This might double the odds again, moving the probability to the 40-50% range (odds approaching 1:1).
3.  However, the positive economic data acts as a strong brake. If the economy is fundamentally recovering, the crisis may pass without needing to activate the swap line. This evidence pulls the probability back down. I estimate this counter-evidence roughly halves the odds, bringing my estimate back down from ~50% to the ~30-40% range.

Synthesizing these updates, the powerful political drivers and the pre-arranged mechanism are in a direct tug-of-war with the positive economic data that questions the ultimate necessity of a bailout. The final probability should reflect this significant tension.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong primarily due to the "sufficient deterrent" scenario. The resolution criteria require Argentina to *draw upon* the swap line. It is very plausible that the public announcement of the $20 billion facility is enough to restore market confidence, stabilizing the peso without any funds ever being disbursed. In this case, both the US and Argentina would claim success, and the question would resolve as "No." This is the most significant argument for a lower probability.

Conversely, I might be underestimating the fragility of Argentina's economy. The "temporary measures" supporting the fiscal surplus could unravel quickly, and a crisis of confidence can become self-fulfilling regardless of GDP forecasts. Given the short timeframe (until the end of 2025), a rapid deterioration is possible. This is the primary risk pushing the probability higher.

My final forecast remains below 50% to properly weight the high plausibility of the "sufficient deterrent" scenario, which is a common outcome for such credit line announcements.

### Final Forecast
The situation presents a conflict between a very high *willingness* from the US to provide a bailout (due to political alignment and the pre-announced swap line) and an uncertain *necessity* for Argentina to use it (due to positive economic data). The short timeframe means a crisis would have to escalate quickly. Balancing the powerful arguments on both sides, I assess the probability as being just under even odds.

Final: 45%
