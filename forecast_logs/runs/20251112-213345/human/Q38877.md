### Reference class & base rates
*   **Spanish Post-Franco Legislatures (1979-Present):** Of the 15 legislatures in Spain's modern democratic history, 9 have ended with early (snap) elections, resulting in a base rate of **~60%**. This suggests that completing a full four-year term is the exception, not the rule. However, this base rate doesn't account for *when* in the term the election is called.
*   **Minority Governments in Spain:** Pedro Sánchez currently leads a minority coalition government. Historically, minority governments in Spain are significantly less stable. Of the 8 minority governments since 1979, 7 called early elections (**~88%**). This is a more relevant, but smaller, reference class, indicating a very high intrinsic probability of an early election at some point during the term.
*   **Legislatures Facing Major Crises in Year 2-3:** Governments are often most vulnerable after the initial "honeymoon" period and before the final pre-election year. The current government, formed in late 2023, is entering this window. The primary trigger for early elections is often the inability to pass a national budget. This occurred in 2019, prompting Sánchez to call a snap election. The probability of an early election conditional on failing to pass a budget is very high (>90%).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** Budget negotiations with Catalan separatist party Junts officially stall over demands for greater fiscal autonomy and timelines for a self-determination referendum. **↑** — The budget is the primary legislative test of the government's viability; failure here is a direct path to new elections.
*   **2025-10-22** A high court judge admits a new corruption case filed by an opposition-linked group against Sánchez's brother, expanding the judicial pressure on the PM's family. **↑** — Increases the "lawfare" narrative, weakens Sánchez's political standing, and provides the opposition with more ammunition, potentially making him consider an election to reset the narrative.
*   **2025-10-15** Polling averages show Sánchez's PSOE and the opposition PP are in a technical tie, with neither party having a clear path to a majority, even with allies. **↓** — A snap election would be a high-risk gamble with no guarantee of a better outcome, incentivizing Sánchez to negotiate and endure rather than roll the dice.
*   **2025-09-30** The government successfully passes a minor, but symbolic, housing decree with the support of all its coalition and parliamentary partners. **↓** — Demonstrates that despite tensions, the governing coalition can still function on specific issues, suggesting a total collapse is not yet inevitable.
*   **2025-09-04** In a televised interview, Sánchez states his firm intention to "exhaust the legislature" and complete his full term, dismissing election rumors as opposition wishful thinking. **↓** — While political statements are cheap, it signals his current strategy is to resist pressure and project stability, lowering the immediate odds of a voluntary election call.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Failure to Pass the 2026 Budget:** This is the most powerful driver. Without a budget, a government cannot effectively govern. Rejection by parliamentary allies (especially Junts or ERC) would almost certainly trigger a snap election. (Impact: **Large**)
*   **Coalition Collapse:** The governing coalition is a fragile alliance of left-wing parties and regional nationalists/separatists with conflicting agendas. If a key partner like Junts formally withdraws its support, Sánchez would lose his majority and be forced into an election. (Impact: **Large**)
*   **Escalation of Judicial Investigations:** A formal indictment of Sánchez's wife or brother, or evidence directly implicating the Prime Minister, could make his position politically untenable, forcing a resignation and subsequent election. (Impact: **Moderate to Large**)
*   **Sánchez's Strategic Calculation:** Sánchez is a known political risk-taker. If he perceives a favorable shift in polls or believes an election could rally his base and grant him a stronger mandate, he might call one opportunistically. (Impact: **Moderate**)
*   **Public Pressure and Protests:** Sustained, large-scale public protests over corruption scandals or unpopular policies (like the amnesty for Catalan separatists) could erode the government's legitimacy and pressure Sánchez into seeking a new mandate. (Impact: **Small to Moderate**)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Coalition Fragility:** Unlike past minority governments, Sánchez relies on the explicit, issue-by-issue support of rival Catalan separatist parties (Junts and ERC), whose primary long-term goal is independence from Spain, creating inherent instability.
*   **Intense "Lawfare":** The degree of sustained, high-profile judicial investigation aimed at the Prime Minister's direct family is a defining feature of this term, creating a constant political crisis atmosphere not seen in most previous legislatures.
*   **Extreme Political Polarization:** The chasm between the left and right blocs is exceptionally wide, eliminating any possibility of cross-aisle support (e.g., from the PP) to pass key legislation like a budget. This makes Sánchez entirely dependent on his fractious allies.
*   **The Protagonist's Character:** Pedro Sánchez has a well-established reputation as a political survivor and gambler who has used snap elections to his advantage before (e.g., 2019, 2023). His personal agency and willingness to take risks are higher than that of a typical Prime Minister.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10-15%, n=10) for an election in the next ~45 days. Despite the high base rate for the full term, government inertia is strong, and calling an election is a momentous step.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The 2026 budget negotiations are the critical variable. Current reports of them stalling with key partner Junts dramatically increase the probability.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The steady drumbeat of judicial investigations creates a corrosive environment that weakens the government's ability to negotiate and makes a political "reset" more appealing.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Current polling offers no clear advantage to Sánchez, suggesting a snap election would be a pure gamble for survival rather than a strategic move to gain power.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Sánchez's public commitment to finishing his term, while expected, provides a slight counterweight, indicating his Plan A is to hold on.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision. The acute risk of budget failure is the dominant factor and should significantly raise the posterior probability from the low initial prior. The update should be substantial.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official statements from Junts or ERC declaring the budget negotiation "broken."
    *   The scheduling of a formal indictment or court appearance for Sánchez's wife or brother.
    *   Sánchez beginning a series of high-profile media appearances or rallies with an "electoral" tone.
    *   The opposition PP formally tabling a motion of no-confidence.
    *   PSOE-commissioned polls being leaked to the media.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A preliminary budget agreement announced between PSOE and its key partners (Junts, ERC).
    *   Judicial cases against Sánchez's family being shelved or delayed by prosecutors.
    *   The government and its allies successfully passing another piece of significant legislation.
    *   Key separatist leaders focusing their rhetoric on regional, rather than national, issues.
    *   Economic indicators (e.g., inflation, unemployment) showing marked improvement.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Sánchez's Unpredictability:** The Prime Minister's decisions often defy conventional political wisdom. His personal calculus is the largest source of uncertainty and could lead to a sudden, unexpected decision.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The true state of negotiations between PSOE and its partners is opaque. Public statements are often posturing, and the real deals are made behind closed doors.
*   **Definition of "Called":** The resolution requires an official call. Political turmoil can persist for weeks before this formal step is taken. An election could become inevitable in December 2025 but not be officially called until January 2026, which would resolve this question as "No."
*   **External Shocks:** An unforeseen international crisis or domestic event could rapidly alter the political landscape and either force or delay an election call, overriding the current drivers.

**Final Research Summary:** Pedro Sánchez's government is inherently unstable and faces an acute crisis over the 2026 budget. While he is a resilient leader who benefits from a lack of a clear electoral alternative, the high probability of his key legislative pillar failing makes a snap election before 2026 a significant and growing risk.

To forecast the probability of Pedro Sánchez calling for general elections before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for early elections in Spain's post-Franco history is approximately 60%, as 9 out of 15 legislatures have ended with snap elections. However, given that Sánchez leads a minority government, a more relevant base rate is 88%, as 7 out of 8 minority governments have called early elections. This base rate reflects the inherent instability of minority governments in Spain.
   - Initial prior: 88% probability of early elections based on the minority government reference class.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Sánchez's government is a minority coalition, similar to past unstable governments that have called early elections.
   - Differences: The current situation is marked by intense judicial pressure and coalition fragility, which are more pronounced than in some past cases. However, Sánchez's strategic behavior and the current polling landscape introduce unique elements that could influence the decision to call elections.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Budget Negotiations Stalling (↑):** The failure to pass the 2026 budget is a significant risk factor. If the budget cannot be passed, the likelihood of early elections increases substantially. Likelihood ratio: High.
   - **Judicial Investigations (↑):** Ongoing investigations against Sánchez's family increase political pressure, making early elections more likely as a reset strategy. Likelihood ratio: Moderate.
   - **Polling Ties (↓):** Current polling does not favor Sánchez, making early elections a risky gamble. Likelihood ratio: Low.
   - **Sánchez's Public Statements (↓):** His stated intention to complete the term suggests a lower probability of calling early elections. Likelihood ratio: Low.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 88% probability translates to odds of 7.33:1.
   - Considering the evidence, the stalling budget negotiations and judicial pressures increase the likelihood of early elections, while polling ties and Sánchez's statements decrease it.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × (Likelihood ratio for budget stalling) × (Likelihood ratio for judicial investigations) / (Likelihood ratio for polling ties) / (Likelihood ratio for public statements).
   - Given the dominant impact of budget negotiations, the posterior probability remains high, though slightly adjusted for countervailing evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The high base rate might lead to overestimating the probability without considering Sánchez's strategic behavior and the lack of a clear electoral advantage.
   - Alternative scenario: Sánchez manages to negotiate a budget deal or judicial cases lose momentum, reducing the need for early elections.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of Sánchez's resilience and strategic maneuvering, which could delay elections despite current pressures.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the probability of Pedro Sánchez calling for general elections before 2026 is adjusted to reflect both the high base rate and the nuanced evidence.
   - Final: 75%

# Will Pedro Sánchez call for general elections before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant historical patterns in Spanish politics.

The most appropriate reference class is minority governments in Spain's modern democratic era (post-Franco). According to the research report, of the 8 minority governments since 1979, 7 called early elections, giving a base rate of approximately 88%.

However, we need to consider the time constraint - this question asks specifically about elections being called before January 1, 2026, which is about 14 months from now (November 2025). The current government was formed in late 2023, so we're asking about early elections within roughly the first 2-3 years of a 4-year term.

Given these considerations, I'll start with a prior of 70% - slightly lower than the 88% base rate for minority governments calling early elections at any point in their term, but still high given the inherent instability of such governments.

**Prior probability: 70%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Sánchez leads a minority government that depends on support from multiple parties
- The government faces the typical challenge of passing a budget, which is historically the main trigger for early elections
- Political polarization makes cross-aisle support unlikely, increasing dependency on fragile coalition partners

**Differences from base case:**
- **More fragile coalition**: Sánchez relies on support from Catalan separatist parties (Junts and ERC) whose primary goal is independence from Spain, creating even greater instability than typical minority governments
- **Judicial pressure**: The corruption investigations involving Sánchez's wife, brother, and former collaborators create additional pressure not present in most previous cases
- **Sánchez's track record**: He has a history of calling snap elections strategically (2019, 2023), showing more willingness than average to take this political risk

These differences generally suggest a higher probability than the base rate, as the current situation appears more precarious than the typical minority government.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Budget negotiations with Junts stalling (November 5, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If early elections are going to be called, budget failure would be the most likely trigger
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If the government completes its term, it would almost certainly need to pass this budget
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This strongly increases the probability of early elections

**Evidence 2: New corruption case against Sánchez's brother (October 22, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderately high (~0.7) - Corruption scandals often precede early elections
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even stable governments face investigations, though perhaps not as serious
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: PSOE and PP in technical tie in polls (October 15, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Elections might be called regardless of polling
- P(E|~H): Moderately high (~0.7) - Unfavorable polls make completing the term more attractive
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.71
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Government passes housing decree with coalition support (September 30, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Minor legislative victories don't preclude early elections
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Functional coalitions are necessary to complete a term
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Sánchez's public commitment to complete his term (September 4, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Politicians often make such statements regardless of intentions
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Completing the term would align with this statement
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67
- This slightly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 70% (odds of 7:3), I'll update based on the most significant piece of evidence: the stalled budget negotiations.

Prior odds = 7:3 = 2.33
Likelihood ratio for budget negotiations = 4.5
Posterior odds = 2.33 × 4.5 = 10.49

Converting back to probability:
Posterior probability = 10.49/(1+10.49) = 0.913 or about 91%

Now, considering the combined effect of the other evidence:
- Corruption case: LR = 1.75 (increases)
- Polling tie: LR = 0.71 (decreases)
- Housing decree passage: LR = 0.63 (decreases)
- Public commitment: LR = 0.67 (decreases)

Combined LR = 1.75 × 0.71 × 0.63 × 0.67 ≈ 0.52

Updating again:
New posterior odds = 10.49 × 0.52 = 5.45
New posterior probability = 5.45/(1+5.45) = 0.845 or about 85%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the importance of the budget negotiations. While budget failures often trigger elections, skilled politicians can sometimes find workarounds.
- I might be underestimating Sánchez's resilience. He has survived political crises before that would have ended other governments.
- The judicial investigations might resolve favorably or fade from public attention.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Sánchez could negotiate a limited budget agreement with enough support to continue governing.
- External events (economic improvement, international crisis) could change the political calculus.
- The opposition might prefer to let Sánchez govern through scandals rather than risk an election that doesn't clearly favor them.

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be around 60% probability, based on the argument that Sánchez has strong incentives to avoid elections given the polling tie and would exhaust all options to maintain power. The budget negotiations, while stalled, could still be salvaged through concessions to Junts or by finding alternative parliamentary support.

However, this alternative view underestimates the severity of the current budget crisis and the historical precedent of minority governments failing to complete their terms, especially when facing multiple simultaneous challenges.

Considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for Sánchez's proven political survival skills and the possibility of unexpected developments.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for minority governments calling early elections, the specific challenges facing Sánchez's government (stalled budget negotiations, corruption investigations, fragile coalition), and accounting for his political resilience, I arrive at a final probability of 82%.

Final: 82%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks whether a general election will be called in a specific, short timeframe: before January 1, 2026, which is approximately 49 days from the forecast date of November 12, 2025.

A broad base rate for an early election during a full 4-year term for a Spanish minority government is very high (~88%). However, this needs to be adjusted for the short timeframe. A 4-year term is 48 months. Naively distributing this probability would suggest a low chance for any given 1.5-month period.

However, political crises are not uniformly distributed. They cluster around key events, and the negotiation of the annual state budget is the most significant recurring flashpoint. The current period is precisely such a high-risk window. Therefore, a simple time-averaged base rate is inappropriate.

A more suitable prior is one that acknowledges both the strong inertia of government and the heightened risk of the current political moment. A government does not lightly call an election. Let's establish a prior of **15%**. This reflects a situation that is significantly more volatile than a random day in the legislative calendar but still recognizes that calling an election is a momentous step and not the default outcome.

Prior Odds: 15% probability corresponds to 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176, or about 1-to-5.6 odds against an election call.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors the classic failure mode for Spanish minority governments: an inability to pass a budget due to a lack of parliamentary support. This is precisely what led Sánchez himself to call a snap election in 2019.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Increased Fragility (Pro-Election):** Sánchez's government is uniquely dependent on rival Catalan separatist parties (Junts and ERC). Their demands, particularly on fiscal autonomy and self-determination, are fundamentally difficult for a Spanish Prime Minister to meet, making a budget deal exceptionally challenging.
    *   **Intense Judicial Pressure (Pro-Election):** The ongoing corruption investigations into Sánchez's family create a constant political storm. This weakens his negotiating position and might tempt him to call an election to "reset" the political narrative and seek a new mandate directly from the people.
    *   **Sánchez's Character (Pro-Election):** Sánchez has a proven track record as a political risk-taker who has used snap elections to his advantage in the past (2019, 2023). He is not a leader who will passively wait for his government to collapse.
    *   **Unfavorable Polling (Anti-Election):** The polls show a technical tie between the left and right blocs. There is no guarantee that an election would produce a better or more stable outcome for Sánchez. This is a powerful incentive to negotiate, make concessions, and hold on to power rather than roll the dice.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most crucial piece of recent evidence is the **stalling of budget negotiations with Junts (Nov 5)**. This is the central mechanism that could trigger an election.

*   **Likelihood Ratio of Stalled Negotiations:**
    *   P(E | H): If an election is called before 2026 (H), it is highly probable that it would be preceded by a public and serious breakdown in budget talks. This is the most direct causal path. P(E | H) is high.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no election is called (~H), it's because a deal was eventually reached. However, public "stalls" are common negotiating tactics. The key is whether this stall is tactical or terminal. Given the fundamental disagreements, a terminal stall is plausible even if no election is ultimately called (e.g., the crisis drags into January).
    *   Net Effect: The official stalling of talks over core, difficult issues is a strong signal that the primary trigger for an election is active. This evidence significantly **increases** the probability.

The second key piece of evidence is the **tied polling data (Oct 15)**.

*   **Likelihood Ratio of Tied Polls:**
    *   P(E | H): A leader might be forced to call an election even with bad polls if the alternative is a non-functional government. This would be an act of desperation, not strategy.
    *   P(E | ~H): A leader facing tied polls has a very strong reason to avoid an election and try to improve their standing. This is the default, rational action.
    *   Net Effect: This evidence provides a strong incentive against calling an election and significantly **decreases** the probability, acting as a powerful counterweight to the budget crisis.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Instead of a step-by-step update, a causal model is more appropriate here, focusing on the main driver: the budget.

P(Election) = P(Election | Budget Fails) * P(Budget Fails) + P(Election | Budget Passes) * P(Budget Passes)

1.  **P(Election | Budget Fails):** If Sánchez cannot pass the 2026 budget, his government becomes a lame duck. The probability of him calling an election under this condition is very high. The research report suggests >90%. Let's use **85%**, allowing a small chance he tries to limp on with a rolled-over budget or the crisis timeline slips into January.
2.  **P(Election | Budget Passes):** If he secures a budget, his government is stabilized for another year. The chance of him calling an election then is extremely low. Let's set this at **2%**.
3.  **P(Budget Fails):** This is the core uncertainty. Given the stalled talks, the deep ideological divides with Junts, and the high-stakes nature of their demands, the probability of a terminal breakdown of negotiations is substantial. I estimate the probability of the budget failing before the end of the year at **35%**.
4.  **P(Budget Passes):** This is simply 1 - 0.35 = **65%**.

**Calculation:**
P(Election) = (0.85 * 0.35) + (0.02 * 0.65)
P(Election) = 0.2975 + 0.013
P(Election) ≈ 0.31 or **31%**.

This posterior probability is a significant update from the 15% prior, driven almost entirely by the acute risk of budget failure.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 31% hinges heavily on the subjective estimate that there is a 35% chance of budget negotiations failing before year-end. Could this be wrong?

*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (>31%):** I might be underestimating Sánchez's willingness to gamble. He might see the "lawfare" and budget crisis as a perfect opportunity to frame an election as "the people vs. the elites" and believe he can win against the odds, as he did in 2023. The fragility of the coalition could be even worse than it appears publicly.
*   **Argument for a Lower Probability (<31%):** I might be underestimating the power of mutual self-interest. All of Sánchez's partners, including Junts, want to avoid a right-wing government led by PP and Vox. This shared fear is the ultimate glue holding the coalition together. It has led to last-minute deals before and is the most powerful force pushing for a compromise, even a messy one. The most likely scenario remains a tense, down-to-the-wire negotiation that ultimately results in a deal. Furthermore, the resolution deadline is sharp (Jan 1, 2026). A crisis could easily mature in late December, but the official call for elections might be announced in the first week of January, resolving this question as "No".

Considering these factors, the 31% estimate seems balanced. It correctly identifies a high-risk situation but stops short of making an early election the most likely outcome. The incentives to strike a deal, combined with the possibility of timeline slippage, are strong enough to keep the probability below 50%.

### 6. Final Forecast
The final forecast reflects the significant risk posed by the 2026 budget negotiations, which represent an existential test for the fragile minority government. This risk is substantially mitigated by unfavorable polling and the strong incentive for all governing partners to avoid an election that could bring the right-wing to power. The final probability is a balance of these powerful opposing forces.

Final: 31%
