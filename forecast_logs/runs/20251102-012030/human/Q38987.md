### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Presidential Reversal of Predecessor's Executive Orders (EOs):** When a new president from an opposing party takes office, they frequently review and rescind the EOs of their predecessor. During his first term, Donald Trump was particularly aggressive in this, signing numerous EOs in his first weeks to reverse Obama-era policies. The survival rate for a specific, non-codified, and ideologically opposed EO is low.
    *   **Base Rate:** 20-30% chance the specific requirements remain. This is derived from the high frequency of EO reversals, particularly by Trump, for policies not aligned with his platform.
2.  **Survival of Tech Regulations Under Deregulatory Administrations:** Administrations focused on economic growth and reducing business burdens often target regulations, especially in fast-moving sectors like technology, viewing them as impediments to innovation and competitiveness.
    *   **Base Rate:** 25-35% chance the requirements remain. The default assumption is that regulations perceived as burdensome will be weakened or removed unless there is a compelling, overriding interest (e.g., immediate national security threat, strong bipartisan/industry support).
3.  **Implementation of Campaign Promises:** Candidates often make specific promises to appeal to their base. Donald Trump has a track record of attempting to follow through on his key promises, especially those involving deregulation and reversing his predecessor's actions.
    *   **Base Rate:** 70-80% chance of *action* being taken to fulfill the promise (i.e., to cancel the EO). This translates to a 20-30% chance the requirements remain untouched.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-18** New national AI strategy, "Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan," released, prioritizing growth and competitiveness over strict oversight. — ↓ — The new plan's explicit focus is contrary to the risk-mitigation spirit of EO 14110, signaling a fundamental policy shift away from such requirements.
*   **2025-08-08** President Trump signs three EOs to accelerate data centers, promote AI exports, and address ideological bias in AI. — ↓ — These actions align with the new "AI Action Plan" and focus on promotion and deregulation, not on the safety-oriented reporting required by the Biden EO.
*   **2025-07-28** Analysis of the "AI Action Plan" confirms its focus on reducing regulatory barriers to enhance U.S. leadership in the global AI market. — ↓ — Reinforces that the administration's primary goal is removing, not maintaining, rules like the foundation model reporting requirements.
*   **2025-07-25** Trump administration releases "America's AI Action Plan" and EOs, emphasizing deregulation to achieve global AI dominance. — ↓ — This is the central event. The announcement of a new, comprehensive plan directly supersedes the previous administration's approach, making the old rules obsolete.
*   **2024-11-14** Post-election analysis from Brookings anticipates a second Trump administration will repeal Biden's October 2023 AI Executive Order. — ↓ — Establishes that the expectation of repeal was high immediately following the election, setting the stage for the subsequent policy actions in 2025.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Deregulatory Ideology:** President Trump's core political and economic philosophy prioritizes reducing government regulation to spur business and innovation. This is a powerful driver for repealing rules seen as burdensome. (Size: Large ↓)
2.  **Geopolitical Competition with China:** The framing of AI development as a "race" against China creates a strong incentive to remove any perceived hindrances to the speed of American companies. Safety reporting can be portrayed as such a hindrance. (Size: Large ↓)
3.  **Ease of Reversal:** Executive Orders can be undone by a subsequent EO with relative ease, as they do not require congressional approval. This makes them fragile instruments of policy across administrations. (Size: Large ↓)
4.  **Industry Influence:** Major AI labs and tech companies, while publicly supporting "responsible AI," generally lobby against prescriptive compliance regimes that could slow development or increase costs. They would likely favor the new, less restrictive "Action Plan." (Size: Moderate ↓)
5.  **National Security Establishment Concerns:** The intelligence and defense communities have a vested interest in understanding and monitoring the development of potentially dangerous dual-use technologies. They could exert internal pressure to retain some form of reporting, even if the public-facing policy is deregulatory. (Size: Moderate ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Campaign Promise:** Unlike many EOs that are reversed as part of a general policy shift, Trump made a specific, public promise to "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one," making reversal a matter of political credibility.
*   **Nascent Policy Area:** AI regulation is a new and highly fluid field. There is no entrenched bureaucracy or long-standing legislative framework supporting these requirements, making them easier to discard than rules in more established domains.
*   **Dual-Edged National Security Argument:** While national security is often a reason for *more* regulation (base case), in the context of a "race" with China, it is being used as a powerful argument for *less* regulation to ensure US companies "win."
*   **Lack of Codification:** The requirements stem solely from an EO. Congress has not passed legislation (like the EU's AI Act) that would codify these rules, leaving them entirely vulnerable to executive discretion. The new administration's plan explicitly prefers a uniform *federal* standard, but one of its own making, not its predecessor's.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior of ~25% YES, based on the reference class of ideologically-opposed EOs surviving a change in administration, especially under Trump. Strength is moderate (n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Trump's explicit 2023 campaign promise to cancel the EO.
    *   (↓ Large) The rollout of a comprehensive and oppositional "AI Action Plan" in July 2025, signaling a full replacement of the prior regime.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The new EOs signed in July/August 2025 focus exclusively on promotion and deregulation, omitting any mention of safety reporting.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Consistent messaging from all (hypothetical) sources that the administration's policy is centered on "reducing regulatory hurdles."
    *   (↑ Small) The possibility that national security agencies have retained some non-public reporting mechanism, though this is not the public-facing regulation in question.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly and consistently negative. The posterior should move sharply down from the prior, landing at a very low probability.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (requirements more likely to remain):**
    *   A major, publicly acknowledged AI-related national security incident or near-miss.
    *   Statements from the Secretary of Commerce or Defense suggesting some reporting requirements are being retained for national security purposes.
    *   Prominent AI companies unexpectedly call for the government to maintain these specific reporting standards for liability or stability reasons.
    *   Leaked information about ongoing compliance with the specific terms of the now-defunct EO 14110.
*   **DOWN indicators (requirements less likely to remain):**
    *   The White House issues a formal, public rescission of EO 14110 by name.
    *   The Department of Commerce issues new, superseding regulations based on the "AI Action Plan" that contain no mention of the specific reporting criteria.
    *   President Trump or senior officials publicly mock the "burdensome" Biden-era AI rules.
    *   The NIST guidance on red-teaming (developed under the Biden EO) is officially withdrawn or replaced.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution criteria are highly specific (notification, model weights, red-teaming). A new Trump policy could implement a *different*, less burdensome reporting requirement (e.g., only for models used in critical infrastructure) which would not satisfy the criteria and cause a "No" resolution. The question is not "will *any* regulation exist?"
*   **"Rebrand and Retain":** The administration could revoke EO 14110 but direct the Commerce or Defense departments to implement functionally identical requirements under a new name and justification (e.g., "AI Dominance Insight Program"). This is a key risk for a "No" forecast.
*   **Bureaucratic Inertia:** The actual process of unwinding regulations can be slow. It's possible the old rules technically remain on the books at the end of 2025, even if the administration's clear intent is to remove them, simply due to administrative delays.
*   **Information Gaps:** The provided sources describe the new high-level policy. They do not detail the specific regulatory text that has been repealed or replaced. The exact status of the rules implementing Section 4.2 of EO 14110 is not explicitly stated, though strongly implied.

### Final Research Summary
The combination of an explicit campaign promise, a strong deregulatory ideology, and the framing of AI as a geopolitical race has led the Trump administration to replace Biden's safety-focused EO with a new "AI Action Plan." This makes it exceptionally unlikely that the specific, burdensome reporting requirements from the original order will remain in place.

To forecast the probability that AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place in the US at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The survival rate for executive orders (EOs) from a previous administration, especially those ideologically opposed, is low when a new president from the opposing party takes office. Historically, Trump has been aggressive in reversing Obama-era policies. The base rate for such EOs remaining in place is approximately 20-30%.
- **Rationale:** This base rate is chosen based on historical frequencies of EO reversals, particularly under Trump, and the nature of the EO being ideologically opposed to Trump's deregulatory stance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation is similar to past instances where Trump reversed EOs from the previous administration, especially those not aligned with his platform.
- **Differences:** The explicit campaign promise to cancel the EO and the introduction of a new "AI Action Plan" that focuses on deregulation and competitiveness rather than safety and reporting requirements.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Campaign Promise:** Trump explicitly promised to cancel Biden's AI EO, which strongly suggests action will be taken to fulfill this promise. This evidence significantly decreases the probability of the requirements remaining.
- **New AI Action Plan:** The introduction of a comprehensive plan that emphasizes deregulation and competitiveness further decreases the likelihood of the reporting requirements remaining.
- **Executive Orders Signed:** Recent EOs signed by Trump focus on promoting AI and deregulation, not on maintaining safety-oriented reporting requirements.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Each piece of evidence (campaign promise, new AI plan, recent EOs) has a likelihood ratio that strongly favors the hypothesis that the requirements will not remain.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Let's assume a prior probability of 25% (odds of 1:3).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence against the requirements remaining, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards the requirements not remaining.
- **Posterior Odds:** The posterior odds are significantly lower than the prior odds due to the overwhelming evidence.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is calculated to be very low, reflecting the strong evidence against the requirements remaining.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of bureaucratic inertia or a rebranding of the requirements under a different guise, which could technically satisfy the resolution criteria.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major national security incident could prompt a retention of some form of reporting requirements.
- **Adjustments:** While these considerations are noted, the overall probability remains low due to the strong deregulatory signals.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability that the AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place is very low.

Final: 5%

# Forecasting: Will AI foundation model reporting requirements remain in place under Trump?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use a base rate focused on the survival of executive orders (EOs) when a new president from the opposing party takes office, particularly when the new president has explicitly promised to cancel the specific EO.

**Base rate: 15%** chance that the AI foundation model reporting requirements remain in place.

This prior is derived from:
- Historical patterns of incoming presidents reversing predecessor EOs, especially when ideologically opposed
- Trump's specific track record of aggressively reversing Obama-era EOs during his first term
- The explicit campaign promise Trump made to cancel this specific EO
- The lack of legislative codification of these requirements (they exist solely through executive action)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a pure executive order without legislative backing
- The incoming president is from the opposing party
- The policy area (AI regulation) aligns with typical deregulatory priorities of Republican administrations
- The requirements impose compliance costs on businesses, making them a natural target for a deregulation-focused administration

**Key differences:**
- Trump made an unusually explicit campaign promise specifically targeting this EO, saying he would "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one"
- AI is a strategically important and rapidly evolving technology area with national security implications
- The research shows Trump has already implemented a replacement "AI Action Plan" with a fundamentally different approach
- The evidence indicates not just modification but wholesale replacement of the regulatory approach

These differences significantly strengthen the case that the requirements will not remain.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit campaign promise to cancel the EO**
- P(E|H): ~0.2 (If requirements remain, there's a ~20% chance Trump would have made this explicit promise)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (If requirements will be canceled, there's a ~90% chance Trump would have made this promise)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 2: Release of "America's AI Action Plan" in July 2025**
- P(E|H): ~0.1 (If requirements remain, there's a ~10% chance of releasing a completely new plan)
- P(E|~H): ~0.95 (If requirements will be canceled, there's a ~95% chance of releasing a replacement plan)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Three new EOs signed in August 2025 focusing on deregulation**
- P(E|H): ~0.15 (If requirements remain, there's a ~15% chance of these specific EOs)
- P(E|~H): ~0.9 (If requirements are canceled, there's a ~90% chance of these EOs)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.17
- This evidence significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Consistent messaging about reducing regulatory hurdles**
- P(E|H): ~0.3 (If requirements remain, there's a ~30% chance of this messaging)
- P(E|~H): ~0.95 (If requirements are canceled, there's a ~95% chance of this messaging)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.32
- This evidence moderately decreases probability

**Evidence 5: National security establishment concerns**
- P(E|H): ~0.8 (If requirements remain, there's an ~80% chance of national security concerns)
- P(E|~H): ~0.5 (If requirements are canceled, there's a ~50% chance of these concerns)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- This evidence slightly increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15:85 (0.15/(1-0.15) = 0.176)

First update (campaign promise):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.22 = 0.039
- Posterior probability = 0.039/(1+0.039) ≈ 3.8%

Second update (AI Action Plan):
- Posterior odds = 0.039 × 0.11 = 0.0043
- Posterior probability = 0.0043/(1+0.0043) ≈ 0.43%

Third update (Three new EOs):
- Posterior odds = 0.0043 × 0.17 = 0.00073
- Posterior probability = 0.00073/(1+0.00073) ≈ 0.07%

Fourth update (Deregulatory messaging):
- Posterior odds = 0.00073 × 0.32 = 0.00023
- Posterior probability = 0.00023/(1+0.00023) ≈ 0.02%

Fifth update (National security concerns):
- Posterior odds = 0.00023 × 1.6 = 0.00037
- Posterior probability = 0.00037/(1+0.00037) ≈ 0.04%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence that the requirements have been replaced.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating bureaucratic inertia - even if the policy intent is clear, the actual regulatory machinery might not have fully implemented the changes by December 2025
- The research doesn't explicitly state "EO 14110 has been formally rescinded" - it's possible some technical aspects remain in force
- National security agencies might have preserved some reporting requirements through classified channels
- The new "AI Action Plan" might have retained some elements of the original reporting requirements under new branding

**Alternative forecast:**
A more moderate forecast might argue for 5-10% probability, reasoning that while the policy direction is clear, the specific implementation details of the new regime aren't fully described in the research. Some reporting requirements might have been preserved for national security reasons or due to administrative delays in fully unwinding the previous system.

**Rebuttal:**
The evidence strongly indicates a wholesale replacement of the approach, not just modifications. The specific requirements in question (notification, model weights, red-teaming) are precisely the kind of "regulatory burden" the new administration would target. The multiple sources consistently describe a fundamental shift in approach, making it extremely unlikely the specific requirements remain intact.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe there is a very low probability that the specific AI foundation model reporting requirements from EO 14110 remain in place by the end of 2025.

The evidence shows that the Trump administration has:
1. Explicitly promised to cancel the EO
2. Released a comprehensive replacement plan with a different philosophy
3. Signed multiple new EOs focused on deregulation and competitiveness
4. Consistently messaged about reducing regulatory barriers

While I acknowledge some uncertainty about implementation details, the overwhelming evidence points to these specific requirements being removed.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is the survival of a specific set of regulations, established by an Executive Order (EO), after a change in presidential administration to the opposing party. A suitable reference class is the survival rate of EOs from a prior administration when a new president, particularly one with a strong deregulatory agenda like Donald Trump, takes office.

*   **Reference Class:** Executive Orders from a Democratic president facing a new Republican administration.
*   **Historical Frequency:** Presidents frequently and easily reverse the EOs of their predecessors, especially when there is a clear ideological divide. Donald Trump was particularly aggressive in reversing Obama-era EOs in his first term. The default expectation should be that a non-codified, ideologically opposed policy will be reversed.
*   **Base Rate (P(H)):** A generous base rate for the survival of such an EO would be around 25%. This implies a 75% chance of reversal or significant modification. In odds, this is 1:3 in favor of the requirements *not* remaining.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The policy was enacted via an Executive Order, making it procedurally easy to reverse with another EO.
*   The policy reflects a more cautious, regulatory approach generally favored by the Democratic party, which is in opposition to the Republican party's typical preference for less regulation to spur innovation and economic growth.

**Differences:**
*   **Explicit Campaign Promise:** Unlike a generic policy reversal, Donald Trump made a specific, public promise on December 2, 2023, to "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one." This elevates the issue from a routine policy review to a matter of fulfilling a direct promise to his base, making reversal much more likely than the base case.
*   **Nascent and Contested Policy Area:** AI regulation is a new field with no long-standing bipartisan consensus or entrenched bureaucracy to defend the existing rules. This makes the policy particularly vulnerable.
*   **Competing National Security Narrative:** While the EO is justified on national security grounds (preventing misuse of AI), a competing narrative of geopolitical competition with China is being used to argue *for* deregulation to "unleash" American companies. The research report indicates the Trump administration has fully adopted this "race to win" framework.

These differences all suggest the probability of the requirements remaining in place is significantly *lower* than the 25% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The research report provides a hypothetical but detailed timeline of events in 2025 under a Trump presidency. This timeline serves as strong evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Trump's explicit campaign promise to cancel the EO.**
    *   P(Promise | Requirements Remain): Very low. It's unlikely a candidate would make such a specific promise and then fail to act on it.
    *   P(Promise | Requirements Are Removed): Very high. This is a clear statement of intent.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors "No" (requirements removed). This evidence significantly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The (hypothetical) release of "America's AI Action Plan" in July 2025, emphasizing deregulation and global dominance.**
    *   P(New Deregulatory Plan | Requirements Remain): Extremely low. A new plan with an opposing philosophy would almost certainly supersede the old rules.
    *   P(New Deregulatory Plan | Requirements Are Removed): Extremely high. This is the mechanism by which the old rules would be replaced.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors "No." This is the most powerful piece of evidence.

*   **Evidence 3: (Hypothetical) new EOs in August 2025 focus on AI promotion (data centers, exports) and omit safety reporting.**
    *   P(Promotional EOs | Requirements Remain): Low. If the old requirements were to be kept, one would expect them to be reaffirmed or integrated, not ignored.
    *   P(Promotional EOs | Requirements Are Removed): High. This action is consistent with a policy shift away from safety-oriented regulation towards promotion.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors "No."

*   **Counter-Evidence (Potential): Pressure from the National Security Establishment.**
    *   The intelligence and defense communities have a strong interest in monitoring powerful AI development. They could exert internal pressure to keep some reporting requirements.
    *   P(Internal Pressure | Requirements Remain): High. This would be the primary reason for the requirements to survive.
    *   P(Internal Pressure | Requirements Are Removed): Moderate. The pressure exists, but it may be overruled by the President's political and economic agenda, or satisfied through other, non-public channels.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors "Yes." This is the main factor preventing the probability from dropping to near zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 25% (Odds = 1:3).
2.  **Update with Trump's Promise:** This is strong evidence. Let's use a likelihood ratio of 1/10. The posterior odds become (1/3) * (1/10) = 1/30. The new probability is approximately 3%.
3.  **Update with the "AI Action Plan":** This is dispositive evidence that the old policy framework has been replaced. The likelihood ratio is extremely small, perhaps 1/20. The final odds become (1/30) * (1/20) = 1/600. This corresponds to a probability of ~0.2%.

The formal update suggests a near-zero probability. However, we must account for real-world complexities not captured in this simple model.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis points to an extremely low probability. What is the best argument for the requirements remaining?

1.  **"Rebrand and Retain":** This is the most plausible scenario for a "Yes" resolution. The administration could publicly cancel Biden's EO 14110 to score political points, but then, under pressure from the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies, issue a new order or regulation that contains the *exact same three reporting requirements* under a new name like the "AI Dominance Insight Program." The core policy would remain, satisfying the resolution criteria.
2.  **Bureaucratic Inertia:** The process of formally rescinding the implementing regulations from the Department of Commerce could be delayed. It's possible that on Dec 31, 2025, the old rules are technically still on the books, even if the administration's clear intent is to remove them.
3.  **Black Swan Event:** A major AI-related national security catastrophe in 2025 could cause a rapid political reversal, making the administration embrace the existing safety framework to appear strong and responsive.

The "Rebrand and Retain" scenario is the most significant risk to a low forecast. However, the resolution criteria are very specific, requiring *all three* components (notification, model weights, red-teaming) to remain. A new administration would likely want to alter the rules to put its own stamp on them (e.g., by removing the model weight reporting, which is sensitive for companies). Therefore, an exact replication is less likely.

Considering these risks, a probability of near-zero is overconfident. The "Rebrand and Retain" scenario, driven by the non-partisan security establishment, warrants assigning a small but non-trivial probability to the "Yes" outcome.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for an ideologically opposed EO surviving a Trump administration is low (~25%). The evidence, including a specific campaign promise and a detailed (hypothetical) replacement plan focused on deregulation, is overwhelmingly strong and points toward the removal of these requirements. The causal mechanisms—deregulatory ideology, ease of reversal, and the "race against China" narrative—all support this conclusion. The primary counterargument is that the national security apparatus could force the administration to retain the exact same rules under a different name. While plausible, the specificity of the required rules makes a verbatim copy unlikely. Therefore, the probability is very low, but not zero.

Final: 5%
