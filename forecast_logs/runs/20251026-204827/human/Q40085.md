### Reference class & base rates
1.  **UNFCCC COP Host Selections (within a designated regional group):** In most cycles, a single candidate emerges from the regional group and is approved without issue. Contested bids are uncommon. When they do occur, the bid with broader diplomatic backing typically prevails after negotiations. A failure to reach consensus, triggering the default to Bonn, is extremely rare.
    *   **Base Rate (Consensus on a bidder):** ~95%
    *   **Base Rate (Default to Bonn):** ~5%
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from the historical pattern of COP hosting. The system is designed to produce a host, and there are strong diplomatic incentives to avoid the "failure" of defaulting to the secretariat's location.
2.  **Contested Bids for International Summits/Organizations:** In cases where consensus or a supermajority is required (e.g., WTO leadership, UN Security Council seats), standoffs are more common. These are often resolved through "horse-trading," where one candidate withdraws in exchange for support on another issue or a future position. The candidate with the most powerful backers usually wins, but holdouts can extract significant concessions.
    *   **Base Rate (Favored candidate wins):** ~70%
    *   **Base Rate (Challenger/compromise candidate wins):** ~25%
    *   **Base Rate (Process breaks down/deadlocks):** ~5%
    *   **Reasoning:** This class acknowledges the political nature of the decision. The consensus rule elevates the power of a single objector far beyond a simple vote.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-18** Australia announces a new 2035 emissions reduction target of 62-70%. — **↑ Australia** — Strengthens its climate credentials, directly addressing a key vulnerability of its bid (its status as a major fossil fuel exporter).
*   **2025-09-08** Australian government website reaffirms its active pursuit of the bid with Pacific nations. — **↑ Australia** — Shows sustained high-level political commitment and continued partnership with the Pacific, a core part of its narrative.
*   **2025-04-17** ASPI Strategist article emphasizes the need for genuine partnership with Pacific nations for the bid to be successful. — **↔ Neutral** — Highlights execution risk and potential friction but does not report a new event; reinforces the complexity of the co-host model.
*   **2024-11-23** Climate campaigners accuse Australia of "lip service" over its bid. — **↓ Australia** — Reinforces the primary criticism against Australia, providing ammunition for any WEOG members hesitant to offer support.
*   **2024-11-20** Multiple sources (Guardian, Arab News) report a "standoff" between Australia and Turkey. — **↓ Australia, ↑ Turkey/Germany** — This is the crucial event establishing the current state. It confirms Turkey is a serious blocker, not a token candidate, and makes the default-to-Germany option a non-trivial possibility.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Consensus Rule (Large):** The single most important mechanism. The requirement for consensus within the 28-member WEOG gives Turkey effective veto power. This transforms the decision from a majority vote into a high-stakes negotiation.
2.  **Major Power Endorsements (Large):** Australia has secured public support from key WEOG heavyweights (US, UK, France, Germany). This creates significant diplomatic pressure on Turkey to concede, but does not override the consensus rule.
3.  **Geopolitical Leverage (Moderate):** Turkey may be using its bid as a bargaining chip for unrelated diplomatic goals with the EU or other WEOG members. The decision to concede may have little to do with the merits of its climate bid.
4.  **Narrative and Thematic Strength (Moderate):** Australia's "Pacific-focused" bid is thematically powerful and aligns with the UNFCCC's focus on climate-vulnerable nations. This makes it an attractive and symbolically important choice, increasing the reputational cost for Turkey to block it.
5.  **Host Country Climate Policy (Small-Moderate):** While important for legitimacy, this is secondary to the political mechanics. Australia's improved 2035 target helps its case and blunts criticism, but its fossil fuel exports remain a point of contention.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Persistent Public Standoff:** Unlike typical, quiet regional negotiations, this contest has been a publicly reported "standoff" for nearly a year. This suggests the disagreement is not minor and standard diplomatic pressure has so far been insufficient.
*   **Co-Host Model:** The Australia-Pacific partnership is logistically and diplomatically more complex than a single-country host. While a narrative strength, it also introduces more potential points of failure.
*   **WEOG Heterogeneity:** The Western European and Others Group is uniquely diverse, comprising the EU bloc, the Anglosphere (including the US), Israel, and Turkey. This lack of cohesion makes consensus more difficult to achieve than in more unified regional groups.
*   **Significance of COP31:** Occurring in 2026, this COP will be a critical stocktaking moment following the 2025 submission of new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The stakes for the host's agenda-setting power are particularly high.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of contested international bids, a reasonable prior would place Australia as the clear but not certain favorite. E.g., Australia 65%, Turkey 15%, Germany 15%, Other/Another Pacific Nation 5%. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** Public backing for Australia from the most influential WEOG members (US, UK, France, Germany).
    *   **↓ Large:** The consensus rule, which gives Turkey a veto and has created a persistent, year-long standoff.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** Australia's recently strengthened 2035 climate target, which improves its credibility.
    *   **↓ Moderate:** The lack of any public signs of Turkey backing down, suggesting their opposition is firm or they are holding out for a significant concession.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The strong diplomatic support for Australia is almost perfectly counteracted by the power of the consensus rule and Turkey's persistence. The posterior for Australia should remain the most likely outcome, but with lower confidence than the public endorsements would suggest. The probability for Germany (default due to deadlock) should be considered significant and likely higher than the base rate suggests.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Any statement from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs softening its stance or withdrawing its bid.
    *   A joint statement from Australia and Turkey announcing a cooperative agreement.
    *   Reports of a high-level diplomatic meeting between Australian and Turkish leaders.
    *   More WEOG members (e.g., Canada, Spain, Italy) publicly endorsing the Australian bid.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Statements from UNFCCC officials about contingency planning for a Bonn-based COP 31.
    *   Turkey announcing it has secured support from any other WEOG member for its bid.
    *   Reports that negotiations have reached a "deadlock" ahead of the COP 30 deadline.
    *   Any major Pacific Island nation publicly criticizing or withdrawing support from Australia's bid.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Negotiations:** The decisive negotiations are happening behind closed doors. Public statements may be posturing, and the true state of play is likely hidden.
*   **Geopolitical Linkage:** The outcome could be determined by factors entirely unrelated to climate policy, such as developments in EU-Turkey relations, making it difficult to forecast based on climate-related inputs alone.
*   **Risk of a "Surprise" Deal:** A deal could emerge where Turkey withdraws its COP 31 bid in exchange for WEOG support for a future Turkish bid (e.g., for COP 36) or another international position.
*   **Definition of "Host":** The question resolves on the *country*. Australia's bid is with "Pacific island nations." While Adelaide is the proposed city, a surprise co-location is a remote possibility, but resolution would still be "Australia" as the primary partner state.

### Final Research Summary
Australia is the strong favorite to host COP 31, backed by key Western powers and a compelling "co-host with the Pacific" narrative. However, the UN's consensus-based process gives Turkey a veto, creating a persistent standoff that makes the outcome highly dependent on backroom diplomatic negotiations, with a small but significant chance the deadlock forces a default to Bonn, Germany.

To forecast which country will host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP 31) in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given Australia's strong diplomatic backing and thematic alignment with the UNFCCC's focus, a reasonable prior is 65%.
- **Turkey**: As the only other official bidder, Turkey's prior is 15%.
- **Germany**: As the default host in case of deadlock, Germany's prior is 15%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is unlikely given the current bids, so a prior of 3% is reasonable.
- **Other**: This is very unlikely, so a prior of 2% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: Similar to past cases where a strong candidate with broad support wins. Different due to the public standoff and co-host model.
- **Turkey**: Similar to cases where a challenger uses geopolitical leverage. Different due to the lack of broad support.
- **Germany**: Similar to rare cases of deadlock. Different due to the high stakes and diplomatic efforts to avoid default.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation/Other**: Unlikely given the current bids and historical patterns.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: Strong backing from major WEOG members increases likelihood (P(E | H) high). The standoff and criticism decrease it (P(E | ~H) moderate).
- **Turkey**: The standoff and Turkey's persistence increase likelihood (P(E | H) moderate). Lack of broad support decreases it (P(E | ~H) high).
- **Germany**: The standoff increases likelihood (P(E | H) moderate). Diplomatic efforts to avoid default decrease it (P(E | ~H) high).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 65/35. Likelihood ratio = (high/moderate). Posterior odds increase slightly, but not significantly due to conflicting evidence.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 15/85. Likelihood ratio = (moderate/high). Posterior odds decrease slightly.
- **Germany**: Prior odds = 15/85. Likelihood ratio = (moderate/high). Posterior odds increase slightly.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Australia's strong backing could be overestimated if Turkey's geopolitical leverage is underestimated.
- **Tail Risks**: A surprise deal or geopolitical shift could change the dynamics.
- **Alternative Forecast**: Germany could host if deadlock persists, but diplomatic efforts make this less likely.

### 6. Final Normalization

Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 60%  
Turkey: 10%  
Germany: 25%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%  
Other: 2%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and the likelihood of each scenario, considering the complex diplomatic landscape and historical patterns.

# Forecasting COP 31 Host Country

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on the reference class of contested bids for international summits requiring consensus:

- **Australia**: 65% - As the apparent frontrunner with significant diplomatic backing
- **Turkey**: 20% - As the only other official bidder with veto power through consensus rules
- **Germany**: 10% - As the default option if consensus fails (Bonn hosts UNFCCC secretariat)
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: 3% - Low probability that a Pacific nation takes primary host role
- **Other**: 2% - Very low chance of an unexpected outcome

These priors reflect that Australia is the favored candidate but Turkey's opposition creates a meaningful chance of either Turkey succeeding or a default to Germany.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This follows the standard UNFCCC regional rotation system
- The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is due to host
- There are two competing bids requiring consensus resolution

**Key differences:**
- Australia's bid involves a co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations, adding complexity
- There's an unusually public and persistent "standoff" reported between Australia and Turkey
- The consensus requirement within WEOG gives Turkey effective veto power
- COP 31 has heightened importance as it follows new NDC submissions in 2025

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring Australia:**
- Strong backing from major WEOG powers (US, UK, France, Germany)
  - P(E|Australia wins) = 0.9, P(E|Australia doesn't win) = 0.3
- Recently announced stronger 2035 emissions target (62-70%)
  - P(E|Australia wins) = 0.7, P(E|Australia doesn't win) = 0.5
- Thematically powerful "Pacific-focused" bid aligning with UNFCCC priorities
  - P(E|Australia wins) = 0.8, P(E|Australia doesn't win) = 0.4

**Evidence favoring Turkey:**
- Persistent year-long standoff without resolution
  - P(E|Turkey wins or blocks) = 0.8, P(E|Turkey concedes) = 0.3
- Consensus rule giving Turkey effective veto power
  - P(E|Turkey blocks) = 0.9, P(E|Turkey doesn't block) = 0.2

**Evidence favoring Germany:**
- Reported "standoff" increasing chance of no consensus
  - P(E|Germany hosts) = 0.7, P(E|Germany doesn't host) = 0.3
- Bonn's status as UNFCCC headquarters making it a ready default
  - P(E|Germany hosts) = 1.0, P(E|Germany doesn't host) = 0.0

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the key evidence of the persistent standoff:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 65%
- Likelihood ratio: P(standoff|Australia wins)/P(standoff|Australia doesn't win) = 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
- Prior odds: 65/35 = 1.86
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 0.5 = 0.93
- Posterior probability: 0.93/(1+0.93) ≈ 48%

For Turkey:
- Prior probability: 20%
- Likelihood ratio: P(standoff|Turkey wins)/P(standoff|Turkey doesn't win) = 0.8/0.4 = 2
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2 = 0.5
- Posterior probability: 0.5/(1+0.5) ≈ 33%

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 10%
- Likelihood ratio: P(standoff|Germany hosts)/P(standoff|Germany doesn't host) = 0.7/0.4 = 1.75
- Prior odds: 10/90 = 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 1.75 = 0.19
- Posterior probability: 0.19/(1+0.19) ≈ 16%

Now updating on Australia's strengthened climate target:
- For Australia: 48% → 52%
- For Turkey: 33% → 30%
- For Germany: 16% → 15%
- Others remain relatively unchanged

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the importance of public diplomatic backing versus behind-the-scenes negotiations
- The co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations introduces execution risks not fully accounted for
- Turkey's motivations may be linked to unrelated geopolitical issues (EU relations, etc.)
- The timeline until decision (before COP 30 in late 2025) allows for significant diplomatic developments

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could be using its bid as leverage for concessions on other issues, with no intention of hosting
- A compromise could emerge where Turkey withdraws in exchange for hosting a future COP
- Australia's fossil fuel exports could become a more significant liability despite its improved targets

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reducing Australia's probability to account for execution risks
- Slightly increasing Germany's probability given the persistence of the standoff
- Maintaining Turkey as a serious contender given its veto power

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:
- Australia: 50%
- Turkey: 30%
- Germany: 15%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
- Other: 2%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 50%
Turkey: 30%
Germany: 15%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 2%
(sum 100%)

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of "Host selections for UN COPs within a designated regional group."

*   **Option A: A single candidate is agreed upon by consensus.** Historically, this is the most common outcome. A regional group either has a single bidder from the start or quickly coalesces around one candidate after brief negotiations. I estimate this happens in ~90% of cases.
*   **Option B: A persistent deadlock forces a default.** The rules allow for the conference to be held in Bonn, Germany, if the regional group cannot reach consensus. This is a "failure state" that all parties are diplomatically motivated to avoid. It is rare. I estimate this base rate at ~5%.
*   **Option C: A challenger candidate wins after a contest.** In the rare cases of a contested bid, it's possible for the initial frontrunner to be outmaneuvered. This is less common than the frontrunner eventually winning. I estimate this at ~5%.

The current situation involves two declared candidates, Australia and Turkey. Australia, with its "co-host with the Pacific" narrative and backing from major WEOG powers (US, UK, France, Germany), can be considered the initial frontrunner. Turkey is the challenger.

Therefore, a simple prior based on this reference class would be:
*   **Australia (frontrunner wins):** ~90% (combining the easy consensus case with the likely outcome of a contested case)
*   **Turkey (challenger wins):** ~5%
*   **Germany (default):** ~5%
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation / Other:** ~0% (not part of the standard process)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This specific case differs from the base rate scenario in several crucial ways that alter the probabilities:

*   **Similarity:** Like most COP selections, there is strong diplomatic pressure to find a host and avoid the embarrassment of defaulting to Bonn.
*   **Difference 1 (Consensus Rule + Persistent Standoff):** The most significant difference is the *consensus rule* combined with a publicly acknowledged, year-long "standoff." In a simple majority vote, Australia would win easily. But consensus gives Turkey effective veto power. The fact that this veto has been exercised for so long indicates that this is not a typical, easily resolved negotiation. This dramatically increases the probability of a deadlock (Germany) compared to the base rate.
*   **Difference 2 (WEOG Heterogeneity):** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is unusually diverse, including the EU, the Anglosphere, Israel, and Turkey. This lack of a cohesive bloc makes consensus harder to achieve than in other, more unified regional groups, further increasing the chance of deadlock.
*   **Difference 3 (Geopolitical Leverage):** Turkey's motivation may be unrelated to its climate bid's merits. It could be using its veto as a bargaining chip for concessions from the EU or other WEOG members on unrelated geopolitical issues. This makes its position potentially more rigid than a typical challenger's.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the initial priors.

*   **Evidence (E1): Public backing for Australia from the US, UK, France, and Germany.**
    *   P(E1 | Australia hosts): High. You would expect the eventual host to have secured the backing of the group's most powerful members.
    *   P(E1 | Turkey hosts): Very Low. It is highly improbable that Turkey would win the bid against the public opposition of all these major powers.
    *   P(E1 | Germany hosts): Medium. This evidence is consistent with a scenario where the major powers apply immense pressure on Turkey, which Turkey resists, leading to a deadlock.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strongly increases the probability of Australia and strongly decreases the probability of Turkey.

*   **Evidence (E2): The standoff has been public and persistent for nearly a year.**
    *   P(E2 | Australia hosts): Medium-Low. If Australia were a guaranteed winner, a deal would likely have been struck behind the scenes much earlier. A long public standoff suggests Australia's path is blocked.
    *   P(E2 | Turkey hosts): Medium. A persistent standoff is a necessary condition for a challenger with a weak hand to exert leverage, but it doesn't guarantee a win.
    *   P(E2 | Germany hosts): High. A persistent, unresolvable disagreement is the direct cause of a default to Bonn. This evidence is most indicative of this outcome.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence significantly decreases the probability of Australia and significantly increases the probability of Germany.

*   **Evidence (E3): Australia's strengthened 2035 emissions target.**
    *   P(E3 | Australia hosts): High. This is a proactive move to counter the main criticism against its bid (being a fossil fuel exporter), making it a more palatable choice for all WEOG members.
    *   P(E3 | ~Australia hosts): Low. While possible for domestic reasons, such a specific and timely announcement is most likely driven by the high-stakes bid.
    *   **Impact:** This moderately increases the probability of Australia, as it strengthens its diplomatic hand and makes it harder for Turkey to justify its opposition on climate grounds.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with the prior odds: Australia (90%) vs. Not-Australia (10%), giving prior odds of 9:1.

The most crucial piece of evidence is the **persistent standoff (E2)**. This evidence is much more likely if the outcome is a deadlock (Germany) or a challenger win (Turkey) than if the frontrunner (Australia) wins easily. This evidence strongly contradicts the "easy consensus" base rate. The likelihood ratio P(E2 | ~Australia hosts) / P(E2 | Australia hosts) is significantly greater than 1. Let's estimate it's around 5 (i.e., a year-long standoff is 5 times more likely given that Australia does *not* end up hosting).

*   **Prior Odds (Australia hosts):** 9
*   **Likelihood Ratio (from E2):** 1/5 = 0.2
*   **Posterior Odds (after E2):** 9 * 0.2 = 1.8
*   **New P(Australia):** 1.8 / (1 + 1.8) = 1.8 / 2.8 ≈ 64%

This single update dramatically lowers Australia's probability from 90% to ~64% and increases the combined probability of Turkey and Germany from 10% to ~36%.

Now, let's consider the **strong diplomatic backing for Australia (E1)**. This makes Turkey winning directly very unlikely. Most of the ~36% probability for "Not-Australia" should therefore be assigned to Germany (deadlock). The improved climate target (E3) further strengthens Australia's hand, making a deal more likely and a deadlock slightly less so.

Therefore, I will distribute the 36% for "Not-Australia" primarily to Germany, with a smaller portion to Turkey.

*   **Australia:** Remains the most likely, as it has the diplomatic weight on its side to eventually force a deal. The probability is reduced due to the standoff.
*   **Germany:** The probability is massively increased from the base rate. The standoff is the primary evidence for this outcome.
*   **Turkey:** Their chance of actually hosting is low against such unified opposition. Their leverage is in blocking, not winning.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis hinges on the assumption that diplomatic pressure from major powers will eventually lead Turkey to concede, likely in exchange for an unrelated concession. What if this is wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** Turkey's domestic political situation or its geopolitical goals might make it completely unwilling to back down, regardless of pressure. The diplomatic cost of blocking might be seen as acceptable. In this scenario, the probability of a deadlock (Germany) is much higher than I've estimated, perhaps as high as 40-50%.
*   **Blind Spot:** I might be underestimating the possibility of a "compromise" where Turkey withdraws its COP 31 bid in exchange for WEOG's guaranteed support for a future Turkish bid (e.g., COP 36). This would still resolve as "Australia" for COP 31, but it highlights that Turkey's goal may not be to host in 2026 at all.
*   **"Another Pacific Island Nation":** The bid is explicitly "Australia in partnership with Pacific island nations." For this option to resolve, the official host country would need to be, for example, Fiji, with Australia as a secondary partner. This would require a fundamental restructuring of the bid and is extremely unlikely.
*   **"Other":** A compromise candidate (e.g., Canada, Switzerland) could be put forward to break the deadlock. This is a remote possibility but cannot be entirely ruled out if the standoff becomes truly toxic.

Considering these points, I will maintain Australia as the favorite but keep the probability for Germany substantial to account for the very real risk of a failed negotiation. Turkey's chances of actually hosting remain low.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the updating and red team thinking, I will set the final probabilities.

*   **Australia:** The most likely outcome. They have the backing and the narrative. The standoff lowers their probability but doesn't eliminate their favorite status. I place this at 60%.
*   **Turkey:** Unlikely to win against unified opposition from WEOG's major powers. Their power is in the veto, not in their own bid's strength. I place this at 12%.
*   **Germany:** The default option. The persistent standoff is strong evidence that this is a non-trivial possibility. This is the second most likely outcome. I place this at 25%.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** Extremely unlikely as it would require a complete change in the existing bid's structure. I place this at 1%.
*   **Other:** A surprise compromise candidate is a tail risk. I place this at 2%.

The sum is 60 + 12 + 25 + 1 + 2 = 100%.

### Output Format

Australia: 60%
