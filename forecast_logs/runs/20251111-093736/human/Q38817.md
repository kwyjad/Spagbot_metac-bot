### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Annual Global COVID-19 Deaths (2020-2024):** This is the most direct reference class, showing the trajectory of the pandemic. The trend is sharply downward since the 2021 peak.
    *   **2020:** ~1.9 million
    *   **2021:** ~3.5 million (Peak)
    *   **2022:** ~1.2 million
    *   **2023:** ~220,000
    *   **2024 (provisional):** ~85,000
    *   **Reasoning:** This class establishes a strong downward trend as population immunity increases and the virus becomes endemic. The 2024 figure serves as the most recent full-year base rate, suggesting a starting point below 100,000.
    *   **Limitations:** The rate of decline is non-linear. Early years are not representative of the current state of viral evolution and population immunity. Reporting standards have also changed significantly.

2.  **Annual Global Influenza Deaths (Estimated):** This class provides an "endemic respiratory virus" benchmark.
    *   **Base Rate:** 290,000 to 650,000 estimated deaths annually (WHO).
    *   **Reasoning:** This represents a potential long-term floor for a widespread, evolving respiratory virus. It helps contextualize the scale of COVID-19 mortality as it transitions away from the acute pandemic phase.
    *   **Limitations:** This is an *estimate* of total burden, not *reported* deaths, which are far lower and not systematically compiled globally. COVID-19 reporting, even in its reduced state, is likely more comprehensive than historical influenza reporting, making direct comparison difficult. SARS-CoV-2 may also have a different intrinsic severity and evolutionary pattern.

3.  **2025 Year-to-Date (YTD) Data Extrapolated:** This is the most powerful reference class as it uses current-year data.
    *   **Base Rate:** As of November 10, 2025 (314 days into the year), reported global deaths stand at approximately 46,000. A simple linear extrapolation (46,000 / 314 * 365) yields a base rate of **~53,500**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most specific and timely data available. It reflects the current reality of circulating variants, population immunity, and reporting systems.
    *   **Limitations:** It does not account for seasonality (i.e., a potential Northern Hemisphere winter wave in the final 51 days) which could cause the final number to be higher than a simple linear extrapolation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-20** Reports from public health agencies (e.g., ECDC, CDC) confirm a new Omicron subvariant, HZ.1, is gaining dominance in Europe and North America. — ↑ — HZ.1 shows increased immune escape, potentially fueling a winter wave and increasing deaths among vulnerable populations.
*   **2025-09-15** Major high-income countries (US, UK, Japan) roll out updated annual COVID-19 booster shots targeting recent variants. — ↓ — Boosters, even with modest uptake, will reduce severe outcomes and deaths in high-risk groups ahead of the winter season.
*   **2025-08-01** WHO publishes a bulletin highlighting the continued decline in global genomic sequencing and case reporting, urging countries to maintain surveillance. — ↓ (on reported number) — Worsening surveillance and testing infrastructure means fewer deaths are being officially attributed to COVID-19, artificially suppressing the final reported count.
*   **2025-06-30** End of the Southern Hemisphere winter shows a moderate but not severe COVID-19 wave, primarily driven by existing variants. — ↓ — Provides a template for the Northern Hemisphere winter, suggesting the health system impact will be manageable and mortality will not return to prior-year levels.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Viral Evolution:** The emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility or immune evasion remains the primary driver for future waves. A variant with intrinsically higher severity is a low-probability, high-impact risk. (Size: Large)
2.  **Population Immunity:** The global "immunity wall" from vaccination and repeated infections is high, generally suppressing severe disease. However, this immunity wanes over time, particularly against new variants, creating openings for new waves. (Size: Large)
3.  **Seasonality:** Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits seasonality, with transmission increasing during the winter months in temperate regions due to behavioral factors (more time indoors). This will likely cause an increase in deaths in Nov-Dec 2025. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Reporting and Surveillance Infrastructure:** The official count is a direct product of testing and reporting policies. As countries de-prioritize COVID-19 surveillance, the number of officially recorded deaths will decline, regardless of the true burden. (Size: Moderate-Large, on the final number)
5.  **Uptake of Mitigations:** The effectiveness and uptake of annual booster vaccines, particularly among the elderly and clinically vulnerable, will directly impact mortality rates during seasonal waves. (Size: Small-Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **vs. Peak Pandemic (2020-22):** The key difference is extremely high, albeit heterogeneous, population-level immunity. The virus is no longer novel, and treatments are well-established, drastically reducing the infection fatality rate.
*   **vs. 2024:** Reporting and surveillance systems have degraded further. COVID-19 is now managed as one of several endemic respiratory viruses, not a public health emergency, leading to less systematic data collection.
*   **vs. 2024:** The specific variant landscape is different (e.g., emergence of HZ.1). While not dramatically more severe, its specific immune escape properties will shape the size of the winter 2025-26 wave differently than the prior year.
*   **vs. Influenza:** SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve more rapidly than seasonal influenza, leading to more distinct and less predictable waves of infection. Global surveillance for COVID-19, though diminished, likely remains superior to that for influenza.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be centered on the 2024 total (~85,000 deaths), but with low confidence (low "equivalent n") given the strong downward trend.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The YTD data through Nov 10 (~46,000) provides extremely strong evidence that the 2025 total will be substantially lower than 2024. This is the anchor.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The combination of seasonality (Northern Hemisphere winter) and the emergence of the HZ.1 variant suggests the daily death rate in the final 51 days will be higher than the year's average.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Continued degradation of reporting infrastructure means that even with a winter wave, the *reported* death count will be suppressed compared to what would have been recorded with the same viral activity in previous years.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift dramatically downward from the 2024 prior, anchoring heavily on the YTD extrapolation (~53.5k). A moderate upward adjustment for seasonality is warranted, but this is tempered by the counter-effect of poor reporting. The final distribution should be centered in the 55,000-65,000 range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Weekly hospitalization rates for COVID-19 in the US, UK, and Germany rising faster than expected through November.
    *   Wastewater surveillance data showing an accelerating prevalence of the HZ.1 variant.
    *   Reports from national health agencies of significant strain on hospital capacity specifically attributed to COVID-19.
    *   WHO issuing a specific warning or statement about the HZ.1 variant's severity.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Daily global death counts on OWID remaining flat or declining through late November, defying seasonal expectations.
    *   High uptake rates for the new annual booster shots in vulnerable populations.
    *   Emerging clinical data suggesting HZ.1 does not cause more severe disease than previous Omicron subvariants.
    *   Major countries (e.g., India, Brazil) reporting very low and stable death numbers.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting Lags:** Deaths occurring in late December 2025 may not be reported by countries and aggregated by WHO/OWID until January or February 2026. The resolution criteria's handling of these lags is a key uncertainty.
*   **Data Dumps/Revisions:** Countries may retroactively revise their data, adding or removing large numbers of deaths in a single update, which could skew the final number.
*   **Definition of a COVID-19 Death:** There is significant global heterogeneity in how a COVID-19 death is defined and certified ("from" vs. "with" COVID), and this has likely become less standardized over time.
*   **Systemic Collapse of Reporting:** The largest

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the base rate, I will use the 2025 Year-to-Date (YTD) Data Extrapolated, which estimates approximately 53,500 deaths for the year based on current data. This is the most specific and timely data available, reflecting the current reality of circulating variants, population immunity, and reporting systems. The variance is expected to be low given the strong evidence from YTD data.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the downward trend in COVID-19 deaths and the high level of population immunity. However, differences include the emergence of the HZ.1 variant and the potential for a winter wave, which could increase deaths. Additionally, reporting infrastructure has degraded, potentially suppressing the reported numbers.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **YTD Data (↓ Large):** Strong evidence that deaths will be lower than in 2024.
   - **Seasonality and HZ.1 Variant (↑ Moderate):** Suggests a potential increase in deaths during the winter months.
   - **Degraded Reporting (↓ Moderate):** Likely to suppress the reported death count.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 53,500 deaths, the evidence from seasonality and the HZ.1 variant suggests a moderate upward adjustment. However, this is countered by the degraded reporting infrastructure. The posterior distribution is thus centered around 60,000 deaths, with a slightly increased variance to account for the potential winter wave.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes the possibility of a more severe winter wave than expected or significant underreporting. An alternative forecast might center around 70,000 deaths if the winter wave is more severe or if reporting improves unexpectedly. However, given the strong downward trend and current data, the original forecast remains plausible.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the following percentiles are provided:

P10: 50,000  
P20: 55,000  
P40: 58,000  
P60: 62,000  
P80: 65,000  
P90: 70,000

# Forecasting Global COVID-19 Deaths in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary Base Rate: 2024 COVID-19 Deaths**
- 2024 reported approximately 85,000 global COVID-19 deaths
- This is the most recent full year and represents the continuing downward trend
- Mean: 85,000 deaths
- Uncertainty: Moderate (continuing the established downward trend from previous years)

**Secondary Base Rate: 2025 Year-to-Date Data**
- As of November 10, 2025 (314 days), approximately 46,000 deaths reported
- Simple extrapolation: (46,000/314) × 365 = ~53,500 deaths for full year
- This is the most current data point and highly relevant

**Tertiary Reference: Annual Decline Pattern**
- 2021: ~3.5 million
- 2022: ~1.2 million (66% decrease)
- 2023: ~220,000 (82% decrease)
- 2024: ~85,000 (61% decrease)
- Projected 2025 based on trend: ~33,000-40,000 (55-60% decrease)

I'll use a prior centered around 55,000 deaths, which balances the YTD extrapolation with the historical decline pattern.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Case:**
- COVID-19 has become endemic rather than pandemic
- High global population immunity exists from vaccination and prior infections
- Similar reporting infrastructure and surveillance systems to 2024
- Similar treatment protocols and healthcare capacity

**Key Differences:**
- The emergence of the HZ.1 variant in October 2025 suggests potential for increased transmission
- Further degradation of global surveillance and reporting systems compared to 2024
- Updated booster shots targeting recent variants were rolled out in September 2025
- We're currently approaching winter in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically sees seasonal increases

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence Supporting Higher Deaths:**
- HZ.1 variant emergence (October 2025) with increased immune escape properties
  - Likelihood ratio: ~1.2× higher deaths than base extrapolation
  - This variant could drive a more significant winter wave than anticipated

- Seasonality effect for remaining 51 days of 2025
  - Likelihood ratio: ~1.15× higher deaths than linear extrapolation
  - Northern Hemisphere winter typically sees increased respiratory virus transmission

**Evidence Supporting Lower Deaths:**
- Updated booster rollout in major countries (September 2025)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.9× lower deaths than base extrapolation
  - Even with modest uptake, boosters should reduce severe outcomes in vulnerable populations

- Continued decline in reporting infrastructure (August 2025 WHO bulletin)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.85× lower reported deaths than actual deaths
  - Fewer deaths being officially attributed to COVID-19 due to reduced testing

- Southern Hemisphere winter experience (June 2025)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.95× lower deaths than expected
  - Moderate but not severe COVID-19 wave suggests Northern Hemisphere may follow similar pattern

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 55,000 deaths, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First Update: HZ.1 Variant + Seasonality**
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~1.2 × 1.15 = ~1.38
- This shifts the expected value upward: 55,000 × 1.38 = ~76,000

**Second Update: Boosters + Reporting Decline + Southern Hemisphere Experience**
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~0.9 × 0.85 × 0.95 = ~0.73
- This shifts the expected value downward: 76,000 × 0.73 = ~55,500

The posterior distribution is now centered around 55,500 deaths, with increased uncertainty due to competing factors. The distribution is slightly right-skewed due to the potential for a more severe winter wave driven by HZ.1.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the HZ.1 variant if it proves more transmissible or severe than current data suggests
- The extrapolation from YTD data assumes relatively stable reporting, which may not hold
- I haven't fully accounted for potential data dumps or retroactive adjustments that often occur

**Tail Risks:**
- High: A significant winter wave combined with holiday travel could accelerate transmission beyond expectations
- Low: Continued degradation of testing and reporting could artificially suppress the final count below actual deaths

**Alternative Forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 70,000-75,000 deaths, giving more weight to the HZ.1 variant and seasonality effects. This would assume:
1. The winter wave is more substantial than the Southern Hemisphere experience
2. Reporting systems capture more deaths than I've estimated
3. Booster effectiveness is lower than expected

**Rebuttal to Alternative:**
The YTD data through November 10 (46,000 deaths) is a strong anchor. Even with a significant winter wave, reaching 70,000+ would require the daily death rate to more than double for the remaining 51 days, which seems unlikely given the moderate severity observed so far.

Based on this red-teaming, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly while maintaining a median around 55,000-60,000.

P20: 50,000
P40: 55,000

P90: 75,000

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate and powerful base rate is a linear extrapolation of the year-to-date (YTD) data for 2025. The research report states that as of November 10, 2025 (day 314 of the year), approximately 46,000 deaths have been reported globally.

*   **Base Rate Calculation:** A simple linear extrapolation for the full 365 days is (46,000 deaths / 314 days) * 365 days ≈ **53,500 deaths**.
*   **Reasoning:** This is the most specific and timely reference class available. It reflects the current state of viral evolution (circulating variants), population immunity, and, crucially, the existing global reporting and surveillance infrastructure. It provides a very strong anchor for the final forecast, as 86% of the year has already passed.
*   **Spread:** The initial distribution around this base rate should be relatively narrow, but with a right skew to account for potential end-of-year waves.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The base case is the simple linear extrapolation of ~53,500 deaths. The key question is how the remaining 51 days of the year (November 11 to December 31) will differ from the average of the first 314 days.

*   **Similarities:** The underlying global immunity and healthcare capacity are unlikely to change dramatically in the final 51 days.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Seasonality:** The most significant difference is seasonality. The final period of the year corresponds to the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, where a majority of the world's population resides. Respiratory virus transmission, including SARS-CoV-2, typically increases during this period. This is a strong reason to expect the average daily death rate to be *higher* than the YTD average.
    *   **Viral Evolution:** The report mentions a new subvariant, HZ.1, is gaining dominance. This provides a specific mechanism for a potential winter wave, as its immune-escape properties could drive an increase in infections.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **YTD Data (46,000 deaths):** This is overwhelmingly strong evidence that the final number will be far below the 2024 total of ~85,000 and orders of magnitude below the pandemic peak. It strongly constrains the forecast to a narrow range. The average daily death rate so far is ~146.5.
*   **Seasonality & HZ.1 Variant (Upward Pressure):** The combination of winter and a new immune-evasive variant makes a higher daily death rate in the final 51 days highly probable. A doubling of the daily rate (to ~293/day) during this period would represent a significant winter wave. This evidence pushes the median of the forecast *above* the simple 53,500 extrapolation.
*   **Degrading Surveillance (Downward Pressure):** The WHO bulletin highlights that reporting infrastructure is weakening. This acts as a powerful counterweight to the seasonality effect. Even if a true wave of infections and severe disease occurs, the number of deaths *officially reported* will be suppressed compared to previous years. This suggests the observed peak in reported deaths will be blunted.
*   **Booster Campaigns (Downward Pressure):** Updated boosters rolled out in high-income countries will mitigate severe outcomes among the most vulnerable, further dampening the mortality peak of any winter wave.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

1.  **Prior/Anchor:** Start with the distribution centered on the linear extrapolation of **53,500**.
2.  **Update for Seasonality/HZ.1:** We need to add the expected deaths from the remaining 51 days. Instead of the YTD average rate of ~147 deaths/day, we should use a higher rate. Let's model a plausible winter increase. A 50% to 100% increase in the daily reported death rate seems reasonable.
    *   *Calculation:* Let's assume a 75% increase in the daily rate for the final 51 days, which is a compromise between a moderate and strong wave.
    *   New daily rate = 146.5 * 1.75 ≈ 256 deaths/day.
    *   Deaths in final 51 days = 51 * 256 ≈ 13,056.
    *   Updated total = 46,000 (YTD) + 13,056 (projected) = **59,056**.
3.  **Update for Reporting Degradation:** The 75% increase might overstate what gets *reported*. The degradation of surveillance likely shaves a significant fraction off the top of any peak. This pushes the median estimate back down slightly from ~59,000. I will settle on a median (P50) slightly lower than this calculation, around **58,000 - 59,000**. The posterior distribution is now centered higher than the base rate but is right-skewed, acknowledging the possibility of a stronger-than-expected wave.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence in Winter Wave:** What if the wave is a dud? The Southern Hemisphere winter was moderate, and high population immunity might be sufficient to prevent a major spike in deaths, even with HZ.1. In this scenario, the final number would be very close to the linear extrapolation. This informs the lower end of my distribution (P10/P20). The final number is very unlikely to be *below* the linear extrapolation, as that would imply a *decrease* in daily deaths during winter.
*   **Underestimation of Tail Risks (Right Tail):** The main risk is a much more severe winter wave than anticipated. This could be due to HZ.1 having unexpectedly higher severity, or a major data dump from a large country revising its 2025 numbers upwards. A scenario where the daily death rate triples for the last 51 days (~440 deaths/day) would add ~22,500 deaths, bringing the total to ~68,500. This seems like a plausible upper bound (P90).
*   **Reporting Lags:** The resolution depends on when deaths are *reported*. Deaths occurring in late December might not be reported until January 2026, which would artificially lower the 2025 total. This adds some downward pressure to the entire distribution.

Considering these factors, I will maintain a median around 59,000 but ensure the distribution captures the low-end possibility of a weak winter (~54,000) and the high-end possibility of a strong one (~68,000). The distribution should be skewed right.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is anchored on the 46,000 deaths already reported, with the remaining uncertainty concentrated in the size of the Northern Hemisphere winter wave over the last 51 days of the year.

P10: 54000
P20: 55500
