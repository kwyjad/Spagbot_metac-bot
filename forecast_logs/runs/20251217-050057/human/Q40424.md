### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Annual Resignations from Pakistan's Superior Judiciary (Normal Period):** In a typical year without major political or constitutional crises, resignations from the superior courts are extremely rare. Judges usually serve until the mandatory retirement age (65 for the Supreme Court, 62 for High Courts). Resignations that occur are often for personal health reasons or occasionally to pre-empt impeachment proceedings (via the Supreme Judicial Council).
    *   **Base Rate:** 0-2 resignations per year across all ~220 judges of the Supreme Court and five High Courts (<1% annual rate).
    *   **Reasoning:** Derived from historical observation of judicial tenures in Pakistan. The posts are prestigious, powerful, and secure, providing strong incentives to serve a full term.
    *   **Limitations:** This base rate is of limited use as the current situation is a clear constitutional crisis, not a normal period.

2.  **Judicial Defiance during Pakistani Constitutional Crises:** Pakistan has a history of extra-constitutional actions by military rulers, with the judiciary's response serving as a relevant reference class. The most significant event was General Musharraf's 2007 imposition of a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO).
    *   **Base Rate:** In 2007, approximately 60 of the ~100 superior court judges at the time refused to take the new oath, leading to their removal. This represents a ~60% rate of defiance in a direct confrontation with a military ruler.
    *   **Reasoning:** This event represents the high-water mark for collective judicial action on a matter of principle. It was a clear, binary choice: take the oath or be removed.
    *   **Limitations:** The 2007 event involved *removal* for refusing an oath, not voluntary *resignation* in response to a constitutional amendment passed by a civilian government. The current government has more tools of co-option and coercion short of outright removal.

3.  **Mass Resignations in other Semi-Authoritarian Regimes:** Judicial resignations as a form of protest against executive overreach have occurred elsewhere, though they are rare. For example, following the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, thousands of judges were dismissed, but mass *protest resignations* beforehand were not a major feature.
    *   **Base Rate:** Mass resignations (e.g., >10% of the judiciary) are an exceptionally rare phenomenon globally. It is more common for judges to be purged or to acquiesce.
    *   **Reasoning:** The collective action problem is severe, and the personal costs (loss of career, pension, status) are extremely high.
    *   **Limitations:** Cross-country comparisons are difficult due to differing legal traditions, political cultures, and the specific nature of the threat to the judiciary.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed, fundamentally altering judicial and military power structures. — **↑↑** (Large) — The primary trigger for the crisis and potential resignations.
*   **2025-11-14** Opposition alliance TTAP calls for nationwide protests against the amendment. — **↑** (Small) — Creates a political atmosphere supportive of defiance but may not directly influence judicial decisions.
*   **2025-11-15** SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resign, citing the amendment. — **↑↑** (Large) — Establishes a precedent for resignation at the highest level by respected, independent-minded judges. Breaks the "no one resigns" taboo.
*   **2025-11-17** Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns. — **↑** (Moderate) — Shows the sentiment extends beyond the Supreme Court, but is still limited to a few individuals.
*   **2025-11-25** (Assumed) Major bar associations (e.g., Pakistan Bar Council, SCBA) condemn the amendment but issue calls for judges to "resist from within" rather than resign en masse. — **↓↓** (Large) — This is a critical off-ramp. It provides cover for judges to stay, framing it as a duty to fight rather than a capitulation. It significantly reduces the pressure for a resignation cascade.
*   **2025-12-05** (Assumed) The government announces the first slate of appointments to the new Federal Constitutional Court, including several sitting High Court judges. — **↓** (Moderate) — Demonstrates that the new system is being implemented and creates a "carrot" for ambitious judges, dividing the judiciary and reducing incentives for collective protest.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand/Judicial Ideology:** A core group of judges with strong commitments to judicial independence and constitutionalism may resign regardless of personal cost. The first three resignations likely came from this group. (Effect: Moderate, as this group is likely small).
2.  **Solidarity & Cascade Effects:** Resignations are contagious. If a critical mass is reached, particularly if led by the Chief Justice or a large group of senior SC judges, it becomes much harder for others to stay. The actions of the bar associations are key to fostering this solidarity. (Effect: Potentially Large, but currently not activated).
3.  **Government Coercion (The Stick):** The new power to forcibly transfer High Court justices is a powerful tool to intimidate judges. A judge in Lahore or Karachi might be deterred from resigning or protesting by the threat of being transferred to Quetta or Peshawar. (Effect: Moderate, suppresses resignations).
4.  **Government Co-option (The Carrot):** The creation of the new Federal Constitutional Court creates prestigious and powerful new positions. The government can offer these posts to sitting judges, rewarding compliance and creating divisions within the judiciary. (Effect: Moderate, suppresses resignations).
5.  **Personal Financial & Career Calculations:** Judges are near the apex of their careers. Resigning means forfeiting a significant salary, a generous pension, and immense social status. For most, this is a powerful disincentive. (Effect: Large, suppresses resignations).
6.  **Public and Peer Pressure:** The stance of the legal community, particularly the powerful bar councils, is a major factor. If they lionize resignees and ostracize those who stay, more may resign. If they support fighting from within, resignations will be suppressed. (Effect: Large, currently pointing toward suppression).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Constitutional Veneer:** Unlike the 2007 PCO (a blunt military order), this change was passed as a constitutional amendment by a civilian parliament. This creates ambiguity, allowing the government to claim legitimacy and making the decision to defy it less clear-cut than refusing an oath from a dictator.
*   **Permanent Restructuring vs. Temporary Emergency:** The 27th Amendment is not a temporary suspension of rights; it is a permanent and fundamental overhaul of the judiciary. This raises the stakes, potentially encouraging more principled resignations from those who see the institution as irrevocably compromised.
*   **Sophisticated Tools of Control:** The government isn't just using force. The amendment provides legal tools of co-option (appointments to the new FCC) and coercion (forced transfers), which are more subtle and potentially more effective at preventing a unified judicial revolt than the binary choice offered by Musharraf.
*   **Initial High-Profile Resignations:** The resignations of two respected Supreme Court justices early in the crisis is a significant event that did not happen in the same way in 2007. This provides a powerful signal and could embolden others, though it has not yet triggered a cascade.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The two reference classes suggest a bimodal prior. One mode is very low, centered around the 3 resignations that have already occurred (reflecting the "normal" rarity of resignations). The other mode is much higher, perhaps centered around 20-40, reflecting a smaller-scale version of the 2007 crisis. The overall prior should be a weighted average, centered low (e.g., 5-8) but with a very fat tail to account for the small possibility of a mass resignation cascade. The "equivalent n" should be low, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑↑ (Large):** The amendment itself is a radical provocation, pushing the probability of resignations far above the "normal" base rate.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The initial three resignations, including two from the SC, confirm that the provocation is severe enough

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate 1:** In normal periods, resignations are rare, with 0-2 resignations per year across all ~220 judges. This suggests a very low base rate for resignations.
   - **Base Rate 2:** During the 2007 constitutional crisis, approximately 60% of judges refused to take a new oath, representing a high defiance rate. This is not directly applicable but provides a high-end reference for potential judicial defiance.
   - **Base Rate 3:** Mass resignations in semi-authoritarian regimes are rare, with judges more likely to be purged than to resign en masse.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** A bimodal distribution reflecting both the rarity of resignations in normal times and the potential for increased resignations during crises. The prior mean is low (around 5-8 resignations) but with a fat tail to account for the possibility of a larger wave of resignations.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation is a constitutional crisis, similar to past events where judicial defiance was significant.
   - **Difference:** The amendment was passed by a civilian government, not a military order, and includes sophisticated tools of control, making the situation less binary than past crises.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Amendment Passage:** The amendment is a radical provocation, increasing the likelihood of resignations significantly.
   - **Initial Resignations:** The resignation of three judges, including two from the Supreme Court, suggests a higher likelihood of further resignations.
   - **Bar Associations' Stance:** Calls for judges to resist from within reduce the likelihood of mass resignations.
   - **Government Appointments:** The creation of the Federal Constitutional Court and appointments to it reduce the likelihood of resignations by offering incentives for compliance.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Start with a low prior mean (5-8 resignations) and adjust upwards due to the amendment and initial resignations. The stance of the bar associations and government appointments act as downward pressures.
   - **Posterior Mean:** The mean shifts slightly upwards from the prior due to the evidence of initial resignations but remains relatively low due to the suppressive factors.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a larger wave of resignations if a critical mass of judges decides to resign in solidarity.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A scenario where the Chief Justice or a large group of senior judges resigns could trigger a cascade, significantly increasing the number of resignations.
   - **Adjustment:** Slightly increase the upper percentiles to account for this tail risk.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the likelihood of resignations given the current evidence and potential tail risks.

# Forecasting Judicial Resignations in Pakistan (Late 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Reference Class A: Normal-period judicial resignations in Pakistan**
- Typically 0-2 resignations per year across ~220 superior court judges
- Mean: ~1 resignation per year (0.5% annual rate)
- This is a low baseline during stable periods

**Reference Class B: 2007 PCO crisis under Musharraf**
- ~60 out of ~100 judges refused to take oath (effectively removed)
- This represents the upper bound of judicial defiance in Pakistan
- However, these were removals, not voluntary resignations

**Reference Class C: Recent resignations (Nov 2025)**
- 3 judges have already resigned (2 Supreme Court, 1 High Court)
- This establishes a floor for our forecast

**Combined Prior:**
- Mean: ~8-10 resignations
- Distribution: Right-skewed with most mass in 3-15 range, but with a fat tail extending to ~40
- This reflects the possibility of both limited individual protests and a potential cascade effect

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes:**
- Like 2007, this is a constitutional crisis threatening judicial independence
- The amendment creates similar pressures on judges to either comply or resist
- The initial resignations follow historical patterns where principled judges lead

**Key differences:**
- Unlike 2007, this is a constitutional amendment passed by parliament, not a military decree
- The amendment provides sophisticated tools of control (transfers, new appointments) rather than binary oath-taking
- The first three resignations create momentum not present in previous crises
- The amendment is permanent, not a temporary emergency measure

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting more resignations:**
- The 27th Amendment fundamentally alters judicial power (↑↑ Strong)
- Two respected Supreme Court justices have already resigned (↑↑ Strong)
- A High Court judge has followed suit, showing broader sentiment (↑ Moderate)
- Opposition parties are organizing protests, creating political cover (↑ Weak)

**Evidence supporting fewer resignations:**
- Bar associations likely advocating "resist from within" strategy (↓↓ Strong)
- Government can offer appointments to new Federal Constitutional Court (↓ Moderate)
- Personal financial and career costs of resignation are extremely high (↓↓ Strong)
- Forced transfer power creates intimidation without requiring resignation (↓ Moderate)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 8-10 resignations, I'll update based on key evidence:

**Update 1: Initial resignations**
- The fact that 3 judges have already resigned increases the likelihood of more resignations
- However, these were likely the most principled/independent judges
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring more resignations
- Posterior shift: Mean moves to ~12-14 resignations

**Update 2: Bar association stance and government incentives**
- Bar associations likely advocating "resist from within"
- Government offering carrots (appointments) and sticks (transfers)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring fewer resignations
- Posterior shift: Mean moves back down to ~7-9 resignations

**Final posterior distribution:**
- Centered around 7-9 resignations
- Right-skewed with most mass between 3-15
- Small but non-negligible probability of a cascade (20+ resignations)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating cascade effects if a critical mass of resignations occurs
- The role of the Chief Justice is crucial - if they resign, it could trigger many more
- I might be overestimating the effectiveness of government carrots and sticks
- Public protests could grow stronger than anticipated, increasing pressure on judges

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 15-20 resignations, arguing that:
- The constitutional changes are so fundamental that principled opposition will be stronger
- Early resignations will create momentum that overcomes collective action problems
- Bar associations might shift to supporting resignations if public sentiment demands it

**Rebuttal:**
While possible, this scenario underestimates:
- The personal costs of resignation (career, financial, status)
- The effectiveness of the "resist from within" narrative
- The government's sophisticated tools to divide the judiciary

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

The primary target for forecasting is the total number of resignations from Pakistan's superior courts (Supreme Court and five High Courts, comprising ~220 judges) during November and December 2025.

*   **Reference Class 1: Normal Annual Resignations.** In a typical year, resignations are extremely rare, numbering 0-2. This is due to the high prestige, power, and security of the positions. This base rate serves as a floor, indicating that resignations are not a routine occurrence, but it is not directly applicable because the current situation is a constitutional crisis, not a normal period.
*   **Reference Class 2: 2007 PCO Crisis.** A more relevant, though imperfect, reference is the 2007 crisis under General Musharraf. Approximately 60 out of ~100 judges (~60%) were removed for refusing to take a new oath under a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). This represents a historical high-water mark for judicial defiance.
*   **Initial Prior:** Given these two reference points, a reasonable prior distribution for total resignations would be centered low but with a very fat tail. It would acknowledge that while mass resignations are rare, a major crisis could trigger a significant number. A bimodal prior is also plausible: one mode around a few principled resignations (2-5) and a much smaller mode representing a cascade event (20-40), inspired by the 2007 crisis.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

The current situation has similarities to the 2007 crisis (a fundamental challenge to judicial independence) but also crucial differences that suggest a lower number of judges will depart.

*   **Resignation vs. Removal:** In 2007, judges were *removed* for the passive act of refusing an oath. Now, they must take the active, career-ending step of *resigning*. This is a higher bar for action and likely reduces the number.
*   **Constitutional Veneer:** The changes were passed as a constitutional amendment by a civilian government, unlike the blunt military order of 2007. This ambiguity provides cover for judges to stay, arguing they are upholding the (new) law or must "resist from within."
*   **Sophisticated Control Mechanisms:** The government has tools of co-option (prestigious appointments to the new Federal Constitutional Court) and coercion (the power to forcibly transfer judges). These are more effective at dividing the judiciary and preventing a unified revolt than the binary choice offered in 2007.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

We start with a baseline of 3 resignations having already occurred. The key question is how many more will follow.

*   **Upward Pressure:**
    *   **Severity of the Amendment:** The changes are a fundamental restructuring of the judiciary, which is a powerful trigger for principled opposition. (Large upward pressure vs. normal times).
    *   **Initial High-Profile Resignations:** The resignation of two respected Supreme Court justices (Shah and Minallah) and one High Court justice breaks the inertia and provides a powerful moral precedent for others to follow. (Large upward pressure, making a final count >3 more likely).

*   **Downward Pressure:**
    *   **Bar Associations' Stance (Assumed):** The research report notes a plausible scenario where bar associations call for judges to "resist from within." This provides a crucial off-ramp and political cover for judges to stay in their posts, framing it as a duty. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a resignation cascade. (Large downward pressure).
    *   **Passage of Time:** The resignations occurred on Nov 15-17. It is now Dec 17. A full month has passed with no further resignations. This is very strong evidence that a rapid, widespread cascade is not occurring. The initial shock has passed, and a new equilibrium is forming. (Very large downward pressure).
    *   **Government Co-option/Coercion:** The "carrot" of new appointments and the "stick" of forced transfers create strong incentives for judges to remain in their posts. (Moderate downward pressure).

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**

1.  **Prior:** A wide distribution, centered low (e.g., median of 5) but with a fat tail allowing for a 2007-like event (e.g., P90 of 30).
2.  **Evidence of 3 Resignations:** This confirms the crisis is severe. The distribution shifts upward. The lower bound is now 3. The median might increase to ~8-10, as a cascade now seems more plausible.
3.  **Evidence of Bar Association Stance & Passage of Time:** This is the most critical update. The call to "resist from within" and the month-long pause in resignations are strong signals that the cascade has failed to launch. This dramatically prunes the fat tail of the distribution. The possibility of 20+ resignations becomes very remote. The probability mass is pulled back down, concentrating heavily near the current number of 3.
4.  **Posterior:** The final posterior distribution is heavily skewed to the right. The mode (most likely outcome) is 3. The median is slightly higher to account for the small possibility of a few more individuals resigning before the end of the year. The tail is thin, reflecting the low probability of a renewed wave of resignations in the next two weeks.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

*   **Risk of being too low:** A new trigger event could occur before Dec 31 (e.g., the government uses its new transfer power on a popular judge), sparking a second wave of resignations. Alternatively, a coordinated group of judges could be planning a joint resignation, and the silence is strategic.
*   **Risk of being too high:** The three judges who resigned may represent the entirety of those willing to take such a drastic step. Everyone else may have already calculated that it is in their best interest to stay. In this case, the final number will be exactly 3.
*   **Adjustment:** The strongest piece of evidence is the one-month lull. This suggests the forces of inertia and self-preservation have won out over principled protest for the vast majority of judges. Therefore, the forecast should remain anchored at 3, with the percentiles reflecting a small but diminishing chance of a few more. The current percentile structure, with a median of 4 and a P90 of 7, appropriately balances these risks.
