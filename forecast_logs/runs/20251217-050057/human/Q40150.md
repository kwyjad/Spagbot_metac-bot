### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Unilateral U.S. Counter-Terrorism Strikes in Third Countries (without overt consent):** This class includes actions like the 2011 raid in Pakistan against Osama bin Laden and numerous drone strikes and raids against ISIS leaders in Syria. These are targeted operations against high-value individuals or groups in nations where the U.S. is not formally at war and the host government is either unable or unwilling to act, and does not provide public consent.
    *   **Base Rate:** Low. Globally, such overt unilateral actions in a country not considered a failed state or active warzone occur perhaps 0-2 times per year. The rate of such an action against a major regional partner like Nigeria is near zero in modern history.
    *   **Reasoning:** These actions carry high diplomatic risk and are reserved for top-priority national security threats where intelligence is highly actionable.
2.  **U.S. Military Interventions Motivated by Humanitarian Concerns:** This class includes actions like the 1992 intervention in Somalia (Operation Restore Hope) or the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia over Kosovo. These are typically larger-scale operations justified on humanitarian grounds.
    *   **Base Rate:** Very low. There have been fewer than five such major U.S.-led interventions since the end of the Cold War. They require significant political capital, international (or at least allied) buy-in, and extensive planning.
    *   **Reasoning:** High cost in resources and political risk, coupled with post-Iraq/Afghanistan public aversion to large-scale interventions, makes the bar for this class extremely high.
3.  **Limited Punitive/Signaling Strikes Ordered by a U.S. President:** This class includes actions like the 2017 and 2018 Tomahawk missile strikes on Syrian government targets. These are not aimed at regime change but at punishing a specific transgression and demonstrating resolve.
    *   **Base Rate:** Low, but higher than the other classes. Such actions have occurred a handful of times in the last decade, typically in response to a clear "red line" being crossed (e.g., chemical weapons use).
    *   **Reasoning:** These actions are politically expedient, can be executed quickly with limited risk to U.S. personnel, and serve a domestic and international signaling purpose.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-01** Trump orders DoD to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria. — ↑ (Large) — Direct presidential statement of intent, setting the stage for a potential military option and putting the bureaucracy on notice.
*   **2025-11-01** Trump threatens Nigeria on Truth Social, mentioning "guns-a-blazing". — ↑ (Large) — Escalates the rhetoric from preparatory to a direct threat, tying it to a specific grievance (killing of Christians) and creating a public commitment.
*   **2025-10-02** Report of Boko Haram killing 4 Christians and destroying a church. — ↑ (Small) — Provides a recent, specific atrocity that can be used as a *casus belli*, fueling the narrative driving the President's threats.
*   **2025-01-30** Report of Boko Haram attacks on Christian communities in Chibok. — ↑ (Small) — Establishes a pattern of violence in 2025 that underpins the U.S. administration's stated concerns.
*   **2025-01-20** State Dept. fact sheet highlights deep U.S.-Nigeria security cooperation. — ↓ (Moderate) — Establishes a baseline of partnership, meaning a unilateral strike would be a radical, costly break from established policy, not an action in a vacuum.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Volition & Rhetorical Commitment:** President Trump's personal focus on the issue, particularly the "persecution of Christians" angle, and his public threats create a strong impetus to act to avoid looking weak. This is the primary driver. (Size: Large)
2.  **Institutional Drag (DoD/State Dept.):** The U.S. military and diplomatic establishment will likely view a unilateral strike on a key regional partner as strategically reckless, damaging long-term counter-terrorism goals and regional stability. They may slow-walk or narrow options presented to the White House. (Size: Large)
3.  **Actionable Intelligence:** The feasibility of any strike depends on having precise, reliable intelligence on the location of terrorist leaders or units. A lack of a "targetable moment" could prevent an attack, regardless of political will. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Nigerian Government Response:** If Nigeria launches a highly visible, credible counter-offensive against the groups in question, it could provide the White House with an "off-ramp," allowing Trump to claim his pressure worked. Conversely, defiance or inaction could provoke a U.S. response. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Domestic Political Calculus:** An attack could appeal to Trump's evangelical base. However, with a very short timeline before 2026, the window for a "rally 'round the flag" effect is minimal, and any complications could create a political headache with no time for recovery. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Presidential Actor:** Unlike past presidents, Trump has demonstrated a higher willingness to break with diplomatic norms, prioritize transactional goals, and use military force for signaling, making his personal threats more credible than those of a more conventional leader.
*   **Target Nation Status:** Nigeria is not a failed state like Somalia or a pariah state like Syria. It is a major African power and a key security partner. A unilateral strike would rupture a critical relationship in a way that strikes in Pakistan or Yemen did not.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in ~2 weeks. This short fuse favors a rapid, limited action (like a drone or air strike) over a complex, planned intervention. It also increases the chance of an impulsive decision based on recent events.
*   **Specific Casus Belli:** The rationale is not a direct attack on U.S. interests (like 9/11) but the protection of a third-party religious group. While this has precedent (Kosovo), it is unusual as the sole driver for a unilateral U.S. strike.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., <5%) based on the reference class of U.S. unilateral strikes against major security partners, which is exceptionally rare. The prior is strong, equivalent to observing dozens of cases of non-intervention in similar contexts.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The President's direct, public order to the DoD and "guns-a-blazing" threat is a powerful signal of intent that dramatically overcomes the base rate.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The established, deep security partnership with Nigeria creates significant institutional and strategic costs to unilateral action, acting as a strong brake.
    *   ↓ (Small): The logistical complexity and need for actionable intelligence for a strike in a country without basing rights could prevent an operation, even with political will.
    *   ↑ (Small): The specific "protecting Christians" narrative strongly appeals to the President's core political base, increasing the domestic political payoff for action.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to a significant upward revision from the very low prior. The President's direct threat is the key variable and is strong enough to make a low-probability event plausible, though significant headwinds remain.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Movement of U.S. ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) assets (e.g., Reaper/Predator drones) to bases in neighboring countries (e.g., Niger).
    *   U.S. State Department issuing heightened travel warnings or ordering the departure of non-essential diplomatic personnel from Nigeria.
    *   Leaks from the Pentagon or White House detailing specific military options being presented to the President.
    *   Further inflammatory rhetoric from President Trump specifically naming Nigerian leaders or military units for inaction.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcements of a major, new Nigerian military offensive in the northeast or Middle Belt, accompanied by verifiable results.
    *   High-level diplomatic engagement between U.S. and Nigerian officials (e.g., a visit by the Secretary of State or a call between presidents) resulting in a joint statement.
    *   Statements from senior Republican lawmakers in Congress questioning the strategic wisdom of an attack.
    *   A significant distracting international or domestic crisis that diverts the President's attention.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Attack":** The resolution criteria are broad. A single drone strike by JSOC against an ISWAP leader would resolve this "Yes," and is far more plausible than a large-scale bombing campaign or troop deployment. The forecast must focus on the lowest-plausibility "Yes" scenario.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Intent:** The President's statements could be a negotiating tactic to coerce the Nigerian government into action, rather than a genuine prelude to an attack.
*   **Intelligence Gaps:** We have no visibility into the quality of U.S. intelligence on terrorist targets in Nigeria. An attack is contingent on a "targetable moment" which may not materialize before the deadline.
*   **Fictional Premise:** The scenario is based on hypothetical news reports. The analysis assumes these reports are true and reflect the political reality of the scenario's world.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a U.S. military attack in Nigeria before 2026 has shifted from near-zero to a non-trivial possibility due to the President's direct and public threats. The outcome now hinges on a conflict between the President's personal commitment and the powerful institutional and diplomatic brakes on such a strategically costly action against a key partner, all within an extremely compressed timeframe.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for unilateral U.S. military strikes in countries like Nigeria, a key regional partner, is extremely low. Historically, such actions are rare, especially against nations that are not failed states or pariah states. The base rate for such an event is less than 5%, reflecting the rarity of such actions in similar contexts.
- **Reasoning:** The U.S. has a history of avoiding military interventions in countries where it has significant diplomatic and security partnerships, unless there is a direct threat to U.S. interests or a humanitarian crisis that garners international support.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves potential U.S. military action in a country where the U.S. is not at war, similar to past unilateral strikes.
- **Differences:** Nigeria is a significant regional partner, unlike past targets of unilateral strikes. The current situation involves a direct presidential threat, which is unusual and increases the likelihood compared to the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential Threats:** The direct threats from President Trump to take military action significantly increase the likelihood of an attack compared to the base rate. This is a strong piece of evidence suggesting intent.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High, as such direct threats are rare and indicate a higher probability of action.
- **U.S.-Nigeria Security Cooperation:** The deep security partnership acts as a deterrent to unilateral action, decreasing the likelihood.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate, as it represents a significant institutional barrier.
- **Recent Atrocities:** Reports of violence against Christians provide a potential justification for action, slightly increasing the likelihood.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Small, as these events alone are unlikely to trigger unilateral action without other factors.
- **Institutional Resistance:** The U.S. military and diplomatic institutions are likely to resist such an action, decreasing the likelihood.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High, as institutional inertia is a powerful force against rapid, unilateral military actions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Let's assume a prior probability of 5% (odds of 0.05/0.95).
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The presidential threats significantly increase the odds, while institutional resistance and the security partnership decrease them.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
  - Adjusting for the presidential threats, the odds might increase to around 0.10.
  - Adjusting for institutional resistance and security partnership, the odds might decrease back to around 0.07.
- **Posterior Probability:** Converting these odds back to probability gives approximately 7%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must consider the possibility of impulsive presidential action, but also the strong institutional barriers.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major Nigerian military offensive or diplomatic engagement could further decrease the probability.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of actionable intelligence or a "targetable moment" could prevent an attack, even with political will.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential institutional barriers, the probability of the U.S. conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is estimated to be:

Final: 7%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before January 1, 2026 (approximately 2 weeks from now).

The most appropriate reference class is "unilateral US military strikes against countries with which it has security partnerships but where terrorist groups operate." This includes cases like Pakistan (bin Laden raid), Yemen (drone strikes), and Somalia (limited operations).

**Base rate:** Historically, such strikes against security partners are rare, occurring perhaps 0-2 times per year globally. Nigeria specifically has never experienced a unilateral US military strike despite years of Boko Haram/ISWAP activity. Given Nigeria's status as a major regional partner and the diplomatic costs involved, I'll set a low prior of 3%.

**Prior odds:** 3:97 or approximately 1:32

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Nigeria faces active terrorist threats (Boko Haram, ISWAP) that the US opposes
- The US has security cooperation with Nigeria, as with other partners where strikes have occurred
- The terrorist groups have committed documented atrocities that could serve as justification

**Key differences:**
- President Trump has explicitly threatened military action, which is highly unusual and significantly increases likelihood
- The specific framing around "protecting Christians" creates a unique political dynamic
- The extremely short timeframe (2 weeks until 2026) limits the types of operations possible
- Nigeria is a much more significant regional power than typical targets of unilateral US strikes

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's direct order to DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If the US were planning to attack, such preparation orders would almost certainly be issued
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.15) - Such explicit preparation orders are uncommon for mere diplomatic pressure
- Likelihood ratio: ~6.3
- This significantly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Trump's public "guns-a-blazing" threat on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.90) - Public threats often precede limited strikes under Trump (e.g., Syria)
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.30) - Trump has made threats that weren't followed through on
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This moderately increases probability

**Evidence 3: Existing deep US-Nigeria security cooperation**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.50) - Attacks sometimes occur despite partnerships (Pakistan)
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.95) - Security partnerships typically prevent unilateral strikes
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.53
- This decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Recent documented attacks on Christians by Boko Haram**
- P(E|H): High (~0.80) - Specific atrocities provide justification for strikes
- P(E|~H): High (~0.70) - Such attacks have occurred for years without US strikes
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14
- This slightly increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:32 (3%)

**Update on Trump's preparation order:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:32 × 6.3 = 6.3:32 ≈ 1:5.1
- New probability: 1/(1+5.1) ≈ 16.4%

**Update on Trump's public threat:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:5.1 × 3.0 = 3:5.1 ≈ 1:1.7
- New probability: 1/(1+1.7) ≈ 37%

**Update on existing security cooperation:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:1.7 × 0.53 = 0.53:1.7 ≈ 1:3.2
- New probability: 1/(1+3.2) ≈ 23.8%

**Update on recent attacks:**
- Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 1:3.2 × 1.14 = 1.14:3.2 ≈ 1:2.8
- New probability: 1/(1+2.8) ≈ 26.3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting Trump's rhetoric, as his administration often made threats without follow-through
- The extremely short timeframe (2 weeks) makes logistics challenging for any operation
- I might be underestimating institutional resistance from DoD/State Department

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Trump could be using threats purely as leverage to pressure Nigeria into action
- A significant terrorist attack in the next two weeks could dramatically increase likelihood
- Nigerian government might launch major counter-terrorism operations to prevent US intervention

**Best alternative forecast:**
A much lower probability (5-10%) could be justified by emphasizing:
1. The extreme diplomatic costs of attacking a major African partner
2. The lack of US basing rights or established operations in Nigeria
3. The need for actionable intelligence that may not exist

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
Trump has demonstrated willingness to break diplomatic norms and order limited strikes (Syria) with minimal planning. The "protecting Christians" narrative provides strong political motivation that could override institutional concerns.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I believe the probability is somewhat lower than my initial calculation. The extremely short timeframe, logistical challenges, and institutional resistance are significant constraints, even with Trump's explicit threats.

Final: 22%

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is the frequency of unilateral U.S. military strikes in a third country without that country's public consent, particularly when that country is a significant security partner.
*   **Reasoning:** Historically, such actions are exceptionally rare. Strikes in places like Syria, Yemen, or Somalia typically occur in states with limited sovereignty or against adversarial regimes. An uninvited strike in a major regional partner like Nigeria is nearly unprecedented in recent decades. The institutional and diplomatic costs are enormous. For any given two-week period, the probability of such an event is extremely low.
*   **Initial Prior:** A standard base rate for this would be less than 1%. However, the prompt specifies the administration of President Donald Trump, whose presidency has been characterized by a greater willingness to break with foreign policy norms. Therefore, I will set a slightly higher prior that accounts for this specific actor's higher baseline propensity for such actions.
*   **Prior Probability:** P(H) = 3%. This reflects an event that is still fundamentally very unlikely but acknowledges an administration more willing to consider it than a typical one. This corresponds to prior odds of approximately 1:32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The context involves non-state terrorist groups (Boko Haram/ISWAP) operating in areas with weak government control, which is a common feature in countries where the U.S. has conducted counter-terrorism strikes.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Presidential Volition:** The primary factor making this situation unique is the President's direct, personal, and public commitment to potential action. His specific rhetoric ("guns-a-blazing") and formal order to the DoD are a radical departure from normal diplomatic pressure.
    *   **Target Nation Status:** Nigeria is a major African power and a key U.S. security partner. A unilateral strike would rupture this relationship, with severe strategic consequences, making it far more costly than a strike in Pakistan (a distrusted partner) or Syria (an adversary).
    *   **Stated Rationale:** The justification—protecting Christians—is tailored to the President's domestic political base. While humanitarianism has been a U.S. rationale before (e.g., Kosovo), its use here as a driver for a potential unilateral strike is unusual and appears highly personalized.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most crucial piece of new evidence is the President's public statements. Let H be the hypothesis that the U.S. attacks, and ~H be the hypothesis that it does not.

*   **Evidence (E):** President Trump orders the DoD to prepare for action and publicly threatens to go in "guns-a-blazing."
*   **P(E | H):** If the U.S. were going to attack, it is highly probable that this specific President would first make such public threats to create a justification and project strength. I estimate this probability to be high, around 0.9.
*   **P(E | ~H):** How likely is it that the President would make these threats but *not* follow through? This is the "bluff" scenario. Such threats could be a coercive tactic to force the Nigerian government to act, providing Trump with a political win he can claim credit for ("My tough talk worked"). Given his past use of bombastic rhetoric, this is a very plausible alternative. However, the specificity and public nature of the threat create a commitment, and backing down would carry a political cost. I estimate the probability of this being a bluff or coercive diplomacy at 25% (0.25).
*   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) = 0.9 / 0.25 = 3.6. This evidence strongly increases the probability of an attack.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 3%, so P(~H) = 97%. The prior odds are 3/97, which is approximately 1 to 32.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The LR from the President's threats is approximately 3.6.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio ≈ (1/32) × 3.6 ≈ 3.6/32 ≈ 1/8.9.
*   **Posterior Probability:** The new probability is calculated from the posterior odds: P(H | E) = 1 / (1 + 8.9) ≈ 1 / 9.9 ≈ 0.101.

This update moves the probability from a very low 3% to approximately 10%. This reflects a situation where an extremely unlikely event has become a non-trivial possibility due to the direct intent expressed by the commander-in-chief.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence/Blind Spots:** The primary risk is overweighting the President's rhetoric and underestimating the immense institutional inertia and diplomatic constraints. The U.S. military and State Department ("institutional drag") will almost certainly advise strongly against this action, highlighting the catastrophic impact on the U.S.-Nigeria partnership and regional stability. They may slow-walk the presentation of options or highlight prohibitive risks.
*   **Alternative Scenarios (Paths to "No"):**
    1.  **Successful Coercion:** The Nigerian government announces a major, credible new offensive against the groups in question, giving the President an "off-ramp" to declare victory without military action.
    2.  **Lack of Opportunity:** A military strike, even a drone strike, requires precise, actionable intelligence. Such a "targetable moment" may not materialize within the short two-week timeframe.
    3.  **Distraction:** A more pressing domestic or international crisis could easily divert the President's attention.
*   **Rebuttal:** While these "No" paths are plausible and represent the bulk of the probability space (90%), the Soleimani strike in Iraq is a powerful precedent for this President ordering a high-risk, norm-breaking military action against the advice of some in the establishment. The possibility cannot be dismissed. The 10% forecast acknowledges that while an attack is unlikely, the specific conditions have made it a real and present danger.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate for a U.S. attack on a key partner like Nigeria is extremely low, estimated at 3% to account for a norm-breaking administration. The President's direct and public threats are a powerful piece of evidence that significantly increases this probability. However, powerful countervailing forces remain: immense institutional resistance from the DoD and State Department, the high diplomatic cost of such an action, and the logistical challenge of finding an actionable target in a short timeframe. Balancing the President's stated intent against these formidable obstacles leads to a final probability that is substantially higher than the base rate but still well below even odds.

Final: 10%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event— a unilateral U.S. military attack within the territory of a major security partner like Nigeria—draws from the reference class of U.S. unilateral counter-terrorism strikes in third countries without overt consent, as outlined in the research report. Historically, such actions (e.g., drone strikes or raids in Pakistan or Syria) are rare, occurring 0-2 times per year globally, but almost never against a stable, allied nation like Nigeria, which is a key regional partner with deep U.S. security cooperation. There are no modern instances of U.S. attacks in Nigeria or similar partners (e.g., no strikes in countries like Kenya or Egypt despite terrorism issues). Broader U.S. interventions motivated by humanitarian concerns (e.g., Somalia 1992) are even rarer, with fewer than five major cases since the Cold War. Limited punitive strikes (e.g., Syria 2017) happen a handful of times per decade but typically target pariah states, not partners.

This yields a very low base rate: perhaps 1-2% in any given year for a comparable scenario, adjusted downward for the short ~2-week horizon (from 2025-12-17 to 2026-01-01), which prorates to ~0.1-0.2% without specific catalysts. I'll set the prior probability P(H) at 1% (odds 1:99), reflecting the exceptional rarity and high diplomatic barriers, backed by decades of non-intervention in similar African contexts despite ongoing violence (e.g., no U.S. strikes in Nigeria during peak Boko Haram activity in the 2010s).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to base cases like U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan or punitive strikes in Syria in that it involves counter-terrorism against Islamist groups (Boko Haram/ISWAP) in a sovereign nation, justified partly on humanitarian grounds (protection of Christians), with no formal U.S. war declaration. Both involve presidential rhetoric escalating to potential action, and a short decision window favors limited operations over invasions.

However, differences are significant: Nigeria is a major U.S. security partner (unlike Syria or Pakistan at times of strikes), with established cooperation that would be ruptured by unilateral action—raising diplomatic and strategic costs far higher than in failed or hostile states. The rationale here is narrower (religious persecution rather than direct U.S. threats like chemical weapons or 9/11 links), and the timeline is extremely compressed (~2 weeks), making complex operations unlikely but impulsive, low-footprint actions (e.g., a single drone strike) more feasible. Trump's personal style—more norm-breaking and rhetoric-driven than predecessors—makes threats more credible, potentially increasing probability beyond the base rate, but institutional resistance (DoD/State Dept.) and lack of a "targetable moment" could reinforce the low base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Key pieces of evidence from the background and research report:

- **Trump's DoD order and Truth Social threat (↑ Large):** P(E | H) is high (~90%), as public presidential directives and inflammatory rhetoric ("guns-a-blazing") often precede actual strikes (e.g., Syria 2017). P(E | ~H) is lower (~20%), as such threats can be bluster for negotiation (e.g., Trump's North Korea rhetoric without action). Likelihood ratio ~4.5:1, strongly increasing probability by signaling intent and creating commitment.

- **Recent Boko Haram atrocities against Christians (↑ Small):** P(E | H) ~70%, as specific incidents provide casus belli for humanitarian justification. P(E | ~H) ~50%, since violence is ongoing regardless. Likelihood ratio ~1.4:1, modestly increasing probability by fitting the narrative.

- **Deep U.S.-Nigeria security cooperation (↓ Moderate):** P(E | H) ~30%, as attacking a partner is anomalous and costly. P(E | ~H) ~90%, as cooperation is the norm without escalation. Likelihood ratio ~0.33:1, decreasing probability by highlighting high barriers to breaking ties.

- **Institutional drag and need for actionable intelligence (↓ Moderate):** P(E | H) ~40%, as bureaucracy can enable but often tempers action; intelligence gaps could block strikes. P(E | ~H) ~80%, as these factors routinely prevent escalation. Likelihood ratio ~0.5:1, decreasing probability by adding practical hurdles in a short window.

- **Domestic political appeal to base (↑ Small):** P(E | H) ~60%, tying to evangelical support. P(E | ~H) ~40%, as it's a motivator but not decisive. Likelihood ratio ~1.5:1, modestly increasing probability.

Overall, evidence mixes strong upward signals (Trump's commitment) with downward brakes (partnership and logistics), netting an upward tilt.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:99 (P(H) = 1%).

First explicit update: Incorporate Trump's order/threat (likelihood ratio 4.5:1). Posterior odds = 1:99 × 4.5 = 4.5:99 ≈ 1:22 (P ≈ 4.3%).

Next, fold in recent atrocities and domestic appeal (combined LR ~2:1 for small ups). Posterior odds ≈ 1:22 × 2 = 2:22 ≈ 1:11 (P ≈ 8.3%).

Then, apply downward evidence (cooperation and institutional drag, combined LR ~0.25:1 for moderates). Posterior odds ≈ 1:11 × 0.25 = 0.25:11 ≈ 1:44 (P ≈ 2.2%).

This results in a posterior of ~2%, reflecting a modest upward nudge from the very low prior due to Trump's credible threats, but tempered by strong countervailing factors. Uncertainty remains high given the short horizon and potential for rapid changes (e.g., a sudden intelligence opportunity or Nigerian concession), leaving room for tail risks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the downward adjustments, underestimating Trump's impulsiveness— he's broken norms before (e.g., Soleimani strike), so the prior could be too low if this is a "black swan" personal priority. Blind spots include intelligence we can't see; a "targetable moment" could spike odds quickly. Alternative forecast: 10-15% if viewing this as akin to Syria strikes, emphasizing the short horizon and rhetoric as high-signal (plausible because limited actions are low-cost). Rebuttal: Nigeria's partner status makes it dissimilar, and no historical Trump-era strikes on allies occurred. Tail risks: High (e.g., 1% chance of full invasion if escalation spirals) or low (e.g., rhetoric as pure bluff). This warrants a slight upward adjustment to ~3% to account for over-discounting presidential volition, ensuring calibration avoids big swings per guidance.

Final: 3%
