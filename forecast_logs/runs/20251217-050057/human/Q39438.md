### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court cases involving the "Major Questions Doctrine" (MQD) or significant non-delegation challenges (post-2018):** This is the most relevant class. The current Court has shown increasing skepticism toward broad delegations of authority to the executive branch on issues of major economic and political significance without clear congressional authorization.
    *   **Base Rate:** The executive branch has lost most of these recent high-profile cases (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, OSHA vaccine mandate in *NFIB v. OSHA*). A base rate for the government's position being found *unlawful* in some form is high, perhaps **65-75%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The imposition of trillions of dollars in tariffs based on a broad interpretation of an emergency powers act fits squarely within the MQD framework. This reference class captures the current Court's dominant judicial philosophy on separation of powers.
2.  **Supreme Court cases involving challenges to presidential authority in national security and foreign affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in this domain.
    *   **Base Rate:** The President's actions are upheld in a majority of these cases (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*, *Dames & Moore v. Regan* which specifically involved IEEPA). The base rate for the President's action being found *lawful* could be estimated at **60-70%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The government has framed the tariffs as a response to national emergencies (drug trafficking, threats to economic security), placing the issue in this traditional area of executive deference.
3.  **Supreme Court review of cases where multiple lower courts have ruled against the government:** The Court does not take cases simply to affirm, but when lower courts are united against the government on a major issue, a reversal is not the default outcome.
    *   **Base Rate:** This is difficult to quantify, but a rough estimate might place the probability of at least partial affirmation of the lower courts (i.e., a ruling of "Unlawful" or "Mixed") at **55-65%**.
    *   **Limitations:** The core tension is between reference classes 1 and 2. The outcome depends entirely on whether the Court frames this as an administrative law/delegation case (favoring "Unlawful") or a foreign affairs/national security case (favoring "Lawful"). The facts here blur the line.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held. Source reports indicate a "divided court." — (↓ Lawful, ↑ Mixed) — A divided court makes a clean sweep for the government less likely and suggests justices are grappling with competing principles, often leading to narrower or split decisions.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates both cases on an expedited schedule. — (↓ No 2025 ruling) — The Court's speed signals its intent to resolve the matter definitively and quickly, making a delay past year-end highly improbable.
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms the *V.O.S. Selections* ruling against the tariffs in a 7-4 decision. — (↓ Lawful) — A clear, though not unanimous, majority in a specialized appellate court found the tariffs exceeded IEEPA's authority, strengthening the legal case against them.
*   **2025-06-17** Plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* petition for certiorari before judgment. — (↔️ Neutral) — This procedural move simply accelerated the timeline to the inevitable Supreme Court review, reflecting the issue's urgency.
*   **2025-05-28** Two different federal courts rule against the tariffs on different grounds. — (↓ Lawful) — The fact that two courts found the tariffs unlawful via different lines of reasoning suggests the government's legal position is weak from multiple angles.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The Court's conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies discovering new, sweeping powers in old, vague statutes. Imposing tariffs—a power the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress—is a quintessential "major question." (Large driver toward **Unlawful/Mixed**)
2.  **Textualism:** The text of IEEPA does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties." It authorizes the President to "regulate" or "prohibit" transactions. A textualist interpretation may find that imposing a tax (a tariff) is a distinct power not granted by the statute. (Large driver toward **Unlawful/Mixed**)
3.  **Foreign Affairs Deference:** The Court has a long tradition of deferring to the President on matters of national security and foreign commerce. The government's entire case rests on framing this as a national security issue, which could persuade key justices like Roberts and Kavanaugh. (Large driver toward **Lawful**)
4.  **Statutory Off-Ramp ("deal with" clause):** The *V.O.S. Selections* case provides a narrower path for a ruling. The Court could avoid the huge question of whether IEEPA ever allows tariffs and instead rule that *these specific tariffs* (especially the "reciprocal" ones) do not plausibly "deal with" the declared emergency. This makes a "Mixed" or "Unlawful" ruling on narrower grounds more likely. (Moderate driver toward **Mixed/Unlawful**)
5.  **Separation of Powers (Taxing Power):** The argument that the tariff power is a core legislative power that cannot be delegated is constitutionally fundamental. This will resonate strongly with originalist justices. (Moderate driver toward **Unlawful**)
6.  **Pragmatism/Institutional Concerns:** An abrupt ruling striking down all tariffs could cause massive economic disruption. Chief Justice Roberts, in particular, may seek a "minimalist" or "mixed" ruling that resolves the case without creating economic chaos or a major political confrontation. (Moderate driver toward **Mixed/Other**)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** While IEEPA has been used for sanctions, its application to impose broad-based tariffs on major trading partners, justified by trade deficits, is a novel and highly aggressive interpretation of the statute. This pushes the case out of the standard "foreign affairs deference" model and into the "major questions" framework.
*   **Clash of Core Principles:** This case creates a direct collision between two powerful judicial principles for the conservative majority: deference to the executive on national security vs. skepticism of the administrative state (MQD). The outcome is less predictable than a standard case in either category.
*   **Two Distinct Legal Challenges:** The Court is not reviewing one legal theory but two. The *Learning Resources* case presents a broad challenge (no tariff power at all), while *V.O.S. Selections* presents a narrower, as-applied challenge. This structure explicitly invites a "Mixed ruling."
*   **Economic Stakes:** The sheer scale of the tariffs ($1.4 trillion over ten years) elevates the economic significance far beyond typical regulatory cases, potentially increasing pressure for a pragmatic or narrow ruling to avoid market shocks.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the MQD reference class, a plausible prior would place a low probability on "Tariffs lawful" (~20%), a high probability on "Tariffs unlawful" (~50%), and a moderate chance on "Mixed ruling" (~25%), with "Other/No ruling" being negligible (~5%). (Equivalent n=12, reflecting moderate confidence in the MQD framework's relevance).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) Two lower courts ruling against the tariffs on different grounds strongly reinforces the "Unlawful" prior. (Large)
    *   (↑ Mixed) The existence of both a broad facial challenge and a narrower as-applied challenge provides a clear path for a split decision. (Moderate)
    *   (↓ Lawful, ↑ Mixed) Reports of a "divided court" from oral arguments suggest a clean win for the government is off the table and that a compromise or fractured ruling is likely. (Moderate)
    *   (↑ Lawful/Mixed) The national security justification, while perhaps pretextual for the reciprocal tariffs, is more plausible for the trafficking tariffs, creating another avenue for a "Mixed" outcome. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly disfavors the "Tariffs lawful" outcome. The primary update should be to shift probability from the "Tariffs unlawful" bucket into the "Mixed ruling" bucket. The posterior should show "Mixed ruling" and "Tariffs unlawful" as the two most likely outcomes, with "Mixed" perhaps becoming the slight favorite due to the multiple avenues for a split decision.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   Public statements or speeches by conservative justices emphasizing the need for a strong executive in foreign policy.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars (e.g., from the Federalist Society) defending the President's broad IEEPA authority.
    *   Leaks from Court deliberations suggesting Chief Justice Roberts is working to build a narrow, compromise opinion.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful):**
    *   Leaks suggesting a strong majority (e.g., 6-3 or 7-2) coalescing around a broad MQD-based rebuke of the executive branch.
    *   Unusual silence from the Court, which could imply a sweeping and complex opinion striking down the tariffs is being written.
    *   Economic news emphasizing the negative impact of the tariffs, potentially reducing the Court's concern about the disruptive effects of striking them down.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Box of Deliberations:** All analysis prior to the ruling is speculative. A single justice changing their mind can completely alter the outcome and coalition.

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential authority in national security and foreign affairs, with a base rate of 60-70% for the President's actions being upheld. However, given the current Court's skepticism towards broad delegations of authority, a lower base rate of **30%** is more appropriate for this scenario.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The recent trend in Supreme Court rulings involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) suggests a high likelihood of the executive branch losing such cases. A base rate of **50%** is reasonable here, reflecting the Court's tendency to limit executive power in major economic matters.

- **Mixed ruling**: Given the presence of both broad and narrow legal challenges, a mixed ruling is plausible. A base rate of **15%** is assigned, considering the Court's potential to issue a nuanced decision.

- **Other ruling**: This includes scenarios like dismissal or lack of standing. Historically, these are less common in high-profile cases, so a base rate of **3%** is assigned.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule and the Court's interest in resolving the matter, the likelihood of no ruling by the end of 2025 is low. A base rate of **2%** is assigned.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves significant questions of executive authority and economic impact, fitting the MQD framework.
  
- **Differences**: The tariffs' unprecedented scope and the dual legal challenges (broad and narrow) make this case unique, increasing the likelihood of a mixed ruling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Two lower courts ruling against the tariffs**: Strong evidence against "Tariffs lawful" and in favor of "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."
  
- **Divided court during oral arguments**: Suggests a lower likelihood of a straightforward ruling, increasing the probability of a "Mixed ruling."

- **National security justification**: Provides some support for "Tariffs lawful," but the pretextual nature for reciprocal tariffs weakens this.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds = 30%, Likelihood ratio (based on evidence) = 0.5. Posterior probability = 15%.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds = 50%, Likelihood ratio = 1.2 (strong evidence from lower courts). Posterior probability = 60%.

- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds = 15%, Likelihood ratio = 1.5 (divided court and dual challenges). Posterior probability = 22.5%.

- **Other ruling**: Prior odds = 3%, Likelihood ratio = 1.0 (neutral evidence). Posterior probability = 2.5%.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds = 2%, Likelihood ratio = 0.5 (expedited schedule). Posterior probability = 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: The forecast may underestimate the potential for a "Mixed ruling" due to the complexity of the case.
  
- **Tail risks**: Consider the possibility of an unexpected procedural outcome or a shift in judicial philosophy.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to sum to 100%:

  - Tariffs lawful: 15%
  - Tariffs unlawful: 55%
  - Mixed ruling: 25%
  - Other ruling: 3%
  - No 2025 ruling: 2%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 55%  
Mixed ruling: 25%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant reference classes:

**For "Tariffs unlawful" (50% prior):**
- Recent Supreme Court cases involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) show strong skepticism toward broad executive power without clear congressional authorization
- In cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), the Court struck down executive actions that claimed broad authority from vague statutes
- The current 6-3 conservative Court has consistently limited executive power in regulatory contexts

**For "Mixed ruling" (25% prior):**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions on politically charged cases
- The consolidated cases present different legal theories, creating natural pathways for a split decision
- Chief Justice Roberts frequently crafts narrow rulings that avoid sweeping pronouncements

**For "Tariffs lawful" (15% prior):**
- Historical deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*)
- IEEPA specifically grants emergency powers to the President in international contexts
- Some precedent exists for upholding presidential emergency powers (*Dames & Moore v. Regan*)

**For "Other ruling" (7% prior):**
- Procedural dismissals are uncommon but possible
- The Court occasionally avoids deciding politically charged cases on technical grounds

**For "No 2025 ruling" (3% prior):**
- The Court has already granted certiorari on an expedited schedule
- Oral arguments were held in November 2025
- The Court rarely delays high-profile cases with economic implications

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other MQD cases, this involves an executive branch claiming broad authority from a decades-old statute
- The economic impact is massive, making it a quintessential "major question"
- The Court's current composition remains skeptical of executive overreach

**Key differences:**
- Unlike pure domestic regulation cases, these tariffs involve foreign affairs where courts traditionally grant more deference
- The dual legal challenges (broad in *Learning Resources*, narrow in *V.O.S. Selections*) create more pathways for a mixed ruling
- The economic stakes are exceptionally high, potentially affecting trillions in trade

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Two different lower courts ruled against the tariffs on different legal grounds (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- The Federal Circuit affirmed one ruling 7-4, with bipartisan composition in both majority and dissent (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- IEEPA's text doesn't explicitly authorize tariffs, only regulation of transactions (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.5)
- The "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits stretch the definition of "emergency" beyond recognition (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.3)

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- The consolidated cases present different legal theories (facial vs. as-applied challenges) (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.4)
- The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible national security justification than the reciprocal tariffs (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- Reports indicated a "divided court" during oral arguments (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.4)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- IEEPA has been used for decades to impose economic sanctions (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.6)
- The Court has historically deferred to the President on national security matters (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.5)
- The drug trafficking emergency has factual support, unlike some pretextual emergencies (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.4)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the strongest evidence: the lower court rulings against the tariffs.

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 50%
- Prior odds: 50/50 = 1.0
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67
- Posterior odds: 1.0 × 2.67 = 2.67
- Posterior probability: 2.67/(1+2.67) = 73%

However, we must also consider the "divided court" evidence, which suggests a mixed ruling is more likely:
- For "Mixed ruling" vs. "Tariffs unlawful":
- Likelihood ratio for divided court: (0.7/0.4) = 1.75 favoring "Mixed ruling"

This shifts some probability from "Tariffs unlawful" to "Mixed ruling."

The trafficking tariffs having a more plausible national security justification than the reciprocal tariffs also supports a "Mixed ruling" where the Court might uphold some tariffs while striking down others.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the Major Questions Doctrine's applicability to foreign affairs
- The Court might be more concerned about economic disruption than legal technicalities
- The consolidated cases might lead to a more complex ruling than my categories allow

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the tariffs but impose significant limitations on their implementation
- The Court might rule narrowly on statutory grounds while avoiding constitutional questions
- A fractured Court could produce a plurality opinion with limited precedential value

**Best alternative forecast:**
- "Tariffs lawful" could be more likely if the Court heavily weights national security deference and the explicit emergency powers in IEEPA
- However, this seems unlikely given the lower court consensus and the Court's recent skepticism of executive power

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots:

- "Tariffs unlawful" probability decreases from 73% to 42% due to the strong evidence for a mixed ruling
- "Mixed ruling" increases to 38% given the multiple pathways for a split decision
- "Tariffs lawful" remains low at 12% given the lower court consensus against it
- "Other ruling" at 6% acknowledging procedural possibilities
- "No 2025 ruling" at 2% given the expedited schedule and December timeframe

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs unlawful: 42%  
Mixed ruling: 38%  
Tariffs lawful: 12%  
Other ruling: 6%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information, following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The central legal question is whether the President can use a broad delegation of emergency authority (IEEPA) to impose tariffs, a power traditionally reserved for Congress. This places the case at the intersection of two competing legal principles, each suggesting a different base rate.

*   **Reference Class 1: Major Questions Doctrine (MQD).** The current Supreme Court is highly skeptical of the executive branch using old, vague statutes to claim new powers of major economic and political significance. Imposing trillions of dollars in tariffs fits this description perfectly. In recent MQD cases (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*), the executive branch has consistently lost. This reference class suggests a high probability that the tariffs will be found unlawful in some capacity. A prior based on this would be roughly: **P(Lawful) = 25%, P(Unlawful/Mixed) = 75%**.
*   **Reference Class 2: Foreign Affairs & National Security Deference.** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs and national security. IEEPA is a foreign affairs statute, and the President has declared a national emergency. This reference class suggests a high probability of the President's actions being upheld (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*). A prior based on this would be roughly: **P(Lawful) = 65%, P(Unlawful/Mixed) = 35%**.

The specific facts of this case—particularly the use of trade deficits as a "national emergency" to justify "reciprocal tariffs"—push it more strongly into the MQD framework than a typical national security case. Therefore, the MQD reference class is the more appropriate starting point. I will set my initial prior with a strong tilt against the tariffs being found entirely lawful.

*   **Initial Prior:**
    *   P(Lawful): 30%
    *   P(Unlawful): 45%
    *   P(Mixed): 20%
    *   P(Other ruling): 3%
    *   P(No 2025 ruling): 2%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case is unusual because it forces a direct conflict between the MQD and foreign affairs deference. Furthermore, the existence of two distinct sets of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) on two different legal justifications (a plausible security threat vs. a questionable economic one) creates a natural pathway for a split or "mixed" decision that is not always present in other MQD cases. The Court is not forced into an all-or-nothing choice.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence:** Two separate lower courts, including a specialized appellate court, have ruled against the tariffs. The rulings were on different grounds: one broad (IEEPA never allows tariffs) and one narrow (these specific tariffs don't "deal with" the threat).
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence is highly probable if the tariffs are indeed unlawful or if a mixed ruling is the correct outcome (P(E | Unlawful) is high, P(E | Mixed) is high). It is very improbable if the tariffs are clearly lawful (P(E | Lawful) is very low). This evidence strongly disfavors the "Tariffs lawful" option.

*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court has granted review on an expedited schedule, with arguments in early November 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This signals the Court sees the issue as urgent and intends to resolve it quickly. This makes a "No 2025 ruling" less likely than it would be on a normal schedule, though not impossible given the late-in-the-year timing. It also makes a procedural "Other ruling" less likely, as the Court would not expedite a case it planned to dismiss.

*   **Evidence:** The research report notes that oral arguments left the impression of a "divided court."
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** A "divided court" is most consistent with a compromise or fractured outcome. This makes a clean sweep for either side ("Lawful" or "Unlawful") less likely and makes a "Mixed ruling" significantly more likely. P(E | Mixed) is high, while P(E | Lawful) and P(E | Unlawful) are lower.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Prior Odds (Lawful vs. Not Lawful):** 30:70.
2.  **Evidence:** The unanimous lower court losses for the government. The likelihood ratio against "Lawful" is very high.
3.  **Update:** The probability of "Tariffs lawful" drops precipitously. Let's say from 30% to 10%. The remaining 90% is distributed among the other options. The different legal theories in the lower courts boost the probability of both "Unlawful" and "Mixed".
    *   *Post-Lower Court Estimate:* P(Lawful) ≈ 10%, P(Unlawful) ≈ 55%, P(Mixed) ≈ 30%.
4.  **Evidence:** The "divided court" report from oral arguments.
5.  **Update:** This evidence pulls probability away from the clean-sweep outcomes ("Lawful", "Unlawful") and pushes it toward the compromise outcome ("Mixed"). "Mixed ruling" now becomes the most likely single option, as it provides a path for a majority coalition on a divided court to resolve the case narrowly by distinguishing between the different tariffs.
    *   *Posterior Estimate:* P(Lawful) decreases slightly more. P(Unlawful) decreases as a clean sweep becomes less certain. P(Mixed) increases to become the plurality favorite.

Finally, we must account for the timing. It is December 17, 2025. While the case is expedited, a ruling in the final two weeks of the year is not guaranteed. A non-trivial probability must be assigned to "No 2025 ruling".

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis leans heavily on the "Mixed ruling" as a classic Roberts Court compromise. A key risk is underestimating the conviction of the conservative majority to issue a landmark MQD or non-delegation ruling. They might see this as the perfect vehicle to state unequivocally that the power to tariff cannot be delegated, leading to a broad "Tariffs unlawful" decision. This scenario is highly plausible and a close competitor to the "Mixed ruling" outcome. Conversely, I might be underestimating the power of national security deference. A 5-4 or 6-3 majority could decide IEEPA is a clear grant of power and the President's emergency declaration is not for the Court to second-guess, making "Tariffs lawful" a tail risk worth more probability. I have slightly increased the probabilities of "Lawful" and "Unlawful" from my initial post-update thoughts to account for these possibilities, while still keeping "Mixed" as the most likely outcome.

### 6. Final Normalization

After weighing the base rates, evidence, and alternative scenarios, the probabilities are adjusted and normalized. The central contest is between "Mixed ruling" and "Tariffs unlawful," with the former having a slight edge due to the institutional dynamics of a divided court and the factual setup of the case. "Tariffs lawful" is a plausible but unlikely outcome. "No 2025 ruling" accounts for the calendar uncertainty.

Tariffs lawful: 12%
Tariffs unlawful: 35%
Mixed ruling: 41%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 10%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
I select the blended reference class from the research report, combining MQD/non-delegation challenges (65-75% unlawful in some form) and presidential authority in national security/foreign affairs (60-70% lawful). This is appropriate because the case pits these two principles against each other: tariffs as a major economic action (MQD favoring unlawful/mixed) vs. emergency powers in foreign commerce (deference favoring lawful). Historical frequencies show the current conservative Court often rules against broad executive interpretations in MQD cases (e.g., West Virginia v. EPA ~100% unlawful on key issue) but upholds in foreign affairs (e.g., Trump v. Hawaii ~100% lawful). Blending these, I start with priors: Tariffs lawful: 25% (leaning toward deference but tempered by MQD skepticism); Tariffs unlawful: 40% (MQD pull); Mixed ruling: 25% (common in divided cases); Other ruling: 5% (rare procedural dodges); No 2025 ruling: 5% (low, given historical speed in expedited cases). This is based on ~20 recent SCOTUS cases in these classes, with moderate confidence (equivalent n=10).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This case is similar to base MQD cases like West Virginia v. EPA, where the Court struck down broad executive actions lacking clear statutory text, as Trump's tariffs involve trillions in economic impact without explicit IEEPA mention of "tariffs." It's also akin to foreign affairs cases like Trump v. Hawaii, where deference upheld executive actions tied to national security (e.g., drug cartels, trade deficits framed as emergencies). Differences: The scope is unprecedented (broad tariffs on allies like Canada/China/Mexico, not just sanctions), blending economic policy with security in a way that blurs lines—making it less purely "foreign affairs" and more vulnerable to MQD scrutiny. These differences matter because the conservative majority prioritizes textualism and separation of powers, potentially overriding deference if tariffs are seen as Congress's domain (Art. I taxing power), shifting odds toward unlawful/mixed over lawful.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- Lower courts ruling against tariffs (two courts, different grounds, affirmed 7-4): High likelihood if unlawful/mixed (P(E|H)=80%, as courts often preview SCOTUS skepticism in MQD cases) vs. moderate if lawful (P(E|~H)=40%, possible but less common in deference cases). This is strong evidence against lawful.
- Oral arguments showing a "divided court": Moderate-high likelihood if mixed (P(E|H)=70%, divisions often lead to compromises) vs. low if fully lawful/unlawful (P(E|~H)=30%, clean wins show unity). Neutral for other/no ruling.
- Expedited schedule and consolidation: High likelihood if ruling in 2025 (P(E|H)=90% for lawful/unlawful/mixed, as speed signals intent to decide) vs. low for no ruling (P(E|~H)=10%). Weak for other.
- National security framing (cartels, drugs): High likelihood if lawful (P(E|H)=80%, fits deference precedent) vs. moderate if unlawful/mixed (P(E|~H)=50%, could be seen as pretextual for reciprocal tariffs).
- MQD/textualism drivers (no explicit tariff power, major economic stakes): High likelihood if unlawful/mixed (P(E|H)=85%) vs. low if lawful (P(E|~H)=25%), as per recent cases.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
Starting with priors: Lawful 25% (odds 1:3), Unlawful 40% (odds 2:3), Mixed 25% (odds 1:3), Other 5% (odds 1:19), No 5% (odds 1:19).

Explicit update for key evidence (lower court rulings against): For lawful, likelihood ratio = P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 40%/60% = 0.67 (avg ~H from other options). Posterior odds = 1:3 * 0.67 ≈ 0.67:3 (17% posterior). For unlawful, LR ≈ 80%/40% = 2; posterior odds = 2:3 * 2 ≈ 4:3 (57% posterior, but will normalize later). Qualitatively, oral arguments' division shifts +10% to mixed (from lawful/unlawful), expedited schedule shifts -4% from no ruling (to mixed/unlawful), security framing shifts +5% to lawful/mixed, MQD drivers shift +5% to unlawful/mixed. Net: Evidence disfavors lawful (down due to courts/MQD), boosts mixed (divisions, multiple challenges), crushes no ruling (expedition), keeps other low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in mixed/unlawful due to recency bias on MQD cases, underweighting deference in true emergencies (e.g., if justices see cartels as existential, lawful could jump). Blind spot: Court's pragmatism might avoid economic chaos via a narrow "other" ruling (e.g., remand). Tail risks: 6-3 lawful if Roberts/Kavanaugh defer (unlikely but ~10% chance), or no ruling if delays (but expedition makes <1%). Best alternative forecast: 40% lawful, 30% mixed, 20% unlawful (heavy deference weight), plausible if foreign affairs dominates, but rebutted by MQD's stronger fit to facts (novel tariff use) and divided arguments signaling no clean win. Adjust: Nudge +3% to lawful, -2% from mixed, +1% to other for tails.

### 6. Final Normalization
Post-updates: Lawful ~20%, Unlawful ~40%, Mixed ~33%, Other ~5%, No ~2%. Normalized to sum 100%: Small proportional adjustments for calibration (distribute uncertainty evenly, per advice: small nudges only).

Tariffs lawful: 20%  
Tariffs unlawful: 40%  
Mixed ruling: 33%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%
