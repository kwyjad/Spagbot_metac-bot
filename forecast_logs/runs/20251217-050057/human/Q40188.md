### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Previous NWS-related border actions (2024-2025):** The most relevant reference class is the temporary block on Mexican cattle imports from late November 2024 to February 2025 due to the same NWS outbreak. This closure lasted approximately three months. Applying this duration to the current suspension (which began in May 2025) would suggest a reopening around August 2025, which has already passed. This indicates the current situation is more severe or complex.
2.  **U.S. agricultural import suspensions for animal diseases:** Historically, U.S. import bans due to significant animal diseases like Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or Foot-and-Mouth Disease can last for years, or even decades. However, NWS is different: it is a pest, not a contagious viral/prion disease, and has a well-established, effective eradication method (Sterile Insect Technique - SIT). This makes long-term bans a poor comparison. A base rate for pest-related, non-systemic disease bans is likely in the range of 6-18 months.
3.  **International pest eradication timelines:** Large-scale SIT programs, from initiation to declaration of eradication in a region, typically take several years. However, the goal here is not full eradication in Mexico, but rather establishing a sufficient buffer zone and demonstrating control to allow trade to resume. The timeline for achieving *sufficient control* is much shorter, likely 6-12 months from the full-scale implementation of countermeasures.

Given these classes, a typical duration for a suspension of this nature might be 3-9 months. The current suspension has already lasted over 7 months, placing it on the longer end of this plausible range.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-05** Article notes a USDA goal of reopening the border by the end of 2025. ↑ — Establishes a stated intention and timeline from a key stakeholder, providing a strong anchor for a "Yes" resolution.
*   **2025-09-21** Mexico confirms an NWS case in Nuevo León, less than 70 miles from the U.S. border. ↓ — Represents a significant failure of containment and a major setback, pushing the perceived risk profile higher and likely extending the timeline for reopening.
*   **2025-09-26** U.S. Agriculture Secretary Rollins criticizes Mexico's handling of the outbreak. ↓ — Signals high-level friction in the bilateral relationship, which could slow down the cooperative efforts necessary for eradication and border reopening.
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary states there is "no time frame for reopening" but is "pleased with Mexico's efforts" and that "every day... we get a little bit closer." ↑ — The "no time frame" is a negative, but the overall tone is one of positive momentum and improving cooperation, suggesting progress since the September friction.
*   **2025-11-13** USDA Secretary leads a major trade mission to Mexico, focusing on NWS. ↑ — High-level diplomatic engagement signals this is a top priority for the U.S. administration, increasing the political will to find a resolution quickly.
*   **2025-11-14** USDA opens a new sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, and is dispersing 100 million flies/week. ↑ (Large) — This is a major operational milestone. It marks the implementation of a key component of the eradication strategy, directly addressing the root cause of the import ban.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Biological Containment & Eradication:** The core driver is the successful suppression of the NWS population near the border. The effectiveness of the SIT program, measured by the number of sterile flies released and a subsequent decline in new cases, is the primary gating factor. (Large)
2.  **Bilateral Cooperation:** The speed and effectiveness of the response depend on seamless U.S.-Mexico cooperation (e.g., flight permissions, data sharing, joint monitoring). Friction slows progress; alignment accelerates it. Recent signs point toward alignment. (Moderate)
3.  **Economic Pressure:** The U.S. beef industry relies on feeder cattle from Mexico (typically over 1 million head annually). This closure creates significant economic pressure on producers in both countries, creating a powerful incentive for officials to resolve the issue. (Moderate)
4.  **USDA/APHIS Bureaucratic Process:** The decision to reopen the border is not just political; it requires the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to certify that the risk is acceptably low. This involves data review, risk assessment, and formal procedures which can be slow and are inherently risk-averse. (Moderate)
5.  **Political Will:** The personal involvement of the USDA Secretary (trade missions, public statements) can accelerate the bureaucratic process and ensure resources are allocated. This appears to be high. (Small-to-Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Established Eradication Technology:** Unlike novel diseases, NWS has a proven "off-the-shelf" solution in the Sterile Insect Technique. The challenge is logistical and financial, not scientific discovery, making a resolution timeline more predictable than for other outbreaks.
*   **High-Level Political Intervention:** The direct and repeated involvement of the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is not typical for all animal health-related trade suspensions. This elevates the issue's priority and suggests a strong push for a faster-than-usual resolution.
*   **Rapid Infrastructure Investment:** The U.S. is making significant and rapid capital investments ($21M, new facilities in both Mexico and Texas) to solve the problem. This level of immediate resource deployment is unusual and signals a commitment to a swift, decisive solution.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The most unusual feature is the question's deadline. With only two weeks remaining in the year, any resolution must overcome not only scientific and bureaucratic hurdles but also the typical slowdown associated with the holiday period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the reference classes might suggest a 6-9 month resolution period is typical. As the ban started in May, this would place the median reopening date around November 2025 - February 2026. A prior of **~40% (n=10)** for a "Yes" before Jan 1, 2026 seems plausible, reflecting that it would be a faster-than-average resolution.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ moderate) September NWS case near the border and U.S. criticism showed the situation was not under control.
    *   (↑ moderate) The explicit USDA goal of reopening by "end of 2025" provides a strong anchor for a positive resolution.
    *   (↑ large) The November trade mission and, most importantly, the opening of the Tampico dispersal facility are concrete, recent, and highly impactful actions that directly address the problem.
    *   (↑ small) The Secretary's optimistic tone in November ("getting closer") reinforces the positive momentum.
*   **Net effect:** The recent, highly positive, and operationally significant evidence from November strongly outweighs the negative evidence from September. The recency-weighting principle is critical here. The update should be a **significant move upward**, though tempered by the extreme shortness of the remaining time.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A joint press release from USDA and its Mexican counterpart (SADER) announcing a specific date for reopening.
    *   Official USDA/APHIS reports confirming a sustained period (e.g., 3-4 weeks) of no new NWS detections in the northern Mexican states.
    *   Statements from U.S. cattle industry groups (e.g., NCBA) indicating they expect a reopening shortly.
    *   Announcement that the new Texas-based dispersal facility is operational ahead of schedule.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any announcement of a new NWS case detected in Nuevo León, Coahuila, or Tamaulipas.
    *   A USDA statement that pushes the expected timeline into "early 2026."
    *   Reports of logistical or operational problems with the sterile fly dispersal from the new Tampico facility.
    *   Silence from all parties through the end of December.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Bureaucratic Lag vs. Holiday Slowdown:** The decision to reopen may be made internally, but the official order and public announcement could be delayed past January 1 due to the Christmas and New Year's holidays, causing a "No" resolution even if the substantive work is complete.
*   **Definition of "Permitted to Resume":** The resolution hinges on the official permission being granted. This is likely a formal notice from APHIS. It does not require a physical shipment of cattle to cross the border before Jan 1, 2026.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The public receives information with a lag. The USDA and Mexican authorities have real-time data on fly trap captures and case reports. The decision will be based on data we do not have.
*   **Political Posturing:** Public statements can be overly optimistic to maintain positive diplomatic relations and manage market expectations. The "end of 2025" goal could have been aspirational rather than a firm commitment.

**Final Research Summary:**
There is very strong positive momentum driven by high-level political will and the recent achievement of a key operational milestone (the new dispersal facility). However, this momentum is racing against an extremely short 14-day timeline, the inherent risk of bureaucratic delay, and the potential for a single new screwworm case to reset the clock.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for reopening cattle imports from Mexico due to pest-related suspensions is informed by historical data on similar situations. The reference class suggests a typical suspension duration of 6-18 months for pest-related issues, with a more specific range of 3-9 months for NWS-related suspensions. Given that the current suspension has lasted over 7 months, a prior probability of reopening before 2026 could be around 40%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a pest (NWS) with a known eradication method (SIT), similar to past cases. The timeline aligns with the longer end of typical suspensions.
   - Differences: The current situation has high-level political involvement and significant resource investment, which are not typical for all cases. These factors could accelerate the resolution process.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **USDA goal of reopening by end of 2025:** This provides a strong anchor for a positive resolution, increasing the likelihood of reopening (↑ moderate).
   - **NWS case in Nuevo León and U.S. criticism:** These represent setbacks, decreasing the likelihood of reopening (↓ moderate).
   - **USDA Secretary's optimistic tone and trade mission:** Indicate positive momentum and political will, increasing the likelihood (↑ small).
   - **Opening of the Tampico dispersal facility:** A major operational milestone that directly addresses the issue, significantly increasing the likelihood (↑ large).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 40% probability translates to odds of 0.67 (40/60).
   - Likelihood ratio: The positive evidence (facility opening, political will) outweighs the negative (recent NWS case), suggesting a likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.67 × 2 (hypothetical ratio) = 1.34.
   - Posterior probability: 1.34 / (1 + 1.34) ≈ 57%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The short timeline and potential bureaucratic delays could lead to overestimating the probability.
   - Alternative scenario: A new NWS case or holiday-related delays could push the reopening into 2026.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of bureaucratic lag and holiday slowdown, slightly reducing confidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the evidence and potential pitfalls, the final probability is adjusted to reflect both the positive momentum and the short timeline challenges.

Final: 55%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on similar import suspensions due to animal health concerns.

The most relevant reference class is the previous NWS-related border closure from November 2024 to February 2025, which lasted approximately 3 months. The current suspension has already lasted over 7 months (May to December 2025), indicating this outbreak is more severe or complex.

For pest-related agricultural import suspensions (as opposed to viral/prion diseases which can last years), typical durations range from 6-18 months when significant control measures are needed. The current suspension falls within this range.

Given that:
- The current suspension has already lasted 7 months
- We're asking about resolution in the next 2 weeks (by January 1, 2026)
- The USDA previously stated a goal of reopening by end of 2025
- Typical pest-control import suspensions of this nature last 6-18 months

I'll set a prior probability of **40%** that the border will reopen before 2026.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical agricultural import suspensions:**
- Involves a known pest with established control methods
- Requires bilateral cooperation between countries
- Subject to formal USDA/APHIS risk assessment procedures
- Creates economic pressure on both sides to resolve quickly

**Key differences:**
- Unusually high political involvement (USDA Secretary directly engaged)
- Rapid and substantial infrastructure investment ($21M in new facilities)
- Established eradication technology (Sterile Insect Technique) with proven effectiveness
- Extremely short time horizon remaining (only 2 weeks until deadline)
- Explicit USDA goal to reopen by end of 2025 (stated in September)

These differences suggest a faster-than-average resolution is possible, but the extremely short remaining timeframe is a significant constraint.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: September NWS case near border and U.S. criticism**
- P(E|H): Moderate - Even if reopening occurs by year-end, we would expect setbacks during the process
- P(E|~H): High - This is exactly what we'd expect to see if the problem remains uncontrolled
- Likelihood ratio: < 1 (moderately negative)
- This evidence decreases probability of reopening by year-end

**Evidence 2: USDA goal of reopening by "end of 2025" (September statement)**
- P(E|H): Very high - This is exactly what we'd expect if reopening will occur
- P(E|~H): Moderate - Goals are sometimes missed, but this is an explicit timeline
- Likelihood ratio: > 1 (moderately positive)
- This evidence increases probability of reopening by year-end

**Evidence 3: November trade mission and opening of Tampico dispersal facility**
- P(E|H): Very high - This is a critical operational milestone directly addressing the problem
- P(E|~H): Low - Such significant investment and progress would be unlikely if reopening wasn't imminent
- Likelihood ratio: >> 1 (strongly positive)
- This evidence significantly increases probability of reopening by year-end

**Evidence 4: Secretary's November statement ("getting closer" but "no timeframe")**
- P(E|H): High - Cautious optimism is consistent with imminent reopening
- P(E|~H): Moderate - Similar language could be used even if reopening is months away
- Likelihood ratio: > 1 (slightly positive)
- This evidence slightly increases probability of reopening by year-end

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 40% (odds of 0.67:1), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on Evidence 3 (most significant):**
- Prior odds: 0.67:1
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 (strongly positive)
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 3 = 2:1
- Posterior probability: 2/(1+2) = 67%

**Adjusting for all other evidence:**
- The September setback (Evidence 1) reduces this somewhat
- The explicit timeline goal (Evidence 2) and cautious optimism (Evidence 4) provide modest positive updates
- Net effect: A small additional increase

This brings my updated probability to approximately **70%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent positive developments (recency bias)
- The holiday period (Christmas/New Year's) could delay bureaucratic processes
- A single new NWS case could reset progress entirely
- The USDA's "end of 2025" goal may have been aspirational rather than realistic

**Alternative forecast (40%):**
The strongest case for a lower probability is the extremely short timeframe remaining. With only two weeks left in the year, including holiday periods, the bureaucratic processes required for formal reopening may simply take longer than available, even if the biological control is successful.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The high-level political involvement and explicit timeline suggest this is a priority that could overcome typical bureaucratic delays. The opening of the dispersal facility is a concrete operational milestone, not just a promise.

**Adjustment:**
Given the extremely short timeframe and holiday period concerns, I should moderate my estimate somewhat. I'll adjust down from 70% to **65%**.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate of similar agricultural import suspensions, the significant recent progress in NWS control efforts, the high-level political engagement, and the explicit USDA goal of reopening by year-end, but tempering this with the extremely short remaining timeframe and holiday period complications:

Final: 65%

```md

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is the reopening of a U.S. agricultural import channel following a suspension due to a pest outbreak. The most relevant reference class is prior pest-related, non-systemic disease suspensions.

*   **Reference Class 1: Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) Suspension (Nov 2024 - Feb 2025).** This lasted approximately three months. The current suspension began in May 2025 and has already lasted over seven months, indicating the current situation is more severe.
*   **Reference Class 2: General Pest-Related Import Suspensions.** These actions, for pests with known eradication methods like NWS (using the Sterile Insect Technique), typically have resolution timelines measured in months, not years. A plausible range for such a suspension is 6 to 18 months.

The current suspension, at over seven months, is within this range. The question asks if it will be resolved before the eight-month mark (by January 1, 2026). A resolution within 8 months would be on the faster side of the 6-18 month range. Therefore, a prior probability slightly below 50% is appropriate.

Let's set the initial prior probability P(H) at **45%**. This reflects that reopening by the end of 2025 is plausible but would represent a quicker-than-average resolution for a serious outbreak. In odds form, this is approximately 0.82-to-1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The underlying cause (NWS) and the technical solution (Sterile Insect Technique) are well-understood from past outbreaks.
*   Significant economic pressure exists from U.S. and Mexican cattle industries, creating a strong incentive for resolution, as is typical in such cases.

**Differences:**
*   **Increased Severity:** The discovery of an NWS case less than 70 miles from the U.S. border in September 2025 suggests a more significant containment challenge than in the 2024 outbreak. This pushes the probability down.
*   **Heightened Political Will:** The direct and repeated involvement of the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, including a trade mission and public statements setting a goal for resolution by the end of 2025, is a significant escalating factor. This level of political intervention can accelerate bureaucratic processes and pushes the probability up.
*   **Massive Resource Deployment:** The U.S. has committed significant funding and rapidly established new infrastructure, including a sterile fly dispersal facility in Mexico. This is a concrete, costly action that signals a much stronger and faster commitment to resolving the issue than a typical "wait and see" approach. This pushes the probability up significantly.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The question resolves in 14 days (from Dec 17, 2025), a period that includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays, when government administrative functions typically slow down. This is a powerful constraint pushing the probability down.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We can evaluate the key evidence clusters since the initial suspension:

*   **Evidence Cluster 1: The September Setback (Negative)**
    *   **Evidence:** An NWS case was confirmed near the U.S. border (Sept 21), and the U.S. Secretary criticized Mexico's handling of the outbreak (Sept 26).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is much more likely if the border remains closed into 2026 (P(E|~H) is high) than if it reopens in 2025 (P(E|H) is low). A major containment failure resets the clock for risk-averse agencies like APHIS, which would want to see a new, sustained period of no detections. This evidence strongly decreases the probability. (Likelihood Ratio << 1).

*   **Evidence Cluster 2: The November Push (Positive)**
    *   **Evidence:** The USDA Secretary led a trade mission (Nov 13), expressed optimism, and, most importantly, opened a new, high-capacity sterile fly dispersal facility in Mexico (Nov 14).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is much more likely if a reopening is imminent (P(E|H) is high). These are the precise actions—diplomatic and operational—one would take to meet an aggressive deadline. This evidence strongly increases the probability. (Likelihood Ratio >> 1).

The November evidence is more recent and represents a direct, massive response to the problems revealed in September. Therefore, it should be weighted more heavily.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the update from our prior.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 45% (Prior Odds ≈ 0.82).
2.  **Update with September Setback:** The border case is a major blow. A risk-averse regulator would typically demand a 60-90 day "clean" period following such an event. This makes a 2025 resolution much harder. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 0.5 to represent this negative update.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.82 * 0.5 = 0.41
    *   Updated Probability ≈ 29%
3.  **Update with November Push:** The high-level political will and, crucially, the operational facility launch are powerful counter-signals. This shows maximum effort is being applied to meet the "end of 2025" goal. This evidence makes a rapid resolution much more likely than it was after the September news. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 2.0.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.41 * 2.0 = 0.82
    *   Updated Probability ≈ 45%

This calculation suggests the strong positive and negative news have roughly cancelled each other out, returning us to our prior. However, we must now account for the final, critical piece of evidence: the imminent deadline. The question is not just whether the biological conditions are met, but whether the official permission will be granted in the next 14 days, which includes the holidays. This acts as a final, negative filter. The bureaucratic process for lifting such a ban requires data review and formal sign-offs, which are subject to delay. This hurdle reduces the probability of a "Yes" resolution. A reasonable discount for this procedural friction during a holiday period is to reduce the probability by a few percentage points.

*   Final Adjustment: 45% -> 40%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
A key vulnerability in this forecast is underestimating the power of political will. The USDA Secretary has publicly anchored to an "end of 2025" timeline and has expended significant political capital. He may force the bureaucracy to accept a shorter-than-usual data window (e.g., 30 days from the new facility's opening) to declare victory. The economic pressure from the U.S. cattle industry provides a strong tailwind for this aggressive approach. An alternative forecast of 60% could be justified if one believes this top-down pressure is the single most decisive factor.

However, the rebuttal is that APHIS has a strong institutional mandate for biosecurity and is famously risk-averse. The September case was a genuine threat to the U.S. cattle industry. Forcing a premature reopening that results in an NWS outbreak in Texas would be a catastrophic failure. Therefore, the scientific and bureaucratic process will likely demand a sufficient data buffer (e.g., 60-90 days of clean results post-intervention), pushing the most probable timeline into January 2026. The Secretary's "no time frame" comment on November 4 could be seen as him giving himself an off-ramp for this very reason. The structural barriers of bureaucracy and the holiday slowdown favor a "No" resolution.

The 40% forecast balances these competing forces, acknowledging the significant chance of a politically-driven "Yes" while leaning towards the more probable outcome of a slight delay into early 2026.

### 6. Final Forecast
The forecast balances strong, recent positive momentum (high-level political will, major operational investment) against significant structural barriers (the fallout from a September containment failure, bureaucratic risk aversion, and an extremely short holiday-season timeline). While the political push for a 2025 resolution is substantial, the procedural and scientific caution of the regulatory agencies will most likely push the official reopening into early 2026.

Final: 40%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event comes from historical U.S. agricultural import suspensions related to animal pests or diseases, particularly those involving non-systemic issues like New World screwworm (NWS). From the research report, previous NWS-related closures (e.g., late 2024 to February 2025) lasted about 3 months, while broader pest-related bans typically range from 6-18 months, with a more specific estimate for sufficient control being 6-12 months. Given the current suspension started in May 2025 and has already lasted over 7 months, this places it in the middle-to-upper end of typical durations.

A narrower reference class is U.S.-Mexico trade suspensions for controllable pests, where resolutions often occur within 3-9 months once countermeasures are in place. Historical examples include short-term halts for fruit flies or other insects resolved via sterile insect techniques (SIT), with about 40-50% resolving in under 9 months from onset. Adjusting for the fact that we're now 7+ months in and asking about resolution in the next 14 days (before 2026), a base rate of ~35% seems reasonable—drawing from the report's suggested prior of ~40% but slightly discounted for the extremely short remaining window and historical tendencies for bureaucratic delays near year-end. In odds form: 35% probability = odds of about 0.54:1 (prior odds = P(H)/(1-P(H)) = 0.35/0.65 ≈ 0.54).

I chose this base rate because it anchors on empirical data from similar pest outbreaks (e.g., NWS in 2024, other SIT programs), avoiding overgeneralization to longer-term viral disease bans like BSE, which are less comparable due to NWS's established eradication methods.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case (e.g., the 2024 NWS closure) in that it involves the same pest, the same bilateral U.S.-Mexico dynamic, and reliance on SIT for control—leading to a temporary suspension resolved via cooperative eradication efforts. Both cases saw initial detections, containment challenges, and eventual progress through sterile fly releases.

However, differences include: (1) The current outbreak has proven more persistent, with a setback in September 2025 (new case near the border) extending beyond the 3-month 2024 resolution, suggesting greater complexity or slower initial response. (2) There's unusually high political involvement now, with USDA Secretary-led trade missions and rapid infrastructure investments (e.g., new Tampico facility dispersing 100M flies/week), which weren't as prominent in prior cases—this could accelerate resolution. (3) Economic pressures are similar, but the extremely short horizon (14 days left) differs from base cases, where resolutions weren't constrained by year-end holidays, potentially introducing delays. These differences matter: positive factors (political will, operational milestones) could shorten the timeline below the base rate, while the short window and potential for holiday/bureaucratic lag could extend it, warranting an upward adjustment from the prior but with caution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Key pieces of evidence from the report, evaluated with likelihood ratios (qualitative where data is sparse):

- **September 2025 NWS case near border and U.S. criticism (↓ moderate):** This is more likely if control is insufficient (~H, P(E|~H) high, say 0.8) than if it's on track for quick resolution (H, P(E|H) lower, say 0.3). Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.3/0.8 = 0.375 (strongly decreases probability, as it signals setbacks).
  
- **USDA goal of reopening by end of 2025 (↑ moderate):** More likely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 0.7, as agencies set achievable goals) than ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 0.3, goals might be aspirational). Ratio ≈ 0.7/0.3 ≈ 2.33 (increases probability).

- **November 2025 trade mission and optimistic statements (↑ moderate):** Likely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 0.6, signals momentum) vs. ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 0.2, less engagement if stalled). Ratio ≈ 0.6/0.2 = 3 (increases probability).

- **Opening of Tampico dispersal facility (↑ large):** Highly likely under H (P(E|H) ≈ 0.9, direct action toward resolution) vs. ~H (P(E|~H) ≈ 0.4, slower rollout if not prioritizing). Ratio ≈ 0.9/0.4 = 2.25 (strongly increases probability, as it's a concrete milestone addressing the core issue).

Net: Early negative evidence decreases odds, but recent positive evidence (especially operational) outweighs it due to recency and direct relevance, leading to an overall upward adjustment.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior probability P(H) = 35% (prior odds = 0.35 / 0.65 ≈ 0.538).

Group evidence into two updates for simplicity: (1) September setbacks (combined LR ≈ 0.4, conservative aggregate for negatives), (2) November positives (combined LR ≈ 4, weighting the facility heavily).

First update (September evidence): Posterior odds = 0.538 × 0.4 ≈ 0.215. Posterior P = 0.215 / (1 + 0.215) ≈ 18%.

Second update (November evidence): Posterior odds = 0.215 × 4 ≈ 0.86. Posterior P = 0.86 / (1 + 0.86) ≈ 46%.

This reflects a net upward shift from the prior, driven by recent momentum, but tempered by the short timeline. The resulting posterior is ~46%, with moderate uncertainty due to potential unseen data (e.g., real-time case reports) and holiday delays—confidence interval roughly 30-60%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the upward update, as the 46% assumes recent positives will translate to action within 14 days, potentially overlooking bureaucratic inertia or a "holiday slowdown" pitfall noted in the report—e.g., even if control is achieved, announcements could slip into 2026. Blind spots include information asymmetry: public data lags behind USDA's internal metrics, so I might be underestimating ongoing risks like undetected cases.

Alternative scenarios: A more pessimistic forecast (e.g., 20%) could argue that the September setback reset the clock, and with only 14 days left, any single new case (tail risk ~10-20% probability) would doom resolution—plausible given NWS's resurgence history. Rebuttal: The new facility's scale (100M flies/week) makes rapid suppression more feasible than in base cases, and high political will reduces lag risks. An optimistic alternative (70%) might overweigh the USDA's "end of 2025" goal as binding, but rebuttal: such statements can be posturing, and the "no time frame" comment tempers this.

To account for tails (e.g., 5% chance of sudden resolution via emergency waiver, 15% chance of new case delay), I nudge down slightly to 42% for calibration, ensuring small evidence-weighted updates per guidance.

Final: 42%
