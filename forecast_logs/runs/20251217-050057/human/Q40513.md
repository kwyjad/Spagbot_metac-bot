### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Post-Election ("Lame-Duck") Sessions with a CR.** In modern history, when Congress passes a Continuing Resolution (CR) that funds the government past the Christmas holiday and into the new year, they typically do not pass additional individual appropriations bills in the interim period (between CR passage and Dec 31). The CR itself is the "deal" that allows members to leave Washington. **Base Rate: ~0-1 additional bills enacted before Jan 1.** This is the most relevant class.
-   **Reference Class 2: All Appropriations Cycles (since FY1998).** In the modern, polarized era, it is common for appropriations to be completed late. However, the final bills are almost always enacted in large packages (omnibus or minibus) right before a funding deadline. In years where a CR is used, the final package is typically passed just before that CR expires. **Base Rate: Very low (<10% chance) for any bills to be enacted in a two-week holiday window without a hard deadline.**
-   **Limitations:** The provided background describes a unique scenario: a post-shutdown environment where a partial deal (3 bills + CR) has already been struck. This differs from a standard pre-holiday CR negotiation, potentially altering leadership incentives.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-08] Congress passes a CR funding most agencies through Jan 30, 2026. — ↓↓↓ — This is the most significant development. It removes the primary driver for legislative action—a funding cliff—before January 1, pushing the new deadline to late January.
-   [2025-11-08] President signs a "minibus" package enacting three FY2026 bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA). — ↓ — This action "cleared the deck" of the least controversial bills. The nine remaining bills are likely to be significantly more difficult to negotiate, making a quick deal less probable.
-   [2025-11-05] The month-long government shutdown ends. — ↓ — While creating pressure to govern, the immediate effect is likely legislative exhaustion and a desire to avoid another high-stakes negotiation so soon, especially before the holidays.
-   [2025-09-30] FY2025 ends, FY2026 begins without any appropriations bills enacted. — (neutral) — This set the stage for the shutdown and subsequent CR, but the CR is the more proximate and influential event for this forecast.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Deadlines (Large):** The expiration of a CR is the single most powerful forcing mechanism for appropriations. The current CR expires Jan 30, 2026, making a pre-Jan 1 deadline non-existent.
-   **Holiday Recess (Large):** There is immense social and political pressure for Congress to adjourn for the Christmas and New Year's holidays. It is exceptionally rare for major, new legislative packages to be negotiated and passed in the last two weeks of December once members have left Washington.
-   **Bundling (Minibus/Omnibus) (Moderate):** The remaining nine bills will almost certainly be bundled into one or more packages ("minibuses" or an "omnibus"). Drafting and negotiating the legislative text for such a package is a complex process that typically takes weeks, not days, making it infeasible before Jan 1.
-   **Political Will & Leadership Priorities (Moderate):** Congressional leaders might desire to show progress by passing another small package. However, the recent shutdown indicates deep divisions, and the path of least resistance is to use the time afforded by the CR and address the remaining bills in January.
-   **Contentiousness of Remaining Bills (Moderate):** The three enacted bills are often the easiest to pass. The remaining nine include the most controversial bills, such as Defense, Labor-HHS, and Homeland Security, which involve major partisan disagreements over funding levels and policy riders.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Post-Shutdown Environment:** Unlike a typical CR negotiation, this one follows a long and damaging shutdown. This could create "deal fatigue" and lower trust, making new negotiations harder. Conversely, it could increase the desire to avoid brinkmanship, but the January deadline allows for that.
-   **"Easy" Bills Already Passed:** The reference class often involves negotiations on all 12 bills. Here, the three least controversial are already law. This concentrates all remaining political conflict into the outstanding nine bills, making any potential new package highly contentious and difficult to assemble quickly.
-   **Clear January Deadline:** The CR has a firm date of January 30. This provides congressional leaders and appropriators with a clear, albeit deferred, target. All energy and planning will be oriented toward this January deadline, not an arbitrary end-of-year goal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior anchored on the base rate of 0 additional bills being passed, given a CR is in place until late January. The "equivalent n" is high, as this is a very regular pattern in modern congressional behavior.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓↓↓) CR extends to Jan 30: Massively reinforces the prior. Removes the primary mechanism (deadline).
    -   (↓↓) Holiday Recess: Strongly reinforces the prior. Congress is not structured to work efficiently during this period.
    -   (↓) "Easy" bills already done: Reinforces the prior. The remaining work is the hardest part, requiring more time than is available.
    -   (↓) Post-shutdown fatigue: Reinforces the prior. Low appetite for another immediate, high-stakes negotiation.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly confirms the strong prior. The posterior distribution should be very heavily concentrated on 0 additional bills, meaning the final resolved number will be 3.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (signals more bills might pass):**
    -   "Four Corners" (House/Senate, R/D leaders) announce a formal agreement on spending toplines for the remaining 9 bills.
    -   Appropriations Committee chairs announce the release of text for a new minibus or omnibus package.
    -   House Rules Committee schedules a hearing for an appropriations package.
    -   Leadership cancels or postpones the holiday recess, keeping members in Washington for votes.
-   **DOWN indicators (signals no more bills will pass):**
    -   House and Senate formally adjourn for the holiday recess.
    -   Leadership statements focus exclusively on plans for negotiations in "early January."
    -   Staff-level talks are reported, but no principal-level (member) meetings occur.
    -   Members and leaders leave Washington D.C. for their districts/states.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Surprise "Christmas Tree" Bill:** A non-zero risk exists that leaders could attach a few of the less-controversial remaining bills to a must-pass emergency supplemental or other vehicle, but this is unlikely.
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires the bill to be "enacted" (i.e., signed by the President) before Jan 1, 2026. Even if Congress passed a bill on Dec 31, logistical delays (enrollment, presidential signature) could push enactment past the deadline.
-   **Unforeseen Crisis:** A major domestic or international crisis could force Congress to act, potentially creating a legislative vehicle to which appropriations could be attached.
-   **Misinterpreting Progress:** Reports of "progress" in staff-level talks are common but often do not translate into imminent legislative action. Action by principals (committee chairs, party leaders) is the key signal.

**Final Research Summary:** Three of twelve bills are already law. With a continuing resolution funding the government until January 30, 2026, and Congress entering a holiday recess, there is no deadline or political incentive to enact any of the nine remaining, more-contentious bills before the new year. The probability of any additional bills being enacted by December 31 is extremely low.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is "Post-Election ('Lame-Duck') Sessions with a CR," where typically 0-1 additional bills are enacted before January 1. This is due to the absence of a hard deadline and the tendency for Congress to adjourn for the holidays once a CR is in place.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean is approximately 0.5 bills, with a low variance given the strong historical pattern of inaction during this period.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation aligns with the base case as a CR is in place until January 30, 2026, removing immediate pressure to pass additional bills.
   - **Difference:** The post-shutdown environment and the fact that three bills have already been enacted could slightly alter dynamics, but these factors are unlikely to significantly change the outcome before January 1.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR until Jan 30:** Strongly supports the prior of 0 additional bills, as it removes urgency (likelihood ratio heavily favors 0 bills).
   - **Holiday Recess:** Reinforces the prior, as Congress typically does not pass significant legislation during this period (likelihood ratio favors 0 bills).
   - **"Easy" Bills Passed:** Suggests remaining bills are more contentious, supporting the prior of no additional bills (likelihood ratio favors 0 bills).
   - **Post-shutdown Fatigue:** Further supports the prior, as Congress is likely to avoid another immediate negotiation (likelihood ratio favors 0 bills).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Start with a prior centered on 0 bills. The evidence overwhelmingly supports this prior, leading to a posterior distribution that remains heavily concentrated on 0 additional bills.
   - **Shift:** The posterior mean remains close to 0, with a slight possibility of 1 bill due to minor uncertainties.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the small risk of a "Christmas Tree" bill or an unforeseen crisis that could lead to additional bills being enacted.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A scenario where leadership decides to push through a small package for political reasons, though unlikely, should be considered.
   - **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, slightly increase the probability of 1 bill being enacted, but maintain a strong focus on 0.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the percentiles are heavily skewed towards 0 additional bills, with a small probability of 1 bill.

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 0  
P60: 0  
P80: 0  
P90: 1

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two key reference classes:

**Primary Reference Class**: Post-shutdown appropriations cycles with a CR extending into the next calendar year
- In these situations, Congress typically does not pass additional appropriations bills during the period between CR passage and the end of the calendar year
- Base rate: 0-1 additional bills enacted before January 1 (beyond what's already passed)
- Mean/median: ~0 additional bills
- Variance: Very low (almost always 0)

**Secondary Reference Class**: All appropriations cycles since FY1998 (modern polarized era)
- When CRs extend past the holidays, additional bills are rarely enacted before the CR deadline
- Base rate: <10% chance of any bills being enacted in a holiday window without a deadline
- Mean/median: 0 additional bills during holiday periods with a CR in place
- Variance: Low

I'm choosing these reference classes because they directly address the specific situation: a post-shutdown environment with a CR extending well past the new year, and with Congress entering the holiday period.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class**:
- A CR is in place extending well beyond January 1 (to January 30, 2026)
- Congress is entering the holiday recess period
- The most contentious appropriations bills remain unresolved
- There is no immediate deadline forcing action

**Differences from reference class**:
- This follows an unusually long government shutdown
- 3 of the 12 bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA)
- The remaining 9 bills include the most politically contentious ones
- The post-shutdown environment might create different political dynamics

These differences don't fundamentally alter the base rate expectation. If anything, the fact that the "easy" bills are already passed makes it less likely that additional bills will be enacted before January 1.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence strongly against additional bills being enacted**:
- The CR extends to January 30, 2026, removing any deadline pressure (likelihood ratio ~0.1:1 for additional bills)
- The three least controversial bills have already been enacted, leaving only the more contentious ones (likelihood ratio ~0.3:1)
- Congress typically enters recess for the holidays, with minimal legislative activity in late December (likelihood ratio ~0.2:1)
- Post-shutdown "deal fatigue" likely reduces appetite for immediate negotiations (likelihood ratio ~0.5:1)

**Evidence potentially supporting additional bills being enacted**:
- Post-shutdown pressure to demonstrate governance capability (likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- Potential desire to clear the decks before the new year (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)

The combined likelihood ratio heavily favors the hypothesis of no additional bills being enacted (net likelihood ratio approximately 0.03:1).

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered strongly on 0 additional bills (beyond the 3 already enacted):
- Prior: P(0 additional) = 0.9, P(1-2 additional) = 0.09, P(3+ additional) = 0.01
- Likelihood ratio for evidence: ~0.03:1 against additional bills

Applying Bayes' rule:
- Posterior P(0 additional) = (0.9 × 1) / [(0.9 × 1) + (0.1 × 0.03)] ≈ 0.99
- Posterior P(1+ additional) ≈ 0.01

The posterior distribution is even more concentrated on 0 additional bills than the prior, with the mean shifting from ~0.1 additional bills to ~0.01 additional bills.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a surprise legislative vehicle (emergency supplemental, etc.) that could carry some appropriations bills
- There could be behind-the-scenes negotiations I'm not accounting for
- The post-shutdown dynamics might create unusual incentives for quick action

**Alternative scenario**:
- Congressional leadership might want to demonstrate productivity after the shutdown by passing a "mini-minibus" with 1-2 additional bills
- However, this would require overcoming significant logistical hurdles during the holiday period
- Even if attempted, the most likely outcome would be preparation for January action, not December enactment

**Tail risks**:
- An unforeseen national security or economic crisis could force emergency legislative action
- Such a vehicle could potentially carry additional appropriations bills

After consideration, I'll slightly adjust my distribution to account for these low-probability scenarios, but the overwhelming evidence still points to 0 additional bills being enacted.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given that 3 bills have already been enacted, and the question asks for the total number enacted before 2026, my distribution is:

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the total number of FY2026 appropriations bills enacted by January 1, 2026. We know that 3 of the 12 bills have already been enacted. The core question is how many *additional* bills will be enacted in the remainder of December 2025.

The most appropriate reference class is the historical behavior of the U.S. Congress in the final weeks of a calendar year after a Continuing Resolution (CR) has been passed that funds the government into the next year.

*   **Reference Class:** Lame-duck congressional sessions between the passage of a CR and the end of the year.
*   **Base Rate:** In this scenario, Congress almost never enacts additional regular appropriations bills. The CR serves as the "deal" that allows members to leave Washington for the holiday recess. The forcing mechanism of a funding deadline is removed. Therefore, the base rate for *additional* bills enacted in this period is extremely close to 0.
*   **Prior Distribution:** My prior distribution for the *total* number of enacted bills is thus very strongly peaked at the current number, 3. I would place a high probability (>90%) on the number remaining at 3, with a small probability of it increasing to 4 or more.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns almost perfectly with the base case and is, in some ways, an even stronger example of it.

*   **Similarities:** A CR is in place, pushing the next funding deadline to January 30, 2026. This removes any urgency to act before December 31. It is mid-December, and the powerful incentive for members to be in their home districts for the holidays is in full effect.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Post-Shutdown Environment:** The recent month-long shutdown likely created legislative exhaustion and "deal fatigue," making leaders and members less inclined to immediately enter another high-stakes negotiation. This strengthens the case for inaction.
    *   **"Easy" Bills Already Passed:** The three bills already enacted are typically among the least controversial. The nine remaining bills (including Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security) are the most difficult and contentious. This makes assembling a new package before year-end significantly harder than in a typical year, where easier bills could be bundled to build momentum.

These differences reinforce the base rate conclusion: inaction is the most likely path.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Each major piece of evidence strongly suggests that no additional bills will be enacted.

*   **CR to Jan 30, 2026 (Strongly Downward Pressure):** This is the most critical fact. It removes the primary driver of legislative action: a funding cliff. This evidence makes the outcome of "0 additional bills" vastly more likely than any other outcome.
*   **Imminent Holiday Recess (Strongly Downward Pressure):** Congress is not structured to negotiate, draft, and pass major, complex legislation in the last two weeks of December. The political and social pressure to adjourn is immense.
*   **Contentiousness of Remaining Bills (Downward Pressure):** The remaining work is the hardest part of the appropriations process. Reaching a compromise on any of the nine remaining bills, let alone a package of them, would require weeks of intense negotiation, not a few days before a holiday.

All available evidence points in the same direction, strongly confirming the prior belief.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A strong belief that the final number will be 3, based on the historical pattern of congressional inaction after a CR is passed.
*   **Likelihoods:** All key evidence (the Jan 30 CR deadline, the holiday schedule, the difficulty of the remaining bills) makes the "no more bills" scenario highly probable and alternative scenarios highly improbable.
*   **Posterior:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. My posterior distribution is even more sharply concentrated at 3 than my prior was. The probability of the total number of enacted bills being exactly 3 is very high, likely in the 95-99% range. The mean, median, and mode of my posterior distribution are all 3.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where I am wrong.

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: Surprise "Christmas Miracle" Deal.** Congressional leaders, wanting to demonstrate an ability to govern after the damaging shutdown, could force a deal on a "minibus" package of 2-3 of the next least-controversial bills.
*   **Rebuttal:** This is highly unlikely. The logistics of drafting text, holding votes, and enrolling a bill during the holiday recess are prohibitive. The political will is absent, as the CR has already provided the necessary breathing room.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Unrelated Must-Pass Vehicle.** A national emergency (e.g., a major natural disaster) could require Congress to pass a supplemental funding bill, to which leaders might attach another appropriations bill.
*   **Rebuttal:** This is a plausible but very low-probability tail risk. It depends on an external, unpredictable event. While this prevents me from being 100% certain, it's a small enough chance that it shouldn't shift the core of my distribution.

My confidence is very high, but the possibility of a surprise, while remote, means the probability of the outcome being greater than 3 is not absolute zero. However, I assess this probability to be well under 10%. Therefore, my 90th percentile should not be higher than 3. Since 3 bills are already enacted, the number cannot be lower than 3.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My distribution is tightly packed around 3. The floor is 3, as that many bills are already law. The probability of any additional bills passing before January 1 is extremely low, certainly less than 10%. This means all percentiles from P10 to P90 should be 3.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3
