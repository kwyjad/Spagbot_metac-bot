### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Ligue 1 seasons in the QSI era (2011-12 to 2024-25):** In the 14 seasons since the Qatari acquisition, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has been the dominant force. They have been leading at the midpoint (or Christmas break, a close proxy) in approximately 11 of these 14 seasons (~78%). This class is highly relevant due to the stable financial disparity.
2.  **Ligue 1 leader after 13 matchdays:** Historically, the team leading Ligue 1 after 13 matches has a very high probability of also leading at the midpoint (approx. matchday 19). This is a short-term forecast, and league positions are sticky. The base rate for the matchday 13 leader still being the leader at matchday 19 is likely in the 70-80% range. PSG is currently the leader.
3.  **Highly competitive Ligue 1 seasons:** The background notes the current season is the "most disputed since the 2010-2011 season." In such seasons, where the top teams are separated by very few points, the leader's position is less stable. In these outlier seasons, the probability of the matchday 13 leader holding their position until the midpoint might drop to 50-60%.

**Reasoning:** The most appropriate reference class is the QSI era, establishing a strong prior for PSG. However, the current season's competitiveness, as explicitly stated in the background, suggests we should temper this with the base rate from more volatile seasons.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-17** PSG begins the 2025-26 campaign. → **(Neutral)** The start of the season, setting the stage for the current standings.
*   **2025-11-30 (approx.)** After 13 matchdays, PSG leads but by only one point over Marseille and two over Lens. ↓ **(for PSG)** This is the core piece of new evidence. It shows a significant erosion of PSG's typical domestic dominance and establishes credible challengers.
*   **2025-12-16** PSG players and coach dominate FIFA's "The Best" awards. ↑ **(for PSG)** Reinforces the underlying world-class talent and coaching at the club, suggesting they have the quality to overcome their current slump and pull away.
*   **2025-12-17 (Today)** The background confirms PSG has already lost once and drawn three times, a worse record than their entire previous season. ↓ **(for PSG)** This quantifies their relative underperformance and suggests a systemic issue this season, not just bad luck.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Financial Disparity & Squad Depth:** PSG's budget allows them to field a team with world-class talent in nearly every position and maintain quality even with injuries or rotation. This is the primary driver of their long-term dominance. **(Large effect)**
2.  **Fixture Congestion & Competing Priorities:** PSG's participation in the Champions League (and other cups, per sources) creates fixture congestion. The background's premise that they are focused on a "back-to-back European title" could lead to squad rotation and dropped points in the league. **(Moderate effect)**
3.  **Challenger Overperformance:** Marseille and Lens are currently performing at an exceptionally high level to keep pace with PSG. The sustainability of this form, especially for teams with less depth, is a key variable. **(Moderate effect)**
4.  **Managerial Strategy:** Luis Enrique's tactical decisions, particularly how he manages squad rotation to balance European and domestic ambitions, will be critical in the short run of games before the midpoint. **(Moderate effect)**
5.  **Key Player Form/Availability:** An injury to a star player at PSG (e.g., Dembélé) or at a challenger club could significantly alter the point trajectory of the respective team over the next few matches. **(Small to Moderate effect)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Competition:** The primary difference is the proximity of challengers. In most QSI-era seasons (the base rate), PSG often has a comfortable lead by this stage. A one-point gap is a significant anomaly.
*   **Explicit Narrative of Shifted Priorities:** The background introduces a specific causal story—a post-Champions League victory hangover and focus on repeating—that is not present in prior seasons. This provides a reason for their relative underperformance.
*   **PSG's Defensive Frailty/Inconsistency:** The number of draws and a loss this early is uncharacteristic. It points to a potential vulnerability that is greater than in typical seasons from the reference class.
*   **Strength of Specific Challengers:** While teams like Monaco or Lyon have challenged PSG in the past, the current strength of both Marseille and Lens simultaneously creates a more complex competitive dynamic than a single-challenger race.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior based on the QSI-era reference class, placing PSG's probability of leading at the midpoint around 80% (equivalent n of ~10-12 seasons).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ **(Large):** The current league table showing a 1-point lead is the strongest piece of evidence against the prior. It dramatically increases the probability for Marseille and Lens.
    *   ↓ **(Moderate):** PSG's record of dropped points (1L, 3D) provides concrete data supporting the narrative of their vulnerability.
    *   ↓ **(Small):** The narrative of a "Champions League focus" provides a plausible mechanism for the underperformance, slightly reducing PSG's odds.
    *   ↑ **(Small):** The recent FIFA awards serve as a countervailing piece of evidence, reminding us of PSG's immense underlying talent pool, which could correct their course at any moment.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the prior is too high. The posterior for PSG should move down significantly, perhaps into the 55-65% range. The probabilities for Marseille and Lens should be elevated from near-zero to meaningful chances.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for PSG leading):**
    *   PSG wins its next 2-3 league matches before the winter break, especially if by convincing margins.
    *   Marseille or Lens drop points in an "easy" fixture.
    *   Reports of key players returning from injury for PSG or getting injured/suspended for Marseille/Lens.
    *   Luis Enrique fields a full-strength squad for league matches, signaling a re-focus on domestic competition.
*   **DOWN indicators (for PSG leading):**
    *   PSG draws or loses any of its remaining league games before Jan 5.
    *   Marseille and Lens both continue their winning form.
    *   Media reports emphasizing squad rotation for PSG in Ligue 1 to rest players for upcoming Champions League knockout stages.
    *   Any signs of internal friction or player discontent at PSG.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Narrative vs. Reality:** The "Champions League focus" is a compelling story but may not be the true cause of PSG's form. The dip could be random variance or a temporary tactical issue.
*   **Small Sample Size:** The forecast is based on only 13 matches. Form can be volatile, and a short run of results before the resolution date could dramatically shift the standings.
*   **Data Gaps:** We lack information on the specific upcoming fixtures for the three teams before January 5th. A difficult run for one team could be decisive.
*   **Resolution Window:** The resolution date of Jan 5, 2026, is immediately after the typical winter break. The result of the first match back in January could be what determines the leader.
*   **"Another team" Option:** While the race currently appears to be among three teams, a club like Monaco or Lyon could be just behind and go on a perfect run, though this is a low-probability outcome.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate strongly favors PSG due to a decade of financial and sporting dominance. However, current evidence from the first 13 matchdays shows an anomalously competitive season, with PSG's lead being minimal and their performance below their own high standards, making this a much more uncertain forecast than in a typical year.

To forecast which club will be the leader of Ligue 1 at the midpoint of the 2025-2026 season, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Paris Saint-Germain (PSG):** Historically, PSG has led at the midpoint in approximately 78% of seasons since the Qatari acquisition. This is a strong prior due to their financial and sporting dominance.
- **Marseille:** Historically, Marseille has not been a frequent leader at the midpoint, but they are currently only one point behind PSG. A reasonable prior might be around 10%, reflecting their competitive position.
- **Lens:** Similar to Marseille, Lens is only two points behind PSG. A prior of around 5% seems reasonable, given their current proximity to the top.
- **Another team:** Historically, other teams have occasionally led at the midpoint, but given the current standings, this is less likely. A prior of around 7% accounts for the possibility of a surprise leader.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to the base rate scenario in that PSG is leading, albeit by a smaller margin than usual.
- **Difference:** The key difference is the unprecedented competition, with PSG's lead being minimal and their performance below their usual standards. This suggests a more volatile situation than in typical seasons.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **PSG's Current Lead:** PSG's one-point lead is a significant piece of evidence against their usual dominance, suggesting a higher likelihood of another team leading at the midpoint.
- **PSG's Underperformance:** Their record of one loss and three draws indicates vulnerability, reducing the likelihood of them maintaining their lead.
- **Marseille and Lens' Proximity:** The close proximity of Marseille and Lens increases the likelihood of one of them overtaking PSG.
- **PSG's Talent and Awards:** The recent FIFA awards highlight PSG's underlying talent, which could help them maintain their lead.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **PSG:** Start with a prior of 78%. The evidence of their current lead and talent supports this, but their underperformance and close competition reduce it. Adjust to around 60%.
- **Marseille:** Start with a prior of 10%. Their proximity to PSG and PSG's underperformance increase their likelihood. Adjust to around 20%.
- **Lens:** Start with a prior of 5%. Similar reasoning to Marseille, adjust to around 15%.
- **Another team:** Start with a prior of 7%. The current standings make this less likely, adjust to around 5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** Ensure not to overestimate PSG's chances given the competitive season.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a surprise leader emerging, though less likely.
- **Rebuttals:** PSG's talent and historical dominance could still prevail, but the current evidence suggests a more competitive race.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Paris Saint-Germain: 60%  
Marseille: 20%  
Lens: 15%  
Another team: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the current competitive nature of the season, with PSG still favored but facing significant challenges.

# Forecasting Ligue 1 Leader at Midpoint of 2025-2026 Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Paris Saint-Germain (PSG):**
- In the Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) era (2011-present), PSG has led at midseason in approximately 11 of 14 seasons (~78%).
- PSG is currently leading the table after 13 matchdays.
- Prior probability: 78%

**Marseille:**
- Historically one of France's most successful clubs but has rarely led at midseason during the QSI era.
- Currently only 1 point behind PSG.
- Prior probability: 8%

**Lens:**
- Has occasionally challenged but rarely led at midseason in recent years.
- Currently 2 points behind PSG.
- Prior probability: 5%

**Another team:**
- This includes all other Ligue 1 teams (Monaco, Lyon, etc.)
- Collectively, these teams have led at midseason in ~3 of 14 seasons in the QSI era.
- Prior probability: 9%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- PSG still maintains financial dominance over other Ligue 1 clubs.
- PSG is currently leading the table, consistent with their historical pattern.
- The structural advantages (squad depth, financial resources) remain intact.

**Key differences:**
- This season is described as "the most disputed since the 2010-2011 season" with unusually close competition.
- PSG has already lost once and drawn three times, which is worse than their entire previous season.
- PSG's focus appears to have shifted toward Champions League retention rather than domestic dominance.
- The gap between PSG and challengers (1-2 points) is much smaller than typical at this stage.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: PSG leads by only 1 point after 13 matchdays**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint) = Moderate (~50%)
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint) = High (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63 (negative for PSG)

**Evidence 2: PSG has already lost once and drawn three times**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint) = Low-Moderate (~40%)
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint) = High (~75%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.53 (negative for PSG)

**Evidence 3: PSG's focus on Champions League**
- P(E|PSG leads at midpoint) = Moderate (~60%)
- P(E|PSG doesn't lead at midpoint) = High (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (negative for PSG)

**Evidence 4: Marseille's strong performance (1 point behind)**
- P(E|Marseille leads at midpoint) = High (~70%)
- P(E|Marseille doesn't lead at midpoint) = Moderate (~40%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75 (positive for Marseille)

**Evidence 5: Lens's strong performance (2 points behind)**
- P(E|Lens leads at midpoint) = Moderate-High (~65%)
- P(E|Lens doesn't lead at midpoint) = Moderate (~45%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.44 (positive for Lens)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**For PSG:**
- Prior odds: 78/22 = 3.55
- Posterior odds after Evidence 1: 3.55 × 0.63 = 2.24
- Posterior probability: 2.24/(1+2.24) = 69%
- After incorporating all evidence: ~58%

**For Marseille:**
- Prior odds: 8/92 = 0.087
- Posterior odds after Evidence 4: 0.087 × 1.75 = 0.152
- Posterior probability: 0.152/(1+0.152) = 13.2%
- After incorporating all evidence: ~22%

**For Lens:**
- Prior odds: 5/95 = 0.053
- Posterior odds after Evidence 5: 0.053 × 1.44 = 0.076
- Posterior probability: 0.076/(1+0.076) = 7.1%
- After incorporating all evidence: ~14%

**For Another team:**
- Prior odds: 9/91 = 0.099
- After incorporating all evidence: ~6%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent performance (recency bias).
- The "Champions League focus" narrative might be post-hoc rationalization rather than a causal factor.
- I might be underestimating PSG's ability to pull away during the winter period.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- PSG could have a resurgence after the winter break, especially if they prioritize league matches.
- Marseille or Lens might face fixture congestion or injuries that aren't accounted for.
- A team not currently in the top 3 (e.g., Monaco or Lyon) could go on a winning streak.

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly increase PSG's probability to account for their historical ability to recover from slumps.
- Slightly decrease "Another team" probability as the gap to 4th place may be substantial.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I'll make final adjustments to ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

- PSG: 60%
- Marseille: 21%
- Lens: 13%
- Another team: 6%

## 7. Output Format

Paris Saint-Germain: 60%
Marseille: 21%
Lens: 13%
Another team: 6%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast, following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is derived from Paris Saint-Germain's performance in the era since their acquisition by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) in 2011.

*   **Reference Class:** Ligue 1 seasons from 2011-12 to the present.
*   **Data:** In the 13 completed seasons within this period, PSG has won the league 11 times. In the seasons they win, they are almost always leading at the midpoint. Even in the two seasons they didn't win (2016-17 Monaco, 2020-21 Lille), they were still competitive at the top. This historical dominance, driven by a massive and sustained financial advantage, suggests a very high prior probability for PSG leading at any given point.
*   **Prior Probabilities:** Based on this, a reasonable prior for PSG leading at the midpoint of a generic season in this era would be approximately **P(PSG) = 80%**. The remaining 20% would be distributed among all other potential challengers, making any single team's prior chance very low. For instance, P(Marseille) might be ~5%, P(Lens) ~3%, and P(Another team) ~12%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental driver of the base rate—PSG's enormous financial and squad depth advantage over the rest of the league—remains firmly in place for the 2025-2026 season.
*   **Differences:** The current situation deviates significantly from the base case in two key ways:
    1.  **Unprecedented Competition:** The league table after 13 matches is exceptionally tight. PSG leads by only one point over Marseille and two over Lens. This is a much smaller gap than PSG typically enjoys at this stage of the season.
    2.  **PSG's Relative Underperformance:** The background notes PSG has already lost once and drawn three times. This suggests they are performing below their own historical standard, lending credibility to the idea that the challengers' proximity is not just a fluke. The narrative of focusing on a "back-to-back" Champions League title provides a plausible causal mechanism for this domestic dip.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of new information against the prior.

*   **Evidence (E):** After 13 matchdays, the league is the "most disputed since 2010-2011," with PSG leading by only 1 point over Marseille and 2 over Lens.
*   **Likelihood Assessment:**
    *   **P(E | PSG leads at midpoint):** This is relatively low. If PSG were on track to comfortably lead at the midpoint (as they do in the base case), we would expect them to have a more substantial lead by now. A 1-point lead is a precarious position.
    *   **P(E | A challenger leads at midpoint):** This is very high. If Marseille or Lens were going to overtake PSG, this is precisely the scenario we would expect to see—them being right on PSG's heels, capitalizing on any dropped points.
*   **Conclusion:** The likelihood ratio P(E | ~PSG leads) / P(E | PSG leads) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly pushes our belief *away* from the PSG prior and *towards* the challengers.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through a conceptual update for PSG's probability.

*   **Prior Odds:** P(PSG) = 80%, P(Not PSG) = 20%. The prior odds are 0.80 / 0.20 = 4 to 1 in favor of PSG.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence of the tight league table is very strong. I'll estimate that this state of affairs is perhaps 4 times more likely if a challenger is going to end up on top at the midpoint than if PSG is. This gives a likelihood ratio of 1/4 for PSG.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 4 × (1/4) = 1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** An odds of 1 corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 1) = 50%.

This single update dramatically reduces PSG's probability from 80% to 50%. I will make a slight upward adjustment from this point. The background information about PSG's players recently winning "The Best" awards serves as a weak counter-signal, reminding us of their immense underlying talent and capacity to go on a winning streak at any moment. This talent provides a "high floor" for their performance. This pushes their probability slightly back up.

Therefore, I will set PSG's final probability slightly above 50%. The remaining probability must be distributed among the challengers. Marseille, being only one point behind, has the clearest path and deserves the largest share. Lens is a close third. "Another team" is a small but non-zero possibility, as a team like Monaco or Lyon could be just a few points further back and could capitalize if all three front-runners falter.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My main concern is being too anchored to the historical base rate. Is a 58% chance for PSG still too high given they are only one point clear and seem to be deprioritizing the league? An alternative forecast might put PSG below 50%, arguing that current form and the tight standings are more predictive over the short term (the next ~6 matches) than decade-long history.

However, the rebuttal is PSG's depth. Over the congested December period, their ability to rotate world-class players is a massive advantage that Marseille and Lens do not have. A single injury or suspension to a key player at Marseille or Lens could be catastrophic for their challenge, whereas PSG can absorb such shocks. This structural advantage is why they should remain the favorite, even if a diminished one. I believe my forecast correctly balances the historical dominance with the strong contrary evidence from the current season.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will finalize my probabilities, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **Paris Saint-Germain:** They are the current leaders with the deepest squad and strongest historical precedent. Despite the challenges, they remain the most likely single team to be leading. I'll set their probability at 58%.
*   **Marseille:** As the closest challenger, just one point behind, they have a very significant chance. I'll assign them 25%.
*   **Lens:** At two points behind, their task is slightly harder, requiring either two PSG slip-ups or a combination of results. I'll assign them 12%.
*   **Another team:** This covers the small chance that a team just outside the top three goes on a perfect run while the leaders all drop points. I'll assign this a 5% chance.

The sum is 58 + 25 + 12 + 5 = 100%.

Paris Saint-Germain: 58%
Marseille: 25%
Lens: 12%
Another team: 5%

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**  
   - PSG: 78% based on leading at the midpoint in ~11 of 14 QSI-era seasons (2011-12 to 2024-25), reflecting their financial and squad dominance as the most relevant reference class.  
   - Marseille: 8% based on historical frequency of strong challengers like Marseille occasionally leading at midpoint in competitive Ligue 1 seasons (e.g., pre-QSI era and rare QSI outliers), adjusted for their status as a top club.  
   - Lens: 5% similar to Marseille but lower due to Lens's less frequent historical success and lower base rate in competitive seasons.  
   - Another team: 9% to cover other clubs (e.g., Monaco, Lyon) that have sporadically led in volatile seasons, drawing from general Ligue 1 statistics where non-dominant teams lead ~10-15% of the time outside QSI norms.  
   These priors sum to 100% and emphasize PSG's dominance while allowing for rare upsets in competitive contexts.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**  
   - Similarities: PSG is currently leading after 13 matchdays, aligning with the base case where the early leader (especially PSG in QSI era) holds position 70-80% of the time due to squad depth and resources. Financial disparities remain, favoring PSG.  
   - Differences: This season is anomalously competitive (most since 2010-11), with PSG's lead minimal (1 point over Marseille, 2 over Lens) and uncharacteristic dropped points (1 loss, 3 draws already vs. 2 losses, 6 draws all last season). PSG's Champions League focus post-victory introduces a new distraction not present in most base case seasons. These matter because they increase volatility, making the position less "sticky" and elevating challengers' chances in a way atypical of PSG's usual comfortable leads.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**  
   - Close standings after 13 matchdays (PSG leads by 1-2 points): P(E|PSG true) ~30% (somewhat likely but low for dominant seasons, as PSG usually pulls away); P(E|~PSG, e.g., Marseille true) ~80% (very likely if a challenger overtakes, as closeness enables it). LR = 0.375 (shifts against PSG).  
   - PSG's dropped points (1L, 3D early): P(E|PSG true) ~20% (uncharacteristic vulnerability); P(E|~PSG true) ~70% (likely if priorities shift or challengers capitalize). LR ~0.29 (strongly against PSG, for challengers).  
   - Champions League focus narrative: P(E|PSG true) ~40% (plausible but reduces domestic edge); P(E|~PSG true) ~60% (more likely if it causes slips). LR ~0.67 (moderately against PSG).  
   - FIFA awards dominance: P(E|PSG true) ~80% (highlights talent); P(E|~PSG true) ~40% (less expected if underperforming). LR ~2 (favors PSG slightly).  
   - Overall competitive season like 2010-11: P(E|PSG true) ~50% (possible but tempers dominance); P(E|~PSG true) ~70% (fits volatile scenarios). LR ~0.71 (mildly against PSG, boosts Marseille/Lens).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior)**  
   - For PSG: Start with prior odds 78/22 ≈ 3.55:1. Key update on close standings: LR=0.375, posterior odds = 3.55 × 0.375 ≈ 1.33:1 (posterior ~57%). Qualitative: Dropped points LR=0.29 shifts down further (~50%), Champions League narrative down mildly (~48%), but FIFA awards LR=2 shifts up (~55%). Net: ~58% (significant downward adjustment from prior due to evidence of vulnerability).  
   - For Marseille: Prior odds 8/92 ≈ 0.087:1. Close standings (1-pt gap) LR~2.5 (highly likely if they lead), posterior odds ≈0.218:1 (~18%). Dropped points and competition boost further (~22%); other evidence neutral or mild positive.  
   - For Lens: Prior odds 5/95 ≈0.053:1. Standings (2-pt gap) LR~2 (likely but less than Marseille), posterior ~10%. Competition boosts to ~13%; other evidence similar but weaker due to larger gap.  
   - For Another: Prior odds 9/91 ≈0.099:1. Standings LR~0.5 (less likely as they'd need to leapfrog three teams), posterior ~5%. Other evidence shifts down slightly (~4%) as focus is on top three.

5. **Red Team Thinking**  
   - Potential overconfidence: I may be overupdating on current closeness and narrative (e.g., Champions League focus could be overstated; PSG's talent might quickly correct form). Blind spot: Lack of fixture details—PSG could have easier games ahead, preserving lead.  
   - Tail risks: Injuries to Marseille/Lens stars (e.g., small effect but could cause drops); PSG win streak amid fixture congestion (boosts PSG to 70%+); a dark horse "Another" surges if top three falter (e.g., 10% tail). Alternative scenarios: Volatility flips standings dramatically.  
   - Best alternative forecast: PSG 75%, Marseille 10%, Lens 8%, Another 7% (argues minimal update, as base rate dominance overrides short-term noise; plausible if viewing dips as variance). Rebuttal: Evidence (dropped points, closeness) is concrete and fits causal mechanisms, warranting larger shift per report's sketch. Another alternative: Even split (PSG 40%, Marseille 30%, Lens 20%, Another 10%) if overemphasizing competition. Rebuttal: PSG's resources still give edge. Adjustment: Nudge PSG up to 60% for conservatism, Marseille down to 20%, Lens to 12%, Another to 8% to widen uncertainty on tails.

6. **Final Normalization**  
   - Adjusted posteriors: PSG 60%, Marseille 20%, Lens 12%, Another 8% (sums to 100%). Uncertainty distributed to challengers proportionally to closeness, with "Another" low but non-zero for tail risks.

Paris Saint-Germain: 60%  
Marseille: 20%  
Lens: 12%  
Another team: 8%
