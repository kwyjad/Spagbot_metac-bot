### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Crisis Iran-IAEA Technical Agreements (2003-Present):** This class includes instances where Iran and the IAEA negotiated specific access or monitoring arrangements following a period of high tension, such as a critical IAEA report or the imposition of sanctions. Examples include the 2007 "work plan" and the 2015 JCPOA implementation. Agreements are eventually reached, but often after months or years of stalemate. A deal being struck within a two-week window of a hard-line public refusal is extremely rare.
    *   **Base Rate:** 5-10%. The short time horizon is the primary constraint. These deals require significant political and technical groundwork, which is not evident here.
2.  **Post-Military Strike Inspections (Global, Post-WWII):** This class involves international inspections of a nation's strategic sites shortly after they have been subject to a significant military attack. Examples include Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War (UNSCOM) or Syria after the 2007 Israeli strike on the Al-Kibar facility. Access is typically granted only under extreme duress (e.g., post-capitulation, under a binding UN Security Council resolution) or after a long delay. Iran is not in such a position.
    *   **Base Rate:** <5%. Iran has not been defeated, and there is no new international legal mandate forcing its compliance. It retains significant agency.
3.  **Reinstatement of Recently Broken Diplomatic Deals:** This class looks at cases where a specific agreement is publicly announced and then publicly scrapped. The base rate for such a deal being reinstated on the same terms within a few months, let alone weeks, is very low. The act of cancellation signals a fundamental shift in strategy or a collapse of the political will that enabled the deal in the first place.
    *   **Base Rate:** 10-15%. While lower than a standard negotiation, it's not impossible if the reason for the cancellation was temporary or tactical. However, the current deadlock suggests the reasons are strategic.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-16** Atlantic Council notes the ceasefire is tenuous and Iran is rebuilding capabilities without oversight. (↓) — This suggests Iran benefits from the current ambiguity and lack of inspections, reducing its incentive to grant access.
*   **2025-12-15** IAEA's Grossi confirms inspectors are blocked from Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. (↓) — Official confirmation of the current deadlock at the highest level, indicating no progress has been made.
*   **2025-12-15** Iran's nuclear chief Eslami states the IAEA has "no protocol" for inspecting attacked sites. (↓) — Iran is creating a formal, technical-sounding pretext for denial, making a sudden reversal before 2026 less likely without a new framework.
*   **2025-12-09** INSS report describes a "standstill" and notes Iran's refusal to negotiate while the U.S. demands zero enrichment. (↓) — Links inspections to broader, intractable negotiations, making a standalone inspection deal highly improbable.
*   **2025-11-05** USIP analysis highlights maximalist U.S. demands and coercion as key challenges. (↓) — The negotiating environment is fundamentally poor, suggesting concessions from Iran are unlikely without major shifts from the U.S.
*   **2025-10-20** Reuters reports Iran scrapped the September 9 deal to resume inspections. (↓) — The most significant recent event. A direct reversal of a prior commitment, indicating a hardened stance and making a new agreement much harder.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Iranian Domestic Politics & National Pride (Large ↓):** After a direct military attack by its chief adversaries, the Iranian regime cannot be seen as quickly capitulating to international demands for inspection. Allowing access could be framed internally as a sign of weakness.
2.  **Strategic Ambiguity & Concealment (Large ↓):** Denying access prevents the IAEA, Israel, and the U.S. from assessing the actual damage to the nuclear program. This ambiguity is a form of leverage, hiding both weaknesses (extent of destruction) and strengths (surviving capabilities, salvage operations).
3.  **Bargaining Leverage (Moderate ↓):** Access to the sites is one of Iran's most valuable non-military bargaining chips. It is unlikely to give this away for free, especially when the U.S. is demanding "zero enrichment." It will be held for a larger negotiation.
4.  **Desire for Sanctions Relief (Moderate ↑):** If crippling economic pressure were re-applied or intensified, Iran might see inspections as a necessary first step toward relief. However, there is no indication of a new diplomatic package being offered that would trigger this.
5.  **Fear of Renewed Military Action (Small ↑):** Iran might calculate that stonewalling could provoke further strikes. Granting access could be a de-escalatory move. However, having just absorbed a major attack, their immediate posture is more likely defiance than accommodation.
6.  **Technical/Safety Pretext (Small ↓):** The claim of "no protocol" for inspecting damaged sites, while likely a political excuse, provides a formal justification for delay that is difficult for the IAEA to counter without a new, negotiated framework, which is impossible before 2026.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct Military Attack Context:** Unlike most historical Iran-IAEA disputes, this one follows a massive, direct U.S./Israeli attack on the very sites in question. This fundamentally changes the dynamic from a technical/legal dispute to one of national security and sovereignty post-conflict.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The resolution window is exceptionally short (~2 weeks). The reference cases of post-crisis deals almost always involve months of cautious, back-channel diplomacy before an announcement.
*   **Scrapped Precedent:** A deal was made in September and then explicitly cancelled in October. This is not a simple failure to reach an agreement; it is a regression from a prior success, which suggests the political obstacles have grown significantly.
*   **Maximalist U.S. Position:** The stated U.S. goal of "zero enrichment" creates a much wider gulf between the parties than during the JCPOA negotiations, disincentivizing Iranian concessions on secondary issues like inspections.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around 10-15% seems appropriate, reflecting a base rate where such short-notice deals following a major crisis and a broken agreement are highly unlikely but not strictly impossible. (Equivalent n of ~10-15).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The public, formal scrapping of the September inspection deal in October is the strongest piece of evidence, indicating a strategic shift against cooperation.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Iran's creation of a formal pretext ("no protocol") in December provides a defensible reason for inaction and makes a sudden reversal difficult.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The confirmed deadlock from both Grossi and Iranian sources in mid-December shows a complete lack of momentum heading into the final weeks.
    *   (↓ Small) The broader context of maximalist U.S. demands removes a key incentive for Iran to make a "good faith" concession on inspections.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence is uniformly negative and reinforces the dynamics suggested by the reference class. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Reports of secret, high-level meetings between Iranian and U.S./E3 officials, likely mediated by Oman or Qatar.
    *   Any public softening of rhetoric from Iran's Foreign Ministry or Atomic Energy Organization.
    *   A significant, unexpected economic or security crisis within Iran that necessitates foreign aid or de-escalation.
    *   A public statement from the U.S. delinking inspections from the "zero enrichment" demand.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continued defiant rhetoric from Iranian officials, especially Supreme Leader Khamenei.
    *   An announcement of an IAEA Board of Governors emergency meeting to censure Iran.
    *   New U.S. or European sanctions imposed on Iran.
    *   Iranian military movements or drills reported near the damaged nuclear sites.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on an "announcement." This could be a vague, non-binding statement of intent rather than a detailed technical agreement. A face-saving but hollow announcement is a possibility.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The internal deliberations of the Iranian regime are opaque. A sudden policy shift driven by factional power struggles or a decision by the Supreme Leader could occur with no external warning.
*   **"Black Swan" Events:** The regional situation is highly volatile. A new conflict, a major political event (e.g., health crisis of the Supreme Leader), or a terrorist attack could dramatically alter priorities.
*   **Deception Risk:** Iran could announce a deal purely for tactical reasons—to forestall further sanctions or military action—with no genuine intent to allow meaningful inspections.
*   **Misinterpretation of Signals:** Back-channel communications, if they exist, are invisible. Public statements may be posturing for domestic audiences and not reflect actual policy.

**Final Research Summary:**
Given the extremely short deadline, Iran's hardened public posture following a direct military attack, and the recent, deliberate cancellation of a previous inspection deal, an agreement before 2026 is highly improbable. Iran is leveraging strategic ambiguity and appears to have no compelling incentive to make such a major concession in the immediate future.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant reference class is "Post-Crisis Iran-IAEA Technical Agreements," with a base rate of 5-10%. This reflects the historical difficulty of reaching agreements quickly after high-tension periods, especially given the recent military conflict and the scrapping of a previous deal.
   - Initial prior probability: 10%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves post-crisis negotiations with the IAEA, similar to past instances where agreements were eventually reached.
   - Differences: The recent military attack and the explicit cancellation of a prior agreement make the current situation more challenging than typical post-crisis negotiations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Scrapping of September Deal (↓ Large):** The cancellation of the September agreement is a strong indicator against cooperation, suggesting a strategic shift by Iran.
   - **Iran's "No Protocol" Claim (↓ Moderate):** This provides a formal pretext for denial, making a sudden reversal unlikely.
   - **Deadlock Confirmation (↓ Moderate):** Statements from both the IAEA and Iran confirm a lack of progress, reinforcing the improbability of a quick resolution.
   - **Maximalist U.S. Demands (↓ Small):** The U.S. position reduces incentives for Iran to concede on inspections.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 10% probability = 0.1 odds.
   - Likelihood ratio: The combined negative evidence suggests a significant decrease in probability.
   - Posterior odds: 0.1 × (significant decrease from evidence) ≈ 0.02.
   - Posterior probability: 0.02 / (1 + 0.02) ≈ 2%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: Consider the possibility of a sudden diplomatic breakthrough or a strategic shift by Iran due to unforeseen pressures.
   - Alternative Forecast: A scenario where Iran seeks to de-escalate tensions due to economic or security crises, though current evidence does not support this.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong negative evidence and lack of positive indicators, the probability remains low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability reflects the low base rate and the overwhelmingly negative evidence against a quick agreement.
   - Final: 2%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class and base rate. The most relevant reference classes are:

1. **Post-military strike inspection agreements**: Cases where a country allows international inspections shortly after its nuclear facilities were attacked. This is rare and typically happens only under extreme duress or defeat.

2. **Recently broken diplomatic deals**: Cases where a specific agreement is announced and then publicly scrapped, and then reinstated within a short timeframe.

3. **Iran-IAEA technical agreements following crises**: Historical patterns of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA after periods of heightened tension.

Given the specific circumstances (military strikes, a scrapped agreement, and the extremely short timeframe of ~2 weeks remaining), I'll use a base rate of **10%**. This reflects the historical rarity of such rapid diplomatic reversals, especially following military action and an explicitly canceled agreement.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran has a history of strategic negotiations with the IAEA, sometimes allowing inspections when it serves their interests
- International pressure and sanctions have previously motivated Iran to make concessions
- The technical capability for inspections exists

**Key differences (mostly negative):**
- **Extremely compressed timeframe**: Only ~2 weeks remain until 2026, leaving almost no time for the complex diplomatic work needed
- **Direct military attack context**: The sites in question were just bombed by the US and Israel, creating a sovereignty and national pride issue
- **Explicit cancellation**: Iran didn't just fail to reach a deal; they announced one in September and then deliberately scrapped it in October
- **Formal pretext established**: Iran has created a technical justification ("no protocol" for inspecting attacked sites)
- **Maximalist US position**: The US demand for "zero enrichment" removes incentives for Iran to make partial concessions

These differences significantly reduce the probability below the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Let's evaluate the key evidence:

**Evidence 1: Iran scrapped the September 9 inspection deal on October 20**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, the probability they would have scrapped a previous deal is very low (~10%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, the probability they would have scrapped the deal is very high (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Iran's nuclear chief Eslami stated on December 15 that the IAEA has "no protocol" for inspecting attacked sites**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, the probability they would create this formal pretext is moderate (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, the probability of this statement is very high (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: IAEA Director Grossi confirmed on December 15 that inspectors are blocked from the sites**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections soon, the probability of this current confirmation is moderate (~40%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this confirmation is nearly certain (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.42
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: US demands "zero enrichment" while Iran refuses to negotiate under these terms**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this negotiating deadlock would be somewhat unlikely (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this deadlock is highly likely (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.38
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 10% (odds of 1:9), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence first:

**Update on Evidence 1 (scrapped deal):**
- Prior odds: 1:9 (10%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 1:9 × 0.11 = 0.11:9 ≈ 0.11:9 = 1:81.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+81.8) ≈ 1.2%

**Update on Evidence 2 (no protocol statement):**
- Prior odds: 1:81.8 (1.2%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 1:81.8 × 0.33 = 0.33:81.8 ≈ 1:248
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+248) ≈ 0.4%

The other evidence points would further reduce this probability, but I'll stop here as the direction is clear. The combined evidence strongly suggests that Iran allowing IAEA inspections before 2026 is extremely unlikely.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Let me challenge my own analysis:

**Potential blind spots:**
- **Back-channel negotiations**: Secret talks could be happening that aren't publicly reported
- **Face-saving compromise**: Iran might accept a limited, symbolic inspection that satisfies the technical criteria
- **External pressure**: A sudden economic crisis or security threat might force Iran to make concessions
- **Domestic politics**: Internal factional struggles could lead to an unexpected policy shift

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran might announce a conditional agreement (5% chance) - but this would still count as "Yes"
- Iran could make a last-minute symbolic gesture to reduce international pressure (3% chance)

**Adjustments needed:**
I should slightly increase my probability to account for these possibilities, particularly the chance of a face-saving, limited inspection agreement that would technically satisfy the resolution criteria.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all the evidence and potential scenarios, I believe there is a very low probability that Iran will allow IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile before 2026.

The extremely short timeframe (only ~2 weeks), Iran's explicit cancellation of the previous agreement, their formal technical pretext for refusal, the confirmation of blocked access by the IAEA Director, and the broader negotiating deadlock all point strongly against an agreement.

While I cannot completely rule out a surprise announcement, the probability is very low. Accounting for some possibility of unexpected developments or face-saving measures, I arrive at a final probability of 3%.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use a combination of the reference classes provided. The most relevant classes are "Post-Crisis Iran-IAEA Technical Agreements" and "Reinstatement of Recently Broken Diplomatic Deals."

1.  **Post-Crisis Iran-IAEA Agreements:** Historically, such agreements take months or years to negotiate, not two weeks. The report suggests a base rate of 5-10% for a deal being struck this quickly.
2.  **Reinstatement of Broken Deals:** A deal was announced on September 9 and scrapped on October 20. Reversing this reversal on such a short timescale is also highly improbable. The report suggests a 10-15% base rate for reinstatement within a few months, which must be discounted for the two-week window.
3.  **Post-Military Strike Inspections:** This class, suggesting a <5% base rate, is also highly relevant as the context of a direct attack is a primary driver of the current situation.

Synthesizing these, the situation is more constrained than a typical crisis. A blended base rate that acknowledges the broken deal and the post-attack context would be lower than the general "post-crisis" rate. I will select a prior probability of **8%**. This reflects that a rapid diplomatic breakthrough is rare but not strictly impossible. In odds form, this is approximately 1-to-12.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case of Iran-IAEA negotiations in several critical ways, all of which decrease the likelihood of an agreement:

*   **Direct Military Attack:** The negotiations are not about a technical dispute but are occurring in the immediate aftermath of a major military strike by the US and Israel on the very sites in question. This injects powerful elements of national pride, sovereignty, and defiance into Iran's calculations, making any concession that could be perceived as capitulation politically toxic for the regime.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The deadline is January 1, 2026, leaving only two weeks from the present. Complex international agreements, especially those reversing a recent public cancellation, require significant diplomatic groundwork, which appears to be completely absent.
*   **Explicit Reversal:** This is not a simple failure to reach a deal; Iran explicitly announced and then scrapped a prior agreement. This indicates that the political forces opposing cooperation have likely won out and consolidated their position, making a second reversal highly improbable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The recent evidence is uniformly and strongly negative. Let H be the hypothesis that Iran announces an agreement before 2026, and ~H be the alternative.

*   **Evidence 1: Iran scrapped the September 9 deal (Oct 20).** This action is far more likely if Iran has no intention of allowing inspections soon (P(E|~H) is high) than if they were planning a new deal within two months (P(E|H) is low). This evidence strongly decreases the probability of H.
*   **Evidence 2: Iran's nuclear chief states the IAEA has "no protocol" for inspecting attacked sites (Dec 15).** This creates a formal, technical-sounding pretext for long-term denial. It is highly unlikely Iran would introduce such a barrier just days before announcing an agreement. This is very strong evidence against H (Likelihood Ratio << 1).
*   **Evidence 3: IAEA Director Grossi confirms a "standstill" and that inspectors are blocked (Dec 15).** A publicly confirmed deadlock is the opposite of the momentum one would expect to see ahead of a breakthrough. While a secret backchannel could exist, this public confirmation makes it much less likely. This evidence decreases the probability of H.

Collectively, this evidence forms a coherent picture of a regime that has hardened its position and is creating justifications for continued non-cooperation, not preparing for a deal.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a conceptual update starting from the 8% prior.

*   **Prior:** P(H) = 8% (Odds ≈ 1:12)
*   **Evidence:** A cluster of recent, strongly negative developments (scrapped deal, new pretext, confirmed deadlock). This evidence is much more probable under the ~H hypothesis (no deal) than the H hypothesis (deal is imminent). I will estimate a conservative combined Likelihood Ratio of 0.25 for this cluster of evidence, meaning it is four times more likely that we would see these events if no deal were coming than if one were.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio ≈ (1/12) × 0.25 = 1/48.
*   **Posterior Probability:** A 1-to-48 odds corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 48) = 1/49, which is approximately **2%**.

The evidence strongly pushes the already low prior probability into extremely unlikely territory.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome is a sudden, tactical reversal by Iran. The regime might announce a deal—perhaps a hollow one that sounds good but has loopholes—to achieve a specific short-term goal, such as forestalling new sanctions or a renewed military threat planned for early 2026. The internal decision-making of the Supreme Leader is opaque and could change without warning. This possibility of a strategic surprise, where public defiance is mere posturing for a pre-planned concession, is the main reason the probability is not near-zero. However, this scenario runs contrary to all available evidence, which points to a genuine and deeply felt political need to project strength and resistance after being attacked. The arguments against a deal are based on concrete actions and statements, while the arguments for a deal rely on speculating about hidden motives. Therefore, the probability should remain very low.

### Final Forecast
The forecast is based on a low prior probability further reduced by a consistent stream of strong, negative evidence. The context of a recent military attack makes Iranian concessions politically difficult, and the regime's actions and rhetoric in recent weeks signal an intent to delay and defy, not cooperate. The extremely short two-week timeframe makes a diplomatic breakthrough exceptionally improbable.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event—Iran announcing an IAEA inspection agreement for its enriched uranium stockpiles at the specified sites before January 1, 2026—draws from the reference classes in the research report. I select a blended prior of 10%, reflecting:
- The 5-10% base rate for post-crisis Iran-IAEA technical agreements, which emphasizes the rarity of deals within such a short (2-week) window after high tension.
- The <5% rate for post-military strike inspections globally, accounting for Iran's non-defeated status and lack of external mandates.
- The 10-15% rate for reinstating recently broken diplomatic deals, which fits the scrapped September agreement but highlights the low likelihood of quick reversal.

This 10% prior is chosen because historical data shows such agreements typically require months of diplomacy, not weeks, especially post-conflict and after a public cancellation. In odds form: 1:9 (prior odds = 0.1 / 0.9 ≈ 0.111).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base cases in involving Iran-IAEA tensions post-crisis (e.g., like the 2007 work plan or JCPOA delays), where stalemates persist due to political pride, sanctions, and bargaining. It's also akin to post-strike scenarios (e.g., Syria 2007), where access is denied without duress, and broken deal reinstatements, where cancellation signals strategic shifts.

However, differences make a positive outcome less likely:
- The direct U.S./Israeli military attack on the sites introduces national sovereignty and post-humiliation dynamics not present in most Iran-IAEA historical disputes, increasing defiance.
- The extremely short 2-week horizon (vs. months/years in base cases) limits time for back-channel diplomacy.
- The recent scrapping of the September deal represents a regression, unlike base cases of gradual progress, widening the negotiation gulf amid U.S. "zero enrichment" demands.
These differences matter because they amplify Iran's incentives for strategic ambiguity and reduce pressure for quick concessions, pushing the probability below the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I evaluate key evidence from the background, report timeline, and mechanisms, focusing on recent developments. For each, I assess P(E | H) (evidence given inspections happen) vs. P(E | ~H) (given they don't), yielding a likelihood ratio (LR = P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)). All pieces are negative, decreasing the probability.

- **Scrapped September deal (October 20, Reuters)**: This public reversal signals hardened stance. P(E | H) is low (~20%, as a quick new deal would require overcoming this regression); P(E | ~H) is high (~80%, as cancellation fits ongoing denial). LR ≈ 0.25 (strongly decreases probability by showing strategic shift against cooperation).
- **IAEA confirmation of blocked access and Iran's "no protocol" claim (December 15)**: Official deadlock and pretext for denial. P(E | H) ~10% (hard to square with imminent agreement); P(E | ~H) ~90% (expected in stalemate). LR ≈ 0.11 (decreases probability, as it formalizes barriers without momentum for reversal).
- **Broader deadlock linked to U.S. maximalism (INSS/USIP reports, November-December)**: Ties inspections to intractable issues. P(E | H) ~30% (some linkage possible but unlikely in weeks); P(E | ~H) ~70% (fits poor environment). LR ≈ 0.43 (moderately decreases, removing incentives for standalone concessions).
- **Post-attack ambiguity and rebuilding without oversight (Atlantic Council, December 16)**: Iran benefits from hiding damage. P(E | H) ~15% (would require forgoing leverage); P(E | ~H) ~85% (aligns with defiance). LR ≈ 0.18 (decreases, emphasizing national pride and strategic drivers).

Net: Uniformly negative evidence with LRs <1, collectively suggesting a major downward adjustment.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Conceptually applying Bayes' Rule: Posterior odds = Prior odds × LR (product of evidence LRs).

Start with prior odds: 0.111 (from 10% prior).
- First update for scrapped deal (LR 0.25): Interim odds = 0.111 × 0.25 ≈ 0.028 (probability ≈ 2.7%).
- Update for blocked access/"no protocol" (LR 0.11): Odds = 0.028 × 0.11 ≈ 0.003 (probability ≈ 0.3%).
- Update for deadlock/U.S. maximalism (LR 0.43): Odds = 0.003 × 0.43 ≈ 0.0013 (probability ≈ 0.1%).
- Final update for ambiguity/rebuilding (LR 0.18): Posterior odds = 0.0013 × 0.18 ≈ 0.00023 (posterior probability ≈ 0.02%).

This is an illustrative chain; qualitatively, the evidence reinforces low base rates without countervailing positives, yielding a posterior around 5%. Confidence remains low due to the short timeline and opacity, but uncertainty favors the negative (e.g., no upside surprises evident), keeping it uncertain but skewed low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in downward adjustments, potentially underweighting Iran's history of tactical reversals (e.g., JCPOA surprises) or black swan events like sudden U.S. concessions amid regional volatility. Blind spots include information asymmetry—secret talks could be underway, invisible to public reports. Tail risks: A major crisis (e.g., Khamenei's health) could force de-escalation (upside risk), or new sanctions/escalation could harden positions further (downside).

Best alternative forecast: 20-30%, arguing the base rate is too pessimistic and fear of strikes (mechanism ↑) could prompt a face-saving announcement. Plausible if viewing the "no protocol" as negotiable bluster, not a hard barrier. Rebuttal: Recent evidence shows no softening, and the short window makes this optimistic; historical patterns post-crisis favor delays. I adjust slightly upward to account for deception risk (e.g., hollow announcement) and volatility, broadening from ~0% to a 5% posterior to avoid overconfidence in a low-sample domain.

Final: 5%
