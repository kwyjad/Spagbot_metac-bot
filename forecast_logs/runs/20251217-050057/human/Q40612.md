### Reference class & base rates
1.  **German Government-Proposed Legislation:** Bills introduced by the federal government (Bundesregierung) have a very high success rate. Historically, over 90% of such bills that are introduced into the Bundestag are eventually passed into law. This reflects strong party discipline and the power of the executive in a parliamentary system. This class suggests a high prior for YES.
2.  **Major Government Reforms with Significant Internal Opposition:** A more specific class is major legislative packages that face public, organized opposition from a faction within the governing coalition's largest party. While less frequent, these situations are more contentious. The success rate here is lower than the general case, as bills may be withdrawn, defeated, or significantly amended to remove the controversial elements. A ballpark estimate for the *original, controversial version* passing is likely in the 60-75% range, as the government usually finds a compromise to pass *something*.
3.  **Legislation Passed in the Final Month of a Year:** Major, controversial legislation is rarely introduced and passed entirely within the last few weeks of December due to the parliamentary Christmas recess and crowded end-of-year schedules. The base rate for such a bill clearing all hurdles (Bundestag and Bundesrat) in this timeframe is very low, likely under 10%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-05** Bundestag passes the 2025 pension package. ↓↓↓ — Reports on the passage (AP, Munich Eye, bundesregierung.de) consistently highlight the stabilization of the 48% pension level but make no mention of the Aktivrente, strongly implying it was dropped from the final bill to secure votes.
*   **2025-12-05** Chancellor Merz announces a commission for a more comprehensive pension reform in 2026. ↓↓ — This provides political cover for dropping controversial elements like Aktivrente. It placates the youth wing by promising their concerns will be addressed later, pushing the timeline beyond the resolution date.
*   **2025-11-28** Government announces it will proceed with the reform, with Junge Union concerns to be "addressed in a separate text." ↓ — This was the first major signal that the package would be split, with the controversial parts (like Aktivrente) being separated from the core bill to ensure passage of the latter.
*   **2025-11-28** Merz states he "expects approval" for the pension bill. ↑ — This shows high-level political will. However, this statement was made before the final compromise and passage, and likely referred to the overall package, not necessarily every component part.
*   **2025-11-19** Reports emerge of a "crisis" within the CDU over the pension reform, with the Junge Union in open rebellion. ↓ — This established the high political cost of pushing the original bill through and created the strong incentive for the government to compromise by removing the most contentious parts.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Coalition Cohesion & Party Discipline:** The CDU/CSU-SPD coalition needs to maintain a united front. The Junge Union's rebellion, with enough members to defeat the bill, forces the government's hand. The need to avoid a coalition-breaking crisis is a powerful driver for compromise. (Size: Large)
2.  **Chancellor's Political Capital:** Friedrich Merz cannot afford a major legislative defeat at the hands of his own party's youth wing. Securing a "win"—even a partial one—is paramount. This incentivizes jettisoning the most controversial elements to ensure the main package passes. (Size: Large)
3.  **Legislative Calendar Constraints:** With the date being December 17, 2025, the parliamentary clock is a critical factor. The Bundestag and Bundesrat have limited sessions before the Christmas recess. Passing a complex, controversial tax law in this window is logistically almost impossible. (Size: Large)
4.  **Need for Bundesrat Approval:** The bill must also pass the Bundesrat (Federal Council), where the 16 state governments are represented. Tax-related laws often require Bundesrat consent. A controversial measure like Aktivrente could face opposition there, further complicating the already tight timeline. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Alternative Support (The Greens):** While theoretically possible to seek support from an opposition party like the Greens, this is politically costly and time-consuming. The Greens would demand their own concessions, requiring new negotiations for which there is no time. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Open Factional Rebellion:** Unlike the typical government bill, this one faced a public and organized rebellion from a significant faction (Junge Union) within the Chancellor's own party, which holds a veto-player position due to the slim majority.
*   **Extreme Time Pressure:** The base rate for government bills assumes a normal legislative process. The attempt to pass this specific, controversial provision in the last two weeks of the year is a massive deviation from the norm.
*   **Explicit Decoupling Strategy:** The government's compromise—passing the core bill while promising a future reform—is a classic political maneuver. This explicitly signals that contentious items have been postponed, a factor not present in the general reference class of "all government bills."
*   **Nature of the Opposition:** The opposition is not based on minor details but on a fundamental principle of intergenerational fairness. This makes the rebels less likely to be swayed by small concessions, forcing the government to remove the offending part of the bill entirely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of major reforms with internal dissent, a prior of ~65% seems plausible, reflecting the government's general ability to find a way to pass its agenda (equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓↓↓ (Large): News reports from the December 5th Bundestag vote conspicuously omit any mention of the Aktivrente, focusing solely on the 48% pension level. This is the strongest evidence it was dropped from the bill that passed.
    *   ↓↓ (Large): The extremely tight legislative calendar before the Christmas recess makes it nearly impossible to introduce and pass a separate Aktivrente bill before the deadline.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The Chancellor's public pivot to a "comprehensive reform" in 2026 is a clear signal that difficult and controversial topics, including the Aktivrente, are being postponed to the next year.
    *   ↓ (Small): The need for Bundesrat approval for tax changes adds another procedural hurdle that is unlikely to be cleared in the available time.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the Aktivrente was sacrificed to ensure the passage of the main pension package. The posterior probability should move sharply downwards from the initial prior, landing in the very low range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An official government announcement explicitly stating the Aktivrente is still on the 2025 legislative agenda.
    *   The scheduling of an emergency or special session of the Bundestag before year-end to debate tax law.
    *   A surprise joint statement from the coalition and the Greens announcing a deal to pass the measure.
    *   Leaked drafts of a new, standalone "Aktivrente" bill being circulated for a fast-track vote.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Publication of the official text of the passed "Rentenpaket II" which does not include the Aktivrente provision.
    *   A statement from the Ministry of Finance or Labour confirming the Aktivrente will be part of the 2026 reform commission's work.
    *   The Bundestag and Bundesrat formally entering their Christmas recess without any further action on this topic.
    *   Statements from Junge Union leaders claiming victory in having the "unfair" tax break for pensioners postponed.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires "an extra tax-free allowance." A much smaller, face-saving "mini-Aktivrente" could theoretically be tucked into another end-of-year bill, though this is unlikely.
*   **Information Gaps:** The analysis relies on media reporting of the passed bill's contents. The official, final text of the law is the key missing piece of evidence.
*   **Fictional Scenario:** The entire background is a hypothetical scenario set in the near future (December 2025). The analysis assumes the political dynamics described are real, but the underlying premise is constructed.
*   **Political Misdirection:** It's possible the government is being intentionally vague. However, the complete absence of "Aktivrente" in post-passage communications makes this unlikely to be a successful strategy.
*   **Bundesrat Power:** The role of the Bundesrat is a potential complication. Even if the Bundestag were to act, the Bundesrat could still delay or block the measure, a factor not fully captured in the provided sources.

**Final Research Summary:** The government faced a choice between passing its core pension stabilization goal or risking the entire package over the controversial Aktivrente. Evidence strongly suggests they chose the former, dropping the Aktivrente to quell an internal party rebellion and promising to revisit it in 2026, making passage before the deadline highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of Germany enacting the Aktivrente before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major government reforms with significant internal opposition is estimated at 60-75%. Given the specific context of the Aktivrente facing organized opposition within the CDU and the tight legislative timeline, a prior probability of 65% seems reasonable. This reflects the government's general ability to pass its agenda despite internal dissent.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The Aktivrente is part of a major government reform package, aligning with the base case of government-proposed legislation.
   - Differences: The open rebellion from the Junge Union and the extreme time pressure due to the legislative calendar are significant deviations from the norm, suggesting a lower probability than the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Bundestag Passage on December 5th**: The omission of Aktivrente from reports suggests it was dropped. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
   - **Chancellor's Announcement of 2026 Reform**: Indicates postponement of controversial elements, decreasing the probability.
   - **Legislative Calendar Constraints**: The tight timeline makes passing the Aktivrente unlikely, decreasing the probability.
   - **Need for Bundesrat Approval**: Adds procedural hurdles, decreasing the probability.
   - **Merz's Expectation of Approval**: While showing political will, it was likely referring to the overall package, not the Aktivrente specifically.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 65% probability translates to odds of 0.65 / 0.35 ≈ 1.86.
   - Likelihood ratio: The combined evidence strongly suggests a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1, indicating a decrease in probability.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.86 × (much less than 1) = significantly less than 1.
   - Posterior probability: Given the strong evidence against, the posterior probability is very low, likely below 10%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The analysis could underestimate the potential for last-minute political maneuvers or compromises.
   - Alternative Scenario: A small, face-saving "mini-Aktivrente" could be introduced, though this is unlikely given the evidence.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of political misdirection or incomplete information, but the evidence strongly supports a low probability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, the final forecast reflects a very low probability of the Aktivrente being enacted before 2026.

Final: 5%

# Will Germany enact the Aktivrente before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the likelihood of Germany enacting the Aktivrente before January 3, 2026.

The most relevant reference class is "major government-proposed legislation with significant internal opposition from the governing coalition." For such cases:
- Government-proposed legislation in Germany typically has a high success rate (~90%)
- However, when facing significant internal opposition from coalition members, this rate drops substantially
- When the opposition comes from a faction with enough votes to defeat the bill (as with the Youth Wing's 18 members in a coalition with only a 12-seat majority), the success rate drops further

Given these factors, I'll set a prior of 65% for the Aktivrente being enacted before 2026. This reflects the general ability of the German government to pass its agenda while accounting for the significant internal opposition.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a government-proposed bill with strong backing from coalition leadership
- The bill has already passed the Federal Cabinet, a key milestone
- The Chancellor has publicly stated he "expects approval"

**Key differences:**
- The timeline is extremely compressed - we're at December 17, 2025, with only about two weeks left before the resolution deadline
- There is organized, public opposition from the Junge Union (Youth Wing) with enough votes to block the bill
- The bill requires both Bundestag and Bundesrat approval, adding procedural complexity
- The December 5th Bundestag passage of the pension package conspicuously omitted mention of the Aktivrente

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base case, as they create substantial procedural and political obstacles.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Bundestag passed pension package on December 5th with no mention of Aktivrente**
- P(E|H): If Aktivrente will pass, it's unlikely (0.2) the main pension package would pass without it
- P(E|~H): If Aktivrente won't pass, it's very likely (0.9) the main package would pass without it
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Chancellor announced commission for comprehensive pension reform in 2026**
- P(E|H): If Aktivrente will pass in 2025, it's somewhat unlikely (0.3) the Chancellor would announce a 2026 commission
- P(E|~H): If Aktivrente won't pass in 2025, it's very likely (0.8) the Chancellor would set up a future commission
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Government announced it will address Youth Wing concerns "in a separate text"**
- P(E|H): If Aktivrente will pass, this statement is moderately likely (0.5)
- P(E|~H): If Aktivrente won't pass, this statement is highly likely (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely tight legislative calendar before year-end**
- P(E|H): If Aktivrente will pass, we would expect a more favorable calendar (0.2)
- P(E|~H): If Aktivrente won't pass, this tight calendar is expected (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 65% (odds of 65:35 or 1.86:1)

First update (Bundestag passage without Aktivrente):
- Prior odds: 1.86:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 0.22 = 0.41:1
- Posterior probability: 0.41/(1+0.41) = 29%

Second update (2026 commission announcement):
- Prior odds: 0.41:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 0.41 × 0.375 = 0.15:1
- Posterior probability: 0.15/(1+0.15) = 13%

Third update (separate text for Youth Wing concerns):
- Prior odds: 0.15:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 0.15 × 0.56 = 0.084:1
- Posterior probability: 0.084/(1+0.084) = 7.8%

Fourth update (tight legislative calendar):
- Prior odds: 0.084:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 0.084 × 0.22 = 0.018:1
- Posterior probability: 0.018/(1+0.018) = 1.8%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be overinterpreting the absence of Aktivrente mentions in news reports
- There could be fast-track legislative procedures I'm not accounting for
- The government might have secured support from opposition parties like the Greens

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A compromise version of Aktivrente could be included in a year-end omnibus bill
- The government might call an emergency session to pass a stripped-down version
- The measure could be implemented through regulatory means rather than legislation

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for a higher probability would be that political reporting is incomplete, and the government has a surprise legislative maneuver planned. However, this seems highly implausible given:
1. The explicit pivot to a 2026 commission
2. The successful passage of the main pension package without Aktivrente
3. The extremely limited legislative calendar before year-end
4. The need for both Bundestag and Bundesrat approval

Even accounting for these possibilities, I would adjust my forecast only slightly upward.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the strong evidence that the Aktivrente was dropped from the pension package that passed on December 5th, the announcement of a 2026 commission, the extremely tight legislative calendar, and the political dynamics within the coalition, I assess there is only a very small chance the Aktivrente will be enacted before January 3, 2026.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the success rate of major government legislative proposals that face significant, organized opposition from within the governing coalition. While the general base rate for German government bills passing is very high (over 90%), this is not a typical bill. A more specific reference class would be contentious reforms where a faction of the governing party has enough votes to act as a veto player. In these cases, the government's priority is often to pass the core of the bill, which frequently involves sacrificing the most controversial elements to secure a compromise. The success rate for the *controversial element itself* is therefore much lower than for the overall bill. A reasonable prior probability that the Aktivrente would survive the legislative process is around **P(H) = 65%**, reflecting the government's general power to enact its agenda but acknowledging the significant hurdle of internal dissent.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This situation deviates significantly from the base case of a standard government bill in two critical ways that lower the probability of the Aktivrente passing:
1.  **Veto Power of the Opposition Faction:** The Junge Union's 18 members are more than the coalition's 12-seat majority, giving them the credible power to defeat the entire bill. This elevates their opposition from mere dissent to a critical threat.
2.  **Extreme Time Constraint:** The current date is December 17, 2025. The German legislative process requires passage in the Bundestag (parliament's lower house) and often approval from the Bundesrat (upper house). Completing this for a controversial law in the two weeks before the Christmas recess is procedurally and politically almost impossible.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The recent evidence strongly suggests the Aktivrente has been abandoned for 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: The government's compromise strategy.** The announcement on Nov 28 that the Junge Union's concerns would be "addressed in a separate text" was a strong signal. This language is far more likely if the plan is to drop the provision from the current bill (P(E|~H) is high) than if the plan is to pass it now (P(E|H) is low). This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
*   **Evidence 2: The Bundestag vote on Dec 5.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The pension package passed the Bundestag, but multiple independent news reports (AP, Munich Eye) and even the government's own website, in describing the passed bill, make no mention of the Aktivrente. This "deafening silence" is extremely unlikely if the provision had passed (P(E|H) is very low) but is exactly what one would expect if it had been removed to secure votes (P(E|~H) is very high). The likelihood ratio heavily favors the conclusion that Aktivrente is not in the bill that passed.
*   **Evidence 3: The announcement of a 2026 reform commission.** On Dec 5, the Chancellor announced a new commission for a "comprehensive pension reform in 2026." This provides the political cover for dropping the Aktivrente, allowing the government to claim it is not abandoning the idea, merely deferring it for proper consideration. This action is much more probable if the Aktivrente failed to pass now (P(E|~H) is high) than if it had just been successfully enacted (P(E|H) is low).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a 65% prior, the evidence provides a massive update downwards. The news from the December 5th vote is the critical factor. The bill that was meant to contain the Aktivrente has passed the Bundestag, and the provision appears to be missing.

The only remaining path for a "Yes" resolution is for the government to introduce and pass an entirely new, separate bill containing the Aktivrente before the end of the year. Given the political compromise already made, the public deferral of the topic to a 2026 commission, and the severe time constraints of the holiday season, the probability of this happening is exceptionally low. The initial 65% prior is completely overwhelmed by this evidence, pushing the posterior probability into the very low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest counter-argument is the possibility of a "definitional gotcha." The resolution criteria state "an extra tax-free allowance," without specifying the amount. The government could theoretically tuck a much smaller, symbolic "mini-Aktivrente" into a different, must-pass end-of-year bill (like a budget or tax law update) to claim a partial victory. This would be a classic parliamentary maneuver. While unlikely, as it would risk re-opening the conflict, this scenario is the most plausible path to an unexpected "Yes" resolution. This possibility prevents the forecast from being 0% or 1%. The chance that all media reports on the Dec 5 vote are simply wrong is extremely small. Therefore, the main uncertainty lies in this "mini-Aktivrente" scenario.

### Final Forecast
The evidence strongly indicates that the Aktivrente was sacrificed to ensure the passage of the broader pension reform package. The bill that passed the Bundestag on December 5 appears not to contain the provision, and the government has publicly signaled its deferral to a 2026 commission. The procedural and political barriers to passing it in a new bill before the end of the year are immense. The small remaining probability accounts for the tail risk of a smaller, symbolic version being passed as part of another last-minute bill.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
For the event of Germany enacting the Aktivrente (an extra tax-free allowance on employment income for people above statutory retirement age) before January 3, 2026, I select a base rate from the reference class of major government reforms with significant internal opposition, as provided in the research report. This class has a historical success rate of around 60-75% for the original, controversial version passing, based on examples in parliamentary systems like Germany's where governments often compromise but still achieve partial wins. I choose this over the broader 90%+ for all government bills because the Aktivrente faces organized factional rebellion within the CDU (e.g., Junge Union), which is a key differentiator. It's also more relevant than the <10% for end-of-year legislation, as that class is too narrow and doesn't fully capture coalition dynamics.

Initial prior: 65% probability (or odds of about 1.86:1 in favor).

This prior draws from general knowledge of German politics: Coalitions like CDU/CSU-SPD typically pass major agendas through discipline and compromise, but internal revolts (e.g., past CDU youth wing pressures on issues like climate or migration) lower the odds without derailing everything.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that it's a major reform package from a governing coalition facing internal dissent within the largest party (CDU), where the government has strong incentives to salvage a win via compromise. For example, historical parallels include Merkel's era coalition compromises on energy or migration reforms, where controversial elements were often diluted or postponed to maintain unity.

However, it's different in critical ways that lower the probability:
- **Timeline compression**: Unlike typical reforms with months for negotiation, we're on December 17, 2025, with Christmas recess looming, making rapid passage of a separate or amended bill logistically improbable (deviating from the base case's assumption of a normal legislative window).
- **Evidence of decoupling**: The Aktivrente appears to have been explicitly separated and dropped from the core package passed on December 5, with a pivot to a 2026 commission— a maneuver not always present in base cases, signaling postponement.
- **Slim majority and veto players**: The 12-seat majority and Junge Union's 18 members give rebels outsized leverage, more acute than in some base cases where opposition was less organized or numerically decisive.

These differences matter because they amplify procedural and political barriers, pushing toward compromise by excision rather than full passage.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I'll evaluate key pieces from the research report and background, focusing on likelihood ratios (LR = P(E | H) / P(E | ~H), where H is "Aktivrente enacted before 2026").

- **December 5 Bundestag passage without Aktivrente mention (↓↓↓, Large effect)**: If H is true (enacted), we'd expect reports to highlight this controversial win; omission is unlikely (P(E|H) ~10%). If ~H (not enacted), omission fits a dropped provision (P(E|~H) ~90%). LR ~0.11 (strongly decreases probability).
- **Merz's announcement of 2026 reform commission (↓↓, Large effect)**: Under H, this would seem redundant or contradictory (P(E|H) ~20%). Under ~H, it's a classic deferral tactic (P(E|~H) ~80%). LR ~0.25 (decreases probability).
- **Tight legislative calendar (December 17, with recess) (↓↓, Large effect)**: Enacting requires Bundestag/Bundesrat action in ~2 weeks; feasible under H only with extraordinary effort (P(E|H) ~5%), but expected under ~H due to norms (P(E|~H) ~95%). LR ~0.05 (strongly decreases).
- **Junge Union rebellion and need for compromise (↓, Moderate effect)**: Rebellion is likely regardless, but under H, government pushes through (P(E|H) ~60%); under ~H, it forces dropping (P(E|~H) ~90%). LR ~0.67 (mildly decreases).
- **Merz's November 28 statement expecting approval (↑, Small effect)**: This shows will; more likely under H (P(E|H) ~80%) than ~H (P(E|~H) ~40%). LR ~2.0 (mildly increases), but it's pre-compromise and refers to the package broadly.

Net: Overwhelmingly negative evidence, with strong LRs pulling downward; the positive is minor and outdated.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds: 65% probability → odds = 0.65 / 0.35 ≈ 1.86:1.

Apply key updates sequentially (grouping for simplicity):

- First, update on Dec 5 passage omission + 2026 commission (combined LR ~0.11 * 0.25 ≈ 0.0275): Posterior odds = 1.86 * 0.0275 ≈ 0.051:1 → Probability = 0.051 / (1 + 0.051) ≈ 5%.
- Then, incorporate calendar constraints (LR ~0.05): Posterior odds = 0.051 * 0.05 ≈ 0.00255:1 → Probability ≈ 0.00255 / (1 + 0.00255) ≈ 0.25%.
- Minor adjustments for rebellion (LR 0.67) and Merz statement (LR 2.0): Net LR ~1.34 → Posterior odds ≈ 0.00255 * 1.34 ≈ 0.0034:1 → Probability ≈ 0.34%.

Resulting posterior: ~0.3% (very low). This reflects high uncertainty resolved downward by strong evidence of dropping/postponement, but leaves tiny room for surprises. Confidence is high in the low estimate due to convergent evidence, though uncertainty remains from potential information gaps (e.g., unpublished bill text).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the low posterior—I've applied sharp downward updates based on media reports, but blind spots include: (1) Political misdirection, where Aktivrente is quietly included in a separate tax bill (tail risk ~1-2%, e.g., emergency session); (2) Definitional edge cases, like a "mini-Aktivrente" snuck in (though unlikely per criteria); (3) Bundesrat wildcard, but this actually reinforces low odds by adding hurdles.

Alternative forecast: A more optimistic 10-20% if assuming the government could fast-track a standalone bill with Greens' support, plausible because Merz's capital might enable a hail-mary push. Rebuttal: Time is too short (Dec 17 to Jan 3), and evidence shows explicit postponement to 2026, making this scenario low-probability without new indicators (none present). No adjustment needed—my posterior already covers slim tails (~0.3% implies <1% for surprises), avoiding big swings per calibration advice.

Final: 1%
