### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All-Stars in the Post-PASPA Era (2018-2024):** This is the most specific reference class. In the ~6.5 years since the Supreme Court ruling, across a pool of thousands of active and former All-Stars, there have been **zero** suspensions for sports betting. The base rate is effectively 0%.
    *   *Reasoning:* This class perfectly matches the population (All-Stars) and the legal/cultural environment (widespread legal betting).
    *   *Limitations:* This is a "zero-numerator" problem. The absence of an event in a relatively short, rapidly changing period is not strong evidence it will never happen. The environment of 2024-2025 is significantly different from 2018-2021 in terms of betting accessibility and league enforcement.

2.  **All Players (Non-All-Stars Included) in the Post-PASPA Era (2018-2024):** There have been dozens of suspensions across the four major leagues since 2018. The NFL has seen the most, with over a dozen players suspended. The NBA, MLB, and NHL have each had recent, significant cases.
    *   *Reasoning:* This provides a non-zero base rate for the general phenomenon of professional athletes being suspended for gambling. A rough estimate is ~25-30 suspensions over ~35,000 player-seasons, yielding a base rate of **~0.08% per player-year**.
    *   *Limitations:* This class is not specific to All-Stars, who have different incentives, scrutiny, and financial resources than the average player, making them a potentially lower-risk subgroup.

3.  **High-Profile Player Scandals (Non-Betting):** The rate at which high-profile, wealthy athletes face career-altering scandals (e.g., DUIs, domestic violence, PEDs) could serve as a proxy for risk-taking behavior. This occurs at a low but steady rate, perhaps 1-2 notable incidents per year across all leagues.
    *   *Reasoning:* This captures the "black swan" nature of a single individual making a catastrophic error in judgment, which is a core driver of a potential betting scandal.
    *   *Limitations:* The mechanisms and incentives for sports betting are unique and may not correlate well with other types of misconduct.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-15** (Hypothetical): NFL suspends two practice squad players for betting on non-NFL sports from a team facility. — ↑ — Reinforces that league monitoring is active and enforcement is ongoing for even low-level infractions, increasing the chance of catching any violator.
*   **2025-06-20** (Hypothetical): NBA and NBPA announce a joint, enhanced player education program on gambling policies, including mandatory annual training. — ↓ — Proactive measures by the league and players' union may increase awareness and reduce the likelihood of accidental or uninformed violations.
*   **2024-06-04**: MLB issues a lifetime ban to Tucupita Marcano for betting on his own team and suspends four others for betting on MLB games. — ↑ — Demonstrates aggressive enforcement and the use of severe penalties, but also confirms that players are actively violating rules and being caught by data monitoring systems.
*   **2024-04-17**: NBA issues a lifetime ban to Jontay Porter for disclosing confidential information to bettors and betting on games. — ↑ — The first NBA lifetime ban for betting since the 1950s. It set a powerful precedent of zero tolerance and showed that monitoring systems can uncover complex betting schemes.
*   **2024-03-25**: Federal investigation clears Shohei Ohtani, confirming him as a victim in the Ippei Mizuhara betting scandal. — ↑/↓ — While clearing the All-Star (↓), the incident demonstrated that even the sport's biggest names can become deeply entangled in betting investigations, raising the overall salience and perceived proximity of the issue (↑).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Ubiquity & Normalization of Sports Betting:** (Large ↑) The constant barrage of advertising and league partnerships with sportsbooks creates an environment of temptation and normalization, increasing the baseline exposure and risk for all players.
2.  **Sophisticated Integrity Monitoring:** (Large ↑ for detection) Leagues and their data partners (e.g., Sportradar) use sophisticated algorithms to detect anomalous betting patterns. This dramatically increases the probability of getting caught compared to any prior era.
3.  **The "One Bad Apple" Factor:** (Moderate ↑) The outcome hinges on a single individual's actions, which could be driven by hidden addiction, debt, or coercion. This makes the event a stochastic risk that is difficult to predict or prevent entirely.
4.  **Deterrence via Severe Punishment:** (Moderate ↓) The recent lifetime bans for Porter (NBA) and Marcano (MLB) serve as a powerful deterrent. The potential loss of a lucrative career is a massive disincentive.
5.  **All-Star Incentives:** (Large ↓) All-Stars have the most to lose: tens or hundreds of millions in career earnings, endorsement deals, and public reputation. Their financial security makes them less susceptible to the financial temptations of betting.
6.  **Expanded Player Pool ("Ever Been Selected"):** (Small ↑) The question includes retired All-Stars. This group is not subject to active team/league oversight and may face different financial pressures, slightly increasing the overall risk pool.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **All-Star Status as a Shield:** Unlike the general player population (base rate #2), All-Stars have immense financial and reputational capital at risk, creating a powerful disincentive for this specific behavior.
*   **Unprecedented Enforcement Technology:** The current environment features a level of digital surveillance of legal betting markets that has no historical precedent. This makes getting away with betting on one's own sport nearly impossible, a stark contrast to past gambling scandals.
*   **Saturated Media Environment:** The sheer volume of betting-related content and partnerships is a new phenomenon. This constant exposure could erode judgment or create temptation in ways not seen in the pre-2018 era

To forecast the probability of at least one All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being banned or suspended for sports betting before 2026, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate 1: All-Stars in the Post-PASPA Era (2018-2024):** The base rate is effectively 0% as there have been no suspensions for sports betting among All-Stars in this period.
- **Base Rate 2: All Players (Non-All-Stars Included) in the Post-PASPA Era (2018-2024):** Approximately 0.08% per player-year, based on ~25-30 suspensions over ~35,000 player-seasons.
- **Base Rate 3: High-Profile Player Scandals (Non-Betting):** Low but steady rate of 1-2 notable incidents per year across all leagues.

Given the specificity of the event (All-Stars and sports betting), Base Rate 1 is most relevant, but we must adjust for the zero-numerator problem and the broader context provided by Base Rate 2.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The environment of legal sports betting and league enforcement remains consistent with the post-PASPA era.
- **Differences:** Increased enforcement technology and media saturation could increase detection and temptation, respectively. However, All-Stars have significant financial and reputational incentives to avoid such behavior.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Ubiquity & Normalization of Sports Betting:** Increases exposure and risk (↑).
- **Sophisticated Integrity Monitoring:** Increases detection probability (↑).
- **Deterrence via Severe Punishment:** Decreases likelihood due to strong disincentives (↓).
- **All-Star Incentives:** Decreases likelihood due to high stakes for All-Stars (↓).
- **Expanded Player Pool:** Slightly increases risk by including retired All-Stars (↑).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Start with a very low prior probability, reflecting the 0% base rate for All-Stars.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Consider the increased detection and temptation balanced by strong deterrents and All-Star incentives.
- **Posterior Odds:** Adjust the prior odds upwards slightly due to increased detection and temptation, but not significantly due to strong deterrents and incentives.
- **Posterior Probability:** The probability remains low but is adjusted upwards from the base rate of 0%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The zero-numerator issue suggests caution in assuming the event will not occur.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider the possibility of a high-profile All-Star succumbing to hidden pressures or addiction.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a slightly higher probability due to the stochastic nature of individual behavior.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and adjustments for potential biases, the final probability reflects a cautious increase from the base rate due to the factors discussed.

Final: 5%

# Will an All-Star be banned/suspended for sports betting before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for an All-Star from the NFL, NBA, MLB, or NHL being banned or suspended for sports betting in the remaining ~2.5 months of 2025.

The most relevant base rate comes from the post-PASPA era (2018-2024), where:
- Zero All-Stars have been suspended for sports betting across all four leagues
- Approximately 25-30 non-All-Star players have been suspended for betting violations
- There are roughly 200-250 active All-Stars across the four leagues at any given time

Given the zero occurrences in the specific reference class, I need to consider a broader reference class. If we estimate:
- ~25-30 suspensions out of ~35,000 player-seasons = ~0.08% per player-year
- All-Stars likely have lower risk factors (more to lose, better financial position)
- But also potentially higher risk factors (more attention from bettors, more opportunities)

I'll set a conservative prior of **0.5% chance per year** for an All-Star to be suspended for betting, which translates to approximately **0.1% for the remaining 2.5 months of 2025**.

**Prior probability: 0.1%** (or odds of 1:999)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The legal environment remains similar to the 2018-2024 period
- League policies on sports betting remain strict with severe penalties
- Monitoring systems for detecting violations are in place

**Differences from base case:**
- Sports betting has become increasingly normalized and accessible since 2018
- Recent high-profile cases (Porter, Marcano) have increased awareness of enforcement
- The question includes any player who has "ever been selected" as an All-Star, which includes retired players who may face different financial pressures
- Monitoring technology has become more sophisticated, increasing detection probability

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Zero All-Star suspensions since 2018**
- P(E|H): If an All-Star will be suspended, how likely would we see zero cases so far? Moderately unlikely (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If no All-Star will be suspended, how likely would we see zero cases? Very likely (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.95 = 0.32 (evidence against the hypothesis)

**Evidence 2: Recent high-profile suspensions (Porter, Marcano)**
- P(E|H): If an All-Star will be suspended, how likely would we see these recent cases? Quite likely (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If no All-Star will be suspended, how likely would we see these cases? Moderately likely (~0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6 (weak evidence for the hypothesis)

**Evidence 3: Increased sophistication of monitoring systems**
- P(E|H): If an All-Star will be suspended, how likely would monitoring systems improve? Very likely (~0.9)
- P(E|~H): If no All-Star will be suspended, how likely would monitoring systems improve? Likely (~0.7)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.7 = 1.29 (weak evidence for the hypothesis)

**Evidence 4: All-Stars have more to lose**
- P(E|H): If an All-Star will be suspended, how likely would they have more to lose? Somewhat unlikely (~0.4)
- P(E|~H): If no All-Star will be suspended, how likely would they have more to lose? Very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.9 = 0.44 (evidence against the hypothesis)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:999 (0.1%)

Update on Evidence 1 (zero cases so far):
- Posterior odds = 1:999 × 0.32 = 0.32:999 ≈ 1:3122
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.032%

Update on Evidence 2 (recent high-profile cases):
- Posterior odds = 1:3122 × 1.6 = 1.6:3122 ≈ 1:1951
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.051%

Update on Evidence 3 (improved monitoring):
- Posterior odds = 1:1951 × 1.29 = 2.064:1951 ≈ 1:945
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.106%

Update on Evidence 4 (All-Stars have more to lose):
- Posterior odds = 1:945 × 0.44 = 0.44:945 ≈ 1:2148
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.047%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the "one bad apple" factor - it only takes a single All-Star making a poor decision
- The inclusion of former/retired All-Stars significantly expands the pool and includes individuals who may face financial difficulties
- The question covers a short time period (2.5 months), but the event is rare enough that timing is largely stochastic
- I might be overweighting the deterrent effect of recent suspensions

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A retired All-Star facing financial difficulties could be tempted to place bets
- An All-Star might bet through proxies, believing they won't get caught
- The increasing normalization of betting could lead to accidental violations of league policies
- The expanded definition of "All-Star" across four leagues creates a larger pool than I initially considered

**Adjustments:**
- The pool of "ever been selected" All-Stars is much larger than active All-Stars, perhaps 1000+ individuals
- The short timeframe (2.5 months) is partially offset by the large pool size
- The stochastic nature of the event means even with low individual probabilities, the cumulative risk across a large pool is non-negligible

After considering these factors, I should adjust my estimate upward to account for the expanded pool size and potential blind spots.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the expanded pool of "ever been selected" All-Stars (1000+ individuals), the short timeframe (2.5 months), the sophisticated monitoring systems, and the stochastic nature of individual decision-making, I adjust my final probability to:

Final: 0.2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is derived from the observed frequency of sports betting suspensions among all professional athletes in the four major US leagues since the widespread legalization of sports betting in 2018.

- **Reference Class:** All players in the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL from mid-2018 to the present.
- **Data:** There have been dozens of suspensions in this period. A reasonable estimate is approximately 3-4 major "incidents" (which can involve multiple players) leading to suspensions per year across these leagues.
- **Initial Calculation:** Let's establish a base rate for an incident occurring. The key is to determine the probability that such an incident involves an All-Star.
    - Active players in the four leagues: ~3,700.
    - Active All-Stars in a given year: ~230.
    - Proportion of All-Stars: ~230 / 3,700 ≈ 6%.
- **Prior Assumption:** If the risk of committing a suspendable offense were randomly distributed across the player population, there would be a 6% chance that any given incident involves an All-Star. With 3-4 incidents per year, a rough initial prior for at least one All-Star being involved in a year is approximately 1 - (1 - 0.06)^3.5 ≈ 20%.
- **Prior Probability P(H): 20%**. This will be our starting point before considering evidence specific to All-Stars.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case (an average player) in one crucial way: the subject is an All-Star.

- **Similarities:** All-Stars are subject to the same league rules, temptations from a betting-saturated environment, and sophisticated league monitoring as any other player.
- **Differences:**
    - **Incentives:** This is the most significant difference. All-Stars have vastly more to lose. A suspension could jeopardize tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in salary and endorsements, plus their public reputation. The players suspended to date (e.g., Jontay Porter, Tucupita Marcano) have been fringe or low-salaried players, for whom the financial incentives to cheat are different. This strongly suggests All-Stars are a much lower-risk population.
    - **Support Systems:** All-Stars typically have a larger network of agents, managers, and advisors dedicated to protecting their careers and finances, which should theoretically reduce risk. However, the Shohei Ohtani/Ippei Mizuhara scandal shows this can also be a vector for risk.

Because the disincentives are so massive, the initial 20% prior, which assumes equal risk, is far too high. The risk for an All-Star is likely an order of magnitude lower than for a marginal player.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We must update our prior based on key evidence.

- **Evidence 1: All players suspended to date have been non-All-Stars.**
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is low. It is much more likely we would see this pattern of only non-All-Stars being suspended if the true risk for All-Stars is very low (H is false) than if it were significant (H is true).
    - **Impact:** This evidence strongly pushes our probability down. Let's apply a "discount factor" to our initial 20% prior. A 5x reduction in likelihood seems conservative given the enormous difference in financial stakes.
    - **Update:** Prior odds were 0.20 / 0.80 = 0.25. Applying a 1/5 likelihood ratio gives new odds of 0.05, which corresponds to a probability of **~5%**. This will be our new, adjusted prior for an annual event.

- **Evidence 2: The recent lifetime bans of Jontay Porter (NBA) and Tucupita Marcano (MLB) in 2024.**
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is greater than 1.
    - **Impact:** Increases probability. This evidence confirms that leagues' monitoring systems are effective at catching rule-breakers and that the leagues are willing to apply the harshest possible penalties. This increases the probability that *any* player who violates the rules—including a hypothetical All-Star—will be caught and suspended.

- **Evidence 3: The Shohei Ohtani scandal.**
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is greater than 1.
    - **Impact:** Increases probability. While Ohtani was cleared, this event demonstrated that even the biggest superstars are not insulated from the world of sports betting. It established a plausible scenario where a star becomes embroiled in a scandal through their entourage, making the abstract risk feel much more concrete.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with our adjusted annual prior of 5% and consider the timing.

- **Adjusted Prior for 2025:** 5%.
- **Timing:** The question resolves at the end of 2025. The current date is October 10, 2025. Approximately 86% of the year has passed without an event.
- **Impact of Time:** This is strong evidence against the event occurring. If the risk were uniformly distributed throughout the year, the remaining probability would be very low (around 0.7%). However, risk is not uniform. The NFL season, the most heavily bet-on sport, is currently in full swing. A significant portion of the annual risk is concentrated in the final quarter of the year.
- **Model:** Let's assume half of the year's total risk is concentrated in the final three months (Oct-Dec).
    - Our annual probability is 5%.
    - The risk for the final quarter of the year would be 0.5 * 5% = 2.5%.
- **Additional Risk Factor:** The resolution criteria include any player who has *ever* been an All-Star. This includes retired players who are not subject to the same seasonal risk but could be banned for other betting-related activities (e.g., involvement in a betting ring). This adds a small, constant background risk. Let's add 0.5% for this possibility.
- **Posterior Probability:** 2.5% (from active players in the current high-risk season) + 0.5% (from retired players/other scenarios) = **3.0%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Why might the forecast be too low?** The primary reason is the "ticking time bomb" scenario. An investigation into an All-Star could have been ongoing for months and could be announced at any time, making my time-decay adjustment invalid. Furthermore, the risk might be driven by a "black swan" event—a single individual's irrational behavior due to addiction or coercion, which is difficult to model with base rates. The Metaculus community prediction is significantly higher (currently 15%), suggesting I may be overweighting the "rational actor" disincentives.
- **Why might the forecast be too high?** The deterrence from recent lifetime bans may be nearly perfect for high-earning players. The financial and reputational "shield" of an All-Star might be even stronger than I modeled, making the true probability closer to zero. Leagues might also be incentivized to handle a superstar's minor infraction internally to avoid a brand-damaging scandal.
- **Conclusion:** My 3% estimate balances these factors. It acknowledges that the event is unlikely but recognizes that the current period is high-risk and that non-seasonal factors (like ongoing investigations or retired players) contribute to the probability. It is a significant downward revision from a naive base rate, reflecting the powerful disincentives for All-Stars, while remaining above zero to account for black swan risks.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability is low but not negligible. The base rate of betting suspensions is now established, but the powerful disincentives for All-Stars make them a very low-risk subgroup. The fact that most of 2025 has passed without an incident is strong evidence, but the current high-risk NFL season and the possibility of a pre-existing investigation being concluded prevent the probability from dropping to near-zero.

Final: 3%
