Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Reference Class Analysis:** What is the historical performance of candidates in Chilean presidential runoffs? Specifically, how often does the first-round winner win the second round? How do vote transfers from eliminated candidates typically work, especially in polarized contests?
2.  **Electoral Mathematics:** What was the precise breakdown of the first-round vote? Who were the other right-of-center candidates who collectively secured ~45% of the vote? What are their ideologies and voter bases?
3.  **Current Political Environment:** What are the dominant issues for Chilean voters in late 2025? How do the public's primary concerns (e.g., crime, immigration, economy, social welfare) align with each candidate's platform and perceived strengths?
4.  **Candidate-Specific Factors:** What are the key strengths and weaknesses of Jara and Kast? How does Jara's Communist Party affiliation play with centrist voters? How does Kast's association with Pinochet affect his ability to attract voters beyond his base?
5.  **Campaign Dynamics:** What has happened between the first round (Nov 16) and today (Dec 11)? Have there been significant endorsements from defeated candidates? How did the candidates perform in any final debates? What do the latest (hypothetical) polls indicate?

### **Step 2: Proposed Search Queries**

1.  **Reference Class:**
    *   `Chilean presidential election runoff results history`
    *   `Chile election first round winner loses runoff`
    *   `voter transfer analysis Chilean elections second round`
    *   `2021 Chilean election Kast vs Boric first round results`
2.  **Electoral Mathematics:**

    *   `Cadem poll crime immigration Chile 2025`
    *   `President Gabriel Boric approval rating December 2025`
4.  **Candidate-Specific Factors:**

### **Step 3: Synthesis of Findings**

Based on the provided background and general knowledge of Chilean politics, the central dynamic is the massive structural advantage for Kast heading into the runoff. While Jara won the first round, this appears to be a result of a fractured right-wing field. The combined 70% vote for right-of-center candidates is the single most important data point. The political climate, dominated by concerns over crime and immigration, strongly favors Kast's law-and-order platform and puts Jara, as a member of the incumbent government, on the defensive. The 2021 election, where Kast won the first round but lost the runoff to Boric, serves as a crucial point of contrast. In 2021, the combined center-left vote was larger than the right's, allowing Boric to consolidate. The 2025 scenario is the inverse of this, with the right holding a commanding first-round majority. Jara's primary challenge is the "anti-communist" sentiment in a significant portion of the electorate, which will make it extremely difficult to attract the centrist voters she needs. Kast's challenge is to not alienate moderate voters with his rhetoric, but the electoral math gives him a very wide margin for error.

### **Step 4: Draft Research Brief**

---

### **Reference class & base rates**

*   **Chilean Presidential Runoffs (since 1999):** There have been six runoffs. The candidate who won the first round went on to win the presidency in four of those six instances (approx. 67% base rate). However, a key recent counterexample is the 2021 election, where José Antonio Kast won the first round but lost the runoff to Gabriel Boric. This suggests the base rate is weak and highly context-dependent.
*   **Runoffs with a Strong Ideological Bloc Majority:** A more relevant reference class is elections where the combined first-round vote for one ideological bloc significantly outweighs the other. In this case, right-of-center candidates won ~70% of the vote vs. the left's ~27%. In such scenarios, the candidate from the majority bloc is overwhelmingly likely to win, as they have a much larger and more accessible pool of voters to consolidate. The base rate for this class is likely >90%.
*   **Incumbent Coalition Performance:** In Latin America, incumbent parties or coalitions often face headwinds, especially amid economic struggles or rising crime. The base rate for an incumbent coalition candidate winning is likely below 50%, though this varies greatly by country and context.

### **Recent developments (timeline bullets)**

*   **2025-11-16** First-round election results show Jara (26.9%) narrowly ahead of Kast (23.9%), but with a combined 70% vote for right-of-center candidates. ↓ (for Jara) — This result revealed a massive rightward tilt in the electorate, creating a very high barrier for Jara to win the runoff.
*   **2025-11-18** (Assumed) The three other major opposition candidates who ran to the right of the government begin to coalesce around Kast, with formal endorsements expected. ↓ — Endorsements will signal to voters that Kast is the consensus candidate of the opposition, facilitating vote transfers.
*   **2025-11-29** OECD report praises pension reform led by Jara. ↑ — Reinforces Jara's core message of social improvements and competence as a minister, but likely a minor factor compared to security concerns.
*   **2025-12-08** (Assumed) Final televised debate occurs. Kast focuses heavily on crime and border control, while Jara defends the government's record and focuses on social programs. ↓ — With crime as a top issue, Kast's focused message likely resonated more strongly with the large pool of undecided and center-right voters.

### **Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)**

*   **Right-Wing Voter Consolidation (Large):** Kast's path to victory is straightforward: unite the voters of the other opposition candidates. Given the ideological proximity, this is a far easier task than Jara's, who must persuade voters who explicitly chose a right-of-center candidate.
*   **Salience of Crime and Immigration (Large):** Public anxiety over security provides a powerful tailwind for Kast's hardline law-and-order platform and serves as a major vulnerability for Jara and the incumbent government.
*   **Anti-Communist Sentiment (Moderate-Large):** Jara's affiliation with the Communist Party, a first for a major presidential contender, is a significant liability. It will be used by Kast's campaign to activate fear and consolidate right-wing and centrist voters who are skeptical of the far-left.
*   **Incumbency Drag (Moderate):** As a minister in the Boric administration, Jara is tied to the government's performance. Any public dissatisfaction with the status quo on the economy, security, or immigration will reflect negatively on her.
*   **Jara's Policy Record (Small-Moderate):** Jara's popular achievements as Labor Minister (40-hour work week, pension reform) are her main assets. This solidifies her base but may be insufficient to overcome the broader political headwinds and security concerns.

### **Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)**

*   **Reversal of 2021 Dynamics:** Unlike the 2021 election where the anti-Kast vote was larger and easier to unify, the 2025 first-round results show a fragmented right that is nonetheless a dominant majority (70%). The core dynamic is now pro-Kast consolidation, not anti-Kast unity.
*   **First-Ever Communist Frontrunner:** Chile has never had a Communist Party candidate win the first round of a presidential election. This introduces a unique and polarizing variable, likely hardening opposition and making centrist votes very difficult for Jara to obtain.
*   **Issue Environment Shift:** The political focus has decisively shifted from the social justice and constitutional reform demands of 2019-2021 to "bread and butter"

To forecast the outcome of the 2025 Chilean presidential election runoff between Jeannette Jara and José Antonio Kast, we will apply Bayesian reasoning as follows:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Jeannette Jara**: Historically, the candidate who wins the first round of Chilean presidential elections has a 67% chance of winning the runoff. However, given the unique context of this election, where the right-of-center candidates collectively secured 70% of the vote, the base rate for Jara is significantly lower. The base rate for an incumbent coalition candidate winning is likely below 50%, especially amid economic struggles or rising crime.
  
- **José Antonio Kast**: Given the right-of-center candidates' collective 70% first-round vote, Kast's base rate is much higher. In scenarios where one ideological bloc significantly outweighs the other, the candidate from the majority bloc is overwhelmingly likely to win, suggesting a base rate for Kast of >90%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Jeannette Jara**: Unlike typical first-round winners, Jara faces a fragmented but dominant right-wing bloc. Her Communist Party affiliation is unprecedented in Chilean presidential elections, introducing a polarizing factor that may deter centrist voters.

- **José Antonio Kast**: The current scenario is favorable for Kast, as the right-wing bloc's majority mirrors situations where the majority bloc candidate wins. However, his association with Pinochet could alienate some moderate voters.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Right-Wing Vote Consolidation**: The likelihood of right-wing voters consolidating behind Kast is high (P(E | H) for Kast is high), given the ideological proximity and endorsements from other right-wing candidates.
  
- **Public Concerns on Crime and Immigration**: These issues favor Kast's platform, making it more likely that voters concerned with these issues will support him (P(E | H) for Kast is high).

- **Jara's Policy Achievements**: While Jara's achievements as Labor Minister are positive, they are less likely to sway voters concerned with security issues (P(E | H) for Jara is low).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Initial Prior Odds**: Assume a prior probability of 10% for Jara and 90% for Kast based on the ideological bloc majority.
  
- **Likelihood Ratio for Right-Wing Consolidation**: Given the strong likelihood of right-wing consolidation, the likelihood ratio heavily favors Kast. This increases his posterior probability significantly.

- **Posterior Probability**: After considering the evidence, Kast's probability increases further, while Jara's decreases.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: While the evidence strongly favors Kast, overconfidence in political forecasts can be risky. Consider potential shifts in public opinion or unexpected events that could alter the dynamics.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant shift in public sentiment towards social welfare issues or a major campaign misstep by Kast could increase Jara's chances.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the evidence and base rates.

### 7. Output Format

Based on the analysis, the final forecast is:

Jeannette Jara: 15%  
José Antonio Kast: 85%

# Forecasting the 2025 Chilean Presidential Election Runoff

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this election, I'll consider several relevant base rates:

**First-round winner in Chilean runoffs:**
- Historically, first-round winners win the runoff about 67% of the time in Chile (4 out of 6 cases)
- This would favor Jara (26.9%) who narrowly led Kast (23.9%)

**Ideological bloc majority:**
- When one ideological bloc has a significant majority in the first round, their candidate typically wins
- Right-of-center candidates collectively won 70% of the first-round vote
- This strongly favors Kast

**Incumbent coalition performance:**
- Incumbent parties/coalitions in Latin America often struggle to maintain power, especially amid rising crime and economic challenges
- Jara represents the incumbent Unidad por Chile coalition, which includes her Communist Party
- This disadvantages Jara

Given these considerations, I'll assign a prior based primarily on the ideological bloc distribution (70% right vs 30% left), as this appears to be the most relevant reference class for this specific election. This gives Kast a strong initial advantage.

**Prior probabilities:**
- Jeannette Jara: 30%
- José Antonio Kast: 70%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a polarized runoff between left and right candidates
- The right-wing candidate (Kast) is running on security and anti-immigration platform
- The left-wing candidate (Jara) is associated with the incumbent administration

**Key differences:**
- Jara is the first Communist Party candidate to lead a major coalition and win the first round
- The 70% right-wing vote in the first round is an unusually strong showing
- The 2025 election occurs amid a significant crime wave and immigration crisis
- This is Kast's third presidential run (he lost to Boric in 2021)

These differences significantly strengthen Kast's position compared to a typical runoff. The rightward shift in the electorate and the salience of crime and immigration create a favorable environment for his candidacy.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: First-round vote distribution (70% right vs 30% left)**
- P(E|Kast wins): Very high (~0.9) - This vote distribution strongly supports a Kast victory
- P(E|Jara wins): Very low (~0.1) - For Jara to win, she would need to attract a significant portion of right-wing voters, which is highly unlikely

**Evidence 2: Rising crime and immigration concerns**
- P(E|Kast wins): High (~0.8) - These issues favor Kast's law-and-order platform
- P(E|Jara wins): Moderate (~0.4) - While challenging for Jara, she could potentially address these concerns with her own security proposals

**Evidence 3: Jara's Communist Party affiliation**
- P(E|Kast wins): High (~0.8) - This affiliation likely limits her appeal to centrist voters
- P(E|Jara wins): Low (~0.2) - Her communist identity creates a ceiling on her potential support

**Evidence 4: Jara's record as Labor Minister (minimum wage increase, 40-hour workweek)**
- P(E|Kast wins): Moderate (~0.5) - These achievements don't significantly hurt Kast's chances
- P(E|Jara wins): Moderate-high (~0.7) - These popular reforms strengthen her case but may not overcome security concerns

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on the first-round vote distribution (70% right vs 30% left):

Prior odds for Kast: 70/30 = 2.33
Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.1 = 9
Posterior odds: 2.33 × 9 = 21

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability for Kast: 21/(1+21) = 0.955 or ~96%
Posterior probability for Jara: 1 - 0.96 = 0.04 or ~4%

This initial update seems too extreme. Let's adjust for the fact that not all right-wing voters will automatically transfer to Kast. Some moderate right voters might be uncomfortable with his Pinochet praise or extreme positions.

Adjusting the likelihood ratio to 0.8/0.2 = 4:
Posterior odds: 2.33 × 4 = 9.32
Posterior probability for Kast: 9.32/(1+9.32) = 0.903 or ~90%
Posterior probability for Jara: 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 or ~10%

Now let's update based on Jara's Communist Party affiliation:
Prior odds (after first update): 90/10 = 9
Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
Posterior odds: 9 × 4 = 36
Posterior probability for Kast: 36/(1+36) = 0.973 or ~97%
Posterior probability for Jara: 1 - 0.97 = 0.03 or ~3%

Again, this seems too extreme. Let's adjust our update to account for Jara's positive record as Labor Minister, which might partially offset concerns about her party affiliation.

Final adjusted posterior:
- José Antonio Kast: 85%
- Jeannette Jara: 15%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the first-round vote distribution. Not all right-wing voters will automatically support Kast.
- I might be underestimating Jara's ability to appeal to moderate voters based on her record as Labor Minister.
- The research doesn't mention recent polling for the runoff, which could provide more direct evidence.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Kast's praise for Pinochet could alienate moderate right-wing voters who prioritize democratic stability.
- Jara could successfully frame the election as a choice between social progress and a return to authoritarianism.
- Turnout dynamics could favor Jara if left-wing voters are more motivated to prevent a Kast presidency.

**Best alternative forecast:**
- Kast: 65%, Jara: 35% - This alternative gives more weight to Jara's ability to attract moderate voters and the possibility that some right-wing voters might be uncomfortable with Kast's extremism.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The 70% first-round vote for right-wing candidates is a massive structural advantage that would be extremely difficult for Jara to overcome.
- The salience of crime and immigration strongly favors Kast's platform.
- Jara's Communist Party affiliation creates a ceiling on her potential support.

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly to account for uncertainty:

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting my forecast to account for uncertainty while maintaining the strong structural advantage for Kast:

- José Antonio Kast: 80%
- Jeannette Jara: 20%

This forecast reflects the significant structural advantage Kast has given the first-round vote distribution and issue environment, while acknowledging some uncertainty about voter behavior in the runoff.

## 7. Output Format

José Antonio Kast: 80%
Jeannette Jara: 20%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on a careful Bayesian analysis of the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is not simply the historical success rate of first-round winners in Chilean runoffs (4 of 6, or 67%), as this ignores the underlying vote distribution. A more relevant reference class is **runoffs where the combined first-round vote for one ideological bloc significantly outweighs the other.**

In this case, right-of-center candidates won a combined 70% of the vote, while the left-of-center incumbent coalition's candidate, Jeannette Jara, won 26.9%. In such scenarios, the candidate from the majority bloc has a much larger and more ideologically aligned pool of voters to draw from. The probability of that candidate winning is very high. I will set a prior based on this strong structural advantage for José Antonio Kast.

*   **Prior P(Kast wins): 85%**
*   **Prior P(Jara wins): 15%**

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is a strong fit for the base case of a dominant ideological bloc. The key differences from a generic scenario actually strengthen the prior for Kast:

*   **Similarity:** The 70% right-of-center vote share is the defining feature, aligning perfectly with the base case.
*   **Difference (strengthens prior for Kast):** Jeannette Jara is a member of the Communist Party. This is a highly polarizing affiliation in Chile and will likely make it extremely difficult for her to attract the centrist and moderate-right voters she needs to win. This acts as a barrier to her expanding beyond her base.
*   **Difference (strengthens prior for Kast):** Jara is a minister in the incumbent government of Gabriel Boric. With crime and illegal immigration being major public concerns, voters are likely to hold the incumbent administration responsible, creating a significant headwind for its candidate.
*   **Difference (weakens prior for Kast):** Kast lost the 2021 runoff after winning the first round. However, the electoral math was inverted in 2021; the combined center-left vote was larger, allowing Boric to consolidate the anti-Kast vote. The 2025 scenario is a reversal of this dynamic.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the prior odds (Prior Odds for Kast = 0.85 / 0.15 ≈ 5.67 to 1).

*   **Evidence 1: The dominant issues are a massive rise in crime and illegal immigration.**
    *   P(E | Kast wins): High. Kast's hardline, law-and-order platform is perfectly tailored to these concerns.
    *   P(E | Jara wins): Low. As part of the incumbent government, she is on the defensive on these issues.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strongly increases the probability of a Kast victory.

*   **Evidence 2: Jara is the first Communist candidate to win the first round for a broad coalition.**
    *   P(E | Kast wins): High. The "communist" label is a powerful tool for Kast to consolidate the entire right-wing and centrist vote against Jara.
    *   P(E | Jara wins): Low. This label is a major liability that severely limits her ability to attract voters from outside the hard left.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence also strongly increases the probability of a Kast victory.

*   **Evidence 3: Jara won the first round (26.9% vs. Kast's 23.9%).**
    *   P(E | Kast wins): Moderate. This is entirely plausible in a scenario where the right-wing vote was fractured among multiple candidates, which is what happened.
    *   P(E | Jara wins): High. Winning the first round is generally a positive signal.
    *   **Impact:** This is the strongest piece of evidence for Jara, but its importance is heavily diluted by the 70% total for the right-wing bloc. It slightly decreases the probability of a Kast victory.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update.
*   **Start with Prior Odds:** 5.67 to 1 in favor of Kast (85%).
*   **Update with Evidence 1 & 2 (Crime issue + Jara's party):** These are powerful factors that make Kast's path to consolidating the 70% bloc much easier. The likelihood ratio for this evidence easily favors Kast by a factor of 2 or more. Let's apply a conservative likelihood ratio of 2.0.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 5.67 * 2.0 = 11.34 to 1.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of P(Kast wins) ≈ 11.34 / (1 + 11.34) ≈ 92%.
*   **Update with Evidence 3 (Jara's first-round win):** This provides a small counterweight. It suggests Jara has a motivated base and some momentum. This might slightly reduce Kast's chances. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 1.3 in favor of Jara (or 1/1.3 ≈ 0.77 for Kast).
    *   Final Odds ≈ 11.34 * 0.77 = 8.73 to 1.
    *   Final P(Kast wins) ≈ 8.73 / (1 + 8.73) ≈ 89.7%.

Rounding this gives a probability of around 90% for Kast.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is highly confident in Kast. What could go wrong? The main risk is that I am overestimating the ideological cohesion of the 70% "right-of-center" bloc. Kast's praise for Pinochet could be a major liability, potentially causing moderate-right voters to abstain in the runoff rather than vote for a candidate they see as an extremist. This is how Boric defeated Kast in 2021.

However, the political environment has shifted dramatically since 2021. The salience of crime and immigration likely makes voters more willing to overlook Kast's rhetoric in favor of his perceived strength on security. Furthermore, Jara's Communist Party affiliation is a much stronger polarizing factor than Boric's student-activist background, making an "anti-Jara" coalition easier to form than the "anti-Kast" coalition of 2021.

The path for a Jara victory is narrow: she must successfully brand Kast as an unacceptable threat to democracy *and* convince voters that this threat is greater than their fears about crime and communism. This is possible, but the electoral math is brutal. She needs to convert a huge number of voters who chose an opposition candidate.

To account for the small but real possibility of an anti-Kast consolidation, I will slightly reduce my confidence from 90%. An 87% probability for Kast acknowledges his overwhelming advantage while leaving a 13% chance for a major polling error or a dramatic shift in the campaign's final days.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are internally consistent and sum to 100%.

*   Jeannette Jara: 13%
*   José Antonio Kast: 87%

Jeannette Jara: 13%
José Antonio Kast: 87%
