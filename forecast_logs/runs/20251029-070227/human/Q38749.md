### Reference class & base rates
1.  **CEOs of high-profile, late-stage private U.S. tech companies (>$10B valuation):** This is the tightest reference class. Indictments are exceedingly rare. Over the last decade, among hundreds of such companies (e.g., Stripe, SpaceX, old Uber, Palantir pre-IPO), only a handful of CEOs have faced indictment (e.g., Travis Kalanick was investigated but not indicted; Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos is a notable but extreme exception). The annual base rate is likely well below 1%, perhaps in the 0.1%–0.5% range. For the ~2-month horizon, this implies a base rate of <0.1%.
2.  **S&P 500 CEOs:** This class offers more data but is less specific. A study by the Wall Street Journal found that of 2,191 individuals who served as CEO or CFO of an S&P 500 company between 1997 and 2014, only 29 (1.3%) were charged with a crime related to their work. This suggests an annual indictment rate of roughly 0.08%. This is consistent with the first reference class and points to a very low prior probability.
3.  **Individuals subject to a formal SEC inquiry:** The SEC opens thousands of inquiries annually, but only a fraction lead to enforcement actions, and an even smaller fraction are referred for criminal prosecution leading to indictment. While we know the SEC was reportedly looking into Altman's statements to investors in late 2023, the vast majority of such inquiries are closed without action or result in civil penalties. The probability of it escalating to a criminal indictment within this short timeframe is low, likely in the low single digits.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-28** item — ↓ — In a (hypothetically provided) live broadcast, Altman and his Chief Scientist outlined a new, forward-looking roadmap for OpenAI, signaling business-as-usual and confident leadership, not the behavior of someone expecting an imminent indictment.
*   **2025-05-01 to 2025-10-29** item — ↓ — The absence of any public reporting, leaks, or official announcements regarding an escalation of the previously reported SEC inquiry into Altman or OpenAI. Silence in this context suggests the investigation has either stalled, been closed, or is not progressing towards a near-term criminal referral.
*   **2024-03-08** item — ↓ — (Outside 6-month window but has a strong, lasting effect) OpenAI reinstated Altman to the board after an internal investigation by law firm WilmerHale, with the board expressing "full confidence." This officially resolved the internal conflict that sparked indictment concerns, providing a strong counter-narrative to the original "not candid" allegation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Escalation of Regulatory Scrutiny (Moderate ↑):** The primary path to indictment. If the SEC's 2023 inquiry uncovered evidence of intentional and material misrepresentation to investors and referred the case to the Department of Justice (DOJ), this would be the key driver.
2.  **Whistleblower Emergence (Large ↑):** A former board member or high-level executive could provide new, damning evidence to federal prosecutors, bypassing OpenAI's internal narrative and triggering a swift investigation. This is the most plausible "black swan" driver for a YES resolution.
3.  **Internal Exoneration & Corporate Control (Large ↓):** The WilmerHale investigation, while not a government action, effectively consolidated the narrative in Altman's favor. The company, with its new board, has no incentive to cooperate with an investigation into its CEO and has publicly backed him, creating a high barrier for prosecutors.
4.  **Extremely Short Timeline (Large ↓):** Federal white-collar investigations are notoriously slow and methodical. Moving from an initial inquiry to a grand jury indictment in the ~2 months remaining before the deadline is highly improbable unless an investigation is already in its final stages, for which there is no public evidence.
5.  **High Bar for Criminal Intent (Moderate ↓):** Proving that Altman's lack of candor was not just poor communication or business maneuvering, but a deliberate criminal act (i.e., *mens rea*), is a difficult legal standard to meet.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Unprecedented Corporate Structure:** OpenAI's capped-profit model within a non-profit parent is unique. This creates novel potential for conflicts of interest and misrepresentation to investors, employees, and the board, making it a more complex and potentially fertile ground for investigation than a standard C-corp.
2.  **Public "Smoke" Signal:** Unlike most CEOs who are quietly investigated, Altman's case began with a very public and specific accusation from his own board ("not consistently candid"). This event itself invited regulatory scrutiny that might not have otherwise occurred.
3.  **Extensive Personal Investments:** Altman's significant venture capital activities and investments in companies like Helion and Worldcoin, which have potential dealings with OpenAI, create a larger-than-normal surface area for allegations of self-dealing or conflicts of interest.
4.  **Intense Geopolitical & Public Interest:** As the face of a transformative technology, Altman operates under a microscope. Political pressure or a desire by regulators to make an example of a high-profile AI leader could increase the odds of an investigation escalating, compared to a CEO in a less scrutinized industry.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior based on the reference class of elite tech CEOs, e.g., 0.5% for the remaining ~14-month period from the Nov 2023 ouster to the Jan 2026 deadline. This is an "equivalent n" of ~200 cases with one indictment.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The initial Nov 2023 firing and "not candid" accusation dramatically increased the probability from the base rate.
    *   (↓ Large) The subsequent internal investigation, reinstatement, and board's expression of "full confidence" in March 2024 largely neutralized the initial negative signal.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time remaining (~2 months) acts as a strong suppressor on the probability, as complex investigations rarely conclude this quickly.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The continued lack of public news or leaks about an active, escalating DOJ/SEC investigation over the past year is significant evidence against an imminent indictment.
    *   (↓ Small) The recent (hypothetical) public broadcast in Oct 2025 reinforces the "business-as-usual" narrative.
*   **Net effect:** The initial spike in probability in late 2023 has decayed significantly. The cumulative evidence, especially the internal exoneration and the short timeline, should drive the posterior probability down to a level very close to, or even below, the initial low base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Reports of key OpenAI executives or former board members hiring personal defense attorneys.
    *   Leaks from the DOJ or SEC indicating a grand jury has been convened.
    *   A former board member (e.g., Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley) making new, specific public allegations of illegal conduct.
    *   Sudden, unexplained changes in Altman's public role or travel schedule.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   An official statement from the SEC or OpenAI confirming an inquiry has been closed with no action.
    *   Continued high-profile public appearances and product launches led by Altman.
    *   Positive, forward-looking articles in major financial press (WSJ, FT) about OpenAI's governance and strategy.

### Caveats & pitfalls
1.  **Investigation Under Seal:** A federal grand jury investigation could be proceeding entirely in secret. The lack of public evidence is not definitive proof that nothing is happening.
2.  **WilmerHale Report Bias:** The investigation that cleared Altman was commissioned by a board friendly to him. Its conclusions may not reflect what an independent federal prosecutor would find. The full report was never released publicly.
3.  **State-Level Risk:** While federal indictment is the most discussed path, a state Attorney General (e.g., in California or New York) could launch their own investigation, potentially with different standards or speed.
4.  **Definition of "Indictment":** The resolution criteria are clear, but it's important not to confuse an indictment (a formal criminal charge) with being sued (civil action), being the subject of an investigation, or receiving a Wells notice from the SEC.
5.  **Unknown Unknowns:** The core reason for the board's "not consistently candid" claim remains undisclosed. The risk lies entirely in the unknown substance of that original dispute.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of Sam Altman being indicted before 2026 is extremely low. The initial alarm raised by his 2023 ouster has been substantially mitigated by his internal exoneration and reinstatement, and the very short remaining timeline makes the conclusion of a complex white-collar investigation highly improbable.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The appropriate base rate for this event is derived from the reference class of CEOs of high-profile, late-stage private U.S. tech companies with valuations over $10 billion. Historically, indictments in this group are exceedingly rare, with an annual base rate likely well below 1%, perhaps in the 0.1%–0.5% range. Given the ~2-month horizon remaining, this implies a base rate of <0.1%. Therefore, I will start with a prior probability of 0.5% for the period from now until 2026.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Sam Altman, as a CEO of a high-profile tech company, fits well within the reference class. The rarity of indictments in this group supports a low base rate.
   - Differences: The public nature of Altman's firing and the specific accusation of not being candid with the board are unusual and could increase scrutiny compared to typical cases in the reference class.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Initial Firing and Accusation (↑ Large):** The firing and accusation of not being candid could increase the likelihood of an investigation, raising the probability from the base rate.
   - **Internal Investigation and Reinstatement (↓ Large):** The internal investigation by WilmerHale and Altman's reinstatement with full board confidence significantly decrease the probability, as they suggest resolution of the internal conflict.
   - **Lack of Public Investigation Progress (↓ Moderate):** The absence of public reporting or leaks about an active investigation over the past year decreases the probability, indicating no escalation.
   - **Short Timeline (↓ Large):** The very short time remaining before the deadline makes a complex investigation leading to an indictment highly improbable.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 0.5%, the initial firing and accusation might have increased this to around 5% due to increased scrutiny.
   - The internal investigation and reinstatement likely reduced this back down significantly, perhaps to around 1%.
   - The lack of public investigation progress and the short timeline further reduce the probability, likely bringing it back close to the original base rate of 0.5%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from assuming the internal investigation's conclusions are definitive. However, the lack of public evidence of an ongoing investigation supports a low probability.
   - Alternative scenarios, such as a secret investigation or state-level actions, are possible but unlikely given the lack of indicators.
   - Adjusting for these considerations, the probability remains low, but slightly higher than the absolute base rate due to the initial public nature of the firing.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability is slightly above the base rate but remains very low.

Final: 1%

# Will Sam Altman be indicted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a high-profile tech CEO being indicted within a specific timeframe. The most appropriate reference class is CEOs of high-profile, late-stage private U.S. tech companies with valuations over $10 billion.

Looking at historical data:
- Among hundreds of such companies over the past decade, indictments of CEOs are extremely rare
- The Wall Street Journal study found that of 2,191 S&P 500 CEOs/CFOs over 17 years, only 29 (1.3%) were charged with work-related crimes
- This translates to an annual indictment rate of approximately 0.08%

Given that we're looking at a period from now (October 29, 2025) until January 1, 2026 - approximately 2 months - the base rate would be even lower, around 0.01-0.02%.

However, Altman's situation has some unique factors that might justify a slightly higher prior. The public "not consistently candid" accusation from his board in November 2023 created regulatory attention that most CEOs don't face.

**Prior probability: 0.5%** (accounting for the initial heightened scrutiny but still recognizing the extreme rarity of such indictments)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Altman is the CEO of a major private tech company
- Like most tech CEOs, he operates in a complex regulatory environment
- The vast majority of corporate investigations end without criminal charges

**Key differences:**
- OpenAI's unusual corporate structure (capped-profit within non-profit) creates novel governance complexities
- The public board accusation about lack of candor created a "smoke signal" that invited regulatory scrutiny
- Altman's extensive personal investments in related companies (Helion, Worldcoin) create potential conflict of interest concerns
- The intense public and political interest in AI regulation puts Altman under greater scrutiny than typical tech CEOs

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: The March 2024 internal investigation and board reinstatement**
- P(E|H): If Altman were to be indicted, it's unlikely the board would have reinstated him with "full confidence" after a law firm investigation (probability ~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Altman will not be indicted, this reinstatement is highly expected (probability ~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (strong evidence against indictment)

**Evidence 2: Lack of public reporting on escalation of SEC inquiry**
- P(E|H): If an indictment were imminent, we would likely see leaks, reports, or signs of an escalating investigation (probability of silence ~0.2)
- P(E|~H): If no indictment is forthcoming, this silence is expected (probability ~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25 (moderate evidence against indictment)

**Evidence 3: Extremely short timeline remaining (2 months)**
- P(E|H): If an indictment were to happen, having only 2 months left makes it highly unlikely unless the investigation is already near completion (probability ~0.05)
- P(E|~H): If no indictment is coming, this timeline constraint is irrelevant (probability ~1.0)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/1.0 = 0.05 (very strong evidence against indictment)

**Evidence 4: Recent business-as-usual activities (hypothetical October 2025 broadcast)**
- P(E|H): If Altman were about to be indicted, he would likely be more reserved in public appearances (probability ~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If no indictment is coming, normal business activities are expected (probability ~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (moderate evidence against indictment)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.5% / 99.5% = 0.005 / 0.995 = 0.005025

First update (board reinstatement):
Posterior odds = 0.005025 × 0.11 = 0.000553
Posterior probability = 0.000553 / (1 + 0.000553) ≈ 0.055%

Second update (lack of escalation reports):
Posterior odds = 0.00055 × 0.25 = 0.000138
Posterior probability = 0.000138 / (1 + 0.000138) ≈ 0.014%

Third update (short timeline):
Posterior odds = 0.00014 × 0.05 = 0.000007
Posterior probability = 0.000007 / (1 + 0.000007) ≈ 0.0007%

Fourth update (business-as-usual activities):
Posterior odds = 0.000007 × 0.33 = 0.0000023
Posterior probability = 0.0000023 / (1 + 0.0000023) ≈ 0.00023%

This extremely low probability (0.00023%) seems unreasonably low due to compounding conservative estimates. Let me adjust for potential overconfidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of sealed investigations that show no public signs
- The full details of the original board dispute remain unknown and could contain serious allegations
- State-level prosecutors could move faster than federal ones
- The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 7.6%, suggesting I may be missing something

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A whistleblower could emerge with new, damaging information
- The SEC investigation could be further along than public information suggests
- Political pressure could accelerate an investigation as AI regulation becomes more contentious

**Adjustment for overconfidence:**
My sequential Bayesian updates may have compounded conservative estimates. While each piece of evidence does reduce the probability, I should be cautious about reaching an extremely low probability given the uncertainties involved.

A more reasonable approach would be to start with the 0.5% prior and make a more holistic adjustment based on the totality of evidence, rather than sequential multiplication of likelihood ratios.

Given the strong exonerating evidence (board reinstatement, lack of escalation reports, short timeline), but accounting for unknown unknowns and the possibility of sealed investigations, I'll adjust to a final probability of 0.2%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 0.2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is CEOs of high-profile, late-stage U.S. technology companies with valuations over $10 billion. Indictments in this group are exceedingly rare. The research report cites an annual indictment rate of roughly 0.08% for S&P 500 CEOs and a slightly higher but still very low rate (perhaps 0.1%-0.5%) for the more specific class of elite tech CEOs.

Given the question's time frame (originally ~26 months from Nov 2023 to Jan 2026), a reasonable prior probability for the entire period would be around 1%. This is higher than a simple extrapolation of the annual rate, accounting for the fact that OpenAI's unique structure and high profile might make it a slightly riskier case than the average company in the reference class.
*   **Initial Prior P(H): 1%**

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs significantly from the base case of an average high-profile CEO in one crucial way:
*   **Public "Smoke":** Unlike most CEOs who might be investigated quietly, Sam Altman's case began with a public and serious accusation from his own board: that he was "not consistently candid." This public trigger event dramatically increases the a priori chance of regulatory scrutiny and potential charges compared to a random CEO from the reference class. This means we must immediately move away from the simple base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We will update our prior based on the key events that have transpired since the initial firing.

*   **Evidence 1: The initial firing and "not candid" statement (Nov 2023).**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if Altman had engaged in conduct that could lead to an indictment (P(E|H) is high) than if he hadn't (P(E|~H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1 (>>1).
    *   **Effect:** This evidence dramatically increases the probability from the 1% base rate. At the time, this news could have reasonably pushed the probability into the 15-25% range.

*   **Evidence 2: Reinstatement to the board after a WilmerHale investigation, with the new board expressing "full confidence" (March 2024).**
    *   This is very strong counter-evidence. It is extremely unlikely that a board, after a formal investigation by a top law firm, would reinstate a CEO if they believed there was a significant risk of a criminal indictment related to his duties (P(E|H) is very low). This action is highly probable if the investigation found no criminal wrongdoing (P(E|~H) is very high).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<<1).
    *   **Effect:** This evidence largely neutralizes the negative signal from the firing, driving the probability back down towards the base rate.

*   **Evidence 3: The passage of time and lack of public signals (March 2024 - October 2025).**
    *   As of today's date in the scenario (Oct 29, 2025), over 1.5 years have passed since the reinstatement without any public reports of a grand jury, key witnesses being subpoenaed, or leaks from the DOJ/SEC about an escalating investigation.
    *   This lack of news is evidence against an imminent indictment. While investigations can be secret, complete silence over such a long period makes a near-term resolution less likely.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1 (<1).
    *   **Effect:** This further decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 4: The extremely short remaining timeline (~2 months until Jan 1, 2026).**
    *   Complex white-collar investigations are notoriously slow. For an indictment to occur in the next two months, a federal investigation would almost certainly have to be in its final stages. The lack of public signals (Evidence 3) makes this scenario less probable.
    *   The short timeline acts as a powerful constraint, making a "Yes" resolution much less likely than it was a year ago.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<<1).
    *   **Effect:** This provides the strongest recent downward pressure on the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the updates conceptually:
1.  **Start with a low prior (~1%)**.
2.  The **firing** causes a massive spike in perceived risk (e.g., to ~20%).
3.  The **reinstatement** and internal exoneration act as a powerful rebuttal, pushing the probability most of the way back down (e.g., to ~2-3%).
4.  The long **passage of time** with no negative news, combined with the **imminent deadline**, erodes most of the remaining risk. The probability of an indictment occurring specifically in the next two months, given no prior signals, is very small.

The cumulative effect of the evidence since March 2024 has been to drive the probability down significantly from its peak. The posterior probability should now be very low, albeit still slightly higher than the original base rate to account for the "tail risk" of a secret, nearly-complete investigation.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Main risk for my forecast:** A federal investigation has been proceeding under seal, and an indictment is imminent. The lack of public evidence is a feature of such investigations, not a bug. The WilmerHale report was internal and commissioned by a friendly board; federal prosecutors are not bound by it and may have access to different information (e.g., from a whistleblower like a former board member).
*   **Plausibility of the alternative:** This scenario is plausible and represents the primary path to a "Yes" resolution. The initial "not candid" accusation was serious, and it's conceivable that it triggered a federal inquiry that has been quietly building a case.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this scenario is unlikely. The high-profile nature of the case would make leaks more probable. Furthermore, the timeline is the biggest hurdle. Even if a secret investigation is ongoing, concluding it with a grand jury vote and formal indictment in the next 60 days is highly improbable unless it is already at the finish line.
*   **Adjustment:** The Manifold market is at 7.6%, which seems too high given the time constraints but indicates that the market is taking the "secret investigation" risk more seriously than my initial analysis. I will adjust my final probability upward from a pure calculation (~1%) to account for this model uncertainty and the non-zero possibility of a surprise. A probability of 3% reflects a low likelihood but acknowledges the genuine "smoke" that started this entire affair.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial alarm from Sam Altman's firing in 2023 has been substantially dampened by his subsequent reinstatement after an internal investigation and the long period of silence from regulators. The most powerful factor is now the extremely short timeline, which makes the completion of a complex white-collar case resulting in an indictment highly improbable. The remaining risk stems from the possibility of a secret investigation that is about to be revealed, but the odds of this are low.

Final: 3%
