### Reference class & base rates
*   **IMF-style "Shock Therapy" Programs:** Argentina's plan is a classic example of rapid fiscal and monetary tightening to quell hyperinflation. Historically, such programs have a mixed record. Success often depends on political sustainability. The probability of achieving a specific, low inflation target like <30% YoY within 24 months is not high, as programs often stall or are reversed. **Ballpark base rate: 25-35% success.**
*   **Argentina's Own Stabilization Attempts:** Argentina has a long history of anti-inflation plans. The 1991 Convertibility Plan was highly successful in the short term, crushing inflation rapidly. Most other plans have failed. This history suggests a bimodal outcome: either dramatic success or spectacular failure, with few instances of muddling through. This specific history might suggest a slightly higher chance of short-term success than the general IMF class. **Ballpark base rate: 30-40% success.**
*   **Chronic High-Inflation Countries:** Countries that experience decades of high inflation (e.g., Brazil pre-1994, Turkey) find it incredibly difficult to break inflationary inertia and expectations. From this perspective, a rapid drop to below 30% would be a rare outlier event. **Ballpark base rate: <15% success.**

*Reasoning:* A blended prior should lean on the first two classes, as Milei's program is a deliberate, radical break from the past, fitting the "shock therapy" and "Argentine stabilization attempt" molds more than the "chronic inflation" one. A starting point of **~30%** seems a reasonable, conservative estimate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-15** INDEC reports June 2025 monthly inflation of 1.6%, bringing YoY inflation to 39.4%. (↑) — This is a critical data point, showing monthly inflation is running at a pace consistent with meeting the year-end target.
*   **2025-07-02** Reports confirm May 2025 monthly inflation was 1.5%, with annual rate at 43.5%. (↑) — Reinforces that the low monthly inflation trend is holding, which is essential for the YoY figure to continue its rapid decline.
*   **2025-04-23** IMF maintains its forecast for Argentina's GDP to grow 5.5% in 2025. (↑) — Continued IMF backing and a positive growth outlook lend credibility to the stabilization plan, reducing the risk of imminent collapse.
*   **2025-03-13** Analysis highlights the severe social costs of austerity, including deep recession and rising poverty. (↓) — Underscores the primary risk to the program: that social and political pressure could force the government to abandon its fiscal discipline.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Fiscal Discipline (Large, ↓):** The "no money printing" rule, enabled by achieving a fiscal surplus, is the primary anchor of the program. It has directly halted the main driver of past inflation. Its continuation is paramount.
*   **Monetary Contraction & High Interest Rates (Large, ↓):** By stopping the financing of the treasury and maintaining tight monetary conditions, the central bank has crushed excess liquidity and incentivized savings in pesos, further taming inflation.
*   **Recession-Induced Demand Destruction (Moderate, ↓):** The severe economic contraction of 2024 and early 2025 has sharply reduced consumer and business demand, acting as a powerful, albeit painful, brake on price increases.
*   **Exchange Rate Anchor (Moderate, ↓/↑):** A slow, predictable "crawling peg" devaluation of the peso has helped anchor expectations. However, this policy risks creating an overvalued currency, which could necessitate a future sharp devaluation, a major inflationary risk (↑).
*   **Political & Social Sustainability (Large, ↑):** The government's ability to withstand protests, strikes, and legislative opposition is the key point of failure. A loss of political capital could force a populist reversal of austerity, reigniting inflation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Political Mandate:** Unlike many past attempts, President Milei was elected with a clear and explicit mandate to implement radical, painful measures specifically to end inflation, granting him unusual political resilience in the face of hardship.
*   **Pace and Depth of Fiscal Adjustment:** The speed at which Argentina achieved a fiscal surplus in 2024 is extreme and rare among historical comparisons. This front-loads the credibility of the program.
*   **Lack of Congressional Power:** Milei's party has very little representation in congress, making his reforms reliant on executive decrees and fragile alliances. This contrasts with successful plans like the Convertibility Plan, which had stronger legislative backing, and represents a key structural weakness.
*   **Front-Loaded Devaluation:** The program began with a massive one-off devaluation in December 2023, which passed through to prices quickly. This means the disinflation seen since is "cleaner" and less subject to repressed price pressures than in some historical cases.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of **~30%** (equivalent n≈5) is plausible, based on the historical difficulty of such stabilization plans.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The core mechanism—fiscal surplus and zero monetary financing—has been successfully implemented and sustained for nearly two years.
    *   (↑ Large) Recent monthly inflation data (1.5-1.6% in May/June 2025) is not just trending in the right direction

To forecast whether Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Given the historical context and the nature of Milei's economic policies, a blended base rate of **~30%** is appropriate. This is derived from the historical success rates of IMF-style shock therapy programs (25-35%) and Argentina's own stabilization attempts (30-40%). The chronic high-inflation country base rate (<15%) is less applicable due to the deliberate break from past policies.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with past stabilization attempts in Argentina, particularly the Convertibility Plan, which saw rapid inflation reduction.
- **Differences:** The political mandate and the pace of fiscal adjustment under Milei are unprecedented, providing a stronger initial push than typical cases. However, the lack of congressional power is a significant structural weakness.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Recent Inflation Data:** The monthly inflation rates of 1.5-1.6% in mid-2025 suggest a strong downward trend, consistent with achieving the target. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
- **IMF Growth Forecast:** The IMF's positive GDP growth forecast (5.5% for 2025) supports the sustainability of the economic plan, further increasing the probability.
- **Social and Political Risks:** Rising poverty and social unrest pose risks to the continuation of the program, decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 30% probability translates to odds of 0.43 (30/70).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** The strong recent inflation data and IMF support suggest a likelihood ratio greater than 1, while social risks suggest a ratio less than 1. Overall, the positive evidence outweighs the negative.
- **Posterior Odds:** Assuming a likelihood ratio of approximately 2 (reflecting stronger positive evidence), the posterior odds become 0.86 (0.43 * 2).
- **Posterior Probability:** This translates to a posterior probability of approximately 46% (0.86 / (1 + 0.86)).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be optimistic given the structural political weaknesses and potential for social unrest.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where political instability leads to policy reversal could drastically increase inflation, suggesting a need for caution.
- **Adjustment:** Considering these risks, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential tail risks is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential risks, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect a balanced view of the situation.

Final: 45%

# Will Argentina's year-over-year inflation be below 30% for December 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes:

- **IMF-style "Shock Therapy" Programs**: These rapid fiscal and monetary tightening programs have historically had a 25-35% success rate in achieving low inflation targets within 24 months.
- **Argentina's Own Stabilization Attempts**: Argentina's history shows either dramatic success or failure, with a slightly higher 30-40% success rate for short-term inflation reduction.
- **Chronic High-Inflation Countries**: Countries with decades of high inflation rarely break below 30% quickly (<15% success rate).

Given that Milei's program represents a deliberate, radical break from past policies, I'll weight the first two reference classes more heavily. 

**Prior probability: 30%** that Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Argentina has a long history of failed stabilization attempts
- The country has deeply embedded inflation expectations
- Structural economic challenges remain similar to past episodes

**Key differences:**
- Milei was elected with an explicit mandate to implement radical anti-inflation measures
- The fiscal adjustment has been unusually rapid and deep, achieving a surplus in 2024
- The program began with a massive one-off devaluation, allowing for "cleaner" disinflation
- Recent monthly inflation data shows consistent improvement (1.5-1.6% in May/June 2025)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent monthly inflation data (June 2025: 1.6%, YoY at 39.4%)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If inflation will be <30% by December, we'd expect to see monthly rates around 1.5-2.0% by mid-2025
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - If inflation will remain >30%, monthly rates would likely be higher or rising
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5 (strongly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Sustained fiscal discipline with zero monetary financing**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Fiscal discipline is essential for achieving <30% inflation
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even with discipline, other factors could keep inflation high
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4 (increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Political and social sustainability challenges**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Success requires maintaining unpopular policies
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Social pressure often leads to policy reversals
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (slightly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: IMF's continued support and positive growth outlook**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - IMF backing enhances credibility and sustainability
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - IMF support doesn't guarantee success
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6 (moderately increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 30:70 (0.43:1)

First update (monthly inflation data):
- Posterior odds = 0.43 × 4.5 = 1.94:1
- Posterior probability = 1.94/(1+1.94) = 66%

Second update (fiscal discipline):
- Posterior odds = 1.94 × 2.4 = 4.66:1
- Posterior probability = 4.66/(1+4.66) = 82%

Third update (political challenges):
- Posterior odds = 4.66 × 0.75 = 3.50:1
- Posterior probability = 3.50/(1+3.50) = 78%

Fourth update (IMF support):
- Posterior odds = 3.50 × 1.6 = 5.60:1
- Posterior probability = 5.60/(1+5.60) = 85%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent positive data and underestimating Argentina's historical pattern of policy reversals
- The calculation seems to yield an unusually high probability given Argentina's history
- The political sustainability risks may be underweighted
- External economic shocks could derail progress regardless of policy discipline

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Political pressure forces policy relaxation in late 2025, causing inflation to rebound
- A global economic downturn forces currency devaluation, reigniting inflation
- The current low monthly inflation rates may be temporary or subject to measurement issues

**Adjustment for overconfidence:**
Given Argentina's volatile history and the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting, I should adjust my probability downward from the calculated 85%. The manifold market shows 61.2%, which seems more reasonable given the historical context.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the strong recent evidence of disinflation, the sustained fiscal discipline, but also accounting for Argentina's history of policy reversals and the significant political challenges, I adjust my final probability to 65%.

Final: 65%

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Identify Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the historical success rate of "shock therapy" stabilization programs in countries with chronic high inflation. Argentina's current plan, centered on achieving a fiscal surplus and halting monetary financing of the government ("no money printing"), is a classic example.
*   **Reasoning:** Historically, such programs have a high failure rate due to immense political and social pressure leading to policy reversal. The research report suggests a success rate for similar programs in the 25-40% range. Argentina's own history is one of repeated failed stabilization plans, with one major success (the 1991 Convertibility Plan). A conservative prior, reflecting the *ex-ante* difficulty of such a plan succeeding over a two-year period, would be around 30%.
*   **Initial Prior:** P(H) = 30%, where H is the event that YoY inflation is <30% by December 2025. This corresponds to prior odds of 0.3 / 0.7 ≈ 0.43.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors the base case in its core economic strategy (fiscal and monetary tightening) and its primary risk factor (social unrest and political fragility due to a severe recession).
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(Positive) Political Mandate:** President Milei was elected with an unusually clear and explicit mandate to implement these painful measures to stop inflation, granting him more political resilience than is typical.
    *   **(Positive) Speed of Adjustment:** The government achieved a fiscal surplus with unprecedented speed in 2024, lending the program significant early credibility.
    *   **(Negative) Legislative Weakness:** Milei's party lacks a majority in congress, making his reform agenda structurally fragile and reliant on executive decrees and shifting alliances.
    *   **(Positive) Current Status:** The forecast is being made in October 2025, nearly two years into the 24-month program. The fact that the plan has survived this long is itself strong evidence that it is more resilient than the average case from the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The current date is October 17, 2025. The most critical evidence is the inflation data from the preceding months, as this determines the trajectory for the year-end figure.

*   **Evidence 1: Recent Inflation Data (Strongly Positive)**
    *   The research report states that Year-over-Year (YoY) inflation had already fallen to 39.4% by June 2025.
    *   Monthly inflation was 1.5% in May and 1.6% in June 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Analysis:** For the YoY figure to fall from 39.4% in June to below 30% in December, the new monthly inflation figures for July-December 2025 must be significantly lower than the corresponding figures from July-December 2024.
    *   Calculations show that the average monthly inflation for the last six months of 2025 must be below approximately **1.81%**.
    *   Given that May and June were 1.5% and 1.6% respectively, maintaining an average below 1.81% is highly plausible, assuming the current policy framework remains intact. This evidence dramatically increases the probability of success. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is very high.

*   **Evidence 2: Political and Social Sustainability (Moderately Positive / Key Risk)**
    *   The primary risk to the forecast is a political crisis forcing a policy reversal or a currency devaluation.
    *   **Likelihood Analysis:** The government has maintained its austerity program for nearly two years despite severe social costs. Having survived the most acute phase of the adjustment, the probability of a collapse in the final 2.5 months of 2025 is reduced, though it remains the most significant risk. This persistence is positive evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

We can model the outcome by considering two scenarios:

1.  **"Continuation" Scenario:** The government's current economic policy remains stable through December 2025.
2.  **"Crisis" Scenario:** A political or economic shock occurs, leading to a policy reversal or a major devaluation.

Let's estimate the probabilities:

*   **P(Crisis):** The risk of a plan-derailing crisis in the final 2.5 months is non-trivial but has diminished over time. I estimate a **15%** probability of a crisis before year-end.
*   **P(Continuation):** This is therefore 1 - 0.15 = **85%**.

Now, let's assess the outcome conditional on each scenario:

*   **P(Success | Crisis):** If a crisis occurs, a sudden spike in inflation is almost certain. The chance of meeting the <30% target would be minimal. I estimate this at **5%**.
*   **P(Success | Continuation):** If the policy holds, success depends on keeping average monthly inflation below ~1.81%. This is likely given recent data, but risks from seasonal effects (higher spending in December) and potential postponed utility price hikes remain. The government also has a strong incentive to manage these factors to hit its flagship target. I estimate the probability of success in this scenario is high, at **80%**.

**Posterior Probability Calculation:**
P(Success) = [P(Continuation) × P(Success | Continuation)] + [P(Crisis) × P(Success | Crisis)]
P(Success) = (0.85 × 0.80) + (0.15 × 0.05)
P(Success) = 0.68 + 0.0075
P(Success) = 0.6875

This calculation updates the initial 30% prior to a posterior of approximately **69%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence:** My forecast of 69% is higher than the Manifold community forecast of 61%. Could I be overconfident? The main point of disagreement is likely the `P(Success | Continuation)` parameter. I set it at 80%, reflecting a belief that the government will actively manage Q4 prices to hit its target. The market might be pricing in a higher chance of "natural" economic forces (like seasonality) pushing inflation just over the threshold.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The market's 61% could be correct if, for instance, `P(Success | Continuation)` is closer to 70% (reflecting more uncertainty about Q4) and `P(Crisis)` is slightly higher at 15%. This would yield `(0.85 * 0.70) + (0.15 * 0.05) = 0.595 + 0.0075 = 60.25%`.
*   **Rebuttal:** I maintain that the political will to hit this specific, highly publicized target is a powerful force that justifies the higher 80% estimate for success conditional on stability. The government has demonstrated a willingness to pay high social costs for this goal, and managing prices over a short 2-3 month period is feasible.
*   **Conclusion:** The 69% forecast appropriately balances the extremely strong positive data trajectory against the remaining tail risk of a political crisis and the uncertainty of Q4 price behavior.

### Final Forecast

The initial base rate of ~30% is overwhelmed by nearly two years of consistent policy implementation and recent inflation data that shows a clear trajectory toward the goal. The primary remaining uncertainty is a low-probability, high-impact political or economic crisis in the final months of the year. My model accounts for this risk, leading to a final probability that is high but well below certainty.

Final: 69%
