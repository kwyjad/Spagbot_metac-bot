### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Western Cryonics Organizations (Alcor, Cryonics Institute):** These are the most established players. Founded in the 1970s, they have each accumulated ~200 patients over ~50 years, implying an average growth rate of ~4 patients/year. However, their growth is not linear; it's often slower in early years and accelerates with public awareness. Their recent growth is typically in the range of 5-10 patients per year. This class suggests a slow, steady accumulation.
2.  **Newer Cryonics Organizations (e.g., KrioRus, founded 2005):** KrioRus in Russia provides a better comparison for a newer organization in a non-US context. It has ~90 patients after ~20 years, an average of ~4.5 patients/year. This suggests a similar long-term growth rate to the established players, even for newer entrants.
3.  **Yinfeng's Own History:** Yinfeng itself forms the most specific reference class.
    *   Sep 2020 – Dec 2021 (~1.25 years): +2 patients (~1.6/year)
    *   Dec 2021 – Dec 2023 (2 years): +7 patients (3.5/year)
    *   Dec 2023 – Dec 2024 (1 year): +7 patients (7.0/year)
    This internal data shows a clear and significant acceleration in the rate of new patients. The most recent annual rate (7/year) is the most relevant base rate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-27** Ovarian tissue cryopreservation award ↑ — Boosts scientific legitimacy and public profile, potentially attracting clients who see Yinfeng as a credible high-tech institution rather than a fringe enterprise.
*   **2025-02-07** Another award for ovarian tissue tech ↑ — Reinforces the message of scientific credibility and innovation, likely increasing positive media coverage and institutional trust.
*   **2025-01-01 (approx.)** Collaboration with Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on brain science ↑ — Signals deep integration with the state's top-tier scientific apparatus, suggesting stability, funding, and official endorsement, which can de-risk the choice for potential clients.
*   **2024-12-24** Documentary "China Temperature" wins brand-building award ↑ — A significant public relations success. This marketing effort directly targets public perception and could be a leading indicator of increased client acquisition in 2025.
*   **2024-12-31** Last official patient count reported as 26 (via Cryonics Wiki) — This provides a firm anchor point for any 2025 growth.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Monopoly Status (Large):** As the only cryonics provider in China, Yinfeng has exclusive access to a market of 1.4 billion people. This eliminates competition and funnels all domestic interest to them.
2.  **Public Relations & Marketing (Moderate):** The award-winning documentary and consistent news flow about scientific achievements are part of a deliberate strategy to build brand legitimacy and public awareness, directly driving customer interest.
3.  **Institutional Backing & Legitimacy (Moderate):** Yinfeng is not a standalone startup but a division of the large Yinfeng Biological Group. Collaborations with top state universities and academies lend it significant scientific credibility, reducing the "sci-fi" stigma and appealing to a more mainstream, wealthy clientele.
4.  **Cultural/Regulatory Environment (Moderate):** The SCMP article noted fewer religious obstacles in China compared to the West. A supportive, state-guided scientific ecosystem can also accelerate development and adoption, assuming the government remains favorable.
5.  **Cost and Accessibility (Small):** While still expensive, the cost may be accessible to China's rapidly growing class of high-net-worth individuals. The procedure's complexity and cost remain a primary limiting factor on growth.
6.  **Technological Advancement (Small):** Breakthroughs in related fields (like the award-winning ovarian tissue preservation) serve more as a marketing and legitimacy driver than a direct enabler of whole-body cryopreservation, which remains speculative.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Accelerating Growth:** Unlike the more mature, linear growth of Western organizations (Reference Class 1), Yinfeng is in a rapid acceleration phase, doubling its annual patient intake in recent years.
*   **State-Linked Enterprise:** Yinfeng is part of a major biological group and collaborates with state institutions. This is unlike the private, foundation-based models of Alcor and CI, giving Yinfeng greater resources and political top-cover.
*   **Untapped Market:** Yinfeng is serving a massive, newly wealthy domestic market with no prior access to such services, whereas Western providers operate in a more saturated, mature market.
*   **Aggressive Legitimacy Campaign:** The recent flurry of awards and PR is a concerted effort to build a mainstream, scientific brand, a more aggressive strategy than the lower-key, community-focused approach of older cryonics organizations.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be centered on a linear extrapolation from the last known data point. Starting with 26 patients at YE 2024 and applying the 2024 growth rate of +7 patients/year suggests a year-end 2025 figure of **33**. The distribution should be fairly wide, given the small number of data points. Equivalent n: ~4 (based on 4 years of growth data).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The sustained, high-impact PR and legitimacy campaign (awards, documentary, collaborations) in late 2024/early 2025 suggests the drivers of the recent growth acceleration are strengthening, not weakening. This pushes the median estimate upwards.
    *   ↑ (Small): The monopoly status in a large market provides a strong structural reason to believe that accelerated growth can be maintained for longer than it could in a competitive market.
    *   ↓ (Large, conditional): The primary downward pressure is the possibility of no new report in 2025. If no update is published, the resolution would be the last 2024 number (26). This introduces a significant left-tail or bimodality to the distribution.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests that *if* a new number is reported, it will reflect continued or even slightly increased growth over the +7/year rate. The posterior median should therefore be adjusted upward from the simple extrapolation of 33, perhaps to **34-36**. However, the statistician must account for the significant probability of the outcome resolving to 26 if no new report is issued.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A press release from Yinfeng Biological Group announcing a new patient milestone.
    *   An update to the "Memorabilia" page on the Yinfeng website.
    *   Major Chinese state media (e.g., Xinhua, People's Daily) running a feature on Yinfeng's progress.
    *   A new version of the "China Temperature" documentary or a similar marketing campaign.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The end of December 2025 passes with no new patient numbers reported on their website or in media.
    *   Yinfeng's news releases focus exclusively on non-cryonics research (e.g., tissue engineering) with no mention of the "Life Extension Program."
    *   Any negative press or scandal related to the institute or its parent company.
    *   Official statements from Chinese regulators introducing new restrictions on human cryopreservation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution on Reporting:** The question resolves on the *last reported number* before 2026. The forecast is critically dependent on whether Yinfeng chooses to issue a press release or update in 2025. The current anchor is 26 from Dec 2024.
*   **Data Source Reliability:** Patient numbers come from the organization itself or a wiki sourcing them. These figures are not independently audited and could be subject to marketing inflation or definitional changes.
*   **Definition of "Patient":** The term could potentially include cryopreserved pets, heads/brains only ("neuro"), or even tissue samples, though the context implies whole-body human patients. Ambiguity could skew the numbers.
*   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast assumes stable political and economic conditions. A regulatory crackdown, a major scientific failure, or a public scandal could halt operations or growth abruptly.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** With only one month until the end of 2025, the window for a new report is very small, increasing the likelihood that the resolution value will be the last known number (26).

### Final Research Summary
The forecast should be anchored on the last reported figure of 26 patients at year-end 2024. Yinfeng is experiencing accelerating growth, recently adding 7 patients/year, driven by a monopoly position and a successful PR campaign to build scientific legitimacy. A simple extrapolation points to ~33 patients, but the positive momentum suggests a slightly higher figure of 34-36 is more likely *if* a new number is reported in 2025. The primary uncertainty is whether any new report will be issued before the deadline.

To forecast the number of patients the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute will report by 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is Yinfeng's recent growth rate. As of December 2024, they had 26 patients, with a growth rate of 7 patients per year in 2024. This suggests a base rate of 33 patients by the end of 2025 if the growth continues linearly.
- **Variance:** Given the small sample size and potential for reporting variability, the variance should be relatively high, reflecting uncertainty in whether a new report will be issued.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Yinfeng's growth pattern is similar to other cryonics organizations in their early stages, showing steady growth as awareness increases.
- **Differences:** Yinfeng benefits from a monopoly in China, a large untapped market, and strong institutional backing, suggesting potential for faster growth than historical averages.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Positive Evidence:**
  - Recent awards and collaborations increase legitimacy and could boost patient numbers.
  - The monopoly status in a large market supports sustained growth.
- **Negative Evidence:**
  - The possibility of no new report in 2025 introduces a significant risk of the number remaining at 26.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered on 33 patients, the positive evidence suggests an upward adjustment to 34-36 patients if a new report is issued. However, the risk of no report suggests a bimodal distribution with a significant probability mass at 26.
- **Posterior Shift:** The mean shifts slightly upward due to positive evidence, but the variance increases due to the reporting uncertainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must account for the real possibility of no new report, which would resolve the question at 26.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the potential for regulatory changes or negative press, which could impact growth.
- **Adjustments:** Given the reporting uncertainty, ensure the lower percentiles reflect the possibility of no new report.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **Calibrated Percentiles:**
  - P10: 26 (reflecting the risk of no new report)
  - P20: 28
  - P40: 32
  - P60: 34
  - P80: 36
  - P90: 38

# Forecast: Patients at Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute by 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Yinfeng's own growth trajectory:**
- September 2020: 10 patients (starting point)
- December 2024: 26 patients (latest confirmed count)
- This represents growth of 16 patients over ~4.25 years, or ~3.8 patients/year on average
- However, the growth has been accelerating:
  - 2020-2021: ~1.6 patients/year
  - 2022-2023: ~3.5 patients/year
  - 2024: ~7 patients/year

**Other cryonics organizations:**
- Established Western organizations (Alcor, Cryonics Institute): ~4-5 patients/year
- KrioRus (newer organization): ~4.5 patients/year

Given Yinfeng's accelerating growth and its unique position as China's only cryonics provider, I'll use a prior centered on their most recent growth rate of 7 patients/year, with a wide variance to account for uncertainty. This gives a prior estimate of 33 patients by the end of 2025 (26 + 7).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Yinfeng continues to operate as China's only cryonics provider
- The service remains expensive and appeals to a niche market
- The fundamental technology hasn't radically changed

**Differences from base case:**
- Yinfeng has shown accelerating growth rather than linear growth
- Recent awards and recognition have boosted their scientific legitimacy
- Collaborations with prestigious institutions like the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences enhance credibility
- Their documentary "China Temperature" won a brand-building award, suggesting effective marketing
- They operate in a massive untapped market (China) with potentially less religious resistance to cryonics

These differences suggest the potential for continued acceleration beyond the 7 patients/year rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting higher patient numbers:**
- Scientific legitimacy: Multiple awards for their ovarian tissue cryopreservation technology in early 2025 (likelihood ratio ~1.5x for higher values)
- Institutional backing: Collaboration with Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (likelihood ratio ~1.3x for higher values)
- Marketing success: Award-winning documentary enhancing brand awareness (likelihood ratio ~1.2x for higher values)
- Monopoly status: Exclusive access to China's 1.4 billion population (likelihood ratio ~1.4x for higher values)

**Evidence supporting lower patient numbers:**
- Reporting uncertainty: The question resolves to the last reported number before 2026. With only one month left in 2025 as of the current date (Nov 30, 2025), there's a significant chance no new report will be issued, meaning the resolution would be 26 (likelihood ratio ~3x for lower values)
- Niche service: Cryonics remains expensive and appeals to a small segment of the population (likelihood ratio ~1.2x for lower values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 33 patients (26 + 7) and updating based on the evidence:

**First update - reporting uncertainty:**
This is the most significant factor. With only one month left in 2025, there's a substantial chance (~40%) that no new report will be issued before 2026, in which case the question resolves to 26.

Prior: 33 patients
Likelihood ratio: ~3x for lower values due to reporting uncertainty
Posterior: Shifts downward to ~30 patients, with a bimodal distribution (peaks at 26 and ~35)

**Second update - positive factors combined:**
The scientific awards, institutional backing, marketing success, and monopoly status all push toward continued or accelerated growth.

Prior: Bimodal with peaks at 26 and ~35
Likelihood ratio: ~2x for higher values (combined effect of positive factors)
Posterior: Still bimodal, but with the higher peak strengthened to ~36-37 patients

The posterior distribution is bimodal with:
- ~40% probability mass at 26 (no new report scenario)
- ~60% probability mass distributed around 36-37 (new report scenario)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the impact of awards and collaborations on actual patient acquisition
- The reporting cycle might be more predictable than I assume
- There could be regulatory changes in China affecting cryonics that aren't visible in Western media
- The definition of "patient" might have changed in their reporting

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Regulatory crackdown: Chinese authorities could impose new restrictions on cryonics
- Definitional change: Yinfeng could start counting tissue samples or animal subjects as "patients"
- Breakthrough scenario: A major scientific advancement could drive a surge in interest

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more conservative view would place less weight on the recent acceleration and more weight on the long-term average growth rate of ~3.8 patients/year. This would suggest a point estimate of ~30 patients if a new report is issued.

After considering these factors, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly and adjust the bimodality to account for the reporting uncertainty.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the bimodal nature of the distribution (with ~40% probability at 26 and ~60% around 36-37), I need to carefully construct percentiles that reflect this structure:

P10: 26
P20: 26
P40: 26
P60: 36
P80: 38
P90: 40

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is derived from the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute's own recent history, as it reflects its unique position as a state-linked monopoly in a new market.

*   **Data Points:**
    *   Sep 2020: 10 patients
    *   Dec 2021: 12 patients (+2 in ~1.25 years, or ~1.6/year)
    *   Dec 2023: 19 patients (+7 in 2 years, or 3.5/year)
    *   Dec 2024: 26 patients (+7 in 1 year, or 7.0/year)

*   **Analysis:** The data shows a clear and rapid acceleration in the rate of patient acquisition. The most recent and relevant rate is +7 patients per year.
*   **Prior Distribution:** Based on this, a simple linear extrapolation from the last known value (26 at YE 2024) would suggest a year-end 2025 figure of 26 + 7 = 33. This forms the central tendency of my prior distribution. The variance should be significant due to the small number of data points and the observed acceleration, suggesting the rate could easily be anywhere from 5 to 10 patients in 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental service (cryonics) is niche, expensive, and faces public skepticism, similar to its Western counterparts (Alcor, Cryonics Institute). This suggests growth won't be exponential indefinitely.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Monopoly Status:** Yinfeng is the sole provider in China, a market of 1.4 billion people. This eliminates competition and funnels all domestic demand to them.
    2.  **State-Linked Legitimacy:** Unlike private Western foundations, Yinfeng is part of a major biological group and collaborates with top state scientific institutions. This provides significant resources, political cover, and scientific credibility, reducing the "fringe" stigma.
    3.  **Growth Stage:** Yinfeng is in a rapid acceleration phase, whereas Western organizations are in a more mature, linear growth phase.

These differences, particularly the monopoly status and state backing, suggest that Yinfeng's growth rate can be sustained at a higher level for longer than the historical Western base rates would imply.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The primary evidence consists of Yinfeng's recent activities and the specific resolution criteria of the question.

*   **Evidence for Higher Numbers (Upward Adjustment):**
    *   **Sustained PR & Legitimacy Campaign (Likelihood Ratio ≈ 2-3x for >7 growth):** The flurry of activity in late 2024 and early 2025 (documentary award, collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, ovarian tissue awards) occurred *after* the period that established the +7/year growth rate. This is strong evidence that the underlying drivers of growth are strengthening, making a 2025 growth rate of 8-10 patients more likely than a reversion to the mean.
*   **Evidence for Lower Numbers (Strong Downward Pressure):**
    *   **Resolution on *Reported* Number (Introduces Bimodality):** The question resolves on the last number *reported* before 2026. The current date is November 30, 2025, leaving only one month for a new report. The last report was on Dec 31, 2024, giving a value of 26. There is a non-trivial chance that no new report will be issued in December 2025. If that happens, the resolution value will be 26. I estimate the probability of a new report being issued in the next month at ~75%, given their past pattern of year-end updates and their active PR. This leaves a **~25% chance of the outcome being exactly 26.**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My posterior is a mixture of two scenarios:

1.  **Scenario A: A new number is reported (75% probability).**
    *   My prior was centered at 33 (26+7). The positive evidence from the PR campaign pushes this median upward. I estimate the median growth for 2025 to be +8 patients, for a conditional median of **34**.
    *   The distribution for this scenario (let's call it `Dist_A`) would range from roughly 31 (slower growth of +5) to 38 (accelerated growth of +12).

2.  **Scenario B: No new number is reported (25% probability).**
    *   The outcome is a point mass at **26**.

*   **Posterior Formation:** The final distribution is `0.75 * Dist_A + 0.25 * δ(26)`.
*   **Effect on Distribution:** This creates a bimodal or heavily left-skewed distribution. The entire lower quartile of my forecast is anchored at 26. The median of the final distribution is pulled down from 34 to approximately 32-33. The mean is pulled down to `(0.75 * 34) + (0.25 * 26) = 25.5 + 6.5 = 32`.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Is the 25% chance of no report too low?** It's possible. Corporate reporting isn't always timely. If growth was disappointing (e.g., only +3 or +4), they might delay the announcement. If I increase the probability of no report to 40%, the median would drop closer to 30. However, their recent high-profile PR push makes it more likely they *want* to announce new, positive numbers. I'll stick with 25% but acknowledge this is the forecast's primary weakness.
*   **Could growth have exploded?** Given the monopoly in a vast market, could they have added 15+ patients? This seems unlikely, as cryopreservation is a complex, high-cost decision for any individual, limiting the rate of uptake even with good marketing. My upper bound of 38 (a growth of +12) seems sufficient to capture a very successful year.
*   **The "Ambiguous" Clause:** The rules state that if no report is published "after or during 2024," the question resolves ambiguously. Since a report for YE 2024 *was* published, this clause is not triggered. The fallback is the last known number, which is 26. My forecast correctly models this.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The final percentiles are derived from the mixture model `0.75 * Dist_A + 0.25 * δ(26)`. The 25% probability of the outcome being 26 means the 10th and 20th percentiles must be 26. The remaining percentiles are scaled into the distribution of likely outcomes if a report is published, which I model as being centered around 34.

P10: 26
P20: 26
P40: 32
P60: 34
P80: 36
P90: 38
