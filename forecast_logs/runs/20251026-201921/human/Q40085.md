### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections (within a regional group):** This is the most relevant class. While most COP hosting decisions are straightforward, contested bids occur periodically, especially in politically diverse groups like the Eastern European Group or WEOG. In these cases, one candidate typically withdraws after diplomatic negotiations. A complete failure to reach consensus, triggering the default to Bonn, is rare.
    *   **Base Rate:** Contested bid resolves to one of the primary bidders: ~90%. Bid fails, defaults to Bonn, Germany: ~10%.
2.  **Major International Event Bids with Two Finalists:** This is a broader class. Typically, one candidate has a stronger narrative, more political capital, or a more robust technical proposal. The outcome is rarely a 50/50 coin flip.
    *   **Base Rate:** The bid with the stronger political/thematic narrative wins: ~65-75%. The "challenger" or alternative bid wins: ~25-35%.
3.  **WEOG-Specific Selections:** The Western European and Others Group is diverse, including "old" Europe, the CANZUK nations (Canada, Australia, NZ, UK), the US, Israel, and Turkey. Consensus can be difficult. However, the group has a strong tradition of finding pragmatic solutions.
    *   **Base Rate:** A consensus candidate is found: ~95%. The process fails and defaults to Bonn: ~5%.

Limitations: The sample size for contested COP bids is small, making base rates illustrative rather than statistically robust. The process is highly political and opaque, driven by factors beyond public view.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-18** Australia announces ambitious 2035 emissions target (62-70% reduction). — **↑ Australia** — Directly counters historical criticism of Australia as a climate laggard, strengthening its credibility within WEOG, especially with European members.
*   **2025-09-08** Australian government reaffirms active pursuit of COP31 bid with Pacific partners. — **↑ Australia** — Shows sustained high-level political commitment, a key factor in successful bids.
*   **2025-06-XX** (Implied) The WEOG decision, previously deferred to June 2025, was not announced. — **↑ Germany, ↓ Australia/Turkey** — The continued stalemate past a key deadline indicates deep divisions, making the consensus-failure/default-to-Bonn scenario more plausible.
*   **2024-11-26** Report confirms decision deferred due to Turkey's competing bid, creating a stalemate. — **(Neutral between bidders, ↑ Germany)** — Established the initial deadlock, signaling this would not be a straightforward selection and putting the default option into play.
*   **2024-10-17** South Australia submits a formal, funded bid for Adelaide to host. — **↑ Australia** — Demonstrates concrete, sub-national logistical and financial readiness, adding credibility to the national bid.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Mechanism:** The single most important factor. The requirement for unanimity gives any single dissenting country or small bloc a veto. A persistent failure to agree is the direct causal path to a Germany-hosted COP. (Large)
2.  **Climate Credibility & Narrative:** Australia's co-bid with Pacific nations is a powerful narrative, framing the conference around climate justice and frontline states. Its recently enhanced 2035 target provides crucial policy substance to back this up. This is a major lever for winning support from climate-progressive WEOG members. (Large)
3.  **Geopolitical Horse-Trading:** The decision is not made in a vacuum. Support for a COP bid can be traded for support on other UN appointments or geopolitical issues. Turkey's strategic position may give it leverage with certain European states, independent of climate considerations. (Moderate)
4.  **Veto from a Key Player:** A major WEOG power (e.g., a large EU country, the US, UK) could effectively block a bid it opposes. Turkey's human rights record or geopolitical stances could attract opposition from some members, while Australia's past climate record could still be a factor for others. (Moderate)
5.  **Bid Fatigue/Pragmatism:** If the deadlock continues, WEOG members may coalesce around one candidate simply to resolve the issue and avoid the perceived failure of defaulting to Bonn. Alternatively, they may choose the default option as the "least controversial" path. (Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Atypical Bid Structure:** The Australia-Pacific co-host model is novel and thematically powerful, contrasting sharply with a more traditional single-nation bid from Turkey. This "climate justice" angle is a significant differentiator from past bids.
*   **Protracted and Public Stalemate:** While disagreements occur, it is unusual for the stalemate to be so public and to persist past a soft deadline (June 2025). This suggests the divisions within WEOG are deeper than typical.
*   **Dramatic Credibility Shift:** Australia has undergone a rapid shift in climate policy under its current government. This makes its bid a test of whether WEOG will reward recent, ambitious commitments over a longer history of climate inaction.
*   **High-Stakes Bidders:** Both candidates are significant geopolitical players. This is not a contest between two smaller nations; both Australia and Turkey have considerable diplomatic weight to bring to bear, contributing to the deadlock.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of a contested bid with a strong narrative candidate, a plausible prior would be: Australia 50%, Turkey 40%, Germany 10%. (Equivalent n=20, reflecting a reasonably structured but uncertain situation).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large) Australia:** The new, ambitious 2035 NDC significantly de-risks the Australian bid by addressing its primary weakness.
    *   **↑ (Moderate) Germany:** The continued stalemate past the June 2025 informal deadline is strong evidence that the consensus mechanism is failing, increasing the probability of the default outcome.
    *   **↓ (Moderate) Turkey:** Australia's strengthened position makes Turkey's path to consensus harder. With the deadlock hardening, Turkey's chances of winning over skeptical WEOG members decrease.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should move significantly towards **Australia**, primarily at the expense of Turkey. However, the probability for **Germany** should also increase from the prior, reflecting the real risk of a continued deadlock. The update suggests a stronger favorite but also a more probable "failure" state.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support from major WEOG members (e.g., Germany, France, Canada, UK).
    *   Joint appearances or statements by Australian and Pacific leaders at pre-COP30 events.
    *   News reports or leaks suggesting Turkey is considering withdrawing its bid or negotiating a compromise (e.g., bidding for a future COP).
    *   Official announcement of a WEOG consensus in favor of Australia.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia; i.e., UP for Turkey/Germany):**
    *   Public statements of support for Turkey from any WEOG members.
    *   Leaks from WEOG meetings indicating continued, intractable disagreement.
    *   An official announcement from the UNFCCC or WEOG that no consensus has been reached, and planning will proceed for a Bonn-based COP.
    *   Any significant domestic political turmoil in Australia that weakens its government's international standing or climate commitments.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Process:** The final decision will be made in closed-door diplomatic negotiations. Public information is limited, and the outcome could be swayed by last-minute deals.
*   **Resolution Definition:** The question resolves to the *home country of the host city*. An Australia-Pacific win with Adelaide as the host city resolves to "Australia." "Another Pacific Island Nation" is highly unlikely to win as a standalone host.
*   **Package Deals:** The COP31 decision could be linked to other unrelated UN candidacies or diplomatic trade-offs, making prediction based on climate merits alone incomplete.
*   **Potential for Surprise Compromise:** A third, previously unannounced WEOG country could be put forward as a compromise candidate to break the deadlock, resolving as "Other." This is a low-probability but non-zero risk.
*   **Domestic Politics:** A sudden change in government or policy in either Australia or Turkey could dramatically alter the viability of their respective bids before the final decision is made.

**Final Research Summary:**
Australia is the clear favorite to host COP31, having significantly strengthened its bid with an ambitious 2035 climate target that complements its powerful co-hosting narrative with Pacific nations. However, the persistent deadlock with Turkey has made the default option of Bonn, Germany, a more significant possibility than in a typical selection process.

To forecast which country will host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP 31) in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning using the provided background and research report.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the strong narrative of co-hosting with Pacific nations and recent ambitious climate targets, Australia is a strong contender. The base rate for a strong narrative candidate winning is 65-75%. I'll start with a prior of 50% for Australia, reflecting its strong position but acknowledging the stalemate.
  
- **Turkey**: As the other main bidder, Turkey's base rate is lower due to Australia's strengthened position and the deadlock. I'll assign a prior of 40% to Turkey.
  
- **Germany**: The default option if consensus fails. Historically, defaults to Bonn are rare, but the ongoing stalemate increases this likelihood. I'll assign a prior of 10% to Germany.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely to host independently without Australia. I'll assign a prior of 0%.

- **Other**: A compromise candidate is possible but unlikely. I'll assign a prior of 0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The co-hosting model with Pacific nations and recent climate commitments make Australia's bid stronger than typical narrative candidates.
  
- **Turkey**: Turkey's geopolitical position could be advantageous, but Australia's strengthened bid makes Turkey's path harder.
  
- **Germany**: The protracted stalemate increases the likelihood of defaulting to Bonn.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia's 2035 emissions target**: Increases Australia's credibility, making this evidence more likely if Australia is the host (P(E | H) is high for Australia).
  
- **Stalemate past June 2025**: Suggests a higher likelihood of defaulting to Germany (P(E | H) is high for Germany).
  
- **Turkey's bid**: Less likely to succeed given Australia's strengthened position (P(E | H) is lower for Turkey).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 50%, Likelihood ratio (based on evidence) suggests a significant increase. Posterior odds increase to around 60%.
  
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 40%, Likelihood ratio suggests a decrease due to Australia's strengthened position. Posterior odds decrease to around 25%.
  
- **Germany**: Prior odds = 10%, Likelihood ratio suggests an increase due to the stalemate. Posterior odds increase to around 15%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Australia's position is strong, but geopolitical factors could shift unexpectedly. Consider the possibility of a compromise candidate.
  
- **Tail Risks**: A sudden geopolitical event or policy change could alter the landscape. Adjust probabilities slightly to account for these risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the updated evidence.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 60%  
Turkey: 25%  
Germany: 15%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0%  
Other: 0%  

These probabilities reflect Australia's strong position, the increased likelihood of defaulting to Germany due to the stalemate, and Turkey's reduced chances.

# Forecasting COP 31 Host Country for 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia is one of two official bidders from the WEOG group scheduled to host COP 31
- Australia has a strong narrative with its Pacific co-hosting model
- The reference class suggests that in contested bids, the candidate with a stronger narrative wins ~65-75% of the time
- However, I'm adjusting this downward due to Australia's historically mixed climate record

**Turkey**: 35% 
- Rationale: Turkey is the other official bidder from the WEOG group
- As an official bidder, it has a substantial chance
- Turkey's geopolitical position gives it leverage in negotiations
- I'm placing it lower than Australia based on the reference class suggesting the challenger typically has a 25-35% chance

**Germany**: 15%
- Rationale: Germany hosts the UNFCCC secretariat in Bonn, making it the default host if consensus fails
- The reference class suggests a ~10% chance of defaulting to Bonn when bids are contested
- I'm adjusting slightly upward due to the protracted stalemate that has continued past expected deadlines

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 2%
- Rationale: While Pacific nations are part of Australia's co-hosting bid, they are unlikely to be the primary host country
- The question resolves to the home country of the host city, which would be Australia in the co-hosting scenario

**Other**: 3%
- Rationale: This accounts for the possibility of a compromise candidate emerging from WEOG
- Historical precedent suggests this is rare but possible

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The hosting rotates among UN regional groups, with WEOG scheduled for 2026
- There are two main competing bids, which is a common scenario
- The decision requires consensus among WEOG members

**Key differences:**
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations is novel and creates a unique narrative around climate justice
- The stalemate has been unusually public and protracted, continuing past the June 2025 informal deadline
- Australia has recently made a dramatic policy shift with its ambitious 2035 emissions target (62-70% reduction)
- Both bidders are significant geopolitical players, not smaller nations, intensifying the deadlock

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Australia's new ambitious 2035 emissions target (September 2025)**
- P(E|Australia wins): ~0.8 (Very likely to see such a commitment if Australia is serious about winning)
- P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~0.3 (Less likely to make such a commitment if not expecting to win)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7 (Strongly favors Australia)

**Evidence 2: Continued stalemate past June 2025 deadline**
- P(E|Germany hosts): ~0.7 (Highly consistent with a deadlock scenario)
- P(E|Germany doesn't host): ~0.4 (Somewhat consistent with tough negotiations that eventually resolve)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75 (Moderately favors Germany)

**Evidence 3: South Australia's formal, funded bid for Adelaide**
- P(E|Australia wins): ~0.9 (Very likely to see such preparation if Australia is the frontrunner)
- P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~0.5 (Might still see this preparation even if chances are uncertain)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (Moderately favors Australia)

**Evidence 4: Australia's reaffirmation of pursuit with Pacific partners (September 2025)**
- P(E|Australia wins): ~0.85 (Very likely if Australia expects to win)
- P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~0.6 (Might still see this even if chances are uncertain)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4 (Somewhat favors Australia)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the strongest piece of evidence first: Australia's ambitious 2035 emissions target.

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45% (prior odds: 0.45/0.55 = 0.82)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.7
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 2.7 = 2.21
- Posterior probability: 2.21/(1+2.21) = 68.9%

This is a significant update, but I need to consider the other evidence and options as well. The continued stalemate evidence increases Germany's chances:

For Germany:
- Prior probability: 15% (prior odds: 0.15/0.85 = 0.18)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.18 × 1.75 = 0.31
- Posterior probability: 0.31/(1+0.31) = 23.7%

Considering all evidence together, Australia's position is strengthened by its climate target and formal bid preparations, while Germany's chances increase due to the persistent stalemate. Turkey's position is weakened relative to both.

After considering all evidence, my updated probabilities before normalization would be:
- Australia: ~65%
- Turkey: ~20% 
- Germany: ~12%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: ~1%
- Other: ~2%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting public information while underestimating behind-the-scenes diplomatic negotiations
- The Australia-Pacific narrative might be less compelling to WEOG members than I assume
- Turkey's geopolitical leverage could be stronger than publicly known
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a compromise candidate emerging

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could have secured private commitments from key WEOG members
- The stalemate could reflect deeper divisions that make Germany more likely
- A compromise candidate could emerge at the last minute to break the deadlock

**Adjustments:**
- I should reduce Australia's probability slightly to account for potential overconfidence
- I should increase Turkey's probability to account for possible behind-the-scenes support
- I should maintain a meaningful probability for Germany given the persistent stalemate
- I should preserve some probability mass for "Other" to account for compromise scenarios

## 6. Final Normalization

After red team adjustments and normalization:

Australia: 58%
Turkey: 25%
Germany: 13%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 3%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 58%
Turkey: 25%
Germany: 13%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 3%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of contested host selections for major UN conferences within a regional group requiring consensus.

*   **Successful Bid:** Historically, most contested bids are resolved through diplomatic negotiations, with one candidate eventually securing consensus. I'll set the base rate for one of the bidders winning at **90%**.
*   **Failed Bid (Default):** It is rare for a regional group to fail to reach consensus, triggering the default option. I'll assign a base rate of **10%** to this outcome, which in this case is Germany (Bonn).
*   **Splitting the Successful Bid:** Within the 90% for a successful bid, I need to split the probability between Australia and Turkey. Australia's bid, co-hosted with Pacific nations, has a significantly stronger thematic narrative ("climate justice") than a more standard bid from Turkey. In such contests, the bid with the stronger narrative usually has an advantage. I'll assign a prior ratio of 2:1 in favor of Australia.
    *   Prior P(Australia) = 90% * (2/3) = 60%
    *   Prior P(Turkey) = 90% * (1/3) = 30%
*   **Other Options:** The probability of "Another Pacific Island Nation" hosting alone (as opposed to co-hosting with the event in Australia) is near zero due to infrastructure constraints. The probability of another "Other" WEOG nation emerging as a last-minute compromise is also very low. I'll assign a combined 1% to these tail risks initially, and adjust the main priors slightly.

**Initial Priors:**
*   Australia: 59%
*   Turkey: 30%
*   Germany: 10%
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 0.5%
*   Other: 0.5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The case fits the reference class well: two official bidders from the designated regional group (WEOG), a consensus-based decision mechanism, and a pre-determined default host.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Protracted Stalemate:** The failure to reach a decision by the informal June 2025 deadline is a significant deviation. It indicates that the divisions within WEOG are deeper than in a typical contested bid, making the default-to-Germany scenario more plausible than the 10% base rate.
    2.  **Narrative Strength:** The Australia-Pacific bid's narrative is exceptionally strong and timely, focusing on nations most vulnerable to climate change. This gives it a greater-than-usual advantage over a standard bid.
    3.  **Bidder Dynamics:** Both Australia and Turkey are significant G20 nations with substantial diplomatic influence, which could contribute to the deadlock as neither is likely to back down easily.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate two key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Stalemate persists past the June 2025 deadline.**
    *   **P(E1 | Germany hosts):** High. A persistent deadlock is the necessary and direct cause for Germany to become the host. The longer the stalemate, the more likely this outcome becomes.
    *   **P(E1 | Australia or Turkey hosts):** Low. If either candidate had a clear path to consensus, a decision would likely have been made already. This evidence is unfavorable for both active bidders.
    *   **Conclusion:** This evidence significantly increases the probability of Germany hosting, at the expense of both Australia and Turkey.

*   **Evidence 2: Australia announces an ambitious 2035 emissions reduction target (62-70%).**
    *   **P(E2 | Australia hosts):** High. This is a powerful strategic move that directly counters the primary criticism against Australia's bid (its history as a climate laggard). It provides climate-progressive European nations in WEOG with a strong justification to support Australia.
    *   **P(E2 | Turkey hosts):** Low. This move makes Australia a much more attractive candidate, making it harder for Turkey to build consensus. It raises the bar for climate credibility in this specific contest.
    *   **Conclusion:** This is very strong evidence in favor of Australia and against Turkey. It also slightly weakens the "stalemate" argument, as it provides a potential deadlock-breaking development.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Priors:** Australia (59%), Turkey (30%), Germany (10%), Others (1%).
2.  **Apply Evidence 1 (Stalemate):** The stalemate significantly raises the odds of the default outcome. I will update by doubling the probability for Germany, taking the probability proportionally from the two bidders.
    *   P(Germany) moves from 10% to ~20%.
    *   This leaves ~80% for the other options. Let's re-distribute the 10% taken from Australia and Turkey based on their prior ratio (~2:1). Australia loses ~7%, Turkey loses ~3%.
    *   **Intermediate Probabilities:** Australia ~52%, Turkey ~27%, Germany ~20%, Others ~1%.
3.  **Apply Evidence 2 (Australia's 2035 Target):** This is a powerful new factor that dramatically strengthens Australia's position relative to Turkey. It makes Australia the far more credible "climate" host. I assess this evidence as tripling Australia's odds relative to Turkey's.
    *   The current odds between Australia and Turkey are roughly 52:27 (~2:1).
    *   The new odds become (~6:1).
    *   This evidence also provides a path out of the stalemate, slightly reducing Germany's chances. I will shift a few percentage points from Germany and Turkey to Australia.
    *   I will shift ~16% from Turkey to Australia, and ~3% from Germany to Australia to reflect the deadlock-breaking potential.
    *   **Posterior Calculation (Qualitative):**
        *   Australia: 52% + 16% (from Turkey) + 3% (from Germany) = **71%**
        *   Turkey: 27% - 16% = **11%**
        *   Germany: 20% - 3% = **17%**
        *   Others: Remain at **1%**

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast makes Australia a strong favorite. Could I be wrong?
*   **Geopolitics over Climate:** The WEOG consensus rule means one or a few countries could block Australia for reasons unrelated to climate (e.g., trade disputes, other UN candidacies). Turkey has complex but important relationships with many European states and could be leveraging these. This could sustain the deadlock, making the 17% for Germany too low.
*   **"Face Saving" Default:** If the dispute becomes too acrimonious, WEOG members might prefer the "neutral" default to Bonn rather than being seen to "pick a side" between two powerful members. This also points to Germany's chances being potentially higher.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, Australia's 2035 target is a massive concession and a public statement of intent. It makes it politically difficult for other WEOG members, especially European ones, to continue blocking the bid on climate grounds. It provides the political cover needed for a consensus to form around Australia.

Considering the risk of a persistent deadlock, I will slightly increase Germany's probability at the expense of Australia.

**Adjusted Probabilities:**
*   Australia: 67% (-4%)
*   Germany: 21% (+4%)
*   Turkey: 11% (no change)
*   Others: 1% (no change)

### 6. Final Normalization

The final probabilities are distributed as follows, summing to 100%.

*   **Australia (67%):** The clear favorite due to a strong narrative and a recent, decisive policy move that addresses its main weakness.
*   **Germany (21%):** A significant possibility. The probability is much higher than the base rate due to the persistent and public stalemate. This is the most likely alternative outcome.
*   **Turkey (10%):** The underdog. Australia's strengthened bid makes it difficult for Turkey to build a consensus based on climate credibility. Its chances rely on geopolitical leverage.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation (1%):** A tail risk, representing an unexpected change to the bid structure.
*   **Other (1%):** A tail risk, representing a surprise compromise candidate emerging.

I will round Turkey down to 10% to make the sum exactly 100%.

Australia: 67%
Turkey: 10%
Germany: 21%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 1%

This distribution reflects Australia as the strong frontrunner, but with a substantial probability (~1 in 5) that the political deadlock cannot be broken, leading to the default outcome in Germany.
