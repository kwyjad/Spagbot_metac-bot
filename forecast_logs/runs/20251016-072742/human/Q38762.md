### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Novel Financial Products Seeking CFTC Approval:** This is the most relevant class. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the primary regulator. The approval process to become a Designated Contract Market (DCM), like Kalshi, is long (multiple years) and expensive. Few succeed. Since the Commodity Exchange Act was modernized, only a handful of novel, retail-focused platforms have achieved this status.
    *   **Base Rate:** The success rate for a given applicant over a multi-year period is low, perhaps 10-20%. The probability of approval within a single calendar year, let alone the final ~2.5 months of one, for an application that has not yet been publicly filed is extremely low, likely **<1%**.
2.  **Offshore/Unregulated Platforms Seeking US Legitimacy:** Polymarket fits this class. Platforms that have operated outside US regulations and/or have faced prior enforcement actions (like Polymarket's 2022 settlement) face a much higher barrier to entry. The CFTC is generally hostile to entities with such a history.
    *   **Base Rate:** The success rate for such platforms gaining a full US license within a few years of an enforcement action is exceptionally low. A generous estimate might be **<2%**.
3.  **"Play Money" Platforms Converting to Real Money:** Manifold fits this class. The legal and technical overhead to transition from a non-financialized platform to a CFTC-compliant real-money exchange is massive. There are few, if any, successful precedents for this specific pivot in a regulated US market.
    *   **Base Rate:** The probability of a platform successfully making this transition and gaining approval within a short timeframe is near **0%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-08-29** CFTC files amicus brief in Kalshi's lawsuit over election contracts, arguing they are contrary to public interest and constitute gaming. — ↓ — Reinforces the agency's deeply entrenched opposition to politically-oriented prediction markets, a core offering for Polymarket.
*   **2024-05-21** A US appeals court rules that the CFTC must reconsider its ban on Kalshi's election-related markets. — ↑ (small) — Shows a potential, albeit long and uncertain, judicial check on CFTC authority. However, this is a procedural victory, not a final one, and doesn't grant legality.
*   **2024-Present** Polymarket experiences record volume on 2024 US election markets, operating entirely outside the US. — ↓ — Demonstrates a successful business model that does not require US market access, reducing the incentive to undertake the costly and uncertain US regulatory process.
*   **2024-Present** No public announcements from Polymarket or Manifold regarding any application, intent to file, or lobbying effort to gain a US license. — ↓ — The complete absence of any movement on the regulatory front is the strongest evidence against a 2025 resolution. Regulatory processes are not secret.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **CFTC Approval Process (Large):** This is the primary gatekeeper. Gaining a DCM license is a multi-year, resource-intensive process. Without the CFTC's explicit approval, real-money operations are illegal. Given the <3 month horizon, this path is functionally closed.
2.  **Congressional Legislation (Large, but near-zero probability):** Congress could pass a law creating a new, streamlined regulatory framework for prediction markets. However, there is no active, prominent bill, and passing any financial legislation in the current political climate is extremely difficult, let alone by year-end 2025.
3.  **Company Strategy & Motivation (Moderate):** Either company would need to decide to pursue the US market. Polymarket has a thriving offshore business. Manifold's entire ethos is built around its play-money model. A strategic pivot is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition that shows no signs of occurring.
4.  **Judicial Rulings (Small):** A sweeping court decision that drastically curtails the CFTC's authority over event contracts could theoretically create a path to legality. This is a "black swan" event; current litigation (e.g., Kalshi's) is narrow and slow-moving.
5.  **Polymarket's CFTC Settlement (Moderate):** Polymarket's 2022 settlement requires them to cease US operations until they are compliant. This history of non-compliance creates a significant handicap and invites extra scrutiny in any potential application.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves at the end of 2025. With today's date being October 16, 2025, the remaining ~2.5-month window makes the completion of any meaningful regulatory, legislative, or judicial process a virtual impossibility. Base rates for approval are calculated over years, not weeks.
*   **Prior Enforcement History:** Unlike a new startup, Polymarket has a negative history with the CFTC. This moves it from the already-low-probability "new applicant" class to the near-zero-probability "prior violator seeking re-entry" class.
*   **Manifold's Non-Financial Model:** Manifold is not a financial company trying to offer a new product. It's a social/tech platform. A pivot to a real-money, regulated model would be a fundamental transformation of its product, community, and legal structure, for which there is no expressed interest.
*   **Hostile Regulatory Stance on Core Products:** The CFTC has demonstrated specific hostility towards political event contracts, which are a primary driver of volume and interest on platforms like Polymarket. This makes their specific product offerings harder to approve than Kalshi's more economically-focused ones.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the reference class of completing a complex federal regulatory approval process in under three months. This prior should be very strong (high "equivalent n") due to the well-established, slow-moving nature of US financial regulation.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The remaining time to resolution is <3 months, insufficient for any plausible legal or regulatory pathway.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The CFTC's continued public opposition to political prediction markets, a key market for these platforms.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Polymarket's prior enforcement action, which creates a higher-than-normal barrier to entry.
    *   (↓ Large) The complete lack of any public evidence (filings, press releases, lobbying) that either company is even attempting to gain a US license.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative and strongly correlated. It should push the already very low prior even closer to zero. The posterior probability should be minimal.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A surprise joint press release from Polymarket/Manifold and the CFTC announcing a settlement or novel temporary license (a "black swan" event).
    *   Passage of a "must-pass" government funding bill that includes a last-minute rider legalizing prediction markets.
    *   A sudden, public announcement by either company that they have been secretly working on an application for years and are in the final stages.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any CFTC statement reinforcing its current stance on event contracts.
    *   A statement from either company's leadership confirming no plans for US real-money operations in 2025.
    *   The passage of time; every day that passes without a major announcement makes a "Yes" resolution less likely.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The term "legally offer" is crucial. While it almost certainly implies federal CFTC approval, a creative legal team could attempt a state-by-state strategy or find a novel loophole. This is highly unlikely to succeed for a derivatives-style product.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The companies' internal strategies are not public. There is a small chance one of them is pursuing a secret path to compliance, though this is improbable for a process that requires public comment periods.
*   **"Black Swan" Politics:** A sudden political realignment or crisis could lead to unexpected and rapid legislative changes, though this is a generic uncertainty for any political forecast.
*   **Technological Workarounds:** A platform could argue a specific cryptocurrency or stablecoin used for betting is not a "commodity" under the CFTC's jurisdiction. This has been a consistently losing argument in US courts.

**Final Research Summary:** The path to legal operation in the US for these platforms is through the CFTC, a process that takes years. With less than three months remaining in 2025 and no public indication that either company has even begun this journey, a "Yes" resolution is a near impossibility.

To forecast the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the United States in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for this event is derived from the historical success rate of novel financial products gaining CFTC approval. Given the complexity and duration of the approval process, the base rate for a new applicant gaining approval within a single year is extremely low, likely less than 1%. For platforms like Polymarket, which have faced enforcement actions, the base rate is even lower, perhaps around 0.5%.

**Initial Prior:** 0.5% probability (or odds of 1:199).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Both Polymarket and Manifold would need CFTC approval to operate legally in the US with real money, similar to other financial platforms.
- The regulatory environment is consistent with historical patterns of strict oversight and lengthy approval processes.

**Differences:**
- The time horizon is extremely short (less than 3 months), which is atypical for regulatory approvals.
- Polymarket's prior enforcement action adds an additional barrier compared to a typical new applicant.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Time Constraint:** The likelihood of gaining approval in less than 3 months is extremely low. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
- **Regulatory Stance:** The CFTC's opposition to political prediction markets, a core offering for these platforms, further decreases the probability.
- **Lack of Public Movement:** No public filings or announcements from either company about pursuing US licensing significantly decreases the probability.
- **Prior Enforcement Action:** Polymarket's history with the CFTC decreases the probability due to increased scrutiny.

**Likelihood Ratios:**
- Time Constraint: P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is very low.
- Regulatory Stance: P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is low.
- Lack of Public Movement: P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is low.
- Prior Enforcement Action: P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Given the overwhelmingly negative evidence, we update the prior probability downward. The prior odds of 1:199 are adjusted by the cumulative likelihood ratios, which are all significantly less than 1.

**Posterior Odds:** Much lower than 1:199.
**Posterior Probability:** Approaches 0%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a "black swan" event, such as a sudden regulatory change or a secretive, expedited approval process.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A state-level legal strategy or a novel legal interpretation could theoretically allow operations, but these are highly improbable.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of any public movement or announcements strongly counters the possibility of a secretive approval process.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, the overwhelmingly negative evidence, and the short time horizon, the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the US in 2025 is extremely low.

Final: 0%

# Will real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold become legal in the US in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a prediction market platform gaining legal status to operate with real money in the US within a very short timeframe (approximately 2.5 months remaining in 2025).

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Novel financial platforms receiving CFTC approval
- Platforms with prior enforcement actions gaining regulatory approval
- Play-money platforms converting to real-money operations

Looking at historical precedents:
- The CFTC approval process for a Designated Contract Market (DCM) typically takes years
- Very few novel prediction market platforms have ever received approval (Kalshi being a rare example)
- Platforms with prior enforcement actions (like Polymarket) face even higher barriers
- There are essentially no examples of play-money platforms successfully transitioning to regulated real-money operations

**Prior probability**: Given the extremely short timeframe (2.5 months) and the lengthy regulatory processes involved, I'll set a very low prior of 0.5%. This reflects the near-impossibility of completing the necessary regulatory processes by year-end 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The CFTC remains the primary regulator for prediction markets
- The regulatory framework requiring DCM status hasn't fundamentally changed
- The process still requires extensive documentation, compliance infrastructure, and regulatory review

**Key differences**:
- **Extremely compressed timeline**: With only 2.5 months remaining in 2025, there is virtually no time for a standard regulatory process that typically takes years
- **Polymarket's enforcement history**: Polymarket has a prior settlement with the CFTC (2022), creating additional barriers
- **Manifold's business model**: Manifold is built around a play-money model, making a pivot to real-money operations a fundamental business transformation
- **No visible preparation**: Neither company has publicly announced any regulatory applications or preparations for US real-money operations

These differences significantly reduce the already low probability, as they represent additional barriers beyond the already challenging base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Lack of public regulatory filings or announcements**
- P(E|H): If legalization were imminent, we would almost certainly see public filings, announcements, or regulatory comments (~0.05)
- P(E|~H): If legalization is not happening, we would expect to see no such announcements (~0.99)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.99 = 0.05
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: CFTC's continued opposition to political prediction markets**
- P(E|H): If legalization were imminent, the CFTC would likely show softening stance (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If legalization is not happening, the CFTC would maintain opposition (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Extremely short remaining timeframe (2.5 months)**
- P(E|H): If legalization were to occur in 2025, a 2.5-month window would be sufficient (~0.01)
- P(E|~H): If legalization is not happening in 2025, a 2.5-month window would be insufficient (~0.99)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01/0.99 = 0.01
- This very strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Polymarket's prior CFTC settlement**
- P(E|H): If legalization were imminent, a platform with prior enforcement would overcome this barrier (~0.2)
- P(E|~H): If legalization is not happening, prior enforcement would remain a barrier (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 0.5% (0.005), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence first - the extremely short timeframe:

Prior odds = 0.005/(1-0.005) = 0.005/0.995 ≈ 0.005
Likelihood ratio = 0.01
Posterior odds = 0.005 × 0.01 = 0.00005
Posterior probability = 0.00005/(1+0.00005) ≈ 0.00005 = 0.005%

This already drops the probability to 0.005%. Updating further with the lack of public filings:

Prior odds = 0.00005/0.99995 ≈ 0.00005
Likelihood ratio = 0.05
Posterior odds = 0.00005 × 0.05 = 0.0000025
Posterior probability = 0.0000025/(1+0.0000025) ≈ 0.0000025 = 0.00025%

The probability has now decreased to an extremely small value, reflecting the virtual impossibility of this event occurring given the evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a "black swan" event like emergency legislation
- There could be confidential negotiations or regulatory pathways not visible to the public
- I might be overestimating the time required for regulatory approval in special circumstances

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A limited, state-by-state approach might be possible under certain conditions
- A novel legal interpretation could create a loophole for certain types of prediction markets
- A last-minute rider on must-pass legislation could create a special carve-out

**Best alternative forecast**:
The strongest case for a higher probability would be the possibility of a surprise announcement of a special regulatory sandbox or temporary permission. However, even this would likely require months of prior confidential work and would be extremely unusual for the CFTC.

**Adjustments**:
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for truly unexpected scenarios, but the adjustment should be minimal given the overwhelming evidence against legalization in this timeframe.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the US in the remaining months of 2025 is extremely low. The regulatory processes involved, the lack of visible preparation, the prior enforcement history, and the extremely short timeframe all point to a near-impossibility.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a novel financial/betting platform gaining legal status to operate with real money in the United States within a specific, very short timeframe. The primary path to legality is approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to operate as a Designated Contract Market (DCM).

The most relevant reference class is "companies seeking and receiving a DCM license from the CFTC." This process is notoriously long, complex, and expensive, typically taking multiple years. The success rate for any given applicant over a multi-year period is low.

However, the crucial context is the timeframe. The question resolves at the end of 2025, and the current date is October 16, 2025. This leaves only ~2.5 months. The base rate for a company to complete a multi-year federal regulatory approval process, starting from a position with no public application, in under three months is virtually zero.

A generous prior probability, P(H), for such an event, accounting for any unknown possibilities, would be extremely low. I will set the prior at **1%**. This acknowledges that "impossible" things sometimes happen in politics and regulation, but grounds the starting point in the reality of bureaucratic timelines.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case is a hypothetical, well-resourced startup with a clean record and a non-controversial product attempting this process. The current situation is significantly worse than this base case for several reasons:

*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The ~2.5-month window is the most significant negative factor. The base case assumes years; this situation has weeks.
*   **Polymarket's History:** Polymarket is not a new applicant with a clean slate. It has a history of operating in the US without authorization, leading to a 2022 settlement with the CFTC. This history invites heightened scrutiny and makes a swift, favorable outcome highly improbable.
*   **Manifold's Business Model:** Manifold is a play-money platform. It lacks the financial, compliance, and legal infrastructure required for real-money operations. A pivot to a regulated financial entity is a fundamental business transformation, not a simple application process.
*   **Controversial Product:** The CFTC has shown specific and sustained hostility towards political prediction markets, which are the flagship products for these platforms. This is in contrast to a base case involving less controversial contracts (e.g., economic indicators).

These differences all suggest the probability for this specific case should be even lower than the already minuscule base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that one of the platforms becomes legal in the US in 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: The remaining time is ~2.5 months.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of seeing only 2.5 months left, given that a multi-year process will successfully conclude, is extremely low. It would require a "black swan" event.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of seeing 2.5 months left, given the status quo of illegality continues, is 1. This is just the passage of time.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This evidence massively decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: There is no public record of an application, intent to file, or significant lobbying effort from either company.**
    *   P(E2 | H): The CFTC approval process includes public comment periods. It is nearly impossible for an application to be in its final stages of approval without any public footprint. Therefore, this evidence is extremely unlikely given H.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): This evidence is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that neither company is pursuing or will achieve legalization in 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This is another piece of overwhelming negative evidence.

*   **Evidence 3: The CFTC is actively litigating against Kalshi to prevent election markets.**
    *   P(E3 | H): It is deeply contradictory for the CFTC to be fighting to ban the core product of these platforms in court while simultaneously preparing to grant them a license. This is highly unlikely.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): The CFTC's legal stance is perfectly consistent with its ongoing refusal to authorize such markets.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H (< 1).

The evidence is uniformly and powerfully negative.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** P(H) = 1% → 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 1:99.
*   **Update Step:** The combined evidence of the short timeline and the lack of any public application is damning. The likelihood ratio for this evidence (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) is extremely small, let's conservatively estimate it at 1/100.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:99) × (1/100) = 1:9900
*   **Posterior Probability:** Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 1 / (1 + 9900) ≈ 0.01%.

Further evidence, like the CFTC's hostility and Polymarket's prior record, would push this vanishingly small probability even closer to zero. The result is a posterior that is functionally indistinguishable from zero for practical purposes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest counter-argument is not a standard regulatory approval but a "black swan" event. The most plausible scenario is Congress attaching a last-minute rider to a must-pass government funding bill that legalizes prediction markets, bypassing the CFTC entirely.

Why this might happen: A new political administration or a powerful lobbying effort could force it through.
Why it's still unlikely:
1.  There is no major political momentum or public demand for this.
2.  Financial regulation is complex and controversial; such a rider would attract opposition.
3.  Even if a law were passed, it would likely direct a regulator (like the CFTC) to create a framework, a process that would still take time. An instant, self-executing legalization is legally and practically difficult.
4.  The ~2.5-month timeline makes even this emergency legislative path extremely difficult.

While this "black swan" scenario prevents the probability from being absolute zero, its likelihood is exceptionally low. My initial 1% prior was intended to capture such possibilities. The subsequent analysis confirms that even with these possibilities, the final probability should remain in that very low range. A forecast of 1% adequately accounts for these tail risks without being naive about the overwhelming evidence against the event occurring.

### 6. Final Forecast
The path to legal real-money operation in the US for Polymarket or Manifold is blocked by immense hurdles. The primary path, CFTC approval, is a multi-year process, and there are only weeks left in 2025 with no indication that the process has even begun. The companies involved face specific disadvantages (prior enforcement, unsuitable business model), and the regulator is actively hostile to their main product. The only conceivable path to a "Yes" resolution is a legislative miracle, an event of exceedingly low probability. Therefore, the forecast reflects a near-impossibility.

Final: 1%
