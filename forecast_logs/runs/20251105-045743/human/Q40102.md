### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the observed rate of admissions under the agreement since its inception? Is this rate accelerating, decelerating, or stable?
    *   What are the primary bottlenecks and dependencies of the "one in, one out" mechanism? (i.e., what is the rate of *returns* to France, which enables admissions?)
    *   What is the administrative capacity of the UK and French governments to process both returns and new admissions?
    *   What is the political and legal environment surrounding the agreement? Is there strong will to accelerate it, or are there significant headwinds (e.g., legal challenges, political criticism)?
    *   What are appropriate historical analogies (reference classes) for a new, politically sensitive, bilateral migration agreement like this?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `"Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys" UK France statistics`
    *   `UK France migrant returns deal numbers 2025`
    *   `"one in one out" channel crossings returns data`
    *   `UK Home Office asylum processing capacity 2025`
    *   `Legal challenges UK France migrant returns agreement`
    *   `Political criticism "Dangerous Journeys Agreement" UK`
    *   `UK refugee resettlement schemes initial rollout speed` (e.g., Syrian VPRS, Afghan ARAP)
    *   `UK asylum returns statistics Dublin Regulation`

3.  **Synthesize Key Findings:**
    *   The initial rate of admissions is very low. From the first admission (Sep 24) to the latest report (Oct 24), 23 people were admitted over 30 days, an average of ~0.77 people/day.
    *   The rate appears to be decelerating. The first 18 admissions took ~15 days (1.2/day), while the next 5 took another 15 days (~0.33/day). This suggests the initial numbers may have been a pre-cleared batch and not indicative of a sustainable rate.
    *   The key bottleneck is the number of successful returns to France. Admissions cannot exceed returns. Historically, UK returns agreements (like the Dublin Regulation) have been hampered by legal challenges and administrative friction, resulting in very low numbers (a few hundred per year at most).
    *   The political environment is challenging. The RFI report notes the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting, which could reduce political will to accelerate the scheme or increase operational friction.
    *   The scheme is a "pilot" running until June 2026, suggesting it may be intentionally small-scale and subject to review, rather than a full-scale operation from the outset.

4.  **Draft the Comprehensive Answer:**
    *   Structure the synthesized findings into the required format, focusing on providing clear, decision-useful information for a statistician. Emphasize the low initial rate, the deceleration, and the key dependency on the returns process.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Initial Phase of New Government Immigration Schemes:** New, complex government programs, especially those involving international cooperation and legal processes, typically start very slowly. Examples include the initial rollout of the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) or the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), which took many months to process the first few hundred individuals. This class suggests a low number, likely in the dozens, not hundreds, in the first 2-3 months.
*   **UK-EU Asylum Return Agreements (e.g., Dublin III Regulation):** Before Brexit, the UK's ability to return asylum seekers to other EU countries was limited by legal and administrative hurdles. In 2019, the UK made 5,509 requests to Dublin members but only achieved 241 actual transfers. This represents a ~4% success rate. If we apply this logic, even with thousands of potential returnees, the number of successful returns (and thus admissions) would be very low, perhaps 20-50 per month.
*   **The Observed Rate of this Specific Program:** The program has admitted 23 people in its first month of operation (Sep 24 - Oct 24). Extrapolating this rate (~23/month) through the end of the year (approx. 2.2 months remaining from Oct 24) would yield around 50 additional people. This provides a data-driven, albeit short-term, base rate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-06] Agreement comes into force, allowing returns and subsequent legal admissions. — NEUTRAL — Establishes the mechanism but provides no data on rate.
*   [2025-09-19] UK Home Office confirms the pilot scheme is running. — NEUTRAL — Confirms operational status but suggests a limited, experimental scale.
*   [2025-09-24] First family of three admitted under the scheme. — ↓ — Establishes a very low starting point nearly two months after the agreement began.
*   [2025-10-09] Total admissions reach 18 people. — ↓ — The rate over the first ~15 days is low (~1 person/day), setting a weak trend.
*   [2025-10-24] Total admissions reach 23 people; reports of mounting criticism. — ↓ — The rate has decelerated significantly (~0.33 people/day), and political friction is increasing.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Rate of successful returns to France:** This is the primary, direct driver. Admissions are legally capped at a 1:1 ratio with returns. Any legal, logistical, or political friction slowing returns directly slows admissions. (Large impact)
*   **UK/French administrative capacity:** The speed of processing paperwork for both returns (in the UK) and new visa applications (in France) is a major bottleneck. Bureaucratic inertia and resource constraints will keep numbers low. (Large impact)
*   **Legal challenges:** Any successful legal challenge against the return of an individual or group could pause or halt the entire returns process, thereby freezing admissions. (Large impact)
*   **Political will:** The UK government is under pressure to show results. This could lead to a push to accelerate the scheme. Conversely, French reluctance or mounting criticism in the UK could lead to a deliberate slowdown. (Moderate impact)
*   **Winter weather:** Rougher sea conditions in the Channel during November and December typically reduce the number of crossings. This lowers the pool of potential returnees, potentially reducing the urgency and scale of the program. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct 1:1 Linkage:** Unlike past resettlement schemes (VPRS) or return mechanisms (Dublin), this agreement creates a direct, one-for-one link between a return and a legal admission. This makes the program's output entirely dependent on the success of the most difficult part: the returns.
*   **Bilateral vs. Multilateral:** The agreement is a focused bilateral deal with France, which could theoretically be more efficient than the multi-country Dublin Regulation. However, it also makes the scheme highly sensitive to the political relationship between just two countries.
*   **"Pilot Scheme" Status:** The program is explicitly a pilot until June 2026. This suggests it is designed to be small-scale, tested, and evaluated, not ramped up to maximum capacity immediately. This strongly argues against a high number in its initial months.
*   **High Political Salience:** The issue of Channel crossings is a top-tier political priority for the UK government, creating immense pressure to demonstrate success. This could lead to "Potemkin" accelerations (e.g., a year-end push for PR), but is unlikely to overcome fundamental administrative barriers.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on historical returns data (Dublin Regulation) and the slow start of other new schemes would be centered low, perhaps in the range of 50-150 people by year-end, with a wide tail. Equivalent n should be low, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Initial data (23 people in the first month): ↓ (Large) — The observed rate is extremely low and grounds the forecast in concrete, pessimistic data.
    *   Decelerating rate between Oct 9 and Oct 24: ↓ (Moderate) — Suggests the system is hitting friction and the initial, slightly higher rate was not sustainable.
    *   "Pilot scheme" framing: ↓ (Moderate) — Reinforces the idea that the program is not intended to operate at scale in 2025.
    *   Mounting criticism and lack of deterrent effect: ↓ (Small) — Increases the probability of political or operational headwinds that prevent acceleration.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downwards. The posterior distribution should be shifted significantly lower and tightened around a value in the low-to-mid double digits (e.g., 40-80).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official UK/French government statements touting a specific, high number of *returns* to France.
    *   Reports of a streamlined or accelerated administrative process for the scheme.
    *   Dismissal of any significant legal challenges against the returns policy.
    *   A sudden, large batch of admissions announced before the Christmas parliamentary recess for political effect.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A gap of more than 2-3 weeks with no new admission numbers reported.
    *   Reports of successful legal injunctions preventing returns.
    *   Statements from French officials expressing frustration or non-cooperation with the scheme.
    *   UK government officials beginning to manage expectations downwards about the scheme's immediate impact.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Opacity and Lag:** Numbers are released sporadically through media reports, not on a regular government dashboard. The final, official number may not be known until well after the resolution date.
*   **Political Manipulation:** The government has a strong incentive to announce a "success" before year-end. This could lead to a last-minute push to process a batch of applications, creating a data spike that is not representative of the true sustainable rate.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria is "received visas." This is a specific bureaucratic step. It may not align perfectly with physical arrival in the UK, and data on this specific step may be hard to find.
*   **Conflation of Crossings, Returns, and Admissions:** Media reports often focus on the number of crossings, which is an input, not an output. The key numbers—returns and admissions—are much smaller and less frequently reported. Do not mistake high crossing numbers for a high number of admissions.

**Final Research Summary:** The agreement is operationally constrained by its "one in, one out" design, making it dependent on the slow and legally fraught process of returning individuals to France. Early data shows a very low and decelerating rate of admissions, suggesting significant administrative and political friction. The final number by year-end is highly likely to be in the low double digits, probably below 100.

To forecast the number of people who will be admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, let's follow the structured approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The initial phase of new government immigration schemes and historical UK-EU asylum return agreements.
   - **Reasoning:** These schemes typically start slowly due to administrative and legal hurdles. The observed rate of admissions for this specific program is very low, with only 23 people admitted in the first month.
   - **Base Rate Statistics:** Mean/median around 50-150 people by year-end, with a wide variance due to high uncertainty.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation reflects the slow start typical of new immigration schemes and the legal/administrative challenges seen in past UK-EU agreements.
   - **Differences:** This agreement has a direct 1:1 linkage between returns and admissions, which is unique and could further constrain numbers.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Initial Admissions Data:** The low number of 23 admissions in the first month strongly suggests a slow start. This evidence decreases the likelihood of high numbers.
   - **Decelerating Rate:** The drop from 1.2/day to 0.33/day indicates increasing friction, further decreasing the likelihood of high numbers.
   - **Pilot Scheme Status:** Suggests intentional small-scale operation, decreasing likelihood of high numbers.
   - **Political and Legal Environment:** Mounting criticism and lack of deterrent effect suggest potential headwinds, decreasing likelihood of high numbers.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered around 50-150, the evidence (low admissions, deceleration, pilot status) shifts the distribution lower.
   - **Posterior Shift:** The mean shifts towards the lower end of the range, with reduced variance reflecting increased confidence in a low outcome.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider potential for political manipulation or sudden administrative changes that could increase numbers.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden political push or streamlined process could increase admissions, but evidence suggests this is unlikely.
   - **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for potential political interventions.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles are:

P10: 30  
P20: 40  
P40: 50  
P60: 60  
P80: 70  
P90: 80

# Forecasting: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Observed Rate of Current Program**: The most direct base rate is the actual observed rate of the program so far. From September 24 to October 24, 2025, 23 people were admitted over 30 days (0.77 people/day). If this rate continued unchanged until December 31, 2025 (about 68 more days), we would expect approximately 52 more people, for a total of 75 people.

2. **UK-EU Asylum Return Agreements**: Under the Dublin III Regulation, the UK achieved very low actual transfer rates (around 4% success rate). This suggests that even with thousands of potential returnees, successful returns (and thus admissions) would be very low, perhaps 20-50 per month, or 60-150 by year-end.

3. **Initial Phase of New Immigration Schemes**: New government programs involving international cooperation typically start very slowly. The Syrian VPRS and Afghan ARAP schemes took months to process the first few hundred individuals.

Based on these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around 100 people, with a wide variance (standard deviation of about 50) to reflect the high uncertainty in a new program.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes:**
- Like other immigration schemes, this involves complex bureaucratic processes across multiple countries
- Like the Dublin Regulation, it depends on successful returns which face legal and administrative hurdles
- The program is in its early stages, which typically means slow processing

**Key differences:**
- The "one in, one out" mechanism creates a direct dependency on returns, which is the most difficult part
- This is a bilateral agreement with France rather than a multilateral one, potentially simplifying coordination
- It's explicitly labeled as a "pilot scheme" until June 2026, suggesting intentionally limited scale
- The issue has extremely high political salience in the UK, creating pressure for visible results

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing numbers down:**
- Initial rate is extremely low (23 people in first month) → Strong evidence for low numbers (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower outcomes)
- Deceleration observed between Oct 9-24 (from 1.2/day to 0.33/day) → Moderate evidence for low numbers (likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- "Pilot scheme" framing suggests intentionally limited scale → Moderate evidence (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)
- Mounting criticism and lack of deterrent effect creates political headwinds → Weak evidence (likelihood ratio ~1.2:1)

**Evidence pushing numbers up:**
- High political pressure to demonstrate success could lead to year-end push → Weak evidence (likelihood ratio ~1:1.2 favoring higher outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 100 with SD of 50, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on initial low rate (23 people in first month):**
- Prior: Mean = 100, SD = 50
- Likelihood: ~3:1 favoring lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shift mean downward to ~70, reduce SD to ~40

**Update on observed deceleration:**
- Prior: Mean = 70, SD = 40
- Likelihood: ~2:1 favoring lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shift mean downward to ~55, reduce SD to ~35

**Update on "pilot scheme" framing:**
- Prior: Mean = 55, SD = 35
- Likelihood: ~1.5:1 favoring lower outcomes
- Posterior: Shift mean downward to ~45, maintain SD at ~35

The combined evidence strongly suggests a number lower than my initial prior, with the posterior distribution centered around 45 people.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the UK government's ability to accelerate processing for political reasons before year-end
- The observed rate is based on only one month of data, which may not be representative
- There could be a large batch of pre-vetted cases waiting for administrative clearance
- The research doesn't mention the total number of returns to France, which is the key constraint

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **High scenario (100-150 people)**: The UK government, facing political pressure, dedicates significant resources to accelerate returns and admissions before year-end. A large batch of cases is processed in December.
- **Very low scenario (25-35 people)**: Legal challenges or diplomatic friction completely stalls the program, and few additional people are admitted beyond the current 23.

After considering these scenarios, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for the possibility of a year-end push, but maintain the relatively low median.

## 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered around a median of 50 people, with a wider right tail to account for the possibility of political acceleration:

P10: 30
P20: 35
P40: 45
P60: 55
P80: 75
P90: 95

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is derived from the program's own, albeit limited, performance data. This is the most specific and relevant reference class.

*   **Observed Rate:** Between September 24 and October 24, 2025 (30 days), 23 people were admitted. This gives an average rate of **0.77 people/day**.
*   **Decelerating Trend:** The rate was not constant. The first 18 people were admitted in ~15 days (1.2/day), while the next 5 took another 15 days (0.33/day).
*   **Extrapolation:** The forecast period is from October 24 to December 31, 2025 (68 days). A simple extrapolation provides a range for my prior:
    *   Pessimistic (recent rate): 23 (current) + (68 days * 0.33/day) ≈ 45 people.
    *   Optimistic (initial rate): 23 (current) + (68 days * 1.2/day) ≈ 105 people.
    *   Average rate: 23 (current) + (68 days * 0.77/day) ≈ 75 people.

A secondary reference class is historical UK asylum return schemes, like the Dublin III Regulation, which managed only 241 transfers in all of 2019 (~20/month). This suggests that even an established system struggles to achieve high numbers, reinforcing the idea that a new pilot scheme will be slow.

Based on these, I will set my prior distribution centered around the average-rate extrapolation, but with significant skew towards the lower, more recent rate. My prior median is around 60, with a wide, right-skewed distribution reflecting the high uncertainty and the possibility of failure (low numbers) being more likely than runaway success.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs from a simple extrapolation in several key ways that suggest a lower outcome:

*   **Structural Bottleneck:** The agreement's "one in, one out" mechanism is a hard cap. Admissions cannot exceed successful returns to France. The returns process is known to be slow, legally complex, and the primary constraint on the system. This is a powerful reason to favor lower numbers.
*   **"Pilot Scheme" Status:** The program is explicitly a pilot until mid-2026. This implies it is designed for testing and evaluation, not for immediate, large-scale operation. This makes a sudden ramp-up to hundreds of people highly improbable.
*   **Political Headwinds:** The RFI report notes that the deal is not deterring crossings and that criticism is mounting. This can erode the political will needed to overcome administrative friction, potentially slowing the process further.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the following evidence:

*   **The Decelerating Rate (Strong Downward Pressure):** The drop from 1.2/day to 0.33/day is the single most important piece of new information. It suggests the initial, higher rate was not sustainable (perhaps a pre-cleared batch) and that the system is now operating at a much slower, friction-limited pace. This makes outcomes based on the recent rate (totaling ~45) much more likely than outcomes based on the initial or average rates (75-105).
*   **The "Pilot Scheme" Framing (Moderate Downward Pressure):** This evidence makes high-end scenarios (e.g., >150) very unlikely. A pilot program is, by definition, not at full scale. This trims the upper tail of my distribution.
*   **Mounting Criticism (Small Downward Pressure):** This factor increases the probability of political or administrative slowdowns. It makes a last-minute, politically motivated push to accelerate the numbers slightly less likely, as the program may be viewed as a liability rather than a success to be touted.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Centered around 60, wide and right-skewed. P50 ≈ 60, P90 ≈ 150.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence, particularly the decelerating rate, strongly favors lower outcomes. The likelihood function peaks at a much lower value than the prior mean.
*   **Posterior:** Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood. The strong downward evidence pulls the entire distribution lower and tightens it.
    *   The median (P50) shifts from ~60 down towards the ~45 figure suggested by the most recent operational rate.
    *   The upper tail is significantly curtailed. The "pilot" status and returns bottleneck make a total of 150 seem fantastical. The P90 should be pulled down below 100.
    *   The lower tail is anchored by the current number of 23. A complete stall is possible, so the P10 should not be much higher than the current total.

My resulting posterior distribution is centered near 45, with a much smaller variance than the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Forecast (Higher):** The government, desperate for a political win before the Christmas recess, could force through a large, pre-vetted batch of applicants. They could announce that "over 100 people" have been admitted to show the scheme is working. This is a plausible tail risk. The main rebuttal is the hard constraint of the 1:1 returns ratio; they cannot admit people without first returning an equivalent number, which is the slow part. However, a concerted political effort might overcome this for a one-off announcement.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Lower):** A successful legal challenge in UK courts could place an injunction on all returns, freezing the scheme entirely. In this scenario, the number might not move beyond the current 23, or perhaps only a few more who are already in the final stages. This is also a plausible tail risk.
*   **Adjustment:** My median of 45 seems robust as it reflects the current, observed reality. The tail risks in both directions are real. I will set my P10 low (at 30) to account for a near-stall. I will adjust my P90 up to 90 to account for the possibility of a politically motivated year-end surge that manages to roughly match the initial, higher rate of processing. This creates a wide, skewed distribution that respects the central tendency of the data while acknowledging the political and legal volatility.
