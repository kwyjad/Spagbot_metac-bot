### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on "Major Questions" of Executive Authority:** This class includes recent cases where an executive agency asserted significant, economy-altering power based on ambiguous or old statutory authority. The Court has increasingly invoked the "major questions doctrine" to strike down such actions.
    *   **Base Rate:** In the last 5-10 years, the executive branch has lost most of these cases (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*, *Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. HHS*). A base rate for the Court striking down the executive action in such cases is **~70-80%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This reference class is relevant because imposing trillions of dollars in tariffs based on a 1977 emergency powers act is a quintessential "major question" that touches on core congressional powers (taxation and commerce).
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in these domains.
    *   **Base Rate:** The President's actions are upheld in a majority of these cases (e.g., *Trump v. Hawaii*, *Dames & Moore v. Regan*). A base rate for the Court upholding the President's action is **~60-70%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The government's case rests on framing the tariffs as a necessary tool to combat foreign-sourced threats (drug trafficking) and protect national economic security, placing it within this reference class.
3.  **Supreme Court Reversal of Unanimous Circuit Court Decisions:** The Supreme Court grants review to resolve circuit splits or correct errors. When lower courts are in agreement, it signals a less contentious legal question.
    *   **Base Rate:** The Supreme Court affirms lower court decisions it takes up less than 40% of the time. However, the dynamic is different when multiple lower courts have unanimously reached the same conclusion on the merits, as here. The base rate for affirming the *substance* of a unanimous lower court consensus is likely higher than the general affirmance rate, perhaps **~50%**.
    *   **Limitations:** The first two reference classes point in opposite directions, indicating the core tension of the case. The third is a weak signal. The most relevant class is likely #1 due to the current Court's clear jurisprudential direction on separation of powers issues.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms tariffs are unlawful in a 7-4 decision. — ↑ for "Tariffs unlawful" — A bipartisan majority in the key appellate court found the government's arguments unpersuasive, strengthening the legal case against the tariffs.
*   **2025-09-03** Government petitions the Supreme Court for review. — ↑ for a definitive 2025 ruling — Signals the government's intent to get a final answer, making "No 2025 ruling" less likely.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. — ↑↑ for a definitive 2025 ruling — The Court's decision to fast-track the case makes a ruling before Jan 1, 2026, highly probable, virtually eliminating the "No 2025 ruling" option.
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments are held today. — (Event is today) — The questions asked by the justices will be the most recent and powerful indicator of their leanings.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's skepticism of executive agencies claiming vast new powers without explicit congressional authorization. If the Court sees this as a "major question," it will likely strike down the tariffs. (Large impact, favors "Unlawful").
2.  **Textualism:** The dominant interpretive philosophy on the current Court. The text of IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate" but does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties." Challengers argue this is a fatal omission, as the power to tax is Congress's. (Large impact, favors "Unlawful").
3.  **Non-Delegation Doctrine:** A revived constitutional theory that Congress cannot delegate its core legislative powers (like taxation) to the President. While the Court is unlikely to invalidate IEEPA on these grounds, it may interpret the statute narrowly to avoid the constitutional question. (Moderate impact, favors "Unlawful").
4.  **Deference in Foreign Affairs:** The traditional view that the President has broad authority to act on the world stage, especially when invoking national security. The government's case hinges on the Court applying this deference. (Moderate impact, favors "Lawful").
5.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court may view the "trafficking tariffs" (tied to a more traditional national security threat like drug cartels) differently from the "reciprocal tariffs" (tied to trade deficits, a purely economic issue). This could lead to a split decision. (Moderate impact, favors "Mixed ruling").
6.  **Institutionalism of Chief Justice Roberts:** The Chief Justice often seeks narrow rulings and tries to avoid decisions that appear overly political or disruptive. This could favor a narrow statutory ruling striking down the tariffs without setting a broad constitutional precedent. (Moderate impact, favors "Unlawful" or "Mixed").

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Economic Scope:** Unlike past IEEPA uses that targeted specific entities or countries, these tariffs affect nearly all U.S. trade. This magnifies the "major question" aspect beyond typical executive action cases.
*   **Direct Conflict with Article I Powers:** The power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" is one of Congress's most fundamental, explicit powers. The tariffs represent a direct presidential assumption of that power, making this a sharper separation-of-powers conflict than in many regulatory cases.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Using a chronic trade deficit as an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to justify emergency powers is a novel and legally tenuous expansion of IEEPA's predicate, contrasting with its historical use for foreign policy crises like the Iran hostage crisis.
*   **Strong Lower Court Consensus:** It is unusual for two different federal courts (CIT and DC District) and a key appellate court (Federal Circuit) to so decisively and unanimously on the outcome rule against a major presidential initiative. This creates strong momentum against the government's position.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the "Major Questions" reference class. A plausible prior might be a 70% belief in "Tariffs unlawful," 15% in "Mixed ruling," 10% in "Tariffs lawful," and 5% in "Other/No ruling," with a moderate strength (equivalent n=10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Unlawful (large):** The statutory argument is strong (textualism, IEEPA does not say "tariffs"). This aligns perfectly with the Court's dominant judicial philosophy.
    *   **↑ Unlawful (moderate):** The unanimous lower court rulings from multiple jurisdictions signal that the government's legal theory is weak across the ideological spectrum.
    *   **↑ Mixed (moderate):** The Court could distinguish between the more plausible national security rationale for the trafficking tariffs and the weaker economic rationale for the reciprocal tariffs.
    *   **↓ Lawful (large):** The sheer scale of the tariffs makes it highly unlikely the current Court would grant such a sweeping delegation of power without a crystal-clear statement from Congress.
    *   **↓ No 2025 ruling (large):** The Court's grant of expedited review makes a decision by year-end almost certain.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior belief in an "Unlawful" ruling. The posterior probability for "Unlawful" should increase significantly, with "Mixed ruling" as the most credible alternative. The probability for "Lawful" should be very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Tariffs lawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from Roberts, Kavanaugh, or Barrett focusing on the President's need for flexibility in foreign policy.
    *   Questions suggesting the "trafficking tariffs" are on stronger legal ground than the "reciprocal tariffs."
    *   Commentary highlighting historical precedents of presidents using tariffs for foreign policy leverage.
    *   Justices expressing concern about the economic disruption of immediately invalidating all tariffs.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "Tariffs unlawful"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from conservative justices (Gorsuch, Thomas, Alito) about the non-delegation doctrine or Congress's Article I power of the purse.
    *   Questions from Roberts or Kavanaugh focusing on the lack of the specific word "tariff" in IEEPA's text.
    *   Skeptical questions from any justice about whether a "trade deficit" can constitute a national emergency under the statute.
    *   The government's lawyer struggling to answer questions about a limiting principle for presidential power under their interpretation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Definition:** A "Mixed ruling" requires the Court to explicitly uphold some measures and strike down others. A ruling that strikes down all tariffs but on narrow grounds that might permit future, different tariffs would still resolve as "Unlawful."
*   **"Other Ruling" Possibility:** While unlikely, the Court could still devise a procedural exit, such as dismissing the writ as improvidently granted or issuing a GVR (grant, vacate, remand) order without a merits holding, which would resolve as "Other."
*   **Oral Argument Misinterpretation:** Questions at oral argument are not votes, and justices often play devil's advocate. Over-interpreting a single line of questioning is a common forecasting error.
*   **The "Foreign Affairs Deference" Wildcard:** The Court's historical deference to the executive in this sphere is a powerful counter-current. A majority could decide this is a political question or that the President needs this tool, despite weak textual support.
*   **Speed of Decision:** The expedited schedule creates a tight timeline. While a decision is expected by late December, any delay could push it into 2026, triggering the "No 2025 ruling" outcome.

**Final Research Summary:** The legal arguments against the tariffs, grounded in textualism and the major questions doctrine, align strongly with the current Supreme Court's jurisprudence. Combined with the unified opposition from lower courts, the most probable outcome is a ruling that the tariffs are unlawful, with a mixed ruling being the primary alternative.

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs unlawful:** The base rate for the Supreme Court striking down executive actions on major questions of economic impact is approximately 70-80%, based on recent cases like *West Virginia v. EPA*. This is the most relevant reference class given the nature of the tariffs and the Court's current jurisprudence.
  
- **Tariffs lawful:** The base rate for upholding presidential actions in foreign affairs and national security is around 60-70%. However, this is less relevant here due to the economic nature of the tariffs and the explicit congressional powers involved.
  
- **Mixed ruling:** There is no direct base rate, but the possibility of a mixed ruling arises from the Court potentially distinguishing between different types of tariffs (e.g., trafficking vs. reciprocal).
  
- **Other ruling:** Historically, procedural dismissals or non-merits rulings are less common but possible, especially if the Court seeks to avoid a substantive decision.
  
- **No 2025 ruling:** Given the expedited schedule, the probability of no ruling by the end of 2025 is very low.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves a major question of executive authority, similar to other cases where the Court has struck down executive actions.
  
- **Differences:** The tariffs' unprecedented economic scope and direct conflict with Congress's Article I powers make this case particularly significant.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Likelihood of "Tariffs unlawful":** Strong statutory arguments (textualism, major questions doctrine) and unanimous lower court rulings increase this likelihood.
  
- **Likelihood of "Tariffs lawful":** The government's argument for deference in foreign affairs is weaker due to the economic nature of the tariffs.
  
- **Likelihood of "Mixed ruling":** The Court could distinguish between different tariff types, especially if oral arguments suggest this line of reasoning.
  
- **Likelihood of "Other ruling":** Procedural outcomes are less likely given the Court's decision to expedite the case.
  
- **Likelihood of "No 2025 ruling":** The expedited schedule makes this very unlikely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior for "Tariffs unlawful":** Start with 70% based on the major questions doctrine.
  
- **Evidence update:** The unanimous lower court rulings and strong statutory arguments increase this to approximately 80%.
  
- **Prior for "Tariffs lawful":** Start with 10% due to the weak textual basis and major questions doctrine.
  
- **Evidence update:** The lack of strong support in oral arguments and the economic nature of the tariffs decrease this to approximately 5%.
  
- **Prior for "Mixed ruling":** Start with 15% due to the possibility of distinguishing tariff types.
  
- **Evidence update:** If oral arguments suggest this distinction, it could increase to approximately 10%.
  
- **Prior for "Other ruling":** Start with 5% due to procedural possibilities.
  
- **Evidence update:** The expedited schedule decreases this to approximately 3%.
  
- **Prior for "No 2025 ruling":** Start with 0% due to the expedited schedule.
  
- **Evidence update:** Remains at 0%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence check:** Consider the possibility of the Court finding a procedural exit or a narrow ruling that doesn't fit neatly into the categories.
  
- **Alternative scenarios:** The Court could issue a narrow ruling that avoids setting a broad precedent, which might be categorized as "Other ruling."

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and adjust for any overconfidence or blind spots.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 80%  
Mixed ruling: 10%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%  

These probabilities reflect the most likely outcomes based on the current evidence and the Supreme Court's jurisprudential trends.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 65%)**
- The Supreme Court has increasingly limited executive power in "major questions" cases where agencies claim significant economic authority without explicit congressional authorization
- In recent years (e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, NFIB v. OSHA), the Court has struck down executive actions ~70-80% of the time when they involve major economic policy without clear statutory authorization
- The textualist majority on the current Court is skeptical of broad delegations of legislative power

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 20%)**
- The Court sometimes distinguishes between different aspects of executive actions
- The trafficking tariffs (tied to drug cartels) have a stronger national security rationale than the reciprocal tariffs (tied to trade deficits)
- This creates a natural dividing line for a split decision

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 10%)**
- Historically, the Court has shown deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security
- In cases like Trump v. Hawaii, the Court upheld presidential actions with national security justifications
- However, this deference has been weakening with the current Court's emphasis on separation of powers

**Other ruling (Prior: 3%)**
- The Court occasionally finds procedural exits without reaching the merits
- This is rare in high-profile cases with clear circuit court decisions

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 2%)**
- The Court has granted expedited review with arguments in November 2025
- This timeline almost guarantees a decision before year-end
- Only extraordinary circumstances would delay a ruling into 2026

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate cases:**
- Like other "major questions" cases, this involves an executive claim of vast economic power based on a broadly worded statute
- The Court has consistently required clear congressional authorization for major policy shifts
- The current Court's textualist approach emphasizes statutory language over executive flexibility

**Key differences:**
- The scale of these tariffs is unprecedented - affecting trillions in trade across multiple countries
- The tariffs directly implicate Congress's Article I power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises"
- The lower courts have shown unusual unanimity in rejecting the government's position
- The case involves both traditional national security concerns (drug trafficking) and economic policy (trade deficits)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Lower court unanimity against the tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = Very high (~0.8) - We would expect consistent lower court rulings if the legal case against the tariffs is strong
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~0.2) - It would be surprising to see such consensus if the tariffs were clearly lawful
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Text of IEEPA lacks explicit mention of "tariffs" or "duties"**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~0.7) - This textual omission is exactly what we'd expect if Congress didn't intend to delegate tariff authority
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Moderate (~0.4) - The government must argue that "regulate" implicitly includes tariffs
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Different rationales for trafficking vs. reciprocal tariffs**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~0.7) - This distinction provides a natural dividing line for the Court
- P(E|Tariffs all unlawful/lawful) = Moderate (~0.4) - The Court could still rule categorically
- Likelihood ratio favors "Mixed ruling" over categorical outcomes

**Evidence: Court granted expedited review**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~0.05) - Expedited review strongly suggests the Court intends to rule quickly
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = Very high (~0.95) - This is the expected behavior when the Court fast-tracks a case
- Likelihood ratio strongly disfavors "No 2025 ruling"

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the lower court unanimity evidence:

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior odds: 65/35 = 1.86
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 4 = 7.44
- Posterior probability: 7.44/(1+7.44) ≈ 88%

For "Mixed ruling":
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.3/0.7 = 0.43 (lower courts rejected all tariffs)
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.43 = 0.11
- Posterior probability: 0.11/(1+0.11) ≈ 10%

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior odds: 10/90 = 0.11
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 0.25 = 0.028
- Posterior probability: 0.028/(1+0.028) ≈ 3%

Updating on the textual evidence and different rationales:
- "Tariffs unlawful" remains strongly favored but decreases slightly to ~75% due to the possibility of a mixed ruling
- "Mixed ruling" increases to ~20% due to the different rationales for different tariffs
- "Tariffs lawful" remains low at ~3%
- "Other ruling" stays at ~2%
- "No 2025 ruling" decreases to ~0.5% given the expedited schedule

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs
- The Court might view drug trafficking as a genuine national security emergency justifying extraordinary measures
- The Court could create a new doctrinal framework that distinguishes between different types of emergency powers

**Alternative forecast:**
- A plausible alternative would give more weight to a mixed ruling (~40%) and less to a categorical "unlawful" ruling (~50%)
- This would recognize that the Court often seeks narrower grounds when possible
- The trafficking tariffs have a stronger national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs

**Tail risks:**
- The Court could issue a landmark ruling on the non-delegation doctrine, fundamentally reshaping separation of powers
- The case could become moot if Trump withdraws the tariffs before the Court rules
- Political pressure could lead to an unusual compromise ruling

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly to account for the stronger possibility of a mixed ruling.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:

Tariffs unlawful: 72%
Mixed ruling: 23%
Tariffs lawful: 3%
Other ruling: 1.5%
No 2025 ruling: 0.5%

Sum: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs unlawful: 72%
Mixed ruling: 23%
Tariffs lawful: 3%
Other ruling: 1.5%
No 2025 ruling: 0.5%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The central conflict in this case is between two competing legal doctrines, each suggesting a different base rate:

1.  **The Major Questions Doctrine:** This doctrine applies when an executive agency claims a power of "vast economic and political significance" based on ambiguous or old statutory authority. The current Supreme Court has frequently used this doctrine to strike down executive actions. In recent major questions cases (*West Virginia v. EPA*, *NFIB v. OSHA*), the executive branch has consistently lost. This suggests a base rate of **70-80% for the tariffs being ruled unlawful**.
2.  **Foreign Affairs/National Security Deference:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President's actions in foreign affairs and national security. The government's justification for the tariffs rests on this framework. This suggests a base rate of **60-70% for the tariffs being ruled lawful**.

Given the current Court's clear jurisprudential trend emphasizing separation of powers and its skepticism of broad delegations of authority, the **Major Questions Doctrine provides the more relevant reference class**. The unprecedented economic scale of the tariffs and their direct encroachment on Congress's explicit Article I power to tax and regulate commerce make this case a quintessential major question. Therefore, I will establish a prior heavily weighted towards an "unlawful" ruling.

*   **Prior:** P(Unlawful) ≈ 70%, P(Mixed) ≈ 15%, P(Lawful) ≈ 10%, P(Other/No Ruling) ≈ 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case is an even stronger candidate for the Major Questions Doctrine than typical cases for several reasons:

*   **Direct Conflict with Enumerated Power:** The tariffs are a form of taxation, a power explicitly granted to Congress in Article I. This is a more direct conflict than in regulatory cases concerning agency authority.
*   **Unprecedented Scope:** The tariffs apply to nearly all U.S. trade, representing a far greater economic impact than the regulations at issue in prior major questions cases.
*   **Tenuous Justification:** Using a chronic trade deficit as an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to justify emergency powers is a novel and legally weak expansion of IEEPA's intended scope.

These factors suggest that the probability of the Court striking down the tariffs is likely even higher than the 70-80% base rate from the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Several key pieces of evidence from the background scenario allow for updating the prior probabilities:

*   **Evidence 1: Unanimous Lower Court Outcomes:** The Court of International Trade, the D.C. District Court, and a bipartisan majority of the Federal Circuit all concluded the tariffs were unlawful.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This strong consensus among lower courts is highly probable if the government's legal position is weak (P(E | Unlawful) is high). It is very improbable if the government's position is strong (P(E | Lawful) is very low). This evidence strongly reinforces the "Unlawful" hypothesis.

*   **Evidence 2: Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The case involves two distinct sets of tariffs: "trafficking tariffs" (against Mexico, Canada, China) and "reciprocal tariffs" (against most trading partners). The national security justification for the former is more plausible than the economic justification for the latter.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This distinction provides a clear path for a split decision. The probability of this evidence existing is highest if a "Mixed ruling" is the true state of the world (P(E | Mixed) is high). It provides a natural off-ramp for justices seeking a compromise.

*   **Evidence 3: Expedited Supreme Court Review:** The Court granted certiorari on an expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** The probability of the Court taking this action if it intended to not rule in 2025 is extremely low (P(E | No 2025 ruling) is near zero). This evidence effectively eliminates the "No 2025 ruling" option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through the updates conceptually:

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(Unlawful) ≈ 70%, P(Mixed) ≈ 15%, P(Lawful) ≈ 10%.
2.  **Apply Evidence of Expedited Review:** The probability for "No 2025 ruling" drops to near zero (~1%).
3.  **Apply Evidence of Lower Court Consensus:** This significantly weakens the "Lawful" option. The odds of "Lawful" vs. "Not Lawful" were about 1:9. The strong lower court consensus is much more likely if the tariffs are unlawful. This evidence might shift the odds by a factor of 3 or 4 against "Lawful," dropping its probability to the low single digits (e.g., ~3-5%). The probability mass is redistributed primarily to "Unlawful."
4.  **Apply Evidence of Two Tariff Types:** This evidence specifically increases the plausibility of a "Mixed ruling." While the lower courts ruled against all tariffs, the Supreme Court may see a distinction. This pulls some probability mass away from the clean "Unlawful" outcome and towards "Mixed."

After these updates, "Unlawful" remains the most likely outcome, but "Mixed ruling" emerges as the most significant and plausible alternative. "Lawful" becomes a tail risk.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary analysis points to a decisive "Unlawful" ruling. I must challenge this. The strongest counter-argument is that the Court will seek a compromise to avoid a direct political confrontation with the President on a national security-adjacent issue. A "Mixed ruling" is the perfect vehicle for such a compromise. It would allow the Court to rein in the most extreme assertion of power (the reciprocal tariffs) while granting the President some deference on the more traditional security threat (the trafficking tariffs). This would let Chief Justice Roberts, for example, write a narrow opinion that appears institutionally modest. This possibility is significant. I may be underestimating the Court's desire for a compromise outcome over a clean, but more politically charged, sweep. Therefore, I will increase the probability of a "Mixed ruling" from my initial post-update estimate, taking that probability primarily from the "Unlawful" option.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the above reasoning, I will set my final probabilities:

*   **Tariffs unlawful (60%):** This remains the most probable outcome. The legal arguments based on textualism (IEEPA doesn't say "tariffs") and the Major Questions Doctrine are extremely strong and align with the current Court's majority.
*   **Mixed ruling (30%):** This is the most plausible alternative. It allows the Court to split the difference, reining in the President's economic power while granting some deference on national security grounds. This is a classic Roberts-era compromise outcome.
*   **Tariffs lawful (5%):** This is a tail risk. It would require the Court to ignore its recent Major Questions jurisprudence and grant the President sweeping, unenumerated powers, which seems highly unlikely.
*   **Other ruling (4%):** A small but non-zero chance the Court finds a procedural way out, such as dismissing the writ as improvidently granted, to avoid a direct ruling on the merits.
*   **No 2025 ruling (1%):** The expedited schedule makes this extremely unlikely, but unforeseen delays could theoretically push a decision into January 2026.

The sum is 60 + 30 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 100%.

### Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 5%
Tariffs unlawful: 60%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
