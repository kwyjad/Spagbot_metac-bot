### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major U.S. Military Interventions (Post-WWII):** This class includes large-scale ground invasions or sustained air campaigns aimed at regime change or significant military degradation (e.g., Korea 1950, Vietnam 1965, Panama 1989, Gulf War 1991, Afghanistan 2001, Iraq 2003). The U.S. has initiated roughly 6-8 such actions in ~80 years.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~1-2% chance in any given year of a *new* major intervention starting.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class represents the high end of potential action. While the current situation is tense, a full-scale invasion is a rare event due to extreme costs and risks.
2.  **U.S. Limited Military Strikes Against Sovereign States (Post-Cold War):** This class includes punitive or targeted actions short of full-scale invasion, such as airstrikes or special operations raids (e.g., Sudan/Afghanistan 1998, Libya 2011, Syria 2017/2018). These are more common than major interventions.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~5-10% chance in any given year of the U.S. initiating a *new* limited strike campaign against a sovereign state.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class seems more analogous to the current scenario, where the stated justification is targeting specific facilities ("cocaine production") or groups ("drug cartels") within a country, which could serve as a pretext for a limited attack on state-linked targets.
3.  **U.S. Hostile Military Actions in Latin America (Post-WWII):** This class includes overt and covert military actions in the Western Hemisphere (e.g., Guatemala 1954, Cuba 1961, Dominican Republic 1965, Grenada 1983, Panama 1989). Such actions were more frequent during the Cold War.
    *   **Base Rate:** Very low in the 21st century (<1% per year). The last major direct U.S. invasion was Panama in 1989.
    *   **Reasoning:** The "Monroe Doctrine" context is relevant, but direct military intervention has become a tool of last resort in the region due to diplomatic costs and the rise of regional actors.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-25** Report that Trump is considering military action against "cocaine production facilities" and has deployed a carrier strike group. — ↑ (Large) — Moves from general pressure to specific targeting considerations and major asset deployment, a key prerequisite for an attack.
*   **2025-10-23** International Crisis Group warns that a counter-narcotics operation appears to be morphing into a regime-change effort. — ↑ (Small) — Reflects that expert observers perceive the situation as escalating beyond its official justification, increasing the perceived likelihood of a broader conflict.
*   **2025-10-10** Trump administration ends diplomatic outreach to Venezuela and notifies Congress of being in an "armed conflict" with a Venezuelan cartel. — ↑ (Large) — Ending diplomacy closes off-ramps for de-escalation. The "armed conflict" notification provides a potential legal framework for military action without further authorization.
*   **2025-09-30** CRS report notes Congress may consider actions to shape U.S. policy, including military operations. — ↑ (Small) — Indicates that military action is being discussed as a plausible policy option within the U.S. government apparatus.
*   **2025-09-06** Trump denies seeking regime change but links Maduro to cartels; U.S. has already taken military action against a purported cartel boat. — ↑ (Moderate) — Establishes a pattern of action (a strike has already occurred) and reinforces the *casus belli* (counter-narcotics) that could be used to justify strikes on Venezuelan territory.
*   **2025-09-03** Former Biden official warns the U.S. could "stumble into" a disastrous intervention, suggesting a pretext for regime change. — ↑ (Small) — Highlights that the escalatory path is clear and recognized by experienced policymakers, even if the ultimate intention is debated.
*   **2025-08-29** Maduro mobilizes militia in response to U.S. warship deployment, declaring an invasion is impossible. — ↔ (Neutral) — A predictable defensive reaction. While it shows Venezuela is taking the threat seriously, it doesn't independently change the probability of a U.S. first strike.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Counter-Narcotics as a *Casus Belli***: Framing the conflict as a fight against drug cartels, rather than the Venezuelan state, provides a powerful domestic and international justification. It lowers the political and legal threshold for a limited strike compared to a declared war for regime change. (Large impact)
2.  **President Trump's Decision-Making Style:** Known for a preference for decisive action, a low tolerance for perceived weakness, and a history of floating the "military option" for Venezuela. Personal frustration with Maduro's resilience could trigger an attack. (Large impact)
3.  **Failure of Other Policy Tools:** The collapse of the Guaidó-led opposition strategy and the ineffectiveness of sanctions alone create a policy vacuum. For an administration seeking a "win," military action may appear to be the only remaining option to force change. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Domestic Political Calculus:** With a short timeline to 2026, a successful, limited military operation could be seen as a way to demonstrate strength, distract from domestic issues, and rally a political base around a "tough on crime/drugs" foreign policy. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Risk of Quagmire and International Backlash:** Venezuela is not Grenada or Panama. Its military is larger and the terrain is difficult. The risk of a prolonged conflict, U.S. casualties, a refugee crisis, and widespread condemnation from Latin American partners serves as a powerful deterrent. (Large impact, opposing an attack)
6.  **Lack of a Viable "Day After" Plan:** The failure of the Guaidó project underscores the absence of a clear, unified, and credible alternative government to install. This increases the risk that a military strike would lead to chaos rather than a stable, pro-U.S. outcome. (Moderate impact, opposing an attack)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Specific and Public Pretext:** Unlike many past interventions where justifications were developed late or were less specific (e.g., "restoring democracy"), the counter-narcotics angle has been methodically built over months, creating a clear, albeit possibly contrived, pathway to conflict.
*   **Absence of a Recognized Alternative Government:** In past situations (e.g., Panama, Afghanistan, recognizing Guaidó previously), the U.S. had a government-in-waiting to legitimize its actions. The 2023 collapse of the Guaidó-led "interim government" means the U.S. would be acting without a clear Venezuelan partner, increasing the appearance of unilateral aggression.
*   **A Known-Quantity U.S. President:** The primary actor, Donald Trump, has a well-documented history of considering military action against Venezuela. This is not a hypothetical preference but a revisited policy option, making threats more credible than they might be from a different leader.
*   **Explicit Rejection of Diplomacy:** The formal cessation of diplomatic outreach is a significant and unusual step that removes the primary mechanism for de-escalation, distinguishing this from many past crises where back-channels remained open even amid public threats.
*   **Modern Geopolitical Context:** Unlike the Cold War, there is no major state sponsor (like the USSR for Cuba) to deter U.S. action. However, unlike the 1990s/2000s, there is greater regional opposition to U.S. unilateralism in Latin America.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior based on the reference class of limited military strikes (~5-10% for a full year). Given the <2 month horizon, this translates to a baseline prior of **~1-2%**. The strength is low (n≈10-20) as each historical case is highly idiosyncratic.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Deployment of a carrier strike group and authorization of CIA covert operations. These are costly signals and material preparations for an attack.
    *   ↑ (Large): Formal cessation of diplomacy and notification to Congress of an "armed conflict." This removes off-ramps and establishes a legal/political foundation for action.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Consistent messaging framing the conflict around counter-narcotics while linking Maduro directly. This creates a specific and politically palatable *casus belli*.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): A strike has already occurred against a "cartel boat," setting a precedent for the use of lethal force in the theater of operations.
    *   ↓ (Small): Maduro's mobilization of militia. This slightly increases the potential cost to the U.S. but is an expected reaction and unlikely to be a primary deterrent.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly escalatory and points toward a serious consideration of military action. The prior should be revised **sharply upward**. The recent developments move the probability from the realm of remote possibility into one of plausible, active planning.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Evacuation of non-essential U.S. embassy personnel from Caracas or neighboring countries.
    *   Specific, named U.S. ultimatums delivered to the Maduro government (e.g., "surrender cartel leaders within 48 hours").
    *   Movement of special operations forces, bombers, or additional naval assets into the region.
    *   A significant increase in anti-Maduro/pro-intervention rhetoric from President Trump, framing it as imminent and necessary.
    *   A staged or real attack on U.S. assets that is blamed on a Venezuelan-backed cartel, providing a final trigger.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of talks mediated by a third party (e.g., Norway, Mexico, Brazil).
    *   Visible withdrawal of the carrier strike group or other key naval assets from the immediate vicinity of Venezuela.
    *   A significant domestic U.S. political event or another international crisis that diverts the administration's attention.
    *   Leaked reports of dissent from senior Pentagon officials about the viability or wisdom of an attack.
    *   Maduro makes a concession, such as releasing American prisoners or agreeing to new talks with the opposition.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria ("military attack against Venezuela's territory or military forces") is broad. A single drone strike on an empty building claimed to be a "cartel HQ" would resolve this "Yes," and is far more likely than a full invasion.
*   **Deception and Misdirection:** The counter-narcotics justification could be a complete fabrication to mask regime-change intentions, or it could be a genuine, more limited goal. Similarly, the military buildup could be an elaborate bluff to extract concessions from Maduro.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** With less than two months to resolution, events can move extremely quickly. The forecast is highly sensitive to near-term triggers and decisions made by a small number of individuals.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most critical information—President Trump's private intentions and the true state of U.S. military planning—is inaccessible. Public signals may not reflect private reality.
*   **Accidental Escalation:** The high concentration of military forces in a tense environment creates a risk of an accidental clash (e.g., a U.S. ship firing on a Venezuelan patrol boat that gets too close) that could trigger a wider conflict, irrespective of initial intent.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a U.S. attack on a sovereign nation is low, but the current scenario is an acute exception. A methodical escalation, the establishment of a specific *casus belli*, and the shutdown of diplomatic channels have created a credible and short-term path to a limited U.S. military strike.

To forecast the probability of the United States attacking Venezuela before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** We start with the base rate for U.S. limited military strikes against sovereign states, which is approximately 5-10% per year. Given the short time frame of less than two months, this translates to a baseline prior of about 1-2%.
   - **Reasoning:** This base rate is chosen because the current situation involves potential limited military action rather than a full-scale invasion. The historical frequency of such actions provides a reasonable starting point.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a tense geopolitical environment with the U.S. deploying military assets and considering military action, similar to past instances where limited strikes occurred.
   - **Differences:** The explicit framing of the conflict as counter-narcotics, the cessation of diplomatic channels, and the specific deployment of a carrier strike group are more escalatory than typical pre-strike conditions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Deployment of Carrier Strike Group:** This is a significant military preparation, increasing the likelihood of an attack. Likelihood ratio is high.
   - **Cessation of Diplomacy:** This removes de-escalation options, increasing the probability of conflict. Likelihood ratio is moderate to high.
   - **Framing as Counter-Narcotics:** Provides a politically palatable justification, increasing the likelihood of action. Likelihood ratio is moderate.
   - **Previous Strike on Cartel Boat:** Establishes a precedent for military action, increasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio is moderate.
   - **Maduro's Mobilization:** While a defensive measure, it slightly increases the potential cost to the U.S., but is expected and unlikely to deter action. Likelihood ratio is low.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 1-2% translates to odds of approximately 1:99 to 2:98.
   - **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of increased probability, with several large and moderate likelihood ratios.
   - **Posterior Odds Calculation:** Given the strong evidence, we adjust the odds significantly upward. For example, if we assume a combined likelihood ratio of 5 (a conservative estimate given the evidence), the posterior odds become approximately 5:99 to 10:98.
   - **Posterior Probability:** This translates to a posterior probability of approximately 5-10%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of misinterpretation of signals or overestimation of the likelihood of action. The risk of accidental escalation should be considered.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A diplomatic breakthrough or a significant diversion of U.S. attention could lower the probability.
   - **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment might be prudent to account for uncertainties and potential de-escalation.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential counterarguments, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect a balanced view of the situation.

Final: 7%

# Will the United States attack Venezuela before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the U.S. launching a military attack against Venezuela in the next ~2 months (from November 5, 2025 to January 1, 2026).

The most appropriate reference class is **U.S. Limited Military Strikes Against Sovereign States (Post-Cold War)**, which has a base rate of approximately 5-10% chance in any given year. Given we're looking at a ~2-month window, this translates to roughly a 1-2% prior probability.

However, this situation has several unique characteristics that suggest adjusting this base rate:
- The U.S. has already deployed a carrier strike group to the region
- The administration has formally notified Congress of being in an "armed conflict" with a Venezuelan cartel
- Diplomatic channels have been officially closed
- A strike has already occurred against a "cartel boat"

These factors indicate we're already in an unusually advanced stage of pre-conflict escalation. Therefore, I'll adjust my prior upward to **8%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The U.S. is framing potential action around a specific justification (counter-narcotics) similar to past limited interventions
- There's a pattern of escalating rhetoric and military positioning before action
- The target is a Latin American country with a government the U.S. considers illegitimate

**Key differences:**
- The explicit cessation of diplomatic outreach is unusual and removes de-escalation pathways
- The U.S. has already taken military action against a "cartel boat" in the region
- President Trump previously considered military action against Venezuela during his first term
- The counter-narcotics framing provides a more politically palatable justification than regime change
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than 2 months to resolution)
- There is no recognized alternative government to legitimize intervention (unlike previous Guaidó recognition)

These differences, particularly the formal end to diplomacy and the existing military action, significantly increase the likelihood above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Deployment of carrier strike group and warships**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Almost any attack would be preceded by such deployments
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.15) - Deploying major naval assets is costly and typically indicates serious intent
- Likelihood ratio: ~6.3
- This strongly increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 2: Formal notification to Congress of "armed conflict" with Venezuelan cartel**
- P(E|H): High (~0.85) - This establishes legal groundwork for military action
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.05) - Such formal notifications are rare without follow-through
- Likelihood ratio: ~17
- This very strongly increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 3: End of diplomatic outreach**
- P(E|H): High (~0.80) - Cutting diplomatic channels typically precedes hostile action
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.20) - Diplomacy is rarely abandoned completely without alternative plans
- Likelihood ratio: ~4
- This significantly increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 4: Previous military action against "cartel boat"**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.60) - Initial limited strikes often precede larger operations
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.30) - Could be a one-off action to demonstrate resolve
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability of an attack

**Evidence 5: Maduro's militia mobilization**
- P(E|H): High (~0.70) - Expected defensive reaction to credible threat
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.50) - Could occur even with just perceived threats
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This slightly increases the probability of an attack

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 8% (odds of 1:11.5), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 2 (Congressional notification):**
- Prior odds: 0.08/(1-0.08) = 0.087
- Likelihood ratio: 17
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 17 = 1.479
- Posterior probability: 1.479/(1+1.479) = 0.596 or ~60%

**Update on Evidence 1 (carrier strike group):**
- Prior odds: 0.596/(1-0.596) = 1.475
- Likelihood ratio: 6.3
- Posterior odds: 1.475 × 6.3 = 9.29
- Posterior probability: 9.29/(1+9.29) = 0.903 or ~90%

This seems too high given the uncertainties involved. Let me adjust by considering countervailing factors:

**Countervailing factor: Risk of quagmire and international backlash**
- Venezuela's military is larger than those of Grenada or Panama
- A prolonged conflict would be politically costly
- Regional partners would likely condemn unilateral action
- Estimated impact: Reduces probability by ~25 percentage points

**Countervailing factor: Lack of "Day After" plan**
- No clear alternative government to install
- Risk of creating a power vacuum or civil war
- Estimated impact: Reduces probability by ~15 percentage points

After these adjustments, the posterior probability is approximately 50%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent escalatory signals and underweighting the historical rarity of direct U.S. military action in South America
- The resolution criteria includes any military attack, even a very limited one, which makes the threshold lower than a full invasion
- The counter-narcotics framing could be primarily for domestic consumption rather than indicating imminent action
- The deployment could be primarily intended as pressure to extract concessions

**Alternative forecast:**
A more conservative forecast might place the probability at 20-30%, arguing that:
- Military deployments are often used as coercive diplomacy without actual attacks
- The costs of even limited military action against Venezuela would be substantial
- The administration may be satisfied with the political benefits of appearing tough without actual conflict
- There's insufficient time before January 2026 to plan and execute even limited operations

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The formal end of diplomacy removes the mechanism for coercive diplomacy to succeed
- The counter-narcotics framing provides a limited, achievable objective that doesn't require regime change
- The administration has already demonstrated willingness to use force in the region
- Limited strikes require minimal planning time compared to full invasions

After considering these perspectives, I believe my estimate of 50% is reasonable but should be adjusted slightly downward to account for the historical rarity of such actions and the substantial costs involved.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the base rate, the unique circumstances of this situation, and potential blind spots, I assess there is a 45% probability that the United States will attack Venezuela before January 1, 2026.

Final: 45%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The event in question is a "military attack against Venezuela's territory or military forces." This definition is broad, covering everything from a single drone strike to a full-scale invasion. The most appropriate reference class is not major invasions, but rather limited military strikes.

*   **Reference Class:** U.S. limited military strikes against sovereign states (post-Cold War). This class includes actions like punitive airstrikes or special operations raids (e.g., Sudan 1998, Libya 2011, Syria 2017/2018). Historically, the U.S. initiates a new conflict of this type at a rate of roughly 5-10% per year.
*   **Reasoning:** This class fits the likely scale of action being contemplated—something short of a full ground invasion but more than covert support. The stated pretext of targeting "cocaine production facilities" aligns well with past justifications for limited strikes.
*   **Initial Prior:** The question's timeframe is very short (less than two months, from November 5, 2025, to January 1, 2026). An annual base rate of 5-10% for an attack on *any* country translates to a much lower probability for an attack on Venezuela specifically within a two-month window. A starting prior of **2%** seems appropriate. This acknowledges that such events are rare, even for a known flashpoint like Venezuela. In odds form, this is 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past limited strikes where the U.S. developed a specific pretext (counter-narcotics here, vs. counter-terrorism or WMDs elsewhere) to justify action against a hostile, but militarily weaker, regime.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Geographic Proximity:** A direct U.S. attack in Latin America is much rarer in the 21st century than one in the Middle East, carrying higher diplomatic risks with regional partners.
    *   **Deliberate Escalation:** Unlike some past strikes that were reactive, the current situation has been built methodically over months with a clear, public justification and the systematic closing of off-ramps.
    *   **Presidential Factor:** The decision-maker is Donald Trump, who has a documented history of considering this specific military option, making the threats more credible than they might be from another leader.
    *   **Lack of a Viable Alternative:** The collapse of the Juan Guaidó-led opposition means the U.S. lacks a clear "government-in-waiting" to legitimize its actions, increasing the appearance of unilateral aggression.

The key difference is the highly deliberate and public nature of the escalation, which makes the current situation more acute than the general base rate would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that the U.S. attacks Venezuela before 2026, and ~H be the hypothesis that it does not.

*   **Evidence 1 (Strongly Increases Probability): Formal cessation of diplomacy and notification to Congress of an "armed conflict" with a Venezuelan cartel.**
    *   P(E | H): Very high. These are standard procedural and legal steps taken to prepare for military action.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very low. Taking these formal steps, which are difficult to reverse, is an extremely costly and risky signal if the intent is merely a bluff.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very high (>> 1). This evidence provides a legal framework and removes the primary means of de-escalation.

*   **Evidence 2 (Strongly Increases Probability): Deployment of a carrier strike group and reports of planning strikes on "cocaine production facilities."**
    *   P(E | H): Very high. An attack would require these military assets to be in place.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. Naval deployments can be used for coercive diplomacy or as a bluff, but they are a costly signal and a necessary prerequisite for an attack.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** High (> 1). This moves the threat from rhetorical to operational.

*   **Evidence 3 (Moderately Increases Probability): A prior U.S. military strike on a purported "cartel boat."**
    *   P(E | H): High. A small, initial strike sets a precedent, tests adversary reactions, and normalizes the use of force in the theater.
    *   P(E | ~H): Low. While a one-off interdiction is possible, in this context, it is more likely part of a planned escalatory campaign.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate to High (> 1). This shows the U.S. has already crossed the threshold of using lethal force in this specific confrontation.

*   **Countervailing Factors (Deterrents): Risk of quagmire, international backlash, and lack of a "day after" plan.**
    *   These are not new evidence but standing conditions. They are the primary reasons the base rate is low. The recent escalatory evidence must be strong enough to overcome these powerful deterrents. The fact that the definition of "attack" can be met with a limited, low-casualty strike (e.g., with cruise missiles) mitigates these deterrents somewhat compared to a full-scale invasion.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

We start with a prior of 2% (1:49 odds). The evidence is a highly correlated cluster of actions (military, legal, diplomatic) that strongly suggests preparation for an attack. Let's treat this cluster as a single piece of evidence, "E".

*   **Likelihood Ratio Estimation:** How much more likely is this cluster of evidence if an attack is imminent versus if it's all a bluff? The legal notification to Congress and the cessation of diplomacy are particularly strong signals. A bluff of this magnitude is possible but unlikely. A combined likelihood ratio of 30 seems reasonable, implying this evidence is 30 times more likely given an impending attack than not.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Prior Odds = 1 / 49
    *   Likelihood Ratio = 30
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1 / 49) × 30 ≈ 0.61
    *   Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 0.61 / (1 + 0.61) ≈ 0.378

The evidence dramatically increases the probability from a remote 2% chance into a highly plausible scenario, landing around 38%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative View:** The most plausible alternative is that this is a "maximum pressure" campaign designed to be the ultimate bluff. The goal might be to frighten Maduro into a major concession or to create a crisis for domestic political gain, with no actual intent to launch an attack that could become a costly quagmire. Trump has a history of threatening "fire and fury" but ultimately avoiding new, large-scale wars.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, this interpretation struggles to explain the formal steps like ending diplomacy and notifying Congress. These actions close off future options and create significant political costs if the administration backs down. They are more indicative of genuine preparation than mere rhetoric.
*   **Tail Risks:** The primary tail risk is accidental escalation. With warships in close proximity and high tensions, a miscalculation by a local commander could trigger a conflict even if one was not formally ordered. This risk slightly increases the overall probability of an attack occurring.
*   **Adjustment:** The red team analysis confirms that a non-attack outcome is very plausible. The 38% forecast already reflects this, indicating that a non-attack is still the more likely outcome (62%), but the risk of an attack is acute and far higher than the baseline. No major adjustment is needed.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for a U.S. military strike is low. However, the specific evidence in this case—the deployment of major military assets, the creation of a legal and political pretext, the cessation of diplomacy, and a precedent-setting initial use of force—is exceptionally strong. These actions have moved the situation from a chronic standoff to an acute crisis where an attack is a distinct possibility in the short term. While powerful deterrents remain, the methodical nature of the escalation suggests a high level of intent.

Final: 38%
