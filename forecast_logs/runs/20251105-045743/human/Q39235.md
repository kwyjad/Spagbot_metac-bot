### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2018-present):** This is the most relevant class. Since the approval and widespread availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, the dynamics of Ebola outbreaks have fundamentally changed. This class includes 6 outbreaks in the DRC. The distribution is extremely skewed:
    *   **Outcomes:** 5 of the 6 outbreaks resulted in fewer than 15 deaths each. The 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak is a massive outlier with 2,280 deaths.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths is very low (likely <10). The mean is heavily skewed by the Kivu outlier to ~380 deaths. A forecaster should consider this a bimodal distribution: a very high probability of a small, contained outbreak (<50 deaths) and a small but non-zero probability of a catastrophic failure of containment (>1000 deaths).
2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-present):** This class includes all 16 outbreaks in the DRC. It provides a longer-term perspective but is less relevant due to major advances in treatment, vaccination, and response coordination.
    *   **Outcomes:** Similar to the modern era, most outbreaks were small. Prior to 2018, the largest outbreak in the DRC was in 1976 with 280 deaths. The median is low (likely <50 deaths), and the mean is pulled higher by a few larger events.
    *   **Limitation:** This class underweights the game-changing impact of the highly effective vaccine and established response protocols, making it a less reliable guide for the current situation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The resolution horizon is <3 months, so the entire outbreak timeline is relevant.
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province. Initial report of 28 suspected cases and 15 deaths. (↓) — Matters because early declaration enables a faster response, but the initial case count is non-trivial.
*   **2025-09-07** Update provided in background: 32 cases and 15 deaths. (↔) — Matters as it shows slow initial growth, not explosive expansion.
*   **2025-10-12** WHO report: Cumulative total of 64 cases (53 confirmed) and 45 deaths. (↓ Large) — Matters because it reports **16 days with no new confirmed cases**, a very strong signal that containment efforts are succeeding.
*   **2025-10-17** CDC report: Confirms the total of 64 cases and 45 deaths as of Oct 15. (↓ Large) — Matters as it corroborates the WHO data and the halt in new cases, increasing confidence that the outbreak has peaked.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Vaccination Strategy (Ring Vaccination):** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective. The "ring" strategy (vaccinating contacts and contacts-of-contacts of confirmed cases) is proven to halt transmission chains. The speed and completeness of its implementation is the single largest driver of containment. (Size: Large)
2.  **Response Coordination & Speed:** The effectiveness of surveillance, contact tracing, case isolation, and safe burials. The DRC Ministry of Health, WHO, and Africa CDC now have extensive experience. A rapid, coordinated response suffocates an outbreak early. (Size: Large)
3.  **Geographic Location:** The current outbreak is in the relatively remote Kasaï Province. This is a double-edged sword: it can naturally limit widespread transmission (compared to a transport hub like Goma in the Kivu outbreak), but it also creates logistical hurdles for response teams and supplies. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Community Trust and Security:** The Kivu outbreak was massively exacerbated by active military conflict and deep community mistrust, leading to attacks on healthcare workers. The security situation in Kasaï is a key variable; less conflict than in Kivu (2018-2020) enables a much more effective response. (Size: Large)
5.  **Virus Strain:** This outbreak is caused by the *Zaire ebolavirus* strain, for which the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is designed and proven effective. An outbreak of a different strain (e.g., *Sudan ebolavirus*, as in Uganda 2022) would be far more dangerous as vaccine effectiveness would be uncertain or non-existent. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Favorable: No Active, Large-Scale Conflict:** Unlike the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak, which occurred in a war zone with dozens of armed groups, the Kasaï region is not currently experiencing a similar level of intense, organized violence. This is the most significant difference from the reference class outlier.
*   **Favorable: Experienced Response Apparatus:** The global and national health communities have a well-oiled "playbook" for Ebola response post-Kivu, including stockpiled vaccines and trained personnel. The response to this outbreak appears to have been rapid and effective.
*   **Mixed: Remote Location:** While most DRC outbreaks occur in remote areas, Kasaï's specific logistical challenges (as noted by the CDC) could hamper response. However, its relative isolation from major international borders and transit hubs is a strong protective factor against regional spread, a key feature of the Kivu and West African outbreaks.
*   **Unfavorable: High Initial Case Fatality Ratio (CFR):** The reported CFR of ~70% (45 deaths / 64 cases) is high. This could suggest that surveillance is missing less severe cases or that patients are presenting late for treatment, indicating potential gaps in community engagement or access to care.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the post-vaccine DRC reference class would be appropriate: a distribution heavily concentrated below 50 deaths but with a long tail to account for catastrophic failure (e.g., a Gamma or Lognormal distribution). The strength should be low (equivalent n≈5-6) reflecting the small number of relevant past outbreaks.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The fact that **no new cases have been reported since late September** (as of mid-October reports) is overwhelming evidence that the transmission chain has been broken.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The outbreak is **not in a major conflict zone** like North Kivu, which was the primary driver of the 2018-2020 catastrophe.
    *   (↓ Small) The **remote location** likely acted as a natural brake on transmission to major population centers.
    *   (↑ Small) The **high initial CFR** is a negative signal about the quality of surveillance/care but is dwarfed by the positive signal of no new transmission.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly supports the "successful containment" scenario. The posterior distribution should be shifted dramatically downward, with its mass tightly concentrated just above the currently reported 45 deaths. The probability assigned to the long tail (>100 deaths) should be reduced to near zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new confirmed case, especially if the transmission link is unknown.
    *   New cases appearing in a different health zone or province.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or active community resistance to response measures.
    *   Detection of the outbreak spreading across an international border.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official announcement from WHO/DRC MoH that the 42-day countdown to declaring the outbreak over has begun.
    *   Continued reporting of zero new cases through November 2025.
    *   Successful completion of follow-up for all known contacts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag/Gaps:** Information from remote Kasaï may be incomplete or slow to emerge. The official death toll could be revised upwards as more information becomes available, even without new infections.
*   **Definitional Risk:** The resolution criteria are tied to the DRC Ministry of Health's official count for *this* outbreak. Deaths could be misattributed, or political factors could influence reporting, though this is unlikely to have a large effect.
*   **Hidden Transmission:** There is a small but non-zero risk of a hidden chain of transmission smoldering in a hard-to-reach area, which could reignite the outbreak.
*   **Short Horizon:** The resolution date is Jan 1, 2026. This is very soon. Given an Ebola incubation period of up to 21 days, a major resurgence that would significantly alter the death toll before this date is extremely unlikely, but a small cluster of new cases is possible.

**Final Research Summary:** The outbreak appears to be over. Strong evidence from mid-October shows transmission was halted, and the final death toll is highly unlikely to be much greater than the 45 deaths reported at that time.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province, DRC, before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2018-present). This class includes 6 outbreaks, with 5 resulting in fewer than 15 deaths each, and one outlier (Kivu outbreak) with 2,280 deaths.
- **Distribution:** The distribution is bimodal, with a high probability of small outbreaks (<50 deaths) and a small probability of catastrophic failure (>1000 deaths). The median is likely <10 deaths, and the mean is skewed by the Kivu outlier to ~380 deaths.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current outbreak is similar to past small outbreaks in the post-vaccine era, with effective containment measures in place.
- **Difference:** The Kasaï outbreak is not in a conflict zone, unlike the Kivu outbreak, which significantly reduces the risk of a large-scale outbreak.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **No New Cases:** The WHO and CDC reports indicate no new cases since late September, suggesting containment (↓ Large).
- **Remote Location:** Kasaï's remoteness limits transmission but poses logistical challenges (↓ Small).
- **High Initial CFR:** A high CFR suggests potential surveillance gaps but is outweighed by containment evidence (↑ Small).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** A distribution concentrated below 50 deaths with a long tail for catastrophic scenarios.
- **Evidence:** Strong evidence of containment shifts the distribution downward, concentrating mass just above the current 45 deaths.
- **Posterior:** The probability of exceeding 100 deaths is near zero, with most mass around 45-50 deaths.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the risk of hidden transmission or data lags, but the short resolution horizon limits these risks.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A hidden transmission chain could increase deaths, but the likelihood is low given current evidence.
- **Adjustment:** Maintain a conservative estimate with a slight allowance for data revisions.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 45  
P40: 46  
P60: 47  
P80: 48

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2018-present) as my primary reference class, as this best reflects current response capabilities and vaccination availability.

This reference class includes 6 outbreaks in the DRC since 2018:
- 5 small outbreaks with fewer than 15 deaths each
- The 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak with 2,280 deaths (major outlier)

The distribution is bimodal:
- Median: ~10 deaths (for contained outbreaks)
- Mean: ~380 deaths (heavily skewed by the Kivu outlier)
- Prior distribution shape: Primarily concentrated below 50 deaths, with a small probability mass extending to >1,000 deaths to account for catastrophic containment failure

I select this base rate because it incorporates the game-changing impact of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine while acknowledging that some outbreaks can still become catastrophic under specific conditions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure challenges
- Same virus strain (Zaire ebolavirus) responsive to the available vaccine
- Similar initial response mechanisms (ring vaccination, contact tracing)

**Key differences:**
- **Favorable**: Unlike the Kivu outbreak (our outlier), Kasaï is not experiencing active large-scale armed conflict that would severely hamper response efforts
- **Favorable**: Response apparatus is now more experienced and better coordinated than in earlier outbreaks
- **Favorable**: The outbreak was detected and declared relatively quickly
- **Mixed**: Remote location limits spread but creates logistical challenges
- **Unfavorable**: The initial case fatality ratio (~70%) is high, suggesting potential surveillance gaps

These differences, particularly the absence of armed conflict, significantly reduce the probability of a Kivu-like catastrophic scenario.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Key evidence from the research report:**
1. **No new confirmed cases for 16+ days (as of Oct 12)** - This is extremely strong evidence for successful containment. In Ebola epidemiology, this represents nearly a full incubation cycle without transmission, suggesting the outbreak has been effectively halted. Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors lower death toll (10:1 or greater)

2. **Current death toll of 45 (as of Oct 17)** - This provides a firm lower bound. Given the high CFR, this suggests most cases have been identified. Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors death toll remaining close to current level (3:1)

3. **Absence of conflict in Kasaï** - The Kivu outbreak became catastrophic primarily due to armed conflict preventing response. This factor strongly reduces the probability of the long-tail scenario. Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors lower death toll (5:1)

4. **Short time horizon (less than 2 months until resolution)** - Given Ebola's incubation period (up to 21 days) and the current status (no new cases for 16+ days), there is limited time for significant new transmission chains to develop. Likelihood ratio: Very strongly favors death toll remaining close to current level (20:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my bimodal prior:
- ~80% probability mass below 100 deaths
- ~20% probability mass in the long tail (>100 deaths, with some extending to >1,000)

After updating on the evidence:
1. The 16+ days without new cases dramatically reduces the probability of the long-tail scenario. This shifts ~15% of the probability mass from the long tail to the region just above the current death toll.

2. The short time horizon until resolution further compresses the distribution, as there's simply not enough time for a major resurgence to develop and cause many additional deaths before January 1, 2026.

3. The absence of conflict in Kasaï eliminates the primary mechanism that drove the Kivu outbreak to catastrophic levels, further reducing the long-tail probability.

Posterior distribution:
- ~95% probability mass concentrated between 45-60 deaths
- ~4% probability mass between 60-100 deaths
- ~1% probability mass above 100 deaths (catastrophic containment failure)

The posterior mean shifts from ~380 to ~50-55, and the variance decreases dramatically.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Data lag/reporting issues** - Information from remote Kasaï may be delayed or incomplete. The actual death toll could be higher than currently reported.

2. **Hidden transmission chains** - There could be undetected cases in remote areas that haven't been captured by surveillance.

3. **Overconfidence in containment** - The "no new cases" report could be premature or reflect incomplete surveillance rather than true containment.

4. **Definitional ambiguity** - Deaths indirectly related to the outbreak might be counted differently by different authorities.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic forecaster might argue that the high CFR suggests poor surveillance, and that cases are being missed. They might place more weight on the possibility of hidden transmission chains that could resurge.

However, this is countered by:
- Multiple independent sources (WHO, CDC) confirming the case/death counts
- The significant time without new cases (16+ days as of mid-October)
- The extremely short time horizon until resolution (less than 2 months)

After considering these factors, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for potential reporting delays and hidden cases, but maintain the overall shape heavily concentrated near the current death toll.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the set of Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since the introduction of the effective rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine around 2018. This reference class includes 6 outbreaks. The distribution is extremely skewed: 5 of the 6 outbreaks resulted in fewer than 15 deaths, while the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak caused 2,280 deaths. This establishes a prior distribution that is heavily concentrated on a low number of deaths (median < 15) but has a very long tail to account for the small but non-zero probability of a catastrophic containment failure, leading to a high mean (~380).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current outbreak is in the DRC and is caused by the *Zaire ebolavirus* strain, meaning the existing vaccine and treatment protocols are effective. The response involves experienced national and international health organizations.

**Differences:**
*   **Favorable:** The most significant difference is the security situation. The catastrophic Kivu outbreak (the outlier in the reference class) occurred in an active war zone, which severely hampered response efforts. The current outbreak in Kasaï Province is not facing a similar level of intense, organized conflict, which is a major factor favoring successful containment.
*   **Favorable:** The response appears to have been rapid and effective, benefiting from the "playbook" developed during previous outbreaks.
*   **Mixed:** The remote location of Kasaï Province can be a double-edged sword. It creates logistical challenges for the response but also acts as a natural barrier to the rapid, widespread transmission seen in outbreaks near major transport hubs (like Goma in the Kivu epidemic). On balance, this likely favors containment.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains overwhelmingly strong evidence that the outbreak has been contained.
*   **Dominant Evidence (pushes forecast strongly down):** The WHO and CDC reports from mid-October 2025 state that there had been **16 consecutive days with no new confirmed cases**. The cumulative total stood at 64 cases and 45 deaths. The likelihood of observing such a long period with no new transmission is extremely high if the outbreak is effectively over, and extremely low if it were still growing. This evidence justifies a massive downward update from the prior's mean.
*   **Supporting Evidence (pushes forecast down):** The lack of a major military conflict in the outbreak zone makes the Kivu outlier scenario highly improbable. This evidence effectively prunes the long, catastrophic tail of the prior distribution.
*   **Timeline (pushes forecast down):** The forecast resolves on January 1, 2026, less than two months from the current date (Nov 5, 2025). An Ebola outbreak is declared over after 42 days (two incubation periods) with no new cases. Given the 16-day streak of no new cases by mid-October, it is highly probable the outbreak will be officially declared over before the resolution date, leaving little to no time for a significant resurgence.
*   **Minor Counter-Evidence (pushes forecast slightly up):** The high initial case fatality rate (~70%) could suggest some missed cases. However, this is a weak signal compared to the direct evidence of halted transmission.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution with a median under 15 but a fat tail allowing for a >2000 outcome.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence (no new cases for 16+ days) is vastly more consistent with a final death toll very near the current count of 45 than with a toll in the hundreds or thousands.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution is a dramatic update from the prior. The probability mass in the long tail is reduced to virtually zero. The distribution becomes tightly concentrated around the last reported number of deaths, 45. The primary remaining uncertainty is not about future infections, but about potential minor retrospective data adjustments (e.g., confirming deaths among previously "suspected" cases). The posterior distribution is therefore a point mass at 45 with a small, right-skewed tail.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is highly confident and places the final number in a very narrow range. Could I be wrong?
*   **Main Risk:** A hidden chain of transmission could be smoldering in a remote, inaccessible community. This could lead to a new cluster of cases. However, with the resolution date less than two months away, such a cluster would have to emerge and spread very quickly to significantly alter the death toll. This seems unlikely.
*   **Data Reconciliation:** The final official number could be revised upwards as deaths among the 11 initial "suspected" cases are confirmed. If all of these cases had a 70% fatality rate, this could add up to 8 deaths, bringing the total to 53. This is the most plausible source of upside risk.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered around 100+ deaths would have to assume the WHO/CDC reports are fundamentally wrong and that a significant, unreported outbreak is ongoing. This contradicts the best available evidence. My forecast correctly discards the prior's high-end possibilities based on the strong new information. The main adjustment is to ensure the upper percentiles plausibly account for data reconciliation, which I have done.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The distribution is anchored at the last reported figure of 45 deaths. The uncertainty is almost entirely to the upside, driven by potential late confirmations of deaths among existing suspected cases, rather than new infections. The short time until resolution strongly caps any potential for a large increase.
