### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Current World Record (WR) & Recent Record Progression:** The current 3x3x3 average WR is 3.89 seconds, set by Yiheng Wang in June 2024. This serves as a hard lower bound for a new record. The progression of records shows diminishing returns. The drop from 4.48s (Tymon Kolasiński, 2023) to 3.89s was an unusually large 13% leap. Prior improvements were smaller (e.g., 4.86s -> 4.48s). A base rate of improvement is now likely <0.1-0.2 seconds per year.
2.  **Top-Tier Competition Results (Last 24 Months):** The top 10 performers globally have official averages ranging from the WR of 3.89s to approximately 4.70s. The median of the top 10 is around 4.50s. This class suggests that a "winning time" at a major competition, or the best time in a given month, is typically in the 4.20-4.60s range, with the sub-4.00s times being exceptional outliers.
3.  **Performances by Top 3 Contenders:** The three individuals most likely to set the fastest time (Yiheng Wang, Tymon Kolasiński, Max Park) consistently average sub-5.00s. Their personal bests and recent results provide a tight reference class. Yiheng Wang has multiple sub-4.50s averages, while Kolasiński and Park are close behind. This suggests the fastest time in any given month will likely come from this small group and fall within their competitive range, which is approximately 4.00s to 4.80s.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-06** Rubik's WCA World Championship 2025 concludes. Max Park wins with a 4.55s average, demonstrating strong performance but not threatening the WR. (↓) — The WR was not broken at the year's most significant event, suggesting its difficulty.
*   **2025-08-20** Yiheng Wang achieves a 3.05s single solve in a minor competition, just shy of the 3.01s WR. (↑) — Indicates the current average WR holder is in peak form for individual solves, a prerequisite for a record average.
*   **2025-09-15** GAN Cube releases the "GAN 16," a new flagship model with an AI-assisted tensioning system. (↑) — Incremental hardware improvements provide small but non-zero advantages to top competitors who adopt it quickly.
*   **2025-10-12** Tymon Kolasiński achieves a 3.95s average at a European competition, the second-fastest official average of all time. (↑) — Confirms that the 3.89s WR is not an unassailable fluke and that multiple cubers are capable of sub-4-second averages.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Human Performance Ceiling (Large, ↓):** As times approach the combined limits of human recognition, reaction time, and motor skills (~2-3 seconds), each fractional improvement becomes exponentially harder. This is the primary driver slowing progress.
*   **Top-Tier Rivalry (Moderate, ↑):** Intense competition between a few elite cubers (Wang, Kolasiński, Park) pushes them to innovate in training and execution, increasing the probability of outlier performances.
*   **Hardware & Lube Innovation (Small, ↑):** Advances in cube manufacturing (magnetization, tensioning, corner-cutting, coatings) provide marginal gains, reducing friction and lockups, which can save crucial hundredths of a second over five solves.
*   **Training Methodologies (Small, ↑):** The use of smart cubes for analytics, targeted algorithm trainers, and advanced theoretical strategies (e.g., full ZBLL recognition) allows for more optimized and consistent solving.
*   **"Lucky" Scrambles (Moderate, ↑):** The "average of 5" method dampens luck, but a favorable set of scrambles (e.g., pre-made F2L pairs, last-layer skips) is still a significant factor in nearly every world record performance.
*   **Competition Density (Small, ↓):** November is not a peak month for major championships. Fewer high-stakes opportunities mean slightly fewer "shots on goal" for a record compared to a month with a World or Continental Championship.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **An Outlier Record:** The current 3.89s WR represents a much larger leap forward than previous records. This suggests it may have been a "perfect storm" of skill and luck, making it harder to beat than a simple trend extrapolation would suggest.
*   **Concentration of Talent:** The potential to set the fastest time is more concentrated in 2-3 individuals than ever before. The outcome is highly dependent on the form and participation of this very small group.
*   **Approaching Physical Limits:** Unlike in the 2010s, when strategic innovations (e.g., look-ahead) drove massive time drops, current improvements are more about refining execution and shaving off milliseconds, indicating a mature optimization phase.
*   **Specific Time Window:** The question is for a single, non-championship month. The base rate of WRs is about one per 9-12 months; the probability of one falling in a *specific* month is low. Therefore, the fastest time is more likely to be an excellent, but not record-breaking, performance.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior distribution centered on recent top-tier results. A log-normal or gamma distribution centered around 4.40 seconds seems appropriate, with the current WR of 3.89s being in the far-left tail. Equivalent n: ~25 (representing the pool of recent world-class results).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑, Moderate) Kolasiński's recent 3.95s average proves the WR is approachable and not a complete anomaly.
    *   (↑, Small) Wang's continued peak single-solve form shows the primary record threat remains active and capable.
    *   (↓, Moderate) The WR was not broken at the recent World Championship, the highest-pressure event with the most talent.
    *   (↓, Large) The law of diminishing returns is the strongest force in play; the 3.89s record is exceptionally difficult to surpass.
    *   (↓, Small) November is a relatively quiet month for competitions, reducing the number of opportunities.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests that while the top cubers are capable

To forecast the fastest average solving time of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube during November 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from recent top-tier competition results and world records. The current world record (WR) is 3.89 seconds, set by Yiheng Wang in June 2024. The top 10 performers have averages ranging from 3.89s to approximately 4.70s, with a median around 4.50s. A reasonable prior distribution is centered around 4.40 seconds, reflecting the typical range of top performances.
   - The variance should account for the spread of recent top-tier results, suggesting a moderate variance that captures the range from 3.89s to 4.70s.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation is similar to the reference distribution as it involves the same top competitors and similar competitive conditions.
   - Differences: The recent advancements in cube technology (e.g., GAN 16) and the intense rivalry among top competitors could lead to slightly faster times. However, the absence of major competitions in November reduces the likelihood of record-breaking performances.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Kolasiński's recent 3.95s average suggests that sub-4-second averages are achievable, increasing the likelihood of faster times (↑).
   - Wang's peak form with a 3.05s single solve indicates potential for fast averages (↑).
   - The WR was not broken at the recent World Championship, indicating the difficulty of surpassing 3.89s (↓).
   - The law of diminishing returns suggests that improvements are becoming harder (↓).
   - November's lower competition density reduces opportunities for record-breaking performances (↓).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Start with a prior centered around 4.40 seconds.
   - Update with evidence: Kolasiński's 3.95s average and Wang's form slightly shift the distribution towards faster times, but the difficulty of breaking the WR and fewer competitions in November counterbalance this.
   - The posterior distribution remains centered around 4.30-4.40 seconds, with a slight leftward skew due to recent performances.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consider the possibility of an outlier performance due to favorable scrambles or exceptional execution.
   - The best alternative forecast might assume a new WR due to unforeseen factors, but this is less plausible given the current evidence.
   - Adjust for overconfidence by ensuring the distribution captures a realistic range of outcomes, including tail risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect a realistic range of outcomes, considering both recent performances and the inherent difficulty of breaking the WR.

# Forecasting the Fastest Average 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube Solving Time in November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the fastest average 3x3x3 solving times from recent competitions as my reference class:

- Current world record: 3.89 seconds (Yiheng Wang, June 2024)
- Previous world record: 4.48 seconds (Tymon Kolasiński, 2023)
- Top 10 performers globally: ~3.89s to ~4.70s
- Median of top 10: ~4.50s

The most appropriate prior is a right-skewed distribution (like log-normal) with:
- Median: ~4.40 seconds
- 10th percentile: ~3.95 seconds (slightly above current WR)
- 90th percentile: ~5.10 seconds

This prior represents what we'd expect for the fastest average time in a typical month, based on recent top-tier competition results.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- The same elite cubers (Wang, Kolasiński, Park) will likely be competing
- The fundamental mechanics and regulations of the competition remain unchanged
- Hardware improvements continue at a similar incremental pace

**Differences from reference distribution:**
- November 2025 is 16 months after the current WR was set, allowing time for improvement
- Kolasiński's recent 3.95s average (October 2025) suggests the WR is approachable
- November typically has fewer major competitions than championship months
- We're forecasting the fastest time in a specific month, not a new WR (which happens ~once per year)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward faster times:**
- Tymon Kolasiński's 3.95s average in October 2025 (strong evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for sub-4.1s times)
- Yiheng Wang's 3.05s single solve in August 2025 (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for sub-4.2s times)
- New GAN 16 cube with AI-assisted tensioning (weak evidence, ~1.1x likelihood for faster times)
- Continued rivalry between top cubers (moderate evidence, ~1.2x likelihood for faster times)

**Evidence pushing toward slower times:**
- No WR broken at World Championship in July 2025 (moderate evidence, ~1.3x likelihood for times >4.0s)
- November has fewer major competitions (weak evidence, ~1.1x likelihood for slower times)
- Diminishing returns as times approach human limits (strong evidence, ~1.5x likelihood for times >3.9s)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 4.40s, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

1. **Update based on Kolasiński's 3.95s average:**
   - This shifts probability mass toward the 3.9-4.1s range
   - Posterior median shifts from ~4.40s to ~4.25s

2. **Update based on diminishing returns near human limits:**
   - This maintains a "floor" around 3.85s (just below current WR)
   - Reduces probability of times below 3.9s
   - Posterior median remains ~4.25s but with less left skew

3. **Update based on Wang's continued peak form:**
   - Increases probability of exceptional performance
   - Shifts some probability mass toward 3.9-4.1s range
   - Posterior median shifts slightly to ~4.20s

The posterior distribution has:
- Shifted left (faster) from the prior
- Become slightly more concentrated around 4.0-4.3s
- Maintained a hard lower bound near 3.85s

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the probability of a new world record in this specific month
- I might be overweighting recent performances (recency bias)
- I could be underestimating the impact of new hardware or training techniques

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A previously unknown cuber emerges with revolutionary technique (low probability)
- An exceptionally lucky set of scrambles enables a sub-3.8s average (very low probability)
- No top-tier cubers compete in November due to scheduling (moderate probability)

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly widen my distribution to account for uncertainty
- Increase the upper percentiles to account for the possibility that top cubers might not compete
- Maintain a very low but non-zero probability of a sub-3.89s performance

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.92
P20: 4.03
P40: 4.18
P60: 4.32
P80: 4.52
P90: 4.75

Answering the question: What will be the fastest average solving time of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube during November 2025?

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is an extreme value: the single fastest official "average of 5" time recorded in a specific month. A suitable base rate is the distribution of top-tier winning times at significant competitions over the last 1-2 years.

*   **Reference Class**: The top 10 global performers, whose official averages range from 3.89s to ~4.70s.
*   **Key Data Points**: The current World Record (WR) is 3.89s. The median of the top 10 is ~4.50s. Winning times at major events, like the hypothetical 2025 World Championship (4.55s), are often slower than the absolute WR.
*   **Prior Distribution**: Based on this, a prior for the fastest time in a random month would be centered around 4.40 seconds. This distribution would be skewed, with a hard-to-breach floor near the current WR and a longer tail towards slower times (e.g., if no top competitors have a peak performance during the month). My prior median (P50) is 4.40s, with a P10 of 4.10s and a P90 of 4.80s.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in November 2025 has several key differences from a generic month in the past:

*   **Similarities**: It is a standard month in the WCA calendar with various competitions scheduled.
*   **Differences (Negative)**: The research report notes that November is a relatively "quiet" month for major championships. This reduces the number of high-stakes opportunities for the very top cubers to compete against each other, slightly increasing the chance that the month's best time will be slower than a typical peak performance.
*   **Differences (Positive)**: The competitive landscape is unusually concentrated at the top. The existence of at least two cubers (Yiheng Wang and Tymon Kolasiński) who have demonstrated the ability to achieve sub-4-second averages creates intense rivalry and a higher probability of an exceptional time being set than in previous eras.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report to update my prior.

*   **Tymon Kolasiński's 3.95s average (Oct 2025)**: This is the most significant piece of new information. It is extremely recent and demonstrates that the 3.89s WR is not an unassailable anomaly. It proves that multiple competitors are capable of sub-4-second averages. This evidence strongly pulls the entire distribution towards faster times (Likelihood Ratio > 1 for faster times).
*   **Max Park's 4.55s Worlds win (July 2025)**: This is a powerful counterpoint. The year's most important competition was won with a time significantly slower than the WR. This suggests that producing a sub-4 average is still an exceptional event, not a routine occurrence, even for the best. This evidence pushes the distribution towards slower times (LR > 1 for slower times).
*   **"Quiet Month" for Competitions**: This factor reduces the number of "shots on goal" for a record. A lower volume of top-tier competitive solves makes an outlier performance less likely. This pushes the distribution moderately towards slower times.
*   **Hardware/Training Advances (GAN 16 cube)**: Small, incremental improvements in technology and training methods provide a steady, gentle pressure towards faster times across the board. This is a minor update pushing the distribution slightly faster.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
I will update my prior (median ~4.40s) using the evaluated evidence.

*   **Prior**: Centered at 4.40s.
*   **Update 1 (Kolasiński's 3.95s)**: This is a major update. It drastically increases the plausibility of a sub-4 time being the month's best. It pulls the median down significantly, perhaps to ~4.20s.
*   **Update 2 (Worlds 4.55s & Quiet Month)**: These factors act as a counterbalance, preventing the median from dropping too far. They remind us that "normal" top-tier times are in the mid-4s and that opportunities for records are scarcer in November. This pulls the median back up slightly from 4.20s, but the Kolasiński result is more recent and potent.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The resulting posterior distribution is centered lower than the prior, around 4.20-4.25s. It remains right-skewed: the physical limits of human performance create a soft wall on the left (faster times), while a lack of major events creates a longer tail on the right (slower times). The new evidence from Kolasiński makes the left tail "fatter," increasing the probability of a time between 3.90s and 4.00s.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must challenge my own reasoning. Am I over-weighting the single 3.95s performance from Kolasiński? Perhaps it was an outlier. The 4.55s from the World Championship is a more robust data point from a larger, higher-pressure event. If I were to build an alternative forecast, I would center it higher, perhaps at 4.35s, arguing that the 3.95s was a "perfect storm" unlikely to be repeated in a quiet month.

However, the rebuttal is that progress in speedcubing happens via these "perfect storm" breakthroughs, which then become the new benchmark to chase. Kolasiński's time resets the bar for what is considered a plausible top performance. Therefore, my significant downward adjustment from the prior seems justified.

A key uncertainty is the small chance of a new WR (<3.89s). The base rate is about one WR per year, so roughly an 8% chance in any given month. With two cubers at this level, a 10% chance seems reasonable. My P10 should reflect this possibility. My P90 should reflect the "quiet month" scenario where the best time is good but not record-threatening.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is a right-skewed distribution centered around 4.20 seconds. The percentiles reflect the small but real possibility of a new world record, the strong likelihood of a very fast time given recent results, and the possibility of a slower month limited by fewer major competitions.

P10: 3.90
P20: 4.02
P40: 4.15
P60: 4.25
P80: 4.40
P90: 4.55
