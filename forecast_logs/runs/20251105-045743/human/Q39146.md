### Reference class & base rates
1.  **League of Legends World Champions (by Region, 2013-2024):** In the 12 tournaments since 2013, the winner has been from South Korea's LCK (8 times, ~67%) or China's LPL (4 times, ~33%). No team from EMEA or the Americas has won in this period. The provided sources guarantee a 4th consecutive LCK winner in 2025, making the base rate for an LCK/Asia-Pacific win this year 100%.
2.  **League of Legends World Champions (by Organization):** T1 has won 5 of the 14 total World Championships (~36%), including the two most recent (2023, 2024). This is an exceptionally high rate for a single organization in a competitive field. KT Rolster has never won the World Championship (0% base rate).
3.  **All-LCK World Finals:** This is not a common occurrence but has happened before (e.g., 2015, 2016, 2017, 2022). In these instances, the historically stronger or more experienced team has typically prevailed.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-04** T1 and KT Rolster confirmed as the 2025 World Championship finalists. ↑↑ (T1/KT) — This is the most critical event, collapsing the probability space to only two teams and confirming they are the two strongest teams at the tournament.
*   **2025-07-13** Gen.G defeated T1 3-2 in the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) final. ↓ (T1) — Demonstrates T1 is not invincible and can be defeated in a high-stakes Best-of-5 final by a fellow top-tier South Korean team.
*   **2024-11-02** T1 won the 2024 World Championship, their second consecutive title. ↑ (T1) — Establishes T1 as the reigning dynasty and defending champion, carrying significant momentum and experience into the 2025 season.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Finals Experience & Mental Fortitude:** T1's roster has extensive experience winning world finals, including the last two. KT Rolster is in its first-ever Worlds final. The pressure difference is a major factor. (Large impact)
*   **Roster Cohesion & Player Skill:** T1's core roster has played together for multiple years, achieving near-perfect synergy. While KT's players are world-class to have reached the final, T1's combination of individual talent (e.g., Faker) and proven teamwork is a powerful driver. (Large impact)
*   **Meta Adaptation:** The team that better understands and drafts for the specific game patch used at Worlds has a significant advantage. A superior draft can win the series before the game even starts. (Moderate impact)
*   **Head-to-Head Momentum:** The results of matches between T1 and KT during the 2025 LCK domestic season can provide insight into stylistic matchups, though tournament performance often differs. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Potential Three-Peat:** T1 is aiming for a third consecutive world title, a feat of dominance unseen in the modern era of League of Legends. This elevates the stakes and pressure beyond a typical final.
*   **"Telecom War" Rivalry:** The final is a showdown between two of South Korea's oldest esports rivals, backed by competing telecom giants. While this rivalry is historic domestically, this is its first appearance on the Worlds final stage, adding a unique narrative layer.
*   **Underdog vs. Dynasty:** Unlike many finals between two established powers, this features a first-time finalist (KT) against the sport's greatest dynasty (T1). This creates a starker favorite/underdog dynamic than the base rate of finals would suggest.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on T1's back-to-back championships and historical dominance, would place them as a strong favorite (~75%) to win against any other team in a hypothetical final. The "equivalent n" is high due to their consistent, repeated success at the highest level.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large) T1 successfully navigated the tournament to reach the final, confirming their status as a top-two team and validating the strong prior.
    *   ↑ (Moderate) KT Rolster reaching their first-ever final demonstrates peak current form, but their lack of finals experience is a significant negative counterweight.
    *   ↓ (Small) T1's loss to Gen.G at MSI 2025 serves as a crucial reminder that they are beatable by domestic rivals in a final, slightly tempering expectations of invincibility.
    *   ↑ (Large) The immense gap in high-stakes finals experience between the two rosters is the single most compelling piece of evidence in T1's favor.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. While KT's performance is commendable, it does not outweigh the overwhelming factors of T1's dynastic momentum and unparalleled experience. The posterior should remain heavily in favor of T1.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
Given the final is imminent, indicators are short-term:
*   **UP indicators (favoring T1):**
    *   Analyst and betting market consensus solidifies around T1.
    *   T1 secures a decisive win in Game 1 of the series, setting the tone.
    *   T1's drafts appear more flexible and surprising than KT's.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring KT Rolster):**
    *   KT wins Game 1, especially in a convincing fashion, breaking T1's aura.
    *   Analysts identify a key champion or strategy in the meta that KT has mastered and T1 has not.
    *   T1 players show uncharacteristic errors or signs of pressure in the opening game.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Best-of-5 Variance:** The outcome is decided by a single series. Upsets are always possible, and a team can have an uncharacteristically good or bad day.
*   **Hidden Preparation:** We lack visibility into the teams' private practice (scrimmages). One team may have developed a novel strategy that could swing the series.
*   **Narrative Fallacy:** The "dynasty vs. underdog" story is compelling but can lead to overweighting T1's historical success while underweighting KT's demonstrated current strength.
*   **Source Context:** The provided sources are treated as factual for this exercise. They establish a clear scenario where only T1 and KT Rolster can win. The analysis is entirely dependent on this premise.

### Final Research Summary
The 2025 World Championship final pits the dynastic, two-time defending champion T1 against first-time finalist KT Rolster. While KT has proven its strength by reaching the final, T1's overwhelming advantage in experience, historical success, and roster cohesion makes them the decisive favorite to secure a historic three-peat.

To forecast the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **T1**: Historically, T1 has won 5 out of 14 World Championships (~36%). Given their recent consecutive wins in 2023 and 2024, a strong prior for T1 would be around 75% against any other team in a hypothetical final.
- **KT Rolster**: KT Rolster has never won the World Championship, so their base rate is 0%. However, reaching the finals this year suggests they are in peak form, so we will assign a prior of 25% for this match-up against T1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: T1's historical dominance and recent consecutive wins align with their strong base rate. KT Rolster reaching the finals indicates they are a top-tier team this year.
- **Differences**: KT Rolster's lack of finals experience is a significant deviation from the base case of a typical T1 opponent, which usually has more experience.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **T1's Finals Experience & Mental Fortitude**: T1's extensive experience in finals is a strong indicator of their ability to perform under pressure. This evidence strongly favors T1.
  - Likelihood of T1 winning given this evidence (P(E | H)): High
  - Likelihood of KT winning given this evidence (P(E | ~H)): Low

- **Roster Cohesion & Player Skill**: T1's synergy and individual talent are significant advantages.
  - Likelihood of T1 winning given this evidence: High
  - Likelihood of KT winning given this evidence: Moderate

- **Meta Adaptation**: Both teams' ability to adapt to the game patch is crucial, but T1's historical adaptability gives them an edge.
  - Likelihood of T1 winning given this evidence: Moderate
  - Likelihood of KT winning given this evidence: Moderate

- **Head-to-Head Momentum**: T1's loss to Gen.G at MSI 2025 shows they are beatable, but this is a small counterweight.
  - Likelihood of T1 winning given this evidence: Slightly reduced
  - Likelihood of KT winning given this evidence: Slightly increased

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior Odds for T1**: 75% (3:1 odds)
- **Likelihood Ratio**: Given the strong evidence in favor of T1 (experience, cohesion), the likelihood ratio heavily favors T1.
- **Posterior Odds for T1**: The evidence reinforces the prior, maintaining T1 as the strong favorite.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of an upset due to variance in a Best-of-5 series and potential hidden strategies by KT.
- **Alternative Scenario**: KT could leverage a novel strategy or champion pick that T1 is unprepared for, leading to an upset.
- **Adjustment**: Slightly adjust T1's probability downwards to account for these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the evidence and adjustments.

### 7. Output Format

T1: 80%  
KT Rolster: 20%  

The final probabilities reflect T1's strong historical performance, experience, and current form, while acknowledging KT Rolster's potential for an upset in their first finals appearance.

# Forecasting the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Based on the research report, the 2025 World Championship final is already set between T1 and KT Rolster, with all other teams eliminated. This fundamentally changes our prior distribution, as we now have certainty that only these two teams can win.

For the two finalists:
- **T1**: Has won 5 of 14 total World Championships (~36%), including the last two consecutive championships (2023, 2024). They are the most successful organization in LoL history.
- **KT Rolster**: Has never won a World Championship (0% historical win rate).

For all other options, the prior is now 0% as they have been eliminated from the tournament.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The final is between two South Korean (LCK) teams, consistent with the region's historical dominance (8 of the last 12 championships).
- T1 continues to be a dominant force, consistent with their historical success.

**Differences from base rate:**
- This is a "Telecom War" rivalry final, which has never happened at Worlds before.
- T1 is attempting an unprecedented three-peat (third consecutive world title).
- KT Rolster is in their first-ever Worlds final, creating a stark dynasty vs. underdog dynamic.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Key evidence and likelihood ratios:

1. **Finals Experience**: 
   - T1 has extensive experience winning world finals, including the last two.
   - KT Rolster is in their first-ever Worlds final.
   - P(E|T1 wins) is very high, P(E|KT wins) is lower, making this strong evidence for T1.

2. **Recent Performance**:
   - T1 lost to Gen.G 3-2 in the 2025 MSI final, showing they can be beaten by domestic rivals.
   - Both teams have performed exceptionally well to reach the final.
   - P(E|T1 wins) and P(E|KT wins) are both moderately high, making this neutral evidence.

3. **Roster Cohesion & Player Skill**:
   - T1's core roster has played together for multiple years with proven synergy.
   - T1 has Faker, widely considered the greatest LoL player ever.
   - P(E|T1 wins) is higher than P(E|KT wins), making this moderate evidence for T1.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with a prior based on T1's historical dominance and current form, I'll assign:
- T1: 75% prior probability
- KT Rolster: 25% prior probability

Updating based on the finals experience factor:
- Prior odds for T1: 75/25 = 3:1
- Likelihood ratio (conservative estimate): 2:1
- Posterior odds: 3 × 2 = 6:1
- Posterior probability: 6/(6+1) = 6/7 ≈ 85.7% for T1

Further adjusting for the MSI loss to Gen.G (showing T1's vulnerability):
- Prior odds (from previous update): 85.7/14.3 ≈ 6:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9:1 (slight evidence against T1)
- Posterior odds: 6 × 0.9 = 5.4:1
- Posterior probability: 5.4/(5.4+1) ≈ 84.4% for T1

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- **Recency bias**: I might be overweighting T1's recent championships and underestimating KT's current form.
- **Underdog potential**: First-time finalists can sometimes overperform due to less pressure or the element of surprise.
- **Meta adaptation**: The specific game patch and meta at Worlds could favor KT's playstyle.
- **Best-of-5 variance**: A single series has inherent variance, and upsets are always possible.

Alternative forecast: KT Rolster could win if they've developed specific counter-strategies to T1's playstyle during their tournament preparation, or if T1 underperforms due to pressure of attempting the three-peat.

Adjusting for these considerations, I'll slightly reduce T1's probability:
- T1: ~80%
- KT Rolster: ~20%

## 6. Final Normalization

Given that the research report explicitly states that only T1 and KT Rolster can win (they are the finalists), all other options have 0% probability. The sum of T1 and KT Rolster should be 100%.

## 7. Output Format

T1: 80%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 0%  
KT Rolster: 20%  
Gen.G: 0%  
Bilibili Gaming: 0%  
Anyone's Legend: 0%  
Top Esports: 0%  
Invictus Gaming: 0%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 0%  
An EMEA team: 0%  
An Americas team: 0%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most critical piece of information is that the date is November 5th, 2025, and the research report confirms that the World Championship final is between T1 and KT Rolster. This collapses the probability space from many teams to just two. Therefore, all other teams and regions have a 0% chance of winning.

The question is now: "Who will win the final between T1 and KT Rolster?"

A generic base rate for a final might be 50/50. However, this ignores the vast asymmetry between the two teams. A more informed prior should be based on T1's status as the reigning two-time champion and the sport's greatest dynasty. The research report's "Bayesian update sketch" suggests a prior of ~75% for T1 against a generic finals opponent. This is a well-justified starting point reflecting their historical dominance and recent success.

*   **Prior P(T1 wins): 75%**
*   **Prior P(KT Rolster wins): 25%**

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The final is a Best-of-5 series, a format where T1 has consistently demonstrated mastery. It is an all-LCK (South Korean) final, which has occurred multiple times in the past.
*   **Differences:** This specific matchup presents an extreme dynamic. T1 is not just an experienced team; they are a dynasty aiming for an unprecedented third consecutive title. KT Rolster is not just an underdog; they are in their first-ever World Championship final. This "dynasty vs. first-timer" scenario creates a much larger experience and pressure differential than a typical final, making it an unusual case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the 75/25 prior based on the specific evidence for this matchup. The prior odds are P(T1)/P(KT) = 75/25 = 3:1.

*   **Evidence 1: The massive gap in finals experience.** T1's roster has won the last two World Championships. KT's roster is entirely new to this stage. High-pressure experience is a major causal factor in performance.
    *   P(E | T1 wins): The experience gap being the deciding factor is very likely. T1 handles the pressure better, KT makes crucial mistakes. This is a very plausible narrative for a T1 victory.
    *   P(E | KT wins): For KT to win, they would have to overcome this enormous disadvantage. It's less likely that a first-time finalist topples a dynasty than the other way around.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood ratio P(E|T1 wins)/P(E|KT wins) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly pushes the probability towards T1.

*   **Evidence 2: T1's loss to Gen.G in the 2025 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) final.** This is the primary piece of evidence against T1's invincibility.
    *   P(E | T1 wins Worlds): T1 losing a final earlier in the year is still plausible, but it slightly weakens the case for their absolute dominance.
    *   P(E | T1 loses Worlds): If T1 is a team that can lose a final to a domestic rival (Gen.G), it makes it more plausible they could lose this final to another domestic rival (KT).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood ratio P(E|T1 wins)/P(E|KT wins) is slightly less than 1. This evidence provides a small update away from T1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 3:1 in favor of T1 (75%).
2.  **Apply Evidence 1 (Experience Gap):** This is the most powerful factor. Let's estimate its likelihood ratio as 2.0, meaning this situation (dynasty vs. rookie finalist) is twice as likely to result in a win for the dynasty than for the rookie.
    *   **New Odds:** 3:1 * 2.0 = 6:1 in favor of T1.
    *   **New Probability:** P(T1) = 6 / (6+1) ≈ 85.7%.
3.  **Apply Evidence 2 (MSI Loss):** This is a small counterpoint. It reminds us T1 is not infallible. Let's estimate a likelihood ratio of 0.9, slightly favoring the KT-wins hypothesis.
    *   **Final Odds:** 6:1 * 0.9 = 5.4:1 in favor of T1.
    *   **Final Probability P(T1):** 5.4 / (5.4 + 1) = 5.4 / 6.4 ≈ 84.4%.
    *   **Final Probability P(KT):** 1 / 6.4 ≈ 15.6%.

Rounding these figures gives a clear picture: T1 is a very strong favorite.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily skewed towards T1. Could I be wrong?
*   **Overconfidence/Narrative Fallacy:** I might be overweighting T1's past success. KT is undeniably one of the two best teams in the world *right now* by virtue of reaching the final. They are in peak form.
*   **Best-of-5 Variance:** A single series can be volatile. A player having an off day, a brilliant draft strategy from KT, or a meta that uniquely favors KT's champion pool could decide the series. The "Hidden Preparation" caveat is real; KT may have a secret weapon.
*   **Plausible Alternative:** The most plausible path to victory for KT is that the pressure of the "three-peat" gets to T1, while KT plays with the freedom of being the underdog. If KT can win Game 1, they could shatter T1's aura of invincibility and build unstoppable momentum.
*   **Adjustment:** A 15% chance for KT seems to adequately capture these possibilities. It's a significant chance of an upset (roughly 1 in 6 or 7), acknowledging the high variance of a single series while still respecting T1's overwhelming advantages on paper. I will stick with my calculated probabilities.

### 6. Final Normalization

The finalists are confirmed to be T1 and KT Rolster. All other options must be 0%. The specific team options take precedence over the regional "catch-all" options.

*   T1: 85%
*   KT Rolster: 15%
*   All other teams/regions: 0%
*   Total: 100%

T1: 85%
Hanwha Life Esports: 0%
KT Rolster: 15%
Gen.G: 0%
Bilibili Gaming: 0%
Anyone's Legend: 0%
