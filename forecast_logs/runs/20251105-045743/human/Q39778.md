### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections (within any regional group):** In recent years, contested bids or deadlocks have occurred but are usually resolved before the default option is triggered. For example, the Eastern European Group's deadlock for COP29 was resolved when Azerbaijan was agreed upon as a compromise host. This suggests a high probability of resolution.
    *   **Base Rate:** A specific host is chosen (~85-90%); the conference defaults to Bonn, Germany (~10-15%). This is an estimate based on the strong international pressure to avoid the "failure" optics of a default.
2.  **Western European and Others Group (WEOG) Host Selections:** WEOG is a diverse and non-cohesive group (inc. Western Europe, USA, Canada, Australia, NZ, Israel, Turkey). Consensus can be more difficult than in more politically aligned groups. However, the group has consistently selected a host when it is their turn.
    *   **Base Rate:** A host is successfully chosen via consensus (>95%); default to Bonn (<5%). Historically, the group manages to find a solution.
3.  **Bids from Non-EU WEOG Members:** When bids come from WEOG members outside the core EU bloc (e.g., Canada for COP11), they are typically successful if they are the sole candidate. The current situation with two strong, non-EU WEOG members competing is unusual.
    *   **Base Rate:** Difficult to establish a precise rate due to the rarity of this specific scenario. The primary driver remains the consensus rule, not the specific identity of the bidders.

Limitations: These base rates are estimates, as the internal negotiations of UN regional groups are opaque and not systematically documented. The current deadlock's persistence makes it an outlier, potentially weakening the relevance of historical base rates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-04** The Guardian notes the unresolved standoff with Turkey is a key issue for Australia's bid, with a decision expected at COP30 in November 2025. — (↔︎) Highlights the imminence and high stakes of the decision.
*   **2025-10-29** Australia's Department of Climate Change (DCCEEW) officially re-confirms its commitment to the bid with the Pacific. — (↑ Australia) Signals continued high-level political will and no intention of backing down.
*   **2025-09-08** DCCEEW website emphasizes the "partnership with the Pacific" aspect of the bid. — (↑ Australia) Reinforces the bid's primary narrative strength, which aligns with the climate justice focus of recent COPs.
*   **2025-07-28** Hürriyet Daily News reports the UN is pressing both nations to resolve the deadlock. — (↓ Germany, ↑ Australia/Turkey) Increases pressure for a compromise, making the default-to-Bonn scenario slightly less likely as it would represent a diplomatic failure for the group.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** (Large) This is the most critical driver. A single member's objection can block a decision, forcing a default to Germany. Turkey's continued bid is a direct lever preventing an Australian victory.
2.  **Geopolitical Narrative & Alliances:** (Large) Australia's "co-host with the Pacific" narrative is powerful, framing the bid around climate justice for vulnerable nations. Turkey's narrative as a bridge between developed and developing worlds is also compelling. The success of either bid depends on which narrative persuades more WEOG members.
3.  **Diplomatic Horse-Trading:** (Moderate) The deadlock could be resolved by a backroom deal, such as one country withdrawing its 2026 bid in exchange for support for a future COP (e.g., COP36, the next scheduled WEOG turn) or another UN position.
4.  **Reputational Stakes:** (Moderate) There is significant pressure on the WEOG group to avoid the embarrassment of failing to select a host. This pressure pushes key players (e.g., the US, EU states) to broker a compromise between Australia and Turkey.
5.  **Domestic Political Commitment:** (Small) Both the Australian and Turkish governments appear strongly committed. The funding and planning undertaken by South Australia for Adelaide is a signal of seriousness, but this has little influence on the international consensus mechanism.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Two Persistent, High-Capacity Bidders:** Unlike typical selection cycles that converge on a single candidate, this features two credible and determined bidders from the same regional group who have maintained a deadlock for an extended period.
*   **Novel Co-Host Model:** Australia's proposed partnership with Pacific Island Nations is a unique model for a WEOG host. It complicates the bid but also gives it significant moral and political weight that a standard single-nation bid would lack.
*   **Geopolitical Diversity of Bidders:** The bidders represent different geopolitical poles within the diverse WEOG group. Turkey is not part of the traditional "Western" alliance (CANZUS/EU) that Australia belongs to, making bloc-based consensus more difficult.
*   **Proximity to Deadline:** The failure to reach a consensus this close to the decision point (COP30) is highly unusual and elevates the probability of the default scenario compared to the historical base rate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of contested bids, a resolution is likely. A plausible prior might be: Australia 55%, Turkey 30%, Germany 15%, Others <1%. This reflects Australia's stronger narrative and reported wider support, Turkey's power to block, and the real risk of default. (Equivalent n≈10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Australia, moderate) Australia's consistent messaging and the powerful "hosting with the Pacific" narrative, which has broad appeal.
    *   (↑ Turkey/Germany, moderate) Turkey's refusal to withdraw demonstrates its ability to exercise a veto, keeping its own chances alive and increasing the probability of a deadlock (and thus a default to Germany).
    *   (↓ Germany, small) Reports of UN pressure on the parties to resolve the issue suggest a desire by the international community to avoid the "failure" of a default.
    *   (↑ Australia, small) The UNSW source mentioning "widespread support" for Australia within WEOG, even if not unanimous, suggests Australia is the plurality favorite.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence slightly reinforces Australia's position as the favorite. However, the hard constraint of the consensus rule means the probability for Germany should remain significant. The posterior should shift slightly towards Australia, perhaps at the expense of both Turkey and Germany, as pressure mounts for a resolution favoring the bid with broader support.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support for Australia's bid from major WEOG players (e.g., USA, Canada, key EU states).
    *   Reports or rumors of Turkey negotiating for a future COP hosting right (e.g., COP36).
    *   A joint statement from Australia and Pacific Island leaders reaffirming the bid at COP30.
    *   Turkey's official withdrawal from the race.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements from the WEOG chair about the "ongoing impasse" or "difficulty in reaching consensus."
    *   Reports of a bloc of countries supporting Turkey's bid.
    *   Any major diplomatic incident between Australia and a key WEOG member.
    *   UNFCCC officials beginning to speak openly about contingency planning for a Bonn conference.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Negotiations:** The entire WEOG negotiation process is conducted behind closed doors. Public information is scarce and potentially biased, representing negotiating positions rather than facts.
*   **Veto Power:** This is not a majority vote. Turkey does not need widespread support to block Australia; it only needs to maintain its own bid. The final outcome hinges on one country's decision.
*   **Last-Minute Deal-Making:** The final decision could be the result of a sudden, unforeseen diplomatic bargain struck at COP30, making prediction difficult.
*   **Geopolitical Volatility:** A sudden shift in international relations involving Turkey (e.g., with the EU or US) could dramatically alter its negotiating position within WEOG.
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The question resolves on the *country*, not the city. An Australian win is straightforward. A German resolution means the default option was triggered.

**Final Research Summary:** This is a two-horse race between Australia and Turkey for the right to host COP31, with the outcome constrained by the need for consensus within their UN regional group. Australia is the marginal favorite due to a more compelling narrative and wider reported support, but Turkey's persistence creates a significant risk of a continued deadlock, which would result in the conference defaulting to Bonn, Germany.

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the historical success of non-EU WEOG members when they are the sole candidates, and considering Australia's strong narrative and reported support, a base rate of 55% is reasonable.
- **Turkey**: As the only other official bid from a WEOG member, Turkey's base rate is set at 30%. This reflects its ability to block consensus and its geopolitical narrative.
- **Germany**: Historically, the default to Bonn is rare but possible if consensus fails. A base rate of 15% is appropriate.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely as a standalone host without Australia, so <1%.
- **Other**: Given the current bids, the likelihood of another country emerging is negligible, so <1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The situation aligns with past contested bids where a resolution is typically reached.
- **Differences**: The persistent deadlock and Australia's unique co-host model with Pacific nations are unusual, potentially affecting the base rates.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia's Commitment**: Australia's consistent messaging and partnership with Pacific nations increase the likelihood of their bid succeeding. (↑ Australia)
- **Turkey's Persistence**: Turkey's refusal to withdraw and its geopolitical narrative maintain its chances and the risk of a deadlock. (↑ Turkey/Germany)
- **UN Pressure**: The UN's push for resolution suggests a desire to avoid defaulting to Bonn, slightly decreasing Germany's likelihood. (↓ Germany)
- **Support for Australia**: Reports of widespread support for Australia within WEOG further bolster its chances. (↑ Australia)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds of 55% increase slightly due to strong narrative and support, moving to around 60%.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds of 30% remain stable due to its blocking power and narrative.
- **Germany**: Prior odds of 15% decrease slightly due to international pressure to avoid default, moving to around 10%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Remains negligible.
- **Other**: Remains negligible.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Ensure not to overestimate Australia's chances given Turkey's blocking power.
- **Tail Risks**: Consider a last-minute diplomatic deal or geopolitical shifts affecting Turkey's position.
- **Alternative Forecast**: Turkey could still host if it negotiates a favorable deal or if geopolitical dynamics shift.

### 6. Final Normalization

- **Australia**: 60%
- **Turkey**: 28%
- **Germany**: 10%
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: <1%
- **Other**: <1%

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 60%  
Turkey: 28%  
Germany: 10%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: <1%  
Other: <1%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and the dynamics of the WEOG decision-making process.

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia: 45%**
- Australia has a formal bid with significant preparation and investment
- Has reported "widespread support" within WEOG
- The Pacific partnership narrative aligns with climate justice themes

**Turkey: 30%**
- Has a formal bid with Antalya as the proposed host city
- As a WEOG member, has equal standing to propose
- Has shown persistence in maintaining its bid

**Germany: 20%**
- Default option if consensus fails
- Houses UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn
- Has experience hosting previous climate conferences

**Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%**
- While Australia proposes co-hosting with Pacific nations, they are not WEOG members
- A Pacific nation could only host independently if regional rotation rules were changed

**Other: 2%**
- Covers any other WEOG member making a late bid
- Includes possibility of compromise candidates or procedural changes

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical COP host selection:**
- Follows the established regional rotation system
- Requires consensus within the regional group
- Involves formal bids from interested countries

**Key differences:**
- Unusually persistent deadlock between two determined bidders
- Novel co-hosting model proposed by Australia
- Proximity to decision deadline without resolution
- Geopolitical diversity of bidders within WEOG (Australia vs Turkey)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Australia:**
- P(Pacific partnership narrative | Australia wins) = High
- P(Pacific partnership narrative | Australia doesn't win) = Low
- This narrative gives Australia a unique selling point that aligns with climate justice priorities

**Evidence for Turkey:**
- P(Continued deadlock | Turkey maintains bid) = High
- P(Continued deadlock | Turkey withdraws) = Very Low
- Turkey's persistence creates veto power that keeps its chances alive

**Evidence for Germany:**
- P(Default to Bonn | Consensus fails) = Very High
- P(Default to Bonn | Consensus reached) = Very Low
- The consensus requirement makes Germany a real possibility despite not being an active bidder

**Evidence against Pacific Island Nations:**
- P(Non-WEOG country hosts during WEOG's turn | Normal rules apply) = Very Low
- This makes an independent Pacific host extremely unlikely

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update Australia's probability based on the "partnership with Pacific" narrative:

Prior odds for Australia = 45/55 = 0.82
Likelihood ratio ≈ 2 (the narrative is about twice as likely if Australia will win vs if it won't)
Posterior odds = 0.82 × 2 = 1.64
Posterior probability = 1.64/(1+1.64) ≈ 62%

However, we must also consider Turkey's veto power:

Prior odds for Australia after first update = 62/38 = 1.63
Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.7 (Australia's win is less likely given Turkey's continued opposition)
Posterior odds = 1.63 × 0.7 = 1.14
Posterior probability = 1.14/(1+1.14) ≈ 53%

For Germany, the continued deadlock increases its chances:
Prior probability = 20%
Given the persistent impasse, likelihood ratio ≈ 1.5
Updated probability ≈ 27%

Adjusting Turkey accordingly:
Prior probability = 30%
With reduced Australia probability and increased Germany probability, Turkey adjusts to ≈ 18%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating Australia's position based on English-language sources
- The opacity of WEOG negotiations means key information is likely missing
- Last-minute diplomatic deals could dramatically change the outcome

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could gain sudden support through diplomatic horse-trading
- A compromise candidate could emerge (e.g., Canada, New Zealand)
- The rules could be modified to allow joint hosting across regional groups

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reduce Australia's probability to account for negotiation opacity
- Maintain significant probability for Germany given the real deadlock risk
- Slightly increase "Other" to account for compromise scenarios

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations and adjustments:

Australia: 50%
Turkey: 18% 
Germany: 27%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 50%
Turkey: 18%
Germany: 27%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of contested host selections for UN COPs.
*   **A host is selected vs. Default:** Historically, even in contested situations (like the Eastern European Group for COP29), a compromise is reached and a host is selected. A default to the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany, is a rare outcome, representing a diplomatic failure for the regional group. I'll estimate a base rate of **85% for a host being selected** and **15% for a default to Germany**.
*   **Splitting the "Host Selected" probability:** There are two official bids: Australia and Turkey. Without further information, a neutral prior would split the 85% probability evenly between them.

This gives the following prior distribution:
*   **Australia:** 42.5% (50% of 85%)
*   **Turkey:** 42.5% (50% of 85%)
*   **Germany:** 15%
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** 0% (This is part of Australia's bid, not a separate one.)
*   **Other:** 0% (No other bids from the WEOG group have been announced.)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process follows the standard UN regional group rotation with a consensus rule. There is significant international pressure on the group to select a host.
*   **Differences:** This case is unusual because two credible, high-capacity bidders have maintained a deadlock for an extended period, much closer to the decision deadline than is typical. The geopolitical diversity of the bidders (Australia from the CANZUS bloc, Turkey as a NATO but non-EU member) and the novel "co-host with the Pacific" model make this situation distinct from past selections. These differences suggest the base rate for a default (Germany) might be understated.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate several key pieces of evidence:

*   **Evidence A: Australia's "co-host with the Pacific" narrative.**
    *   This narrative is politically powerful, aligning with the climate justice focus of recent COPs. It is highly likely to attract broad support within the WEOG group (e.g., from the EU, Canada, New Zealand).
    *   P(E | Australia wins) is high. P(E | Turkey wins) is low, as it would mean this powerful narrative was overcome.
    *   This evidence strongly favors Australia over Turkey.

*   **Evidence B: Turkey's persistent bid and refusal to withdraw.**
    *   This is the direct cause of the deadlock. The consensus rule means Turkey can block Australia's bid simply by maintaining its own.
    *   P(E | Germany wins) is high, as this persistence is the mechanism for a default. P(E | Turkey wins) is also high, as it's a necessary condition. P(E | Australia wins) is low, as an Australian victory requires Turkey to eventually concede.
    *   This evidence increases the probability of both Turkey and Germany, primarily at the expense of Australia.

*   **Evidence C: UN pressure on both nations to resolve the deadlock.**
    *   The international community wants to avoid the "failure" of a default. This pressure is intended to force a compromise.
    *   P(E | Germany wins) is low. The evidence suggests an outcome where either Australia or Turkey is chosen is more likely than a default.
    *   This evidence pushes probability away from Germany and towards the two main contenders.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with the prior:** Australia 42.5%, Turkey 42.5%, Germany 15%.

2.  **Apply Evidence A (Australia's narrative):** This evidence suggests Australia is a stronger candidate than Turkey. I will adjust the initial 85% "host selected" probability from a 50/50 split to a 2/3 vs. 1/3 split in Australia's favor.
    *   Australia: (2/3) * 85% ≈ 57%
    *   Turkey: (1/3) * 85% ≈ 28%
    *   Germany remains at 15%.

3.  **Apply Evidence B (Turkey's persistence):** The unusual length and persistence of the deadlock make the default scenario more likely than the base rate suggests. I will double the probability of a default, moving 15% probability mass to Germany. This mass should come from the other two options, proportionally more from the favorite (Australia), whose path is being directly blocked. I'll take 10% from Australia and 5% from Turkey.
    *   Australia: 57% - 10% = 47%
    *   Turkey: 28% - 5% = 23%
    *   Germany: 15% + 15% = 30%

4.  **Apply Evidence C (UN pressure):** This pressure makes a default less likely. It will likely force a resolution that favors the candidate with broader support (Australia). I will move 5% probability mass away from Germany and add it primarily to Australia.
    *   Australia: 47% + 4% = 51%
    *   Turkey: 23% + 1% = 24%
    *   Germany: 30% - 5% = 25%

This gives a posterior of Australia 51%, Turkey 24%, Germany 25%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast makes Australia the favorite. A key vulnerability is underestimating Turkey's resolve or its ability to secure a small but firm blocking coalition within WEOG. The consensus rule is absolute; Turkey does not need to be popular, it just needs to not back down. The deadlock itself could be Turkey's primary goal, using the COP bid as leverage in other geopolitical arenas. If this is the case, the probability of a default to Germany is higher than my estimate.

To account for this, I will slightly reduce Australia's probability and increase Germany's, reflecting the scenario where the deadlock is more robust than it appears. I will move 3% from Australia to Germany.

*   Australia: 51% - 3% = 48%
*   Turkey: 24% (unchanged)
*   Germany: 25% + 3% = 28%

Finally, I will assign a very small probability (1%) to "Another Pacific Island Nation" to account for the small chance that the co-hosting arrangement results in a surprise official designation. This 1% will come from Australia, the most related option.

### 6. Final Normalization

After red-teaming, the adjusted probabilities are:
*   Australia: 47%
*   Turkey: 24%
*   Germany: 28%
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
*   Other: 0%
The sum is 100%. This distribution reflects that Australia is the most likely host, but the risk of a continued deadlock resulting in a default to Germany is very significant and slightly more likely than Turkey winning the bid outright.

Australia: 47%
Turkey: 24%
Germany: 28%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 0%
