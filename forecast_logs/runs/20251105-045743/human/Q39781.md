### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the legal and constitutional framework for states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador?** Specifically, what are the maximum durations and conditions for extension? This is critical for understanding the constraints on the current SoE.
*   **Q2: What is the historical precedent for SoEs in Ecuador?** How frequently are they used, for what reasons (e.g., crime, protest, natural disaster), how many provinces do they typically cover, and how long do they last? This will establish the reference class.
*   **Q3: What is the current status of the two main drivers for recent SoEs: indigenous-led protests and organized crime?**
    *   For protests: Are negotiations underway regarding the diesel subsidy cuts? What is the stance of key indigenous organizations like CONAIE?
    *   For crime: What are the recent trends in violence? Is the government's "internal armed conflict" strategy showing signs of success or failure?
*   **Q4: What is President Noboa's political strategy and current standing?** How does he use SoEs? What are his approval ratings, particularly concerning his security policies? Does he have the political capital to extend or impose new SoEs?
*   **Q5: What is the timeline for the current SoE?** When exactly does the 60-day period declared in October 2025 end? This is the most crucial tactical detail.

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `Ecuador constitution state of emergency duration`, `constitución Ecuador estado de excepción prórroga`, `ley de seguridad pública y del estado Ecuador`.
*   **Q2:** `history of states of emergency Ecuador`, `historial estados de excepción Ecuador últimos 5 años`, `estados de excepción Ecuador Lasso Moreno Correa`.
*   **Q3:** `CONAIE Ecuador diesel subsidy negotiations 2025`, `Ecuador security situation update November 2025`, `homicide rate Ecuador 2025`, `resultados plan fénix Ecuador 2025`.
*   **Q4:** `Daniel Noboa approval rating November 2025`, `estrategia de seguridad Noboa`, `Noboa popularidad encuestas`.
*   **Q5:** `Ecuador decreto estado de excepción octubre 2025 fecha exacta`, `cálculo 60 días estado de excepción Ecuador`.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Legal Framework:** The Ecuadorian Constitution (Article 165) allows for a state of emergency for up to 60 days. It can be renewed only once for an additional 30 days. After 90 days, it must be lifted. This is a hard constraint.
*   **Timeline:** The initial SoE was declared on October 4, 2025. A 60-day period from this date ends on or around **December 3, 2025**. This is *before* the resolution date of December 25, 2025. Therefore, for any provinces to be under an SoE on Dec 25, the current one must be formally extended, or a new one must be declared.
*   **Historical Precedent:** SoEs are a common tool in Ecuador, used by recent presidents (Moreno, Lasso, and now Noboa) to respond to prison riots, spikes in crime, and major social protests (e.g., 2019, 2022). They range from localized (a few provinces) to nationwide (all 24). They are almost always temporary and often lifted following negotiations (in the case of protests) or a perceived stabilization of the security situation.
*   **Current Drivers:**
    *   **Protests:** The conflict with indigenous groups over subsidies is a recurring theme. Noboa's government has taken a hardline stance, linking protesters to foreign cartels and terrorism, which complicates negotiations and raises the stakes.
    *   **Crime:** The "internal armed conflict" declared in January 2024 remains the government's overarching security policy. While it initially led to a drop in violence and was popular, the structural drivers of crime (drug trafficking, weak institutions) persist, and violence remains a major national issue.
*   **Noboa's Strategy:** President Noboa has built his political identity on a "mano dura" (iron fist) security policy. He has a demonstrated willingness to use military force and declare SoEs. This approach remains popular, giving him political latitude to employ such measures.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency in Ecuador (2019-2025):** SoEs are a frequently used tool of governance. In the last ~5 years, Ecuador has seen at least half a dozen major SoEs declared for reasons including prison riots, spikes in gang violence, social protests, and the COVID-19 pandemic. They can be localized (1-7 provinces) or nationwide (24 provinces). **Base Rate:** The probability of *at least one* province being under an SoE on a random day in this period is moderately high (perhaps 20-30%), but they are by definition temporary. The number of provinces involved varies widely.
2.  **SoEs for Major Indigenous Protests (2019, 2022):** Large-scale protests led by indigenous confederation CONAIE have previously triggered widespread SoEs (e.g., 2019 under Moreno, 2022 under Lasso). These typically last for weeks, not months, and are usually resolved through political negotiation, after which the SoE is lifted. **Base Rate:** These specific events are rarer, but when they occur, they affect multiple (6+) provinces. They almost never last the full constitutionally-allowed 90 days.
3.  **SoEs under President Noboa (2024-2025):** Noboa's administration has used SoEs proactively as a central pillar of its security strategy. This includes the nationwide "internal armed conflict" declaration and the current protest-related SoE. This suggests a higher propensity to use this tool than his immediate predecessors.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-04** The government declares a 60-day SoE in 10 provinces due to indigenous-led protests against diesel subsidy cuts. ↑ — Establishes the current state of affairs.
*   **2025-10-06** The SoE is expanded to a total of 16 provinces as protests and violence escalate. ↑ — Shows the government's willingness to broaden the scope in response to events.
*   **2025-10-08** President Noboa's convoy is attacked; the government labels it an assassination attempt and arrests protesters on terrorism charges. ↑ — Hardens the government's stance, making a negotiated de-escalation less likely and an extension more probable.
*   **2025-11-05** (Today) Tensions remain high, with the government framing the protests as a security threat linked to foreign cartels, while protest leaders demand economic policy changes. ↑ — The core conflict remains unresolved as the SoE expiry date approaches.
*   **2025-12-03** (Projected) The 60-day SoE declared on October 4 is set to expire. ↓ — This is the most critical fact. The SoE will automatically lapse before the resolution date unless the government actively extends it for another 30 days.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Constitutional Clock (Large):** The Ecuadorian constitution limits an SoE to 60 days, renewable once for 30 days. The current SoE expires ~Dec 3, forcing a decision by the government to either extend it or let it lapse. This is the primary driver of the forecast.
*   **Protest Intensity & Negotiations (Large):** The state of play between the government and indigenous groups (like CONAIE) is key. A successful negotiation or a lull in protests would remove the justification for the SoE. A renewed wave of protests would strongly argue for an extension.
*   **Noboa's "Mano Dura" Doctrine (Moderate):** The President's political brand is built on a tough security stance. He is predisposed to using security measures and framing dissent as a criminal/terrorist threat, increasing the odds of an extension compared to a more conciliatory leader.
*   **Underlying Organized Crime (Moderate):** The persistent, high level of gang violence provides a constant, alternative justification for an SoE. A major security incident unrelated to the protests could trigger a new, separate SoE at any time, potentially covering many provinces.
*   **Holiday Season Politics (Small):** There may be political pressure to lift the SoE before Christmas to project an image of normalcy and facilitate holiday travel and commerce, potentially acting as a small downward pressure.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **"Internal Armed Conflict" Frame:** Unlike past presidents who treated protests as a political problem, Noboa has formally declared an "internal armed conflict" against gangs and rhetorically links social protest to this conflict. This elevates the confrontation and justifies a military response.
*   **Blending of Threats:** The government's explicit attribution of protests to the "Tren de Aragua" cartel is a novel strategy. It attempts to delegitimize the protest movement and frame it as a national security issue rather than a socio-economic one.
*   **Noboa's High Approval:** Historically, presidents facing major protests often had low approval ratings. Noboa, largely due to his security platform, has maintained significant public support, giving him more political capital to sustain a hardline stance.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on 0 provinces. The base rate shows SoEs are temporary, and the constitutional clock dictates the current one will expire before Dec 25. This prior should have a low "equivalent n" (

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection**: The historical use of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador serves as the base rate. Over the past five years, SoEs have been used frequently, often in response to protests, crime, or natural disasters. They can range from affecting a few provinces to being nationwide.
- **Base Rate Statistics**: Historically, the probability of at least one province being under an SoE on any given day is moderately high, around 20-30%. The number of provinces involved can vary widely, but large-scale SoEs affecting many provinces are less common.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The current situation involves significant protests and violence, similar to past instances that have led to SoEs.
- **Differences**: The current SoE is set to expire on December 3, 2025, unless extended. The government's framing of protests as linked to organized crime is a novel strategy, potentially justifying an extension or new declaration.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Protests and Violence**: The ongoing protests and violence increase the likelihood of an SoE extension or new declaration. The government's hardline stance and framing of the protests as a security threat suggest a higher probability of maintaining or expanding the SoE.
- **Constitutional Constraints**: The constitutional limit of 60 days, with a possible 30-day extension, means the current SoE will expire before December 25 unless actively extended.
- **Political Strategy**: President Noboa's "mano dura" approach and high approval ratings support the likelihood of using SoEs as a tool for maintaining order.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior**: Start with a prior centered on 0 provinces, given the constitutional expiration of the current SoE.
- **Likelihood**: The evidence of ongoing protests and the government's strategy increases the likelihood of an SoE affecting multiple provinces.
- **Posterior**: The posterior distribution shifts towards a higher number of provinces under SoE, but the constitutional expiration acts as a counterbalance.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of negotiations leading to a resolution before December 25, reducing the number of provinces under SoE.
- **Tail Risks**: A significant escalation in violence or a new security threat could lead to a nationwide SoE.
- **Alternative Forecast**: A scenario where the government opts for a more conciliatory approach, leading to fewer provinces under SoE.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the number of provinces in Ecuador under a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, are as follows:

P10: 0  
P20: 2  
P40: 5  
P60: 8  
P80: 12  
P90: 16

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use historical patterns of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador:

- Ecuador has 24 provinces total
- SoEs are common tools used by Ecuadorian presidents for security crises and protests
- They are constitutionally limited to 60 days, with one possible 30-day extension
- The current SoE (declared October 4, 2025) covers 16 provinces and would expire around December 3, 2025
- For a province to be under SoE on December 25, either:
  a) The current SoE must be extended (for 30 days, reaching ~January 2, 2026)
  b) A new SoE must be declared after December 3

**Prior distribution:**
- Mean/median: 0 provinces (most likely outcome given constitutional timing)
- Shape: Right-skewed (possibility of 0-24 provinces)
- Variance: Moderate (historical precedent shows both nationwide and targeted SoEs)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- President Noboa has used SoEs as a security tool, consistent with previous administrations
- The current SoE follows the pattern of being triggered by indigenous protests
- Constitutional constraints on duration remain unchanged

**Key differences:**
- Noboa has framed protests as terrorism and linked them to cartels, unlike previous administrations
- The attack on Noboa's convoy has escalated tensions beyond typical protest dynamics
- Noboa's "internal armed conflict" declaration shows greater willingness to use security measures
- The timing of the current SoE expiration (~December 3) means active renewal is required for provinces to be under SoE on December 25

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Noboa has declared 16 provinces under SoE, showing willingness to use broad geographic coverage (+)
- The framing of protests as terrorism creates justification for extended security measures (++)
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa significantly raises stakes and justification for continued emergency powers (++)
- Ecuador's ongoing security crisis with organized crime provides alternative justification for new SoEs (+)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Constitutional constraints limit SoEs to 90 days maximum (60+30), forcing eventual expiration (---)
- The current SoE expires ~December 3, requiring active renewal to reach December 25 (--)
- Historical pattern shows most protest-related SoEs are resolved through negotiation before reaching maximum duration (-)
- Holiday season (Christmas) creates political pressure to restore normalcy (-)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered on 0 provinces, I'll update based on key evidence:

**Update 1: Constitutional timing**
- The current SoE expires ~December 3
- For provinces to be under SoE on December 25, the government must take active steps
- This strongly shifts probability mass toward 0 provinces

**Update 2: Noboa's security approach**
- Noboa's framing of protests as terrorism and cartel activity
- His "internal armed conflict" declaration and hardline stance
- This shifts some probability mass toward non-zero values, particularly in the 10-16 range

**Update 3: Historical resolution patterns**
- Most protest-related SoEs don't reach maximum constitutional duration
- Negotiations typically lead to de-escalation
- This reinforces the probability mass at 0 provinces

**Posterior distribution:**
- Still centered near 0 provinces
- But with meaningful probability mass at higher values (5-16 provinces)
- Right-skewed with some possibility of nationwide coverage (24 provinces) in case of major security incident

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the constitutional timing constraint. Noboa could declare a new SoE right after the current one expires, using different justification.
- I might underestimate the government's determination to maintain emergency powers through the holiday season.
- The situation could dramatically change between now and December (e.g., major terrorist attack, prison break, escalation in violence).

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center on 16 provinces (current number), assuming Noboa extends the current SoE for the full 30 days allowed, reaching January 2, 2026. This would cover December 25.

**Rebuttal:**
This requires Noboa to make an active decision to extend, which depends on conditions in early December. Historical patterns suggest SoEs often end before reaching maximum duration, especially if protests subside.

**Adjustment:**
I'll increase probability mass in the 10-16 range to account for the possibility of extension, while maintaining significant weight at 0.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My prior distribution is based on the recent history of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador. The default state for any given province on any given day is not being under an SoE. Therefore, the prior is strongly centered on 0.

*   **Reference Class:** SoEs in Ecuador from 2019-2025.
*   **Reasoning:** This period covers multiple administrations (Moreno, Lasso, Noboa) and various triggers (protests, crime, pandemic), providing a robust reference for how this political tool is used. SoEs are common but, by constitutional definition, temporary.
*   **Distribution:** My prior is a bimodal distribution with a large probability mass at 0 (perhaps an 80% chance of no SoE on a random day) and a smaller, widely distributed mass for non-zero outcomes, reflecting that when SoEs are declared, they can range from a few provinces to all 24.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation, an SoE declared in response to indigenous-led protests over economic policy, is a classic scenario that has occurred multiple times in the reference period (e.g., 2019, 2022).
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **President Noboa's Strategy:** Unlike predecessors who treated protests primarily as a political issue, President Noboa has framed this as a national security threat, linking protesters to foreign cartels and terrorism. This "mano dura" (iron fist) approach, backed by high approval ratings, makes a negotiated de-escalation less likely and a prolonged security response more likely.
    2.  **The Constitutional Clock:** This is the most critical factor. The SoE declared on October 4, 2025, lasts for 60 days and will expire around December 3, 2025. The resolution date is December 25, 2025. This means the current SoE will have lapsed by default. For the number to be greater than zero, the government must take the active step of either extending the current SoE (for a constitutionally permitted extra 30 days) or declaring a new one.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on evidence pushing the forecast away from the default of 0.

*   **Evidence for Higher Values (Extension/New SoE):**
    *   **Noboa's Hardline Stance:** The government's rhetoric (labeling protests as terrorism, alleging an assassination attempt) significantly raises the political cost of backing down. This makes an extension of the SoE to maintain pressure and project strength highly probable, assuming the underlying conflict is not resolved. This is strong evidence pushing the distribution upwards, making the 16-province outcome much more likely than the base rate would suggest.
    *   **Unresolved Core Conflict:** The dispute over diesel subsidies is a deep-seated issue unlikely to be fully resolved by early December. Lingering tensions provide a clear justification for an extension.
    *   **Ongoing Crime Problem:** The government's separate "internal armed conflict" against gangs provides a persistent, alternative justification for an SoE. Even if the protest-related SoE lapses, a spike in gang violence between Dec 3 and Dec 25 could easily trigger a new, widespread SoE. This creates a secondary pathway to a non-zero outcome.

*   **Evidence for Lower Values (Lapsing SoE):**
    *   **Inertia and the Constitutional Clock:** The strongest evidence for a zero outcome is that the SoE automatically expires. An extension requires a deliberate political act.
    *   **Holiday Season Politics:** There is moderate political and economic pressure to project normalcy and not have large parts of the country under emergency measures during the Christmas holiday period, which could incentivize letting the SoE lapse if the situation has calmed.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** P(0) ≈ 80%, P(>0) ≈ 20%.
*   **Update:** The key question is the probability of extension or a new declaration.
    1.  **Probability of Extension:** Given Noboa's strategy and the unresolved conflict, the likelihood he uses his constitutional option to extend the SoE for another 30 days (which would cover Dec 25) is high. I estimate this probability at ~55-60%. If extended, the number of provinces would most likely remain 16.
    2.  **Probability of Lapsing:** This leaves a ~40-45% chance the SoE lapses on Dec 3.
    3.  **Probability of a New SoE:** Conditional on the protest SoE lapsing, there is still a chance a new one is declared due to the ongoing crime wave. I estimate this at ~15%. This creates a P(lapses) * P(new) = 45% * 15% ≈ 7% chance of a non-zero outcome unrelated to the current SoE.
*   **Posterior Shape:** My posterior is no longer smooth. It is a "clumpy" distribution.
    *   There is a significant probability mass at **0** (SoE lapses and no new one is declared): ~35-40%.
    *   There is a very large probability mass at **16** (the current SoE is extended): ~50-55%.
    *   There is a smaller probability smeared across other values, representing a partial extension (e.g., 5-10 provinces) or a new crime-related SoE (which could be anywhere from a few to 24 provinces).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily dependent on the assessment of President Noboa's political calculus. A key vulnerability is underestimating the potential for a negotiated settlement. Indigenous groups like CONAIE are powerful political actors and have successfully forced previous governments to the negotiating table. A sudden breakthrough before December 3 would almost certainly lead to the SoE being lifted, making the outcome 0. I have factored this in by keeping the probability of a zero outcome relatively high at ~35%.

Another risk is being too anchored to the number 16. The government could make a partial extension, covering only the most restive provinces. Or, a severe escalation in either protests or crime could lead to a nationwide SoE (24 provinces). My final percentile distribution accounts for these possibilities by having a range between the lower and median percentiles, and by pushing the 90th percentile above the modal outcome of 16.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution reflects a ~35% chance of the SoE lapsing entirely (outcome 0), a modal outcome of 16 (a full extension), and tail possibilities for partial extensions or a wider, nationwide emergency.

P10: 0
P20: 0
