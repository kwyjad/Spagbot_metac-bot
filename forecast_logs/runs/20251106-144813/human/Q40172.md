### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Presidents of Guinea-Bissau (Post-1994 Multi-party System):** Since the first multi-party elections, no democratically elected president has successfully completed a full term and won re-election. Presidents have been overthrown in coups (Vieira in 1999), assassinated (Vieira in 2009), or have died in office (Sanhá in 2012). José Mário Vaz (2014-2020) is the only one to complete a term, but he lost his re-election bid in the first round.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0% (0 out of 4 elected presidents re-elected).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most specific reference class. Its small size is a limitation, but the consistent pattern of instability is a powerful signal.

2.  **Incumbent Presidents in West African Elections (2010-2024):** In the broader West African region, incumbency is a significant advantage, though not absolute. Many incumbents secure re-election, often in environments with constrained political freedom. However, the region has also seen notable opposition victories and is home to the "coup belt."
    *   **Base Rate:** ~60-70% re-election rate for incumbents who run.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class provides a wider sample but may understate the unique level of political fragility in Guinea-Bissau. It captures regional trends of "executive dominance."

3.  **Incumbents in "Partly Free" Countries with Semi-Presidential Systems:** In systems like Guinea-Bissau's, where power is divided between a president and a prime minister/parliament, conflict is common. Incumbents in "Partly Free" countries often leverage state resources to secure victory, but institutional gridlock can also weaken them.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~50-60%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class accounts for both the institutional structure (semi-presidentialism) and the political environment (partly free). The base rate is lower than for all incumbents due to the inherent potential for conflict and deadlock.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2023-06-04** Legislative elections result in a victory for the opposition coalition PAI-Terra Ranka. ↓ Shows Embaló and his allies lack a popular majority and are electorally vulnerable.
*   **2023-12-01** Clashes between military factions are labeled a "coup attempt" by Embaló. ↑ Provides a pretext for Embaló to take extraordinary measures against his political opponents.
*   **2023-12-04** Embaló dissolves the opposition-led parliament for the second time in his presidency. ↑ A major move to consolidate power, removing the primary legislative check on his authority.
*   **2024-08-13** Analysis indicates growing social polarization and political crisis following the dissolution of parliament. ↓ Heightened instability increases the risk of a coup or social unrest that could remove him from power before the election.
*   **2025-03-03** Embaló threatens an ECOWAS mediation mission, causing it to leave the country. ↑ Demonstrates his willingness to defy regional pressure and control the political process on his own terms.
*   **2025-03-08** Embaló unilaterally sets the election date for November 2025, after postponing from 2024. ↑ Asserting control over the electoral calendar gives him more time to consolidate power and arrange conditions favorable to his victory.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Control of State Institutions:** Embaló's willingness to dissolve parliament, appoint loyalists to key government and judicial posts, and potentially influence the National Electoral Commission (CNE) is the primary driver of his potential success. (Size: Large)
2.  **Military and Security Forces' Loyalty:** Guinea-Bissau's history is dominated by military intervention. The loyalty of the armed forces' leadership is paramount. While he has survived alleged coup attempts, this is a volatile and decisive factor. (Size: Large)
3.  **Opposition Cohesion and Strategy:** The PAI-Terra Ranka coalition has proven it can win elections. Its ability to remain unified, mobilize supporters, and counter Embaló's maneuvers is the main force against his re-election. (Size: Large)
4.  **International and Regional Pressure:** ECOWAS, the African Union, and other partners can exert diplomatic and economic pressure for a free and fair election. However, Embaló's recent defiance of an ECOWAS mission suggests the impact may be limited. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Voter Turnout and Public Sentiment:** Despite institutional control, widespread public discontent over economic conditions or political repression could lead to protest or a surprise electoral outcome if the vote is reasonably fair. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Historical Failure:** The 0% re-election rate in Guinea-Bissau is a stark contrast to the general incumbency advantage seen elsewhere. Embaló is attempting something no predecessor has achieved.
*   **Aggressive Institutional Dismantling:** While many incumbents bend rules, Embaló's repeated dissolution of an opposition-controlled parliament is an unusually aggressive and overt move to eliminate checks on his power ahead of an election.
*   **Proven Electoral Vulnerability:** Unlike many strongmen who face fragmented opposition, Embaló was defeated in the 2023 legislative elections. This provides a clear and recent signal of his lack of a popular mandate, creating a direct conflict between his actions and the expressed will of the electorate.
*   **Dual Role with ECOWAS:** Embaló's recent chairmanship of ECOWAS (ending in 2023) gave him a regional platform, but his subsequent defiance of the organization creates a uniquely confrontational dynamic with the primary regional arbiter of democratic norms.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior, perhaps 15%, based on the Guinea-Bissau-specific reference class (0% success rate) but slightly anchored up by broader regional incumbency advantage. Equivalent n is low (e.g., n=5) due to the small sample of historical elections.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ **Large:** Repeated dissolution of parliament and consolidation of executive power.
    *   ↓ **Moderate:** Demonstrated electoral weakness in the 2023 legislative elections.
    *   ↑ **Moderate:** Successful postponement of the election, buying time to further consolidate.
    *   ↑ **Small:** Defiance of regional pressure from ECOWAS, signaling resolve and autonomy.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests Embaló is creating conditions where a fair election is unlikely. The updates pointing to his consolidation of power should significantly outweigh his demonstrated electoral weakness. The posterior should move substantially upward from the very low prior, perhaps into the 40-60% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Embaló's re-election):**
    *   Appointment of loyalists to head the National Electoral Commission (CNE) or Supreme Court.
    *   Arrest or disqualification of key opposition leaders (e.g., Domingos Simões Pereira).
    *   Public declarations of loyalty from the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.
    *   Fracturing of the main PAI-Terra Ranka opposition coalition.
    *   Amendments to electoral law that favor the incumbent.
*   **DOWN indicators (disfavoring Embaló's re-election):**
    *   Large-scale, sustained public protests against his rule or electoral process.
    *   Credible reports of dissent or factionalism within the senior military ranks.
    *   Imposition of targeted sanctions by ECOWAS, the EU, or the US.
    *   The opposition remains unified and successfully registers a single, popular candidate.
    *   Supreme Court rulings that push back against Embaló's decrees.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Non-Election Resolution:** The question resolves on an election *win*. A military coup before the election, either for or against Embaló, would make the question moot or resolve it in an unexpected way.
*   **Defining "Win":** The resolution criteria cite "official results or credible sources." Given Embaló's actions, the official results may be heavily manipulated and not recognized by the opposition or international observers, creating ambiguity.
*   **Information Scarcity:** Reliable, on-the-ground information from Guinea-Bissau is limited. Reporting is often filtered through international news agencies or think tanks, with potential for delays or biases.
*   **The "Coup-Proofing" Paradox:** Embaló's actions to consolidate power and control the security forces may be interpreted as "coup-proofing," but they can also alienate factions within the military and increase the very risk he is trying to mitigate.
*   **External Shocks:** As a small, fragile state, Guinea-Bissau is sensitive to regional instability (e.g., events in neighboring Senegal or Guinea) which could spill over and alter the political calculus.

**Final Research Summary:**
Embaló is attempting to defy Guinea-Bissau's perfect record of presidential re-election failure. His aggressive dismantling of democratic checks and control over the state apparatus significantly boosts his chances of engineering a win, likely overriding his demonstrated lack of a popular majority.

To forecast the probability of Umaro Sissoco Embaló being re-elected as president of Guinea-Bissau in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most specific reference class is the history of presidential re-elections in Guinea-Bissau since the multi-party system was established. No president has been re-elected, giving a base rate of 0%. However, considering the broader West African context where incumbents often have a re-election advantage, we adjust this slightly upwards. A reasonable prior probability might be around 15%, reflecting the unique instability in Guinea-Bissau but acknowledging some regional incumbency advantage.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** Embaló, like past presidents, faces significant political instability and opposition. The historical pattern of no re-elections is a strong similarity.
   - **Differences:** Embaló has taken aggressive steps to consolidate power, such as dissolving parliament and defying regional bodies like ECOWAS, which could increase his chances compared to past presidents.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Evidence of Power Consolidation:** Embaló's actions to dissolve parliament and control the electoral process increase the likelihood of his re-election (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This evidence strongly increases the probability.
   - **Electoral Vulnerability:** The opposition's victory in the 2023 legislative elections suggests electoral weakness (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)). This evidence decreases the probability.
   - **Defiance of ECOWAS:** His willingness to defy regional pressure suggests a strong grip on power (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)). This evidence slightly increases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 15% probability translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong evidence of power consolidation and moderate evidence of electoral vulnerability, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1.
   - **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.176 × (a factor > 1, say 3 due to strong consolidation evidence) = 0.528.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 0.528 / (1 + 0.528) ≈ 34.5%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The historical 0% re-election rate is a strong counterbalance to the evidence of consolidation. The possibility of a coup or significant opposition mobilization remains a risk.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A successful opposition strategy or international intervention could drastically change the outcome. The forecast should account for these tail risks.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the aggressive consolidation of power by Embaló and the historical context, the probability of re-election is adjusted upwards from the base rate but remains uncertain due to potential instability and opposition strength.

Final: 35%

# Will Umaro Sissoco Embaló be re-elected president of Guinea-Bissau in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I need to select an appropriate base rate for presidential re-election in Guinea-Bissau's context.

Looking at the most relevant reference classes:

1. **Guinea-Bissau-specific presidential re-elections**: Since multi-party elections began in 1994, no democratically elected president has been re-elected. 0 out of 4 elected presidents have won re-election.

2. **West African incumbents**: In the broader region, incumbents have roughly a 60-70% re-election rate, though this varies significantly by country.

3. **Partly free countries with semi-presidential systems**: These have approximately a 50-60% re-election rate.

Given Guinea-Bissau's specific history, I'll weight the country-specific reference class most heavily, while acknowledging the regional patterns. The country's unique instability makes the 0% historical re-election rate particularly relevant, but I'll adjust slightly upward given the broader regional context.

**Prior probability**: 20%
- This reflects the country's perfect record of failed re-elections (0%) but adjusts slightly upward to account for regional incumbency advantages and Embaló's apparent consolidation of power.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Guinea-Bissau remains politically unstable with a history of coups and military intervention
- The country continues to operate as a "partly free" semi-presidential system
- Economic challenges and corruption persist as significant issues
- Regional dynamics and international pressure remain important factors

**Key differences**:
- Embaló has taken unprecedented steps to consolidate power by dissolving parliament twice
- He has demonstrated willingness to defy regional bodies like ECOWAS
- He has unilaterally postponed elections, giving himself more time to strengthen his position
- He survived what he claimed was a coup attempt in December 2023, potentially eliminating rivals

These differences suggest Embaló has created conditions more favorable to re-election than his predecessors by systematically dismantling democratic checks and balances.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Dissolution of opposition-led parliament (December 2023)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~90%) - If Embaló will win re-election, dissolving the opposition-led parliament is a logical step to consolidate power
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~40%) - Even if he will lose, this could be an attempt to improve his chances
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- Direction: Increases probability of re-election

**Evidence 2: Opposition coalition PAI-Terra Ranka won 2023 legislative elections**
- P(E|H): Low (~30%) - If Embaló will win re-election, we would expect his allies to perform better
- P(E|~H): High (~80%) - If he will lose, opposition electoral strength is expected
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38
- Direction: Decreases probability of re-election

**Evidence 3: Unilateral postponement of elections to November 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~95%) - If he will win, buying more time to consolidate power is strategic
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~50%) - Even if he will lose, postponement could be an attempt to improve odds
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- Direction: Increases probability of re-election

**Evidence 4: Defiance of ECOWAS mediation mission (March 2025)**
- P(E|H): High (~80%) - If he will win, rejecting external oversight helps maintain control
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~40%) - If he will lose, this could be desperation or miscalculation
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
- Direction: Increases probability of re-election

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), I'll update based on the key evidence:

**Update on parliament dissolution**:
- Prior odds: 1:4 (0.2:0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 2.25:4 = 0.56:1
- Posterior probability: 0.56/(1+0.56) ≈ 36%

**Update on opposition electoral strength**:
- Prior odds: 0.56:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.38
- Posterior odds: 0.21:1
- Posterior probability: 0.21/(1+0.21) ≈ 17%

**Update on election postponement**:
- Prior odds: 0.21:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.9
- Posterior odds: 0.4:1
- Posterior probability: 0.4/(1+0.4) ≈ 29%

**Update on ECOWAS defiance**:
- Prior odds: 0.4:1
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.8:1
- Posterior probability: 0.8/(1+0.8) ≈ 44%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 44%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overestimating the effectiveness of Embaló's authoritarian moves. Guinea-Bissau has a strong history of military intervention that can override even well-consolidated power.
- I might be underestimating the strength of opposition unity and popular discontent, which could manifest in mass protests or military defections.
- The analysis assumes elections will actually occur, but Guinea-Bissau's history suggests a coup or other disruption before November 2025 is quite possible.

**Alternative forecast**:
A plausible alternative forecast would be much lower (~20%) based on:
- Guinea-Bissau's perfect record of failed re-elections
- The demonstrated electoral weakness in 2023 legislative elections
- The possibility that Embaló's aggressive moves backfire by unifying opposition
- Potential for military intervention before elections occur

**Rebuttal to alternative**:
The alternative underestimates how effectively Embaló has dismantled democratic guardrails. Unlike his predecessors, he has:
- Survived coup attempts
- Successfully defied regional pressure
- Demonstrated willingness to use extraordinary measures
- Gained time through postponement to further consolidate power

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to 40% to account for the historical pattern and inherent instability in Guinea-Bissau.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering Guinea-Bissau's history of failed presidential re-elections, but also accounting for Embaló's unprecedented consolidation of power through parliament dissolution, election postponement, and defiance of regional bodies, I forecast a 40% probability of his re-election.

This reflects both the historical headwinds against re-election in Guinea-Bissau and the significant but not decisive advantages Embaló has created for himself through authoritarian measures.

Final: 40%

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast using Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will consider three reference classes:

1.  **Presidents of Guinea-Bissau (Post-1994):** This is the most specific reference class. Since the introduction of multi-party elections, no democratically elected president has ever been re-elected. They have been removed by coups, assassinated, died in office, or lost their re-election bid. This yields a stark base rate of 0% (0 out of 4).
2.  **Incumbent Presidents in West Africa:** In the broader region, incumbency is a powerful advantage, with a re-election rate of roughly 60-70% for those who run. This class is much larger but less specific to Guinea-Bissau's unique political fragility.
3.  **Incumbents in "Partly Free" Semi-Presidential Systems:** This class captures both the institutional structure (prone to conflict between president and parliament) and the political environment. The re-election rate here is around 50-60%, lower than for all incumbents due to the potential for gridlock and instability.

The 0% local history is a powerful signal of deep-seated structural instability. A 0% prior is unworkable, but it indicates the starting point should be very low. I will anchor on this local history while acknowledging the general power of incumbency.

I will set the **prior probability (P(H)) at 15%**. This reflects the overwhelming historical precedent against re-election in Guinea-Bissau, while allowing for the possibility that an incumbent could break the pattern. This is equivalent to prior odds of roughly 1-to-6 against.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case of past Guinea-Bissau presidencies in that Embaló faces a powerful military, significant political opposition (which won the 2023 legislative elections), and operates within a system historically prone to instability.

However, it is different in one crucial respect: Embaló's response to these challenges has been exceptionally aggressive. His repeated dissolution of the opposition-led parliament is a more overt and forceful move to dismantle democratic checks and balances than his predecessors attempted. He is not merely navigating the unstable system; he is actively trying to break it and reshape it in his favor, making his attempt to retain power different from previous failed bids.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate two main clusters of evidence:

*   **Evidence 1: Aggressive Consolidation of Power.** This includes dissolving parliament twice, postponing the election to November 2025, and openly defying a mediation mission from the regional body ECOWAS.
    *   **P(E1 | H):** If Embaló is to be re-elected (H), it is highly probable he would need to take these authoritarian measures to sideline a popular opposition and control the electoral process. These actions are instrumental to his success.
    *   **P(E1 | ~H):** If Embaló is not re-elected (~H), it's possible these actions would have backfired, triggering a successful coup or popular uprising. However, a leader who expects to lose a fair election is the most likely to attempt such a power grab.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H) / P(E1|~H)):** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly **increases** the probability of re-election, as it shows both intent and capability to create a non-competitive electoral environment.

*   **Evidence 2: Demonstrated Electoral Weakness.** The opposition coalition, PAI-Terra Ranka, won the June 2023 legislative elections, showing that Embaló and his allies lack a popular majority.
    *   **P(E2 | H):** If Embaló is to be re-elected, it is somewhat surprising that he would have just suffered a clear electoral defeat. This indicates he must win against the popular will.
    *   **P(E2 | ~H):** If Embaló is not re-elected, his demonstrated lack of popular support is the most likely reason. This evidence is highly consistent with a failure to be re-elected.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E2|H) / P(E2|~H)):** Less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability of re-election.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior odds of 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176.

The evidence of authoritarian consolidation (E1) is more causally significant for the outcome of a manipulated election than his underlying popularity (E2). His actions are a direct attempt to make his unpopularity irrelevant. Therefore, the net effect of the evidence is strongly positive. Let's estimate a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 4 for the net effect of all evidence (his power grab is a very strong signal, while his unpopularity is a weaker one in this context).

*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
*   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.176 × 4 = 0.704
*   **Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)**
*   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.704 / 1.704 ≈ 41.3%

This update moves the probability from a very low 15% to a much more substantial ~41%. This reflects that his actions have fundamentally changed his chances, but his re-election remains an uphill battle against historical and structural forces.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too low if I am overweighting the historical base rate. Embaló's actions are precisely the playbook an autocrat uses to succeed where others have failed. If he has effectively "coup-proofed" the military and neutralized the opposition, his re-election might be a near certainty, suggesting a probability closer to 60-70%.

Conversely, my forecast could be too high. The "coup-proofing paradox" suggests that his aggressive consolidation might be the very thing that provokes a military intervention, which is the most common form of political change in Guinea-Bissau. The country's political system has a historical tendency to "reject" any leader who accumulates too much power. This would argue for a probability below 40%.

The key uncertainty is the loyalty and cohesion of the military, which is difficult to assess from the outside. Given that a coup remains a highly plausible path to his removal before the election, keeping the forecast below 50% is prudent. The current forecast of ~41% acknowledges that his authoritarian project is advancing but faces a very real risk of catastrophic failure, consistent with the country's history.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a president being re-elected in Guinea-Bissau is effectively zero, suggesting a very low prior probability. However, President Embaló is taking aggressive, authoritarian steps—dissolving parliament, controlling the electoral calendar, and defying regional mediators—that significantly increase his chances of engineering a victory, unlike his predecessors. This strong positive evidence must be weighed against his demonstrated lack of popular support and the country's extreme propensity for coups, which his actions may provoke. The result is a situation where his re-election is a very real possibility but remains less likely than not due to the profound and persistent political instability.

Final: 41%
