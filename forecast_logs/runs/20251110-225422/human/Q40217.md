### Reference class & base rates
-   **Long-Term Historical Average (1997-Present):** The mean value for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS is approximately 5.25% (525 bps). This period includes multiple credit cycles, including major blowouts in 2002, 2008, and 2020. This serves as a broad, all-encompassing base rate but may be less relevant given structural market changes.
-   **Non-Recessionary Periods (Post-GFC, excluding 2020):** In periods of stable economic expansion (e.g., 2012-2014, 2017-2018, 2021-2023), the spread has typically traded in a range of 3.25% to 4.75%. This class is more representative of the current economic regime (assuming no imminent recession) and suggests a base rate centered around 4.00%.
-   **Late-Cycle Tightening (e.g., 2006-2007, 2018-2019):** In the later stages of an economic cycle, spreads often reach cyclical lows before beginning a gradual widening trend as growth slows and risks accumulate. This reference class would suggest a base rate starting from a low point (e.g., 2.50-3.50%) and exhibiting a tendency to drift higher. The current value of 3.13% fits squarely in the early phase of this class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Today is 2025-11-10. The horizon is <3 months, so we focus on the last 6 months.*
-   **[2025-11-06]** Latest daily value for the OAS was reported at 3.13%. (→) — Establishes the current baseline for the forecast period. It is historically tight but has been stable.
-   **[2025-10-22]** Q3 corporate earnings season largely concluded, showing resilient revenues but signs of margin compression, particularly in cyclical sectors. (↑) — Rising input costs and slowing demand could signal future credit stress, pushing spreads wider.
-   **[2025-09-17]** The Federal Reserve held rates steady but released a statement with a slightly more hawkish tone, emphasizing data-dependency and pushing back on market expectations for early 2026 rate cuts. (↑) — Higher-for-longer rates increase refinancing costs for high-yield issuers, a key risk factor.
-   **[2025-08-08]** July jobs report showed continued moderation in payroll growth but wage growth remained firm, complicating the inflation picture for the Fed. (→) — A mixed signal, suggesting an economy that is slowing but not collapsing, providing little new direction for spreads.
-   **[2025-07-25]** Q2 2025 GDP was revised slightly higher, confirming a resilient economic backdrop through the first half of the year. (↓) — Stronger growth reduces near-term default risk, supporting tighter credit spreads.
-   **[2025-06-30]** T. Rowe Price and Lord Abbett research highlighted the historically high credit quality of the HY index, with a large share of BB-rated debt. (↓) — This structural factor suggests the market is more resilient to shocks than in past cycles.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Economic Growth Expectations:** Stronger GDP and employment data reduce default risk and tighten spreads. Conversely, signs of a slowdown or recession cause significant widening. (Large impact)
-   **Corporate Default Rate:** The primary driver. Spreads are a forward-looking measure of compensation for default risk. Rising actual or expected defaults lead directly to wider spreads. (Large impact)
-   **Investor Risk Appetite:** Broader market sentiment (e.g., VIX index, fund flows) dictates demand for risky assets. A "risk-on" environment compresses spreads, while "risk-off" events cause them to gap out. (Moderate-to-Large impact)
-   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** Changes in the federal funds rate and forward guidance affect corporate borrowing costs. A pivot to easing is supportive (tightens spreads), while a hawkish stance is a headwind (widens spreads). (Moderate impact)
-   **Market Technicals (Supply/Demand):** Heavy new issuance can temporarily widen spreads, while strong investor demand (e.g., inflows into HY funds) can tighten them. The attractive "all-in" yield can be a key demand driver. (Small-to-Moderate impact)
-   **Structural Credit Quality:** The composition of the index (e.g., percentage of BB vs. CCC-rated bonds) determines its inherent riskiness. A higher-quality index can sustain tighter spreads for a given economic outlook. (Slow-moving, but large structural impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Historically High Credit Quality:** Unlike previous cycles (e.g., 2007), the HY index now has a near-record concentration of higher-quality BB-rated issuers. This provides a fundamental cushion and suggests historical base rates (especially the long-term average) may be too high.
-   **Elevated "All-in" Yields:** While spreads are tight, the absolute yield on the index (~7.5% per AXA) remains attractive relative to the last decade due to higher base Treasury rates. This continues to draw in capital, providing support for current valuations.
-   **Compressed Starting Point:** The current spread of 3.13% is significantly below the long-term average of 5.25% and even below the non-recessionary average of ~4.00%. This limits the potential for further tightening and creates an asymmetric risk profile skewed towards widening.
-   **Post-Election Policy Uncertainty:** The forecast period falls shortly after a presidential election. The transition to a new administration (per Janus Henderson source) could introduce policy uncertainty (e.g., regarding trade, regulation, fiscal policy) that is not typical of a standard late-cycle environment, potentially increasing volatility.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior centered on the "Late-Cycle Tightening" reference class seems most appropriate. Suggest a log-normal distribution with a median around 3.60% (360 bps), reflecting a modest drift up from the current tight levels but well below the long-term average. Assign a moderate strength (equivalent n=10) to this prior.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The structural shift to higher credit quality in the index argues for a sustained lower-spread regime than historical averages would suggest.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Resilient economic data and corporate performance through H1/Q3 2025 have justified the current tight valuations and suppressed default risk.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The very low starting point of 3.13% offers little room for further compression and creates an asymmetric risk of widening on any negative news.
    -   (↑ Moderate) A hawkish Fed stance and post-election policy uncertainty are credible catalysts for a modest risk-off move and spread widening into year-end.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. Strong fundamentals and market structure are a powerful anchor, but valuations are tight and macro/political risks are tilted to the upside. The net effect suggests a small upward revision from the current 3.13% level, moving the posterior slightly closer to the prior median of 3.60%. The update should reflect a high probability of staying within a tight range (e.g., 3.00-3.75%) but with a fatter tail to the upside.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    -   Weekly jobless claims trending above 250k.
    -   VIX index sustaining a move above 20.
    -   Negative pre-announcements for Q4 earnings, especially from bellwether industrial or consumer discretionary companies.
    -   Hawkish commentary from Fed officials pushing back against rate cut expectations.
    -   Specific policy proposals from the new administration perceived as disruptive to markets.
-   **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten):**
    -   October/November inflation data (CPI/PCE) coming in significantly below expectations.
    -   Stronger-than-expected "soft data" like ISM Manufacturing/Services PMI.
    -   A dovish pivot in Fed communications.
    -   A surge of inflows into high-yield bond funds.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Non-Linearity:** Credit spreads are prone to "gapping" rather than moving smoothly. A sudden risk event can cause a sharp widening that fundamentals alone would not predict.
-   **Year-End Liquidity:** The forecast period (late Nov/early Dec) can experience reduced market liquidity, which can exaggerate price movements on relatively small news or flows.
-   **Structural vs. Cyclical:** Over-reliance on the "higher quality" structural argument could blindside forecasters if a sharp cyclical downturn materializes, as even BB-rated bonds suffer in a deep recession.
-   **Data Lag:** Macroeconomic data (GDP, earnings) is backward-looking. The market will trade on forward-looking expectations, which can shift rapidly.
-   **Geopolitical Wildcards:** Unforeseen geopolitical events remain a constant, unmodellable risk that could trigger a flight to safety and a spike in spreads.

**Final Research Summary:**
The high-yield spread is caught between strong fundamental support (resilient economy, high-quality index) and tight valuations facing headwinds from a hawkish Fed and post-election uncertainty. A small drift wider from the current 3.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the biweekly period of November 24 - December 5, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this forecast is the "Late-Cycle Tightening" reference class, given the current economic context and market conditions. This class suggests a base rate starting from a low point (e.g., 2.50-3.50%) and exhibiting a tendency to drift higher. The current value of 3.13% fits within this class.
   - The mean/median of this base rate is approximately 3.60%, with a moderate variance reflecting the potential for both tightening and widening.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current spread of 3.13% is consistent with the late-cycle tightening phase, where spreads are historically low but expected to widen as risks accumulate.
   - Differences: The structural shift to higher credit quality in the index and the resilient economic data suggest that the base rate might be slightly lower than historical late-cycle averages.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Resilient Economic Data (↓ Moderate):** Supports tighter spreads due to reduced default risk.
   - **High Credit Quality (↓ Large):** Suggests a sustained lower-spread regime.
   - **Hawkish Fed Stance (↑ Moderate):** Increases the likelihood of spread widening due to higher refinancing costs.
   - **Post-Election Uncertainty (↑ Moderate):** Could lead to increased volatility and wider spreads.
   - **Current Tight Valuations (↑ Moderate):** Limited room for further compression, skewing risk towards widening.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 3.60%, the evidence suggests a slight upward adjustment due to macroeconomic and policy risks. The posterior distribution is thus slightly skewed towards higher spreads, with a mean closer to 3.40-3.50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast should account for potential non-linear movements in spreads due to unforeseen events.
   - Alternative Scenario: A dovish Fed pivot or unexpectedly strong economic data could tighten spreads further, but this is less likely given current evidence.
   - Adjustments: Consider a wider range to account for tail risks and potential volatility.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS are as follows:

P10: 3.20
P20: 3.25
P40: 3.35
P60: 3.45
P80: 3.60
P90: 3.75

# Forecasting the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the "Late-Cycle Tightening" reference class, which appears most appropriate given current conditions. This reference class suggests a base rate centered around 3.50%, reflecting periods like 2006-2007 and 2018-2019 when spreads were at cyclical lows but beginning to drift higher as economic cycles matured.

The current value as of November 10, 2025, is 3.13%, which is historically tight and fits the early phase of this reference class. I'll model my prior as a log-normal distribution with a median of 3.50% and a moderate variance to reflect uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We appear to be in a late-cycle economic environment with relatively tight spreads
- The Federal Reserve is maintaining a somewhat hawkish stance
- Corporate earnings show some signs of margin compression, typical of late cycles

**Differences from base case:**
- The current HY index has historically high credit quality with a large share of BB-rated debt
- The absolute "all-in" yield (~7.5%) remains attractive due to higher Treasury rates
- The forecast period falls shortly after a presidential election, introducing policy uncertainty
- The starting point (3.13%) is extremely tight by historical standards

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for tighter spreads:**
- Structural shift to higher credit quality in the index (strong downward pressure, ~0.7x likelihood ratio)
- Resilient economic data through H1/Q3 2025 (moderate downward pressure, ~0.8x)
- Attractive "all-in" yields driving continued demand (mild downward pressure, ~0.9x)

**Evidence for wider spreads:**
- Very low starting point of 3.13% creates asymmetric risk (moderate upward pressure, ~1.2x)
- Signs of margin compression in Q3 earnings (mild upward pressure, ~1.1x)
- Hawkish Fed stance pushing back on rate cut expectations (moderate upward pressure, ~1.2x)
- Post-election policy uncertainty (moderate upward pressure, ~1.2x)
- Reduced year-end liquidity in late Nov/early Dec (mild upward pressure, ~1.1x)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 3.50%, I'll update based on the evidence:

First update (structural factors):
- Higher credit quality and resilient economy (combined likelihood ratio ~0.6x for higher values)
- This shifts my distribution downward, with a new median around 3.30%

Second update (current risks):
- Low starting point, Fed hawkishness, post-election uncertainty (combined likelihood ratio ~1.5x for higher values)
- This shifts my distribution back upward, with a new median around 3.45%

The posterior distribution is now centered slightly above the current value of 3.13%, but below my initial prior of 3.50%. It has a right-skewed shape, reflecting greater upside risk than downside potential.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk of a sudden economic deterioration that could cause spreads to gap significantly wider
- I could be overweighting the structural "higher quality" argument, which might not hold in a true risk-off environment
- Year-end positioning and liquidity effects might be stronger than anticipated
- Geopolitical risks remain an unmodeled wildcard that could trigger flight-to-safety

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 4.00%, arguing that the extremely tight starting point is unsustainable and that post-election uncertainty will drive a more significant risk repricing. This view would emphasize that spreads rarely stay this tight for extended periods.

**Rebuttal:**
While valid, this alternative view may overstate the speed of spread widening in the absence of a clear catalyst. The structural improvements in the high-yield market and continued investor demand for yield should provide meaningful support.

I'll adjust my distribution to have slightly fatter tails, particularly on the upside, to account for these considerations.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.05%
P20: 3.20%
P40: 3.40%
P60: 3.60%
P80: 3.90%
P90: 4.25%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The forecast horizon is very short (from November 10, 2025, to the period ending December 5, 2025). For such short-term financial time series forecasting, the most appropriate prior is a "random walk" model centered on the most recent observation.

*   **Reference Distribution**: A normal distribution centered on the last known value of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS, which is 3.13%.
*   **Rationale**: Financial markets exhibit high serial correlation, meaning today's value is the best predictor of tomorrow's value. Over a few weeks, the price is more likely to diffuse from its current spot than to mean-revert to a long-term historical average.
*   **Mean/Median**: 3.13%.
*   **Spread**: The spread should reflect typical volatility over a one-month period. Based on historical daily data, the standard deviation of the change over approximately 20 trading days is roughly 0.16 percentage points (16 bps). This forms the initial estimate of the distribution's spread.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case is a simple random walk from the current value. The current situation differs in ways that suggest modifying this simple prior.

*   **Similarities**: The economy is in a state of stable, moderate growth, which is consistent with the low-volatility environment that supports a random walk model.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Asymmetric Starting Point**: The current spread of 3.13% is historically low. This creates an asymmetric risk profile; there is more room for spreads to widen (increase) in a negative scenario than to tighten (decrease) in a positive one. The practical floor for spreads is much closer than the potential ceiling during a risk-off event.
    *   **Known Event Risk**: The forecast period immediately follows a U.S. presidential election. The research report explicitly flags "Post-Election Policy Uncertainty" as a risk factor. This is a known source of potential volatility not captured by a simple historical volatility measure.
    *   **Year-End Dynamics**: The period in late November/early December can be characterized by lower market liquidity, which can amplify price movements.

These differences suggest the prior should be adjusted to have a positive (upward) skew and slightly fatter tails than a standard normal distribution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the research report to determine the likely direction and magnitude of the shift from the prior.

*   **Anchor Evidence (supporting tight spreads)**:
    *   **High Index Credit Quality**: The large share of higher-rated BB bonds provides a structural cushion against shocks. This makes a sudden, dramatic blowout less likely and supports sustained tight spreads. (Likelihood: Dampens the probability of very high outcomes).
    *   **Attractive "All-in" Yields**: Higher base rates mean the total yield is attractive to investors, creating steady demand for high-yield bonds. (Likelihood: Supports outcomes at or near the current level).

*   **Upward Pressure Evidence (supporting wider spreads)**:
    *   **Hawkish Fed Stance**: The Fed's pushback against expectations for rate cuts increases refinancing costs and is a headwind for corporate credit. (Likelihood: Makes outcomes > 3.13% more likely than outcomes < 3.13%).
    *   **Margin Compression**: Q3 earnings showed signs of compressing margins, a potential leading indicator of future credit stress. (Likelihood: Small upward push).
    *   **Post-Election Uncertainty**: Policy uncertainty is a classic driver of risk aversion, which leads to wider credit spreads. This is the most significant short-term catalyst. (Likelihood: Increases the probability of higher outcomes and widens the entire distribution).

The net effect of the evidence points towards a modest upward drift. The powerful structural anchors are likely to prevent a dramatic widening, but the short-term macro and political risks make a move higher more probable than a move lower.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   **Prior**: Centered at 3.13%, standard deviation ~0.16.
*   **Likelihood Adjustment**: The evidence collectively suggests a shift. The hawkish Fed and election uncertainty push the center of the distribution higher.
*   **Update Step**: I will shift the median of my distribution up from the current 3.13%. A small nudge of +0.10% to a median of 3.23% seems appropriate, reflecting a slight upward drift driven by the identified risks. This is a conservative adjustment, in line with the calibration guidance.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The distribution's variance should be increased to reflect the election and year-end liquidity risks. I'll increase the effective standard deviation from ~0.16 to ~0.20. Crucially, I will incorporate a positive skew, meaning the tail on the upside is longer and fatter than the tail on the downside. A move to 3.75% is more plausible than a move to 2.50%.

My final posterior distribution has a median around 3.23% and is skewed to the right (positively skewed).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overconfidence Check**: Am I too confident in a small upward drift? What if the election result is seen as unequivocally positive for markets, leading to a "risk-on" rally? Spreads could tighten towards the cycle lows of ~2.80%. My P10 at 2.98% accounts for a modest rally but perhaps underweights a true melt-up.
*   **Blind Spots (Tail Risks)**: Conversely, am I underestimating the tail risk on the upside? A "gap out" event, where spreads jump 50-100 bps on a major negative surprise (e.g., a chaotic political transition, a sudden geopolitical event), is always possible. My initial P90 was 3.65%, which might be too low for a true shock.
*   **Adjustment**: I will widen the tails of my distribution to better account for these alternative scenarios. I will lower the P10 slightly and raise the P80 and P90 more significantly. This increases the skew and better reflects the non-linear nature of credit spreads, where negative shocks tend to have a larger and faster impact than positive news. My final distribution will have a wider P10-P90 range to reflect this heightened uncertainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is based on a distribution centered slightly above the current value of 3.13%, with a positive skew and wider tails to account for post-election and year-end risks.

P10: 2.98
P20: 3.05
P40: 3.18
P60: 3.28
P80: 3.50
P90: 3.75
