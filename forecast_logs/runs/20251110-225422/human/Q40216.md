### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent 10-Year Yield Behavior (2023-2025):** In the post-tightening cycle era, the 10Y yield has exhibited significant volatility, trading in a broad range (roughly 3.5% to 5.0%). The average level has been around 4.2-4.3%. This class is relevant due to the similar macroeconomic regime (high-but-moderating inflation, data-dependent Fed). The base rate from this class suggests a value centered around **4.20%**.
2.  **Short-Term (3-Week) Yield Changes:** Historically, the 10-year yield's change over a three-week period is centered close to zero. The standard deviation of these changes is approximately 20-25 basis points (bps). This implies that, absent major shocks, an 80% confidence interval for the change from the current level (4.11%) would be roughly +/- 30 bps. This suggests a base rate range of **3.80% to 4.40%**.
3.  **Periods of Fed Policy Pause/Pivot:** Following a hiking cycle, periods where the Federal Reserve is on hold but biased toward easing often see yields drift lower as the market prices in future cuts. However, these periods are also punctuated by sharp upward moves on strong economic data. This reference class suggests a slight downward bias from the current level but with high volatility. The base rate is less a single number and more a dynamic of **downward drift with upside volatility**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-10** Current yield at 4.11%. TradingEconomics forecasts 4.06% for end-of-quarter. (↓) — Establishes the current anchor and a near-term analyst expectation for a slight decline.
*   **2025-11-07** Yield reported at 4.11%, noted as below the long-term average of 4.25%. (↔) — Confirms the current level and provides context against a longer-term anchor.
*   **2025-11-06** Yield rose to 4.16% before falling. UBS forecasts a decline to 3.75% by mid-2026. (↓) — Indicates recent volatility but reinforces the medium-term expectation for lower yields driven by Fed cuts.
*   **2025-09-17** FOMC released economic projections. (↔) — These projections are a critical input for the market's view on the Fed's reaction function and the likely path of policy, influencing yields for the subsequent months.
*   **2025-07-09** Bankrate survey from mid-year expected the yield to fall to 4.18% over the next year. (↓) — Shows that the expectation for a modest decline has been consistent among analysts for several months.
*   **2025-06-04** Schwab noted continued volatility due to tariff policies, government debt, and economic uncertainty. (↑/↓) — Highlights persistent non-monetary factors that can create unpredictable swings in the yield.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Federal Reserve Policy Expectations:** The market's perception of the FOMC's next move is the primary driver. Any data or Fedspeak that alters the timing or magnitude of future rate changes will have a large impact.
2.  **Inflation Data (CPI, PCE):** Upcoming inflation reports are the most direct input into Fed policy. A hotter-than-expected print would push yields up significantly; a cooler print would pull them down. Large impact.
3.  **Labor Market Data (Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment):** A key part of the Fed's dual mandate. Signs of a rapidly weakening labor market would accelerate rate cut expectations and lower yields. Moderate-to-large impact.
4.  **Economic Growth Signals (GDP, PMIs):** Broader indicators of economic health. Stronger growth implies a higher neutral rate and less need for Fed easing, pushing yields up. Moderate impact.
5.  **Risk Sentiment & Safe-Haven Flows:** Geopolitical shocks or financial market stress can trigger a "flight to safety," increasing demand for Treasuries and pushing yields down, independent of economic fundamentals. Moderate impact.
6.  **Treasury Auction Demand:** The results of Treasury auctions signal investor appetite for U.S. debt. A poorly received auction can cause a short-term spike in yields. Small-to-moderate impact.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Post-Easing Pause:** The market is operating under the assumption that the Fed has completed its initial easing for 2025 and is now in a data-dependent pause (per iShares). This is a distinct state from a steady-rate or hiking environment, making yields highly sensitive to every data point.
*   **Elevated Policy Uncertainty:** Unlike typical periods, there is explicit concern over non-monetary government policies like tariffs and debt management (per Schwab, HSBC). This adds a risk premium that may keep yields higher than fundamentals alone would suggest.
*   **Divergent Analyst Forecasts:** While the consensus leans toward lower yields (UBS, TradingEconomics), the range of outcomes is wide, with some forecasts as high as 4.25% (RBC) and others as low as 3.5% (HSBC) for year-end. This suggests a lack of strong conviction in the market.
*   **Recent Volatility Spike:** The quick move from 4.16% down to 4.11% in early November suggests the market is nervous and prone to re-pricing risk quickly, which may differ from the average volatility in the base rate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A strong prior centered on the current yield of **4.11%**. The short time horizon means the current price is the most informative signal. Equivalent n should be high, suggesting a distribution like Normal(4.11, 0.15^2).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) **Analyst Consensus:** The majority of provided forecasts (TradingEconomics, UBS, HSBC) point to yields being lower by year-end or mid-2026, creating a gentle downward pressure. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) **Recent Momentum:** The yield has declined by 5 bps in the days leading up to Nov 10, suggesting some immediate downward momentum. (Small)
    *   (↑) **Persistent Uncertainty:** Concerns about government policy and the wide dispersion in forecasts act as a countervailing force, potentially keeping a risk premium embedded in the yield. (Small)
    *   (↔) **Data Dependency:** The Fed's stated pause makes the outcome for the next three weeks highly contingent on the November CPI and jobs reports. This increases the variance of the forecast more than it shifts the mean. (Increases uncertainty)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides a slight downward tilt to the prior. The posterior mean should be adjusted slightly lower than 4.11%, perhaps in the **4.05% - 4.10%** range, while acknowledging that the variance around this mean is significant due to event risk.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   November CPI or PCE inflation data coming in above consensus expectations.
    *   A strong November jobs report (high payrolls, low unemployment, high wage growth).
    *   Hawkish commentary from key FOMC members (e.g., emphasizing inflation risks).
    *   A poorly subscribed 10-year Treasury auction before or during the resolution period.
    *   De-escalation of any ongoing geopolitical conflicts, reducing safe-haven demand.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Softer-than-expected November inflation and labor market data.
    *   Dovish Fedspeak hinting that the bar for further cuts is low.
    *   A significant risk-off event in equity markets or geopolitics, triggering a flight to safety.
    *   Weak ISM PMI or retail sales figures suggesting a slowing economy.
    *   Strong demand at Treasury auctions.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Event Risk:** The forecast horizon is very short and spans a period likely to include major data releases (e.g., November jobs report, CPI). A single surprise can move the yield by 10-20 bps, dominating all other factors.
*   **Hypothetical Sources:** This analysis is based on a curated set of hypothetical sources. The actual information environment in November 2025 could be substantially different.
*   **Year-End Effects:** Trading liquidity can decrease in December, potentially leading to exaggerated price movements on lower volumes or news flow.
*   **Data Revisions:** The final FRED value is subject to revision, although this is rare for the DGS10 series.
*   **Non-Fundamental Drivers:** The yield can be moved by technical factors, large trades, or shifts in global capital flows that are difficult to predict from macroeconomic data alone.

### Final Research Summary
The current 10-year yield of 4.11% serves as a strong anchor for this short-term forecast. The balance of analyst expectations and recent momentum suggests a slight downward drift, but this is highly contingent on key economic data releases for November, which could easily push the yield in either direction.

To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025, I'll follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the 10Y yield is centered around 4.20%, based on recent behavior from 2023-2025. This period reflects a similar macroeconomic environment with high-but-moderating inflation and a data-dependent Fed. The variance for short-term changes is approximately 20-25 bps, suggesting a base range of 3.80% to 4.40%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current yield of 4.11% is slightly below the recent average, indicating a downward drift. However, the market is in a post-easing pause with high sensitivity to data, which could lead to volatility.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Analyst Consensus (↓):** Forecasts from TradingEconomics and UBS suggest a slight decline, reinforcing a downward bias.
   - **Recent Momentum (↓):** The yield has decreased slightly, indicating short-term downward momentum.
   - **Persistent Uncertainty (↑):** Concerns about government policy and forecast dispersion add a risk premium, potentially keeping yields higher.
   - **Data Dependency (↔):** Upcoming economic data releases increase forecast variance, as they could shift the yield significantly.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 4.11%, the evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment. The posterior mean is adjusted to around 4.05% - 4.10%, with increased variance due to potential data-driven volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as unexpected inflation data or geopolitical events, suggests maintaining a wider distribution. An alternative forecast could emphasize the risk of a sudden upward spike due to strong economic data or poor Treasury auction results. However, the consistent analyst expectation for a decline supports the current downward bias.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and potential for volatility, the final percentiles reflect a slightly lower mean with a wide spread to account for uncertainty:

P10: 3.85  
P20: 3.95  
P40: 4.05  
P60: 4.15  
P80: 4.25  
P90: 4.35

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use multiple reference points:

1. **Current yield (4.11%)**: This is the most recent anchor point as of November 10, 2025.
2. **Recent trading range (3.5% to 5.0%)**: The post-tightening cycle range with mean around 4.2-4.3%.
3. **Short-term yield changes**: Historical 3-week changes have standard deviation of 20-25 basis points.

Given the short forecast horizon (2-3 weeks ahead), I'll center my prior on the current yield of 4.11% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.25%, reflecting the typical volatility over similar timeframes. This gives a prior distribution of approximately Normal(4.11, 0.25²).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- We're in a post-tightening cycle environment with the Fed on pause
- Market remains data-dependent and reactive to economic indicators
- Yield is currently near the middle of its recent trading range

**Differences from reference distribution:**
- The period (Nov 24 - Dec 5) falls during a potentially lower-liquidity period approaching year-end
- The forecast period will likely include the November jobs report and inflation data
- There appears to be a slight downward bias in analyst expectations
- Concerns about government policy and tariffs create additional uncertainty

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for lower yields:**
- Multiple analyst forecasts point to lower yields (TradingEconomics expects 4.06%, UBS forecasts 3.75% by mid-2026)
- Recent momentum shows a slight decline (from 4.16% to 4.11%)
- Bankrate survey from mid-year expected the yield to fall to 4.18% over the next year
- The current yield (4.11%) is already below the long-term average of 4.25%

**Evidence for higher yields:**
- Persistent uncertainty around tariff policies and government debt could maintain a risk premium
- Year-end effects might reduce liquidity, potentially amplifying volatility
- Some analysts like RBC have higher forecasts (around 4.25%)
- The yield has shown significant volatility, with recent moves in both directions

**Evidence for increased uncertainty:**
- The Fed's data-dependent stance makes yields highly sensitive to upcoming economic releases
- Wide dispersion in analyst forecasts (from 3.5% to 4.25%) indicates low consensus
- Schwab noted continued volatility due to policy uncertainty

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.11% with σ = 0.25%, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **Analyst consensus update**: Most forecasts suggest a slight downward bias. This shifts my distribution mean down by approximately 5 basis points to 4.06%.

2. **Recent momentum update**: The small recent decline provides weak evidence for continuation. This further shifts the mean slightly downward to about 4.04%.

3. **Uncertainty factors update**: The wide range of forecasts and potential for data surprises suggests I should maintain or slightly increase my variance. I'll maintain σ = 0.25%.

My posterior distribution after these updates is approximately Normal(4.04, 0.25²), reflecting a slight downward shift from the current level but maintaining significant uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of a single major economic data release during this period
- The forecast period includes the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which could affect market liquidity
- Year-end positioning by institutional investors might create non-fundamental moves
- I haven't fully accounted for potential geopolitical shocks

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Upside scenario**: A surprisingly strong November jobs report or inflation reading could push yields up sharply, potentially to 4.40-4.50%
- **Downside scenario**: Signs of economic weakness or a risk-off event could trigger a flight to safety, pushing yields down to 3.70-3.80%

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should ensure my distribution has slightly fatter tails to account for these event risks
- The slight downward bias in my forecast seems justified but shouldn't be overemphasized given the short time horizon

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, I'll provide my calibrated forecast for the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025:

P10: 3.70
P20: 3.82
P40: 3.98
P60: 4.10
P80: 4.25
P90: 4.38

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The forecast horizon is very short (less than one month from the date of the provided information). For a liquid financial market variable like the 10-year Treasury yield, the most effective prior is a random walk model centered on the most recent known value. This approach assumes that the current price reflects all available information, and future changes are unpredictable.

*   **Reference Class:** Short-term (3-4 week) changes in the 10Y Treasury yield.
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** A normal distribution centered on the current yield of **4.11%** (as of Nov 10, 2025). The historical standard deviation of 3-week changes is approximately 20-25 basis points (0.20% to 0.25%). I will use a standard deviation of 0.25% for the prior, representing a distribution of Normal(μ=4.11, σ=0.25).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that the yield is subject to daily fluctuations based on news and data, consistent with a random walk. However, it differs in a few key ways:

*   **Monetary Policy Stance:** The market is in a "data-dependent pause" phase from the Federal Reserve. This is different from a steady-rate or hiking/cutting cycle, as it makes yields exceptionally sensitive to specific, high-impact data releases (like inflation and employment reports).
*   **Known Event Risk:** The resolution date (Dec 5, 2025) is the first Friday of the month, which is the typical release day for the U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report. This single data point is a major known source of volatility that could cause a significant deviation from the random walk.
*   **Analyst Bias:** There is a discernible, though not unanimous, bias among analysts for yields to drift lower over the medium term, which may exert a slight gravitational pull on the price.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the research report to update the prior.

*   **Analyst Consensus (↓ Downward Pressure):** The majority of forecasts cited (TradingEconomics at 4.06%, UBS at 3.75% by mid-2026, HSBC at 3.5%) point towards lower yields. While there are counterpoints (RBC at 4.25%), the overall weight of this evidence suggests that outcomes below the current 4.11% are more likely than outcomes above it. This evidence pushes the mean of the distribution down.
*   **Recent Momentum (↓ Downward Pressure):** The yield recently fell from 4.16% to 4.11%. This is weak evidence but directionally consistent with the analyst consensus, providing a small additional nudge downwards.
*   **Policy & Political Uncertainty (↔ Increased Variance):** The report highlights uncertainty from tariffs and government debt. This, combined with the Fed's data-dependent stance and the wide dispersion in analyst forecasts, argues against a narrow, overconfident forecast. This evidence primarily increases the variance (or spread) of the distribution, suggesting the tails are fatter than in a more stable period.
*   **Event Risk (↔ Increased Variance):** The proximity of the November jobs report to the resolution date is a major factor that increases the probability of a large, sharp move. A surprisingly strong report would push yields up, while a weak one would pull them down. This reinforces the need for a wide distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Normal(μ=4.11, σ=0.25).
*   **Update Step:** The analyst consensus and recent momentum provide a likelihood that favors lower values. I will update the mean of my distribution downwards from 4.11%. A shift to a central tendency around **4.08%** seems appropriate—a small but meaningful adjustment that reflects the downward bias without ignoring the strong anchor of the current price.
*   **Variance Adjustment:** The evidence on uncertainty and event risk confirms that the prior's standard deviation of 0.25% is appropriate, and possibly even conservative. I will maintain this spread to account for the potential of a significant data surprise.
*   **Posterior Distribution:** My final posterior distribution is approximately Normal(μ=4.08, σ=0.25). It is centered slightly below the current price and has a spread consistent with historical volatility and the current high-uncertainty environment.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is centered slightly below the current price, implying a modest downward drift. What could go wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher Yields):** The primary risk to this forecast is a "no landing" or "re-acceleration" scenario. If upcoming inflation and employment data (before Dec 5) are unexpectedly strong, the market would quickly price out any remaining expectations for Fed easing, sending yields sharply higher, potentially towards 4.30% or 4.40%. My P80 and P90 values (4.29% and 4.40%) account for this possibility.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower Yields):** A significant "risk-off" event, such as a geopolitical shock or signs of a sudden, sharp economic downturn, could trigger a flight to safety in Treasuries, pushing yields down much faster and further than my median suggests. A drop below 3.80% would be plausible in this scenario. My P10 and P20 values (3.76% and 3.87%) capture this tail risk.
*   **Critique of Median:** Is the 3 bps downward shift in the median justified? It's a small move, reflecting the balance between the strong anchor of the current price and the mild downward bias in the forward-looking evidence. It avoids making a strong directional bet while still acknowledging the prevailing sentiment. The symmetric distribution around this median is a reasonable compromise between the competing upside (inflation) and downside (recession) risks.

The final distribution appears robust, with a defensible central tendency and a sufficiently wide range to account for the significant uncertainty.
