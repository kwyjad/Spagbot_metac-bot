### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All biweekly periods (2010-2024):** The distribution of `CL_return - ES_return` is characterized by high volatility and fat tails. The mean is close to zero (-0.2 pp), but the median is slightly more negative (-0.5 pp), reflecting periods of large positive spikes in oil returns (e.g., due to supply shocks) that skew the mean upwards. The standard deviation is high, approximately 7.5 pp. This class suggests that in any random two-week period, a small underperformance by oil is slightly more likely than not, but large deviations in either direction are common.
2.  **Late Q4 biweekly periods (Last week of Nov / First week of Dec, 2010-2024):** This period often coincides with the US Thanksgiving holiday and the run-up to the end of the year. Historically, this has been a seasonally strong period for equities (the "Santa Claus rally" phenomenon can begin). Crude oil, conversely, is in a shoulder season between the end of summer driving demand and the peak of winter heating oil demand. The base rate for this specific period is more negative, with a median `CL_return - ES_return` of approximately -1.8 pp.
3.  **Periods of anticipated oil oversupply:** In historical periods where major forecasting agencies (IEA, EIA, OPEC) and investment banks have consensus forecasts of significant supply surpluses (e.g., 2014-2015, parts of 2019), crude oil has tended to underperform equities. In these regimes, the median biweekly `CL_return - ES_return` has been in the -1.0 pp to -2.5 pp range, as the supply glut weighs on oil prices while equities may still be supported by a stable (if not booming) economy.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** OPEC+ concludes its ministerial meeting with a commitment to maintain existing production quotas but offers no deeper cuts. Internal reports suggest compliance among several members remains weak. (↓) — Lack of further supply cuts in an oversupplied market is bearish for crude prices relative to equities.
*   **2025-10-30** The US Commerce Department releases Q3 GDP figures showing resilient growth but a slight uptick in the PCE deflator, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's "higher for longer" interest rate stance. (↑) — Sticky inflation and high rates are a headwind for equities (discount rate effect), potentially more so than for oil, which is sensitive to global, not just US, demand.
*   **2025-10-22** The IEA's latest Oil Market Report reiterates its forecast for a significant supply surplus in 2025, citing robust non-OPEC+ production growth (from the US, Guyana, Brazil) and softening demand from China and Europe. (↓) — Reinforces the fundamental bearish narrative for crude oil provided by the JPMorgan sources earlier in the year.
*   **2025-10-15** China's National Bureau of Statistics releases economic data showing industrial production and retail sales missing expectations, renewing concerns about the country's economic recovery. (↓) — China is the marginal buyer of crude; its economic weakness directly translates to lower oil demand forecasts, weighing heavily on CL futures.
*   **2025-09-18** The US Department of Energy announces a pause in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) replenishment purchases, citing prices above their target range. (↓) — Removes a source of marginal demand from the market, contributing to the supply-demand imbalance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Global Supply/Demand Balance:** (Large) The primary driver. Consensus points to a supply surplus in 2025. Any evidence confirming this (e.g., high inventory builds, strong non-OPEC production) will pressure CL prices down relative to ES.
2.  **OPEC+ Cohesion and Policy:** (Large) A surprise decision to implement deep, credible production cuts is the main upside risk for oil. Conversely, signs of fraying discipline or a market share war would be severely bearish for CL.
3.  **US Monetary Policy & Economic Health:** (Moderate) A "soft landing" scenario with resilient growth and falling inflation is bullish for the S&P 500. A "higher for longer" rates scenario creates headwinds for equities, potentially making oil's performance look better on a relative basis.
4.  **Chinese Economic Momentum:** (Moderate) As the world's largest oil importer, any significant deviation from the current weak-but-stable narrative for China's economy will directly impact oil demand forecasts and CL prices.
5.  **Geopolitical Flare-ups:** (Large, asymmetric) A major conflict disrupting supply in the Middle East (e.g., Strait of Hormuz) or elsewhere would cause CL to spike while likely harming ES, leading to a large positive outcome. The base case assumes no such shock.
6.  **Market Sentiment & Seasonality:** (Small to Moderate) Late Q4 often sees a seasonal tailwind for equities. This acts as a gentle but persistent headwind for the `CL-ES` spread.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Persistent Supply Glut Narrative:** Unlike a typical year, 2025 has been dominated by a consistent and strong consensus forecast (per the provided sources) of a significant oil supply surplus. This is a stronger fundamental headwind for oil than in an average year.
*   **Elevated Global Interest Rates:** Compared to the 2010-2021 period, global interest rates are significantly higher. This constrains corporate investment and consumer spending, acting as a structural drag on both asset classes but potentially weighing more on future growth expectations embedded in the S&P 500.
*   **Post-Pandemic Chinese Economy:** China's economic model is shifting away from heavy industry and real estate, and its recovery has been weaker than in past cycles. This represents a structural downshift in its energy demand growth compared to the 2010s.
*   **High but Stable Geopolitical Risk:** While geopolitical risk is always present, the current environment features multiple simmering conflicts (Ukraine, Middle East). The market appears to have priced in the status quo, but the potential for a sudden escalation is a key latent risk, making oil prices more sensitive to tail events than usual.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered near -1.8 pp, derived from the reference class of the specific late-Nov/early-Dec period, seems appropriate. This reflects the seasonal advantage for equities. Assign a moderate strength (equivalent n=15) to this prior.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The consistent narrative of a 2025 supply surplus, reinforced by recent IEA reports and weak OPEC+ actions.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Continued weak economic data from China, directly impacting the key source of marginal oil demand.
    *   (↓ Small) Seasonal tailwinds for the S&P 500 in late Q4 are likely to be a factor.
    *   (↑ Small) The "higher for longer" Fed stance, which may create a slightly stronger headwind for rate-sensitive equities than for globally-priced crude.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the negative prior. The fundamental picture for oil (oversupply, weak demand) is significantly worse than for the diversified S&P 500. The posterior should shift further negative, likely into the -2.5% to -4.0% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (CL outperforms ES):**
    *   Emergency OPEC+ meeting announcement or credible rumors of a surprise production cut.
    *   Major supply disruption in a key producing region (e.g., Nigeria, Libya, Middle East).
    *   Weekly EIA inventory reports showing unexpectedly large crude draws.
    *   Stronger-than-expected PMI data from China or Europe.
    *   A sudden dovish pivot from the US Federal Reserve.
*   **DOWN indicators (ES outperforms CL):**
    *   Further reports of weak OPEC+ compliance or rising production from sanctioned countries (e.g., Iran, Venezuela).
    *   Weekly EIA reports showing large inventory builds, especially at Cushing, OK.
    *   Weaker-than-expected US retail sales or employment data, signaling a "soft landing" that boosts equity sentiment without cratering oil demand.
    *   Any signs of de-escalation in major geopolitical conflicts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Extreme Short-Term Noise:** A two-week period is highly susceptible to random market noise and news flow. A single day's price action can determine the outcome, overriding all fundamental analysis.
*   **Geopolitical Black Swan:** The analysis assumes no major escalation in the Middle East or other key regions. A sudden conflict could cause oil to spike 10-20% in days, rendering the fundamental supply/demand analysis moot.
*   **Holiday Trading Liquidity:** The period includes the US Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27, 2025), which can lead to thin trading volumes and exaggerated price moves.
*   **Positioning & Sentiment:** The bearish consensus on oil is widely known. If speculative short positions are crowded, any

To forecast the difference in total price returns between Crude Oil Futures and S&P 500 Futures for the period from November 24 to December 5, 2025, we will follow a Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The base rate for this period is derived from historical data for late Q4 biweekly periods (last week of November/first week of December) from 2010-2024. The median `CL_return - ES_return` for this period is approximately -1.8 pp, with a high standard deviation of 7.5 pp.
   - **Reasoning:** This period often sees a seasonal strength in equities due to the "Santa Claus rally," while oil is in a shoulder season. Thus, historically, oil tends to underperform equities during this time.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current period aligns with the historical pattern of late Q4, where equities typically perform well.
   - **Differences:** The 2025 scenario is marked by a persistent supply glut narrative for oil, elevated global interest rates, and a weaker-than-usual Chinese economy, which are stronger headwinds for oil than in typical years.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Supply Surplus (↓ Large):** The IEA's forecast of a significant supply surplus and weak OPEC+ compliance are strong bearish factors for oil.
   - **Chinese Economic Weakness (↓ Moderate):** Weak economic data from China reduces oil demand.
   - **Seasonal Equity Strength (↓ Small):** Seasonal factors favor equities.
   - **US Monetary Policy (↑ Small):** High interest rates could weigh more on equities than oil, providing a slight relative boost to oil.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered at -1.8 pp, the strong evidence of an oil supply surplus and weak Chinese demand shifts the distribution further negative. The small positive influence of high interest rates on oil relative to equities is outweighed by these factors.
   - **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution is shifted to a more negative range, reflecting the stronger headwinds for oil.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for potential geopolitical disruptions that could cause oil prices to spike.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A surprise OPEC+ production cut or a geopolitical event could significantly alter the outcome.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the potential for tail risks, the distribution should be slightly widened to account for these possibilities.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles for the difference in returns are adjusted to reflect the stronger negative outlook for oil, while considering tail risks.

P10: -5.0  
P20: -4.0  
P40: -3.0  
P60: -2.0  
P80: -1.0  
P90: 0.0

# Forecasting Crude Oil Futures vs S&P 500 Futures Returns (Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the reference class of late Q4 biweekly periods (last week of November/first week of December) from 2010-2024 as my primary base rate. This is the most relevant reference class because:

- It captures the specific seasonal patterns of this exact time period
- It includes a substantial sample (15 years of data)
- It accounts for the typical market dynamics during the US Thanksgiving holiday period

This base rate shows a median `CL_return - ES_return` of approximately -1.8 percentage points, with a standard deviation likely around 7-8 percentage points (based on the overall biweekly volatility of 7.5 pp mentioned in the research report).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The forecast period includes the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically creates similar trading patterns with reduced volumes
- The seasonal pattern of stronger equity performance in late Q4 ("Santa Claus rally") is likely to persist
- The general market structure and relationship between oil and equities remains intact

**Differences from base rate:**
- The 2025 oil market appears to have a stronger consensus about oversupply than in typical years
- Global interest rates are higher than during much of the 2010-2021 period
- China's economic growth model has shifted, with weaker industrial/real estate sectors affecting oil demand
- Current geopolitical tensions create asymmetric tail risks for oil prices

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting more negative spread (ES outperforming CL):**

1. **Strong consensus of oil oversupply in 2025** (Strong evidence, ↓↓↓)
   - Multiple JPMorgan reports consistently forecast lower oil prices
   - IEA's October 2025 report reiterates significant supply surplus forecast
   - This suggests a fundamental headwind specific to oil that doesn't affect equities
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring more negative outcomes

2. **Weak Chinese economic data** (Moderate evidence, ↓↓)
   - October 2025 data showed industrial production and retail sales missing expectations
   - China is the marginal buyer of crude oil, making this particularly impactful
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring more negative outcomes

3. **OPEC+ maintaining rather than deepening cuts** (Moderate evidence, ↓↓)
   - November 5th meeting showed no new production cuts despite oversupply concerns
   - Reports of weak compliance among members
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring more negative outcomes

4. **Seasonal equity tailwinds** (Weak evidence, ↓)
   - Late Q4 typically sees positive equity momentum
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring more negative outcomes

**Evidence supporting less negative or positive spread (CL outperforming ES):**

1. **"Higher for longer" interest rate stance** (Weak evidence, ↑)
   - Q3 GDP figures showing uptick in PCE deflator
   - High rates may create stronger headwinds for rate-sensitive equities
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 favoring less negative outcomes

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior distribution centered at -1.8 pp with a standard deviation of ~7.5 pp, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - Oil oversupply consensus:**
- Prior: Mean = -1.8 pp, SD = 7.5 pp
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring more negative outcomes
- Posterior: Mean ≈ -3.0 pp, SD ≈ 7.0 pp (slightly reduced uncertainty)

**Second update - Weak Chinese economic data:**
- Prior: Mean = -3.0 pp, SD = 7.0 pp
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring more negative outcomes
- Posterior: Mean ≈ -3.8 pp, SD ≈ 6.8 pp

**Third update - OPEC+ inaction:**
- Prior: Mean = -3.8 pp, SD = 6.8 pp
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring more negative outcomes
- Posterior: Mean ≈ -4.5 pp, SD ≈ 6.6 pp

**Fourth update - Seasonal equity tailwinds:**
- Prior: Mean = -4.5 pp, SD = 6.6 pp
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring more negative outcomes
- Posterior: Mean ≈ -5.0 pp, SD ≈ 6.5 pp

**Fifth update - "Higher for longer" rates:**
- Prior: Mean = -5.0 pp, SD = 6.5 pp
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 favoring less negative outcomes
- Posterior: Mean ≈ -4.7 pp, SD ≈ 6.5 pp

My final posterior distribution has a mean of approximately -4.7 percentage points with a standard deviation of 6.5 percentage points.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Geopolitical shock risk:** I may be underestimating the probability of a sudden Middle East escalation that could cause oil to spike dramatically.
2. **Positioning crowding:** The bearish consensus on oil could lead to a short squeeze if any positive news emerges.
3. **Weather factors:** Unexpected cold weather in late November could boost heating oil demand.
4. **Technical market factors:** The two-week period is very short and susceptible to random noise or liquidity effects around Thanksgiving.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a distribution centered closer to the long-term mean of -0.2 pp, arguing that:
- Markets have already priced in the oil oversupply narrative
- Geopolitical risks are underpriced
- Positioning is too one-sided, creating mean reversion potential

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, the fundamental picture for oil is unusually negative, with multiple independent sources confirming the supply glut. The consistent messaging from JPMorgan, IEA, and OPEC+ behavior provides strong evidence for oil underperformance.

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for the short time period and holiday-related volatility, and shift it slightly less negative to account for potential geopolitical tail risks.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: -13.5
P20: -10.0

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the historical performance of the `Crude Oil Futures return - S&P 500 Futures return` spread during the specific biweekly period in question. The research report provides this:

*   **Reference Class:** Late Q4 biweekly periods (Last week of Nov / First week of Dec, 2010-2024).
*   **Reasoning:** This class is highly specific, capturing both the seasonality of equity markets (tendency for a "Santa Claus rally" to begin) and the typical state of the oil market during the shoulder season between peak summer driving and peak winter heating demand.
*   **Distribution:** The median for this period is approximately **-1.8 percentage points (pp)**. The general volatility for any biweekly period is high, with a standard deviation of about **7.5 pp**, which I will adopt for the initial spread of my prior distribution. The distribution is known to have fat tails, especially a positive skew due to the potential for supply-shock-driven oil spikes.

My prior is therefore a fat-tailed distribution with a median of -1.8 pp and a standard deviation of ~7.5 pp.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the 2010-2024 average in several key ways that are bearish for crude oil's relative performance:

*   **Similarities:** The forecast period matches the seasonal reference class perfectly. The underlying market drivers (geopolitics, monetary policy, economic growth) are structurally similar.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Stronger Supply Glut:** The consensus forecast for a significant oil supply surplus in 2025 is much stronger and more persistent than in a typical year of the reference period. This is a major fundamental headwind for crude oil.
    *   **Weaker Chinese Demand:** China's post-pandemic economic recovery has been sluggish, particularly in energy-intensive sectors. This represents a structural downshift in the primary source of marginal oil demand growth compared to the 2010s.
    *   **Higher Interest Rate Environment:** While higher rates are a headwind for both asset classes, the "higher for longer" stance from the Fed may weigh more heavily on the valuation of growth-oriented equities in the S&P 500. This is the main factor that could provide relative support for crude oil, but it is likely secondary to the direct supply/demand fundamentals of the oil market.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The recent news flow strongly supports a more negative outcome than the base rate suggests:

*   **IEA Report & OPEC+ Inaction (↓ Large):** The IEA's confirmation of a 2025 supply surplus, combined with OPEC+'s decision not to deepen cuts and signs of weak compliance, is highly bearish for crude oil. This evidence makes a significant underperformance by oil much more likely.
*   **Weak Chinese Economic Data (↓ Moderate):** Reports of China's industrial production and retail sales missing expectations directly weaken the demand outlook for crude oil, pushing the `CL-ES` spread lower.
*   **US SPR Pause (↓ Small):** The halt in SPR purchases removes a source of marginal demand, adding another small bearish factor for oil.
*   **Fed's "Higher for Longer" Stance (↑ Small):** This is the primary counter-evidence. By creating a headwind for equities via higher discount rates, it could improve crude oil's relative performance. However, this effect is indirect and likely outweighed by the direct, negative oil-market fundamentals.

The combined likelihood from this evidence strongly favors a distribution shifted significantly more negative than the prior.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Median of -1.8 pp, Std Dev ~7.5 pp.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The overwhelming evidence of a supply glut and weak demand acts as a strong multiplier on the negative region of the distribution.
    *   Starting from the prior median of -1.8 pp, the strong fundamental evidence (IEA, OPEC+, China) pushes the central tendency down significantly. I estimate this evidence shifts the median by about -2.0 pp.
*   **Posterior:** My updated posterior distribution is now centered around a median of **-3.8 pp**. I will maintain a wide standard deviation (~7.0 pp) because the short two-week timeframe is subject to high noise, and significant tail risks remain. The distribution retains a positive skew due to the asymmetric risk of a geopolitical supply shock.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Primary Risk to Forecast (Upside):** A geopolitical "black swan" event, such as a conflict disrupting the Strait of Hormuz. This is a low-probability, high-impact event that could cause oil to spike >10% while equities fall, leading to a large positive outcome (+15 pp or more). My upper percentiles (P80, P90) must account for this tail risk.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Downside):** A "soft landing" narrative takes hold, with inflation falling faster than expected. This would be very bullish for the S&P 500, potentially causing it to rally much faster than a fundamentally weak oil market. This could lead to a deeply negative outcome (-10 pp or worse). My lower percentiles (P10, P20) must reflect this.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** The bearish oil narrative is a strong consensus. Crowded trades can unwind sharply on any surprising news (e.g., an emergency OPEC+ meeting to announce cuts). This reinforces the need for wide, fat tails in the distribution rather than a narrow, overconfident forecast.

My central estimate remains strongly negative based on fundamentals, but the red team analysis confirms the necessity of a wide distribution to capture the significant two-way tail risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast reflects a distribution with a median of -3.8 pp, a wide spread, and a positive skew to account for the asymmetric risk of oil supply shocks.

P10: -12.0
P20: -9.0
P40: -4.8
P60: -2.8
P80: 3.0
P90: 6.5
