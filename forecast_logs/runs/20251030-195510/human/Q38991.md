### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Historical U.S. Human Cases of Avian Influenza:** Prior to 2024, there was only one documented human case of H5N1 in the United States (in 2022). This reference class suggests a base rate of **<1 case per year**. However, its utility is severely limited as it predates the key driver of the current situation: the widespread outbreak in U.S. dairy cattle, which represents a fundamental regime change in human exposure risk.
2.  **Global Sporadic H5N1 Human Cases (Post-2015):** Since 2015, the WHO has reported a few dozen sporadic human cases of H5N1 globally per year, typically linked to close contact with infected poultry. This reference class suggests a base rate of **10-40 cases globally per year**. This is more relevant as it reflects the behavior of modern H5 clades, but it doesn't account for the unique, large-scale mammalian reservoir now present in the U.S.
3.  **Early Stages of Novel Zoonotic Outbreaks:** This class includes events like the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or MERS-CoV. In these instances, initial case counts are low and geographically clustered before either fizzling out or achieving efficient human-to-human (H2H) transmission and growing exponentially. This class doesn't provide a specific base rate but highlights the bimodal nature of the potential outcomes: either a low number of sporadic cases (like MERS in the U.S.) or a very large number (like H1N1). The current situation fits the "low number of sporadic cases" branch of this reference class.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Size of the Animal Reservoir (Large ↑):** The virus is widespread in wild birds and, crucially, has established a large, persistent reservoir in U.S. dairy cattle. This is unprecedented and dramatically increases the scale and frequency of the human-animal interface, driving spillover events.
2.  **Viral Adaptation & Evolution (Large ↑):** Each infection in a mammal (cow or human) is an opportunity for the virus to acquire mutations that facilitate mammalian, and potentially human-to-human, transmission. The risk of a key mutation occurring is the primary driver of tail risk.
3.  **Surveillance & Testing Intensity (Moderate ↑/↓):** The number of *reported* cases is a direct function of testing efforts, particularly among asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic farm workers. Increased surveillance will find more cases (driving the number up), but it also enables faster public health interventions (driving spread down).
4.  **Farm Biosecurity & PPE Usage (Moderate ↓):** Adoption of personal protective equipment (PPE) by farm workers and improved biosecurity measures on farms directly reduces the probability of animal-to-human spillover. The effectiveness of these measures is a key variable.
5.  **Seasonality (Small ↑):** The forecast period (Nov-Dec 2025) coincides with the traditional influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. This could potentially increase transmission risk through environmental factors or biological susceptibility, though the primary driver remains direct animal exposure.
6.  **Human-to-Human (H2H) Transmission (Large ↑):** This is the critical switch. The current forecast regime assumes zero sustained H2H transmission. If this switch is flipped, case counts would move from dozens to potentially thousands or more, a true regime change.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Novel Mammalian Reservoir:** Unlike past avian flu outbreaks (Reference Class 1 & 2), which were driven by poultry, the current situation features a large, geographically dispersed reservoir in dairy cattle. This changes exposure routes (e.g., contact with raw milk, aerosols in milking parlors) and increases the potential for viral adaptation in mammals.
*   **Scale of Geographic Spread in Animals:** The H5N1 outbreak in cattle has affected herds across numerous states, creating a far wider and more persistent source of potential human exposure than a typical localized poultry farm outbreak.
*   **Heightened Public Health Surveillance:** Following the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance systems and public awareness are significantly higher. The CDC and state health departments are actively monitoring and testing at-risk populations (e.g., farm workers), meaning more mild or asymptomatic cases are likely to be detected than in previous eras.
*   **One Health Approach:** There is a more integrated "One Health" approach involving the CDC, USDA, and state agencies than in the past. This coordinated response in both human and animal health could be more effective at containment than historical efforts.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, based on pre-2024 U.S. data, would be a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution centered very low, near 0-1 cases per year (equivalent n of ~10-20 years of observation). This prior expects very few cases.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The emergence of a large, persistent mammalian (cattle) reservoir fundamentally breaks the old model and invalidates the low prior.
    *   (↑ Large) The observation of 70 cases over the first 19 months (Jan '24 - Jul '25) provides strong evidence for a new, higher baseline rate of sporadic spillover (~3.7 cases/month).
    *   (↑ Small) The forecast period enters the seasonal flu window, which may slightly increase transmission risk.
    *   (↓ Small) Public health responses (PPE guidance, surveillance) are in place and may be partially mitigating the spillover rate.
    *   (↔) Crucially, there remains no evidence of sustained H2H transmission, which acts as a strong cap on exponential growth scenarios.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests the prior is wrong. The posterior should shift dramatically upward to a new regime of continued, sporadic spillovers. The forecast should be anchored on the recently observed rate (~3.7 cases/month), with a slight upward adjustment for seasonality, but without incorporating the tail risk of a full-blown H2H pandemic.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any confirmed cluster of human cases not explainable by separate animal exposures (strong signal of H2H).
    *   CDC/WHO reports of genetic markers associated with mammalian adaptation (e.g., PB2-E627K) in new human or animal isolates.
    *   Confirmed human cases in individuals with no direct exposure to livestock or poultry.
    *   Significant expansion of the outbreak into swine herds, which are known "mixing vessels" for influenza viruses.
    *   A sharp, unexplained increase in weekly case reports from the CDC.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A sustained period (e.g., 4-6 weeks) with zero new reported human cases.
    *   Reports from the USDA showing a significant decline in the number of newly infected cattle herds.
    *   Widespread, successful rollout of an effective H5 vaccine for either cattle or at-risk farm workers.
    *   Data showing high rates of PPE compliance and effectiveness among exposed workers.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Testing Artifacts:** The final number is a count of *reported* cases. A sudden increase or decrease in testing availability or uptake among at-risk populations could change the reported number without a change in the true number of infections.
*   **Reporting Lags:** CDC reporting can have significant lags. Cases that occur in late December 2025 might not be officially reported until January 2026, potentially falling outside the resolution window. The resolution criteria should be checked carefully.
*   **Fat-Tailed Risk:** The analysis is predicated on the most likely scenario of continued sporadic spillovers. It does not fully price in the low-probability, high-impact "black swan" event of the virus achieving efficient H2H transmission, as discussed by Taleb. A single mutation could render the central forecast obsolete overnight.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The distinction between "confirmed" and "probable" cases could matter. The

To forecast the total number of human cases of H5 bird flu reported by the CDC in the United States for 2024 and 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate comes from the recent data provided: 70 cases over 19 months (January 2024 - July 2025), which equates to approximately 3.7 cases per month. This is a significant increase from historical rates due to the novel mammalian reservoir in cattle.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3.7 cases/month provides a reasonable starting point. Over 24 months, this would suggest a base rate of approximately 88.8 cases.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base rate in that it reflects ongoing sporadic spillovers without sustained human-to-human transmission.
   - **Differences:** The presence of a large mammalian reservoir and heightened surveillance increases the likelihood of detecting more cases than historical norms.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Large Increase:** The persistent mammalian reservoir and recent case data (70 cases in 19 months) suggest a higher baseline rate.
   - **Small Increase:** Seasonal flu factors and global infectious disease pressures may slightly increase transmission risk.
   - **Moderate Decrease:** Public health measures and surveillance efforts could mitigate case numbers.
   - **No Change:** No evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which would drastically alter the forecast.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior of 88.8 cases, the evidence of a large mammalian reservoir and recent case data suggests an upward adjustment. The posterior distribution should reflect a higher mean, perhaps around 100-110 cases, considering the ongoing spillover rate and slight seasonal increase.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The primary risk is underestimating the potential for a sudden increase due to viral adaptation. However, the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission supports the current forecast.
   - **Tail Risks:** The possibility of a mutation leading to efficient human-to-human transmission remains a low-probability, high-impact event.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with efficient human-to-human transmission could lead to thousands of cases, but current evidence does not support this.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the following percentiles are provided:

P10: 85  
P20: 90  
P40: 95  
P60: 105  
P80: 115  
P90: 125

# Forecasting Human H5 Bird Flu Cases in the US for 2024-2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the current reported case count and extrapolate. As of October 18, 2024, the CDC reported 27 human cases in the US for 2024. By July 7, 2025, this had increased to 70 cumulative cases since 2024.

This gives us:
- 27 cases in ~9.5 months of 2024 (Jan-Oct 2024): ~2.84 cases/month
- 43 additional cases in ~6.5 months (Oct 2024-July 2025): ~6.62 cases/month
- Overall rate from Jan 2024 to July 2025: 70 cases in 19 months = ~3.68 cases/month

The base rate appears to be increasing, with the most recent period showing a higher monthly case rate. For my prior, I'll use a distribution centered around 90-95 total cases by the end of 2025, which assumes the recent rate of ~3.7 cases/month continues for the remaining 5 months (Aug-Dec 2025).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The outbreak continues to be driven primarily by the same mechanism: spillover from infected animals (cattle and poultry) to humans with close contact
- No sustained human-to-human transmission has been documented
- The public health response infrastructure remains similar

**Differences from base case:**
- The case rate appears to have accelerated from early 2024 to mid-2025 (from ~2.8 to ~6.6 cases/month)
- We're entering winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, which typically increases respiratory virus transmission
- The virus has had more time to potentially adapt to mammals, including humans
- Public health measures and awareness may have improved since the initial cases

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
- The acceleration in case rate from early 2024 to mid-2025 suggests the trend may continue (↑ moderate)
- Seasonal effects of winter 2025 may increase transmission risk (↑ small)
- The large and persistent reservoir in dairy cattle provides ongoing exposure opportunities (↑ moderate)
- Each new human case provides opportunity for viral adaptation (↑ small)

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
- Improved biosecurity measures and PPE usage on farms following earlier cases (↓ small)
- Enhanced surveillance and rapid response capabilities (↓ small)
- No evidence of human-to-human transmission despite numerous cases (↓ moderate)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 90-95 total cases by end of 2025:

**Update 1: Accelerating case rate**
- Prior: ~90-95 cases (based on 3.7 cases/month)
- Evidence: Rate increased to ~6.6 cases/month in the most recent period
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence is ~1.8x more consistent with a higher case count
- Posterior: Shift upward to ~100-105 cases

**Update 2: Seasonal effects**
- Prior: ~100-105 cases
- Evidence: Winter months typically increase respiratory virus transmission
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence is ~1.2x more consistent with a higher case count
- Posterior: Shift upward to ~105-110 cases

**Update 3: No human-to-human transmission**
- Prior: ~105-110 cases
- Evidence: Despite 70+ cases, no sustained H2H transmission has been observed
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence is ~1.5x more consistent with a lower case count
- Posterior: Shift downward to ~95-100 cases

The posterior distribution is centered around 95-100 total cases, with a wider right tail to account for the possibility of accelerating transmission or limited clusters of H2H transmission.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the tail risk of a mutation enabling efficient H2H transmission
- The reporting lag could mean cases from late 2025 aren't counted in the official tally
- Testing intensity could change, affecting the number of detected cases
- The cattle reservoir could either expand dramatically or contract based on control measures

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Low scenario (~75-85 cases)**: Effective control measures in cattle, improved farm biosecurity, and no further adaptation of the virus lead to a significant slowdown in new human cases.
2. **High scenario (~120-150 cases)**: The virus continues to adapt to mammals, creating more efficient transmission from cattle to humans, and possibly limited H2H transmission in small clusters.
3. **Extreme scenario (200+ cases)**: A significant mutation enables efficient H2H transmission, leading to exponential growth in cases in late 2025.

The extreme scenario is unlikely but represents a fat-tailed risk that shouldn't be completely discounted. I'll adjust my distribution to slightly increase the upper percentiles to account for this tail risk.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, I'll provide my calibrated forecast:

P10: 85
P20: 90
P40: 95
P60: 105
P80: 120
P90: 140

Here is a full probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate for this forecast is not the long-term historical average, but the observed rate of infection during the current outbreak.

*   **Initial (Obsolete) Base Rate:** Prior to 2024, the United States had only one recorded human case of H5 bird flu (in 2022). This would suggest a base rate of less than 1 case per year. However, the 2024 emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle represents a fundamental regime change, creating a large, novel mammalian reservoir for the virus. This makes the pre-2024 data an inappropriate prior.
*   **Chosen Base Rate (Current Outbreak Rate):** The most relevant data comes from the outbreak itself. We have two key data points: 27 cases by October 18, 2024, and 70 cases by July 7, 2025. The rate between these two points is (70 - 27) / ~8.6 months ≈ 5.0 cases per month. This recent rate is the most informative starting point for our forecast, as it reflects the current reality of viral circulation, surveillance intensity, and public health response.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The base case is that this rate of ~5 sporadic spillover cases per month continues through the end of 2025.

*   **Similarities:** The primary driver—widespread H5N1 in dairy cattle—remains unchanged. There is no indication that the virus has been eradicated from this reservoir, so the mechanism for human exposure persists.
*   **Differences:** The forecast period is for the final months of 2025. The key difference from the preceding months is **seasonality**. The forecast for November and December 2025 falls squarely within the traditional influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. This could increase the rate of transmission from animals to humans due to environmental factors or increased human susceptibility. Conversely, public health interventions and on-farm biosecurity measures may have become more effective over time, exerting downward pressure on the rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

We must forecast the total number of cases for 2024-2025. Given the "current date" of October 30, 2025, the task involves estimating the current case count and then forecasting for the remaining two months.

*   **Estimating the Current Count (as of Oct 30, 2025):** The last hard data point is 70 cases on July 7, 2025. The period between July 7 and October 30 is approximately 3.75 months. Using our base rate of 5.0 cases/month, we can estimate the number of cases that have occurred in this unobserved period: 3.75 months × 5.0 cases/month ≈ 19 cases. This brings our estimated current total to 70 + 19 = 89 cases. Let's round this to a baseline of **90 cases** as of the end of October 2025.

*   **Forecasting for Nov-Dec 2025 (2 months):**
    *   **(↑ Moderate) Seasonality:** This is the primary factor pushing the forecast up. Influenza viruses typically circulate more efficiently in cooler, drier air. This makes a rate higher than the 5.0/month average more likely during these two months.
    *   **(↑ Large) Cluster Risk:** The monthly average conceals the risk of a single-source outbreak on a large farm, which could produce a cluster of 10-30 cases in a short period. This is the primary driver of the forecast's right tail.
    *   **(↓ Moderate) Public Health Response:** Ongoing efforts to promote PPE use and improve biosecurity on farms are the main countervailing force. Their increasing effectiveness would push the rate down.
    *   **(↔ Strong Cap) No Sustained H2H Transmission:** The background and research reports confirm that, despite 70+ human infections, no sustained human-to-human (H2H) transmission has been observed. This provides a strong cap against exponential growth, keeping the forecast in the realm of dozens of additional cases, not thousands.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

We start with our inferred baseline of ~90 cases and add a distribution for the final two months (November and December).

*   **Prior/Baseline:** A distribution centered at 90 cases by Oct 30, 2025.
*   **Likelihood (Forecast for Nov-Dec):** We model the number of additional cases.
    *   The median scenario assumes the recent rate of ~5 cases/month continues, perhaps slightly elevated by seasonality to ~5-6 cases/month. This would add 10-12 cases.
    *   **Update Step:** Baseline of 90 + 10 additional cases = **100 cases**. This will be the median (P50) of my posterior distribution.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The distribution for the final count will be right-skewed. The downside is limited (the rate could slow), but the upside includes the significant risk of a farm-based cluster. Therefore, the distance between the upper percentiles (P80, P90) and the median will be larger than the distance for the lower percentiles.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Forecast (Higher):** A forecaster more concerned about viral adaptation could place more weight on the possibility of a mutation that increases the efficiency of animal-to-human spillover, even without full H2H. This, combined with a winter surge, could plausibly lead to 20-25 cases per month, for a total of 90 + 50 = 140 cases. This is a key risk for the upper tail of my distribution.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Lower):** The outbreak in cattle could be waning, or biosecurity measures could have become highly effective. If the true rate has already dropped to 1-2 cases/month, the final total might only be 90 + 4 = 94. This scenario informs the lower end of my distribution.
*   **Blind Spot:** The biggest uncertainty is the lack of data between July and October 2025. My entire forecast is anchored on an extrapolation to ~90 cases. If the actual rate during that period was significantly different, my forecast's center would be wrong. However, using the most recent observed rate is the most principled approach. My final distribution accounts for this by having a non-trivial width.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered at 100 cases, reflecting an estimated 90 cases to date plus 10 more in the final two months. The distribution is skewed to the right to account for seasonal and cluster risks.

P10: 92
