### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Tenured Professors at R1 Universities Facing Dismissal for Cause:** The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) sets a high bar for dismissal ("grave misconduct"). Actual dismissals are extremely rare. A 2018 FIRE report found only a handful of post-tenure dismissals at top universities over a 15-year period for conduct-related reasons. The base rate is likely well below 0.1% per professor-year. This class suggests a very low prior probability.
2.  **Tenured Professors Subject to Formal, Public Disciplinary Proceedings for Speech/Conduct:** This is a more specific class. While many professors face criticism, a formal, multi-year faculty senate review process is uncommon. Of those who undergo this process, sanctions short of dismissal (censure, suspension) are more common than outright tenure revocation. The base rate of *dismissal* from this group is still low, perhaps in the 5-15% range, as universities often seek a resolution that avoids protracted legal battles over tenure.
3.  **High-Profile "Controversial" Academics at Elite Institutions:** This class includes figures like Joshua Katz (Princeton), Dorian Abbot (MIT/cancelled lecture), and others. The outcomes are mixed. Katz was fired, but the official reason was a prior sexual misconduct case, not his controversial speech, muddying the comparison. Others face intense criticism but retain their positions. This class highlights that while pressure is high, the institutional hurdles to firing remain formidable. The base rate for tenure loss is likely higher than the general population but still well below 50%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-11-17** Amy Wax files a second lawsuit against UPenn, alleging violations of academic freedom over the imposed sanctions. **(↓)** This action is a response to the sanctions, not a new cause for dismissal. It signals a shift to external legal battles rather than an escalation of the internal university process toward termination.
- **2025-08-XX** A federal judge dismisses Wax's first lawsuit against the university. **(↓)** This demonstrates that her initial legal challenges were unsuccessful, but the university's response was not to escalate sanctions to dismissal, but to see the existing process through.
- **2024-09-23** UPenn formally suspends Wax for the 2025-2026 academic year with half pay and other sanctions. **(↓↓)** This is the most critical event. The university concluded its lengthy disciplinary process with a specific, major sanction that is *not* tenure revocation. This resolves the ambiguity of the process and makes a "Yes" resolution much less likely.
- **2024-03-04** FIRE reports on the confidential June 2023 faculty senate recommendation for a one-year suspension. **(↓)** This was the first strong signal that the likely outcome of the multi-year process would be suspension, not dismissal, lowering the probability of a "Yes" resolution.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **University Disciplinary Process:** This is the primary mechanism. It is designed to be slow, deliberative, and provide due process, with multiple levels of review (faculty committee, dean, provost, president). The bar for tenure revocation is exceptionally high. This mechanism has already run its course and resulted in suspension. **(Large effect size, currently pushing strongly against a "Yes" resolution).**
2.  **External Legal Action:** Wax's lawsuits against the university. These actions consume resources and time but are unlikely to trigger a dismissal. If anything, they may make the university more cautious to avoid providing more grounds for litigation. **(Small effect size, pushes probability down).**
3.  **New Provocation by Wax:** Wax could engage in new conduct or speech so egregious that it forces the university to initiate a *new*, expedited dismissal process. Given her history, this is possible, but the timeline makes it a weak driver. **(Moderate potential effect size, but low probability of occurring and concluding before the deadline).**
4.  **Public/Donor/Student Pressure:** This was a major driver for initiating the review in 2022. However, now that the university has acted and imposed a significant penalty (a full-year suspension), this pressure has likely abated. It would take a major new controversy to reactivate it to a level that would demand dismissal. **(Small effect size, currently inactive).**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Process Conclusion:** Unlike a typical case where the outcome is uncertain, the university's formal, multi-year disciplinary process against Wax has *already concluded*. The penalty has been decided and implemented: suspension. The base rate applies to cases *in progress*, whereas this one is effectively post-decision.
- **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in approximately one month (Jan 1, 2026). University and legal processes operate on timelines of months or years. The possibility of a new dismissal process being initiated, conducted, and finalized in this window is virtually zero.
- **Nature of the Sanction:** The university chose suspension, a severe penalty that affirms the faculty committee's findings of misconduct but deliberately stops short of tenure revocation. This signals the institution's calculated limit.
- **Protagonist's Strategy:** Wax's current strategy is legal action to fight the *suspension*, not behavior that would escalate the conflict toward dismissal. Her fight is now in the courts, which moves slower than the resolution horizon.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 10%) based on the reference class of tenured professors undergoing formal review for cause. The base rate of actual dismissal is very low. (Equivalent n=10).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **(↓↓) University concludes process with suspension (Sep 2024):** This is dispositive evidence that the existing process did not and will not result in tenure loss. It resolves the primary uncertainty in favor of "No."
    - **(↓) Extremely short time horizon (<1 month):** Procedural impossibility of a new dismissal process concluding in time.
    - **(↓) Wax files new lawsuit (Nov 2025):** Confirms the battle has moved to a slower, external venue and is focused on reversing the suspension, not fighting a pending dismissal.
- **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points against a "Yes" resolution. The posterior should be updated sharply downwards to a very low probability, likely <1%. The initial prior was too high because it didn't account for the process having already reached a non-dismissal conclusion.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - A new, unambiguous statement from the UPenn President or Provost announcing the initiation of *new* proceedings for tenure revocation.
    - An unexpected and immediate resignation by Amy Wax.
    - A court order that both invalidates the suspension *and* somehow compels the university to seek a harsher penalty (extremely unlikely).
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - The passage of time with no new announcements from the university.
    - Any university statement referring to the September 2024 sanctions as the final resolution of the matter.
    - Continued focus in news reports on Wax's lawsuit rather than any new university action.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Definitional Gotcha:** The primary risk is misinterpreting the resolution criteria. A suspension, even for a full year at half pay, is a sanction applied *to a tenured professor*. She still "has tenure" while suspended. The question resolves "Yes" only if that status is formally revoked.
- **Black Swan Event:** The analysis assumes no shocking, out-of-character events. A sudden resignation, a major health issue forcing retirement, or a completely new scandal unrelated to her speech could theoretically change the outcome, but these are unpredictable and low-probability.
- **Settlement Risk:** There is a small chance the university and Wax could reach a settlement in her lawsuit where she agrees to resign her tenure in exchange for a financial payout. However, completing such a negotiation before Jan 1, 2026, is highly improbable.
- **Information Gaps:** The internal deliberations of the UPenn administration and Board of Trustees are not public. There is a small chance they have a different view, but their public actions to date strongly contradict this.

**Final Research Summary:** The university's multi-year disciplinary process against Amy Wax has already concluded with a one-year suspension, a sanction that does not revoke her tenure. With less than two months until the resolution date, there is no viable mechanism or timeline for a new dismissal process to be initiated and completed.

To forecast the probability that Amy Wax will no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for tenured professors at R1 universities facing dismissal for cause is extremely low, likely well below 0.1% per professor-year. For those subject to formal disciplinary proceedings, the base rate of dismissal is higher, perhaps in the 5-15% range. Given the specific context of Amy Wax's situation, a prior probability of around 10% seems reasonable, reflecting the higher likelihood due to the formal proceedings but still acknowledging the rarity of tenure revocation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** Amy Wax's case involves formal disciplinary proceedings, aligning with the reference class of professors facing potential dismissal.
- **Difference:** The process has concluded with a suspension, not dismissal, which is a significant deviation from cases that might still be pending. The short time horizon further differentiates this case, as there is insufficient time for a new process to conclude.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **University Process Conclusion (Sep 2024):** The conclusion of the disciplinary process with a suspension rather than dismissal is strong evidence against tenure revocation. Likelihood ratio heavily favors "No" resolution.
- **Short Time Horizon:** The procedural impossibility of initiating and concluding a new dismissal process within a month further decreases the likelihood of tenure revocation.
- **Legal Actions:** Wax's lawsuits focus on reversing the suspension, not on fighting a pending dismissal, indicating a shift away from university proceedings.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 10% prior probability translates to odds of 1:9.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the evidence, particularly the conclusion of the disciplinary process and the short time horizon, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards "No." For simplicity, assume a likelihood ratio of 1:100.
- **Posterior Odds:** 1:9 × 1:100 = 1:900.
- **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 900) ≈ 0.11%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The analysis assumes no unexpected events, such as a sudden resignation or settlement. These are low-probability but should be acknowledged.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A new scandal or health issue could theoretically change the outcome, but these are unpredictable and unlikely within the timeframe.
- **Adjustment:** Given the robustness of the evidence and the short timeline, the probability remains very low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian update, the probability that Amy Wax will no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 0%

# Will Amy Wax no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider the reference class of tenured professors at elite universities who have undergone formal disciplinary proceedings for controversial speech or conduct.

Looking at historical data:
- Tenured professors at R1 universities rarely lose tenure, even when facing disciplinary action
- The AAUP sets an extremely high bar for dismissal ("grave misconduct")
- A 2018 FIRE report found very few post-tenure dismissals at top universities over a 15-year period
- When formal proceedings occur, sanctions short of dismissal (censure, suspension) are far more common

Given that Amy Wax is already under formal review, I'll use a base rate of approximately 10% for tenure revocation in such cases. This reflects that while dismissal is rare, it does occasionally happen when formal proceedings have been initiated.

**Prior probability: 10%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Wax is a tenured professor at an elite university (UPenn Law)
- She has made controversial public statements that led to formal disciplinary proceedings
- The university administration has publicly criticized her statements

**Key differences:**
- The disciplinary process has already concluded with a specific sanction: suspension for the 2025-2026 academic year at half pay
- The resolution date is January 1, 2026, leaving extremely little time (about one month) for any new process to be initiated and completed
- Wax has filed lawsuits against the university, moving the conflict to external legal venues
- The university has already imposed significant sanctions that deliberately stop short of tenure revocation

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: UPenn formally suspended Wax for 2025-2026 with half pay (September 2024)**
- P(E|H): If Wax were to lose tenure, it's unlikely the university would first impose a lesser sanction and then escalate. ~0.1
- P(E|~H): If Wax were to retain tenure, this suspension would be the expected outcome of the disciplinary process. ~0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.8 = 0.125
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Extremely short time horizon (one month until resolution)**
- P(E|H): If Wax were to lose tenure before 2026, there would need to be sufficient time for a new process. ~0.05
- P(E|~H): If Wax were to retain tenure, this short timeline is irrelevant. ~1.0
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/1.0 = 0.05
- This dramatically decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Wax filed a second lawsuit against UPenn (November 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Wax were about to lose tenure, filing a lawsuit about the suspension would be an odd strategy. ~0.3
- P(E|~H): If Wax were to retain tenure but fight the suspension, this lawsuit makes perfect sense. ~0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10%/90% = 1/9

**Update on Evidence 1 (Suspension decision):**
Posterior odds = 1/9 × 0.125 = 0.0139
Posterior probability = 0.0139/(1 + 0.0139) ≈ 1.37%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Short time horizon):**
Posterior odds = 0.0139 × 0.05 = 0.000695
Posterior probability = 0.000695/(1 + 0.000695) ≈ 0.07%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Second lawsuit):**
Posterior odds = 0.000695 × 0.33 = 0.00023
Posterior probability = 0.00023/(1 + 0.00023) ≈ 0.023%

This extremely low probability reflects the fact that:
1. The university has already concluded its disciplinary process with a non-dismissal outcome
2. There is virtually no time for a new process to be initiated and completed
3. The conflict has moved to external legal venues

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a sudden resignation or negotiated departure
- There could be ongoing confidential discussions between Wax and the university
- A new, egregious incident could theoretically trigger an expedited dismissal process

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Wax could agree to resign her tenure as part of a settlement agreement in her lawsuit
- The university could have a separate, non-public process underway that could conclude quickly
- Wax could face health issues or other personal circumstances leading to retirement

While these scenarios are possible, they are extremely unlikely given the timeline and available information. Even accounting for these possibilities, the probability remains very low.

**Adjustment:** I'll increase my estimate slightly from 0.023% to 0.5% to account for these low-probability scenarios and unknown factors.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class is tenured professors at top US universities who become subject to formal, public disciplinary proceedings that could lead to dismissal. The dismissal of a tenured professor for cause is an exceedingly rare event. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) standards set a very high bar, requiring "grave misconduct." While many professors face criticism, very few face a formal faculty senate review process aimed at major sanctions. Of those who do, sanctions short of dismissal (like censure or suspension) are more common outcomes than tenure revocation. Based on historical rarity, a reasonable prior probability that such a process, once initiated, will result in dismissal is low. I will set the prior at **10%**. This acknowledges the seriousness of initiating such a process while respecting the strong protections of tenure. In odds form, this is 1:9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with Amy Wax has key differences from the base case of a professor *undergoing* a disciplinary review:

*   **Similarity:** Like the base case, Amy Wax is a tenured professor at an elite university (UPenn) who faced a formal, multi-year disciplinary review initiated by the dean due to her conduct and speech.
*   **Difference:** The most critical difference is that the process is no longer in a state of uncertain outcome. The university's formal disciplinary process has **already concluded**. In September 2024, the university announced its final sanction.
*   **Why it matters:** The base rate applies when the outcome is unknown. Here, the outcome of the primary process is known. The question is no longer "Will this process lead to dismissal?" but rather "Could some *new* event lead to dismissal before the deadline?"

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis "Amy Wax will no longer have tenure before 2026." Let ~H be the contrary.

*   **Evidence 1: The university imposed a one-year suspension with half pay as the final sanction in September 2024.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of the university announcing a suspension as the final outcome, if they were actually going to revoke her tenure, is extremely low. This would be a contradictory and illogical action.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of the university announcing a suspension if they intended for her to remain a tenured professor is very high. This is a severe penalty that punishes the conduct without engaging in the legally perilous process of tenure revocation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H)):** This ratio is extremely small (<< 1). This evidence powerfully decreases the probability of H.

*   **Evidence 2: The resolution date is January 1, 2026, leaving only about one month from the present (late November 2025).**
    *   P(E2 | H): The probability of a new tenure revocation process being initiated, proceeding through all required faculty hearings, reviews, and appeals, and concluding within one month is virtually zero. University disciplinary and legal processes are notoriously slow.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): The probability of the current status quo (she is a suspended tenured professor) continuing for another month is extremely high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E2 | H) / P(E2 | ~H)):** This ratio is also extremely small (<< 1). The short timeline is very strong evidence against H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 10% (1:9 odds), we update with the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:9
*   **Evidence:** The university concluded the process with a suspension, not a dismissal. This is the dispositive piece of information, resolving the primary uncertainty. The likelihood ratio is extremely small. Let's conservatively estimate it as 1/100.
*   **Posterior Odds:** (Prior Odds) × (Likelihood Ratio) = (1/9) × (1/100) = 1/900.
*   **Posterior Probability:** (1/900) / (1 + 1/900) = 1/901, which is approximately **0.1%**.

This update shows that based on the known outcome of the disciplinary process, the probability of her losing tenure *through that mechanism* is now near zero. The remaining probability must come from other, less likely scenarios.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis concludes the probability is very low because the university's process is over. What could I be missing?

*   **Alternative Scenarios:** The only plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution before January 1, 2026 are:
    1.  **Sudden Resignation:** Wax could choose to resign for personal reasons or burnout. This is unpredictable but possible.
    2.  **Settlement of Lawsuit:** She is suing the university. A settlement could be reached where she agrees to resign in exchange for a financial package. Reaching such a settlement and having it finalized in the next month is highly improbable but not impossible.
    3.  **A New, Egregious Act:** She could commit a new act so severe that it triggers an emergency dismissal, but this is extremely unlikely, and the timeline for due process remains a major obstacle.

*   **Plausibility of Alternatives:** The primary risk is a voluntary departure (resignation or settlement). While the university process is closed, her personal decisions are not. A person in their 70s in a high-stress, multi-year public battle might choose to step away. The probability of this happening in any specific 30-day window is low, but it is not zero.

*   **Adjustment:** The formal Bayesian update based on the university's actions drives the probability to well below 1%. However, to account for the small but real possibility of a "black swan" event like a sudden resignation or settlement, I will set the final probability slightly higher than the sub-0.1% calculation. A 1% forecast seems appropriate to cover these unlikely tail risks.

### 6. Final Forecast
The primary mechanism by which Amy Wax could have lost her tenure—the university's formal disciplinary process—has already concluded with a sanction of suspension, not dismissal. With only one month remaining until the resolution date, there is no procedurally viable path for the university to initiate and complete a new tenure revocation process. The only remaining possibilities are a sudden resignation or a rapid settlement of her lawsuit that includes her departure, both of which are low-probability events. Therefore, the probability that she will no longer have tenure before 2026 is very low.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event (Amy Wax losing tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026) comes from the reference class of tenured professors at elite (R1 or top-ranked) institutions facing formal disciplinary proceedings for speech or conduct issues. According to the research report, which draws from AAUP data and FIRE reports, actual tenure revocations in such cases are rare, with outcomes more often involving lesser sanctions like censure or suspension. Historical data over the past 15-20 years shows a base rate of dismissal around 5-15% for professors in this specific class (e.g., cases like Joshua Katz are outliers, and even then, the official reason was not solely speech). I choose this base rate because it narrows to high-profile, controversial academics at elite schools, which matches Wax's situation more closely than the broader <0.1% per-year rate for all tenured professors. This gives an initial prior probability of 10% (or odds of 1:9), reflecting the low but non-zero historical frequency of tenure loss in similar proceedings.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that Wax is a tenured professor at an elite institution (UPenn, ranked in the top 24) undergoing formal review for controversial statements, with public pressure and a lengthy faculty senate process—much like cases involving figures such as Joshua Katz at Princeton or others criticized for speech. These often involve debates over academic freedom, donor/student backlash, and institutional caution due to legal risks. However, it differs significantly in two key ways: (1) The disciplinary process has already concluded with a suspension (not dismissal) as of September 2024, resolving the primary uncertainty in favor of retaining tenure, whereas base cases typically involve ongoing or unresolved proceedings. (2) The extremely short remaining horizon (<1 month until January 1, 2026) makes new processes procedurally impossible, unlike base cases with multi-year timelines. These differences matter because they eliminate the main pathways to tenure loss, pushing the probability well below the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **University's conclusion of process with suspension (Sep 2024):** This is strong evidence against tenure loss. P(E | H) (likelihood if event happens) is low (~10%), as a concluded process with suspension would be unlikely if tenure revocation were imminent or intended. P(E | ~H) (if event does not happen) is high (~90%), as suspension is a common non-revocation outcome. Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (strongly decreases probability).
- **Extremely short time horizon (<1 month):** P(E | H) is very low (~1%), as initiating and completing a new dismissal in weeks is infeasible given university procedures. P(E | ~H) is high (~99%), as short timelines favor status quo. Likelihood ratio: ~0.01 (sharply decreases probability).
- **Wax's new lawsuit (Nov 2025):** P(E | H) is moderate (~30%), as lawsuits could theoretically escalate but rarely lead to sudden revocation. P(E | ~H) is higher (~70%), as they shift focus to courts without prompting dismissal. Likelihood ratio: ~0.43 (modestly decreases probability).
- **No new provocations or pressure escalations:** P(E | H) is low (~20%), as absence of triggers reduces paths to revocation. P(E | ~H) is high (~80%). Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (decreases probability).

Overall, the evidence overwhelmingly favors ~H (no tenure loss), with net likelihood ratios pulling downward.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:9 (10% probability). Apply the strongest evidence first: the process conclusion with suspension (likelihood ratio ~0.11). Posterior odds = 1:9 × 0.11 = 0.11:9 (or ~1:82), converting to ~1.2% probability. Next, incorporate the short horizon (ratio ~0.01): Posterior odds = 0.11:9 × 0.01 = 0.0011:9 (or ~1:8182), ~0.01% probability. Further minor updates for the lawsuit and lack of escalations (combined ratio ~0.3) yield final posterior odds ~0.00033:9 (or ~1:27273), ~0.004% probability. However, to avoid over-precision and align with calibration advice for small updates, I round this conceptually to a very low posterior of ~0.5%, reflecting high confidence in no change but residual uncertainty from black swans. Uncertainty remains low due to the dispositive evidence, but not zero given potential surprises.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in assuming the process is fully "concluded"—internal university dynamics could hide ongoing deliberations, or a settlement could lead to voluntary resignation (a blind spot in public info). Tail risks include a sudden new scandal, health-related retirement, or a court ruling forcing escalation (though improbable in <1 month). An alternative forecast of ~5% might be plausible if one weights black swans higher (e.g., viewing Wax's litigiousness as a wildcard that could provoke revocation), but this is rebutted by the procedural timelines and evidence that the university chose suspension as its limit to avoid litigation. A higher ~20% alternative could argue the suspension is a "stepping stone" to dismissal, but this ignores the report's timeline and base rates showing suspensions rarely escalate. To account for these, I adjust upward slightly from my initial posterior to ~1%, broadening for uncertainty without big swings.

Final: 1%
