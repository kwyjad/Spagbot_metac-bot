### Reference class & base rates
-   **Waymo's State-Level Expansion:** Waymo's history is the most direct reference class. The company was founded in 2009. It launched its first public rider-only service in Arizona (2020) and its second in California (2023). This yields a base rate of roughly one new state every 2-3 years, or ~0.4 states/year since the first launch. This rate is very low and suggests adding a new state is a slow, deliberate process.
-   **"Blitzscaling" Tech Service Rollouts (e.g., Uber/Lyft):** A broader, but less applicable, reference class is the geographic expansion of ride-sharing services in the early 2010s. These companies added dozens of states within a few years. This class is a poor fit due to Waymo's fundamentally different constraints: physical vehicle fleets, intensive high-definition mapping, complex safety validation, and a much heavier state-level regulatory burden. This class suggests a much higher potential rate of expansion but should be heavily discounted.
-   **Major Capital-Intensive Infrastructure Projects:** A more conservative reference class could be the rollout of new, regulated infrastructure (e.g., 5G cell towers, fiber optic networks). These projects are slow, require significant upfront investment, and face local and state-level approvals. The pace is typically measured in years per state, not months, aligning more closely with Waymo's observed behavior.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Note: The provided sources on Meta's "Workplace" and San Francisco/Los Angeles events are not relevant to Waymo's expansion and have been disregarded.*
-   **2024-10-22** Waymo announces a significant expansion of its service territory in Phoenix, AZ, nearly doubling its operational area to 315 square miles. (↔) — Demonstrates continued investment and operational maturity in an existing market, but does not add a new state.
-   **2024-10-08** Waymo announces it will begin mapping operations in Atlanta, GA, its fourth major planned market. (↑) — Signals intent for a future launch in a 4th state, but mapping is a very early step, making a Jan 2026 public launch there virtually impossible.
-   **2024-08-20** Waymo expands its Los Angeles service to include LAX airport, a key milestone for service utility. (↔) — Reinforces operational capability in an existing state (CA), but does not change the state count.
-   **2024-05-07** Waymo begins offering rider-only trips to its employees in Austin, TX, a critical step before public launch. (↑) — This is the most significant recent development. It moves Texas from "planned" to "pre-launch," making it the only candidate for becoming the 3rd state by the resolution date.
-   **2024-03-28** The Metaculus question opens. At this time, Waymo is public in AZ and CA, with Austin, TX, announced as the next city. (Baseline) — The situation with the top three candidate states has not fundamentally changed, only progressed along expected lines.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Regulatory Approval (Large):** Each state has a different regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles. Gaining approval to operate a rider-only service for the general public is a major, time-consuming hurdle. A sudden approval or denial is a key driver.
-   **Operational Readiness (Large):** A public launch requires a fully mapped service area, a deployed and validated vehicle fleet, a physical depot for maintenance, and local staff. This entire logistical chain takes many months to establish, making a surprise "quick launch" in a new state highly improbable.
-   **Safety Incidents & Public Perception (Large):** A significant at-fault crash or a series of minor, publicly visible incidents involving Waymo or a competitor (like the 2023 Cruise incident) could trigger a regulatory crackdown, pausing all expansion plans indefinitely.
-   **Corporate Strategy & Capital Allocation (Moderate):** Alphabet's willingness to continue funding Waymo's high cash-burn rate determines the pace of expansion. A strategic decision to accelerate or decelerate investment would directly impact the number of new launches.
-   **Technical Validation (Moderate):** Before a public launch, Waymo must be confident its system can safely handle the specific driving environment (weather, road layout, local driving habits) of a new city. This internal validation is a key gate.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Mature Launch Playbook:** Unlike its first launch in Arizona, Waymo now has a more refined playbook for entering new markets (mapping, community engagement, regulatory outreach, operational setup). This could accelerate the time from announcement to launch compared to the historical base rate.
-   **Increased Regulatory Scrutiny:** Following the 2023 Cruise incident in San Francisco, regulators and the public are more cautious. This adds friction and potential delays to the approval process in new states, counteracting the "mature playbook" advantage.
-   **Focus on Existing Markets:** Recent announcements have heavily emphasized expanding service *within* existing territories (Phoenix, LA, SF) rather than entering new ones. This suggests a strategy of deepening moats and proving unit economics before rapid geographic expansion.
-   **Imminent but Undated Launch:** The situation in Austin, TX (employee-only testing) is a unique state of affairs. The company is closer to a public launch in a new state than it has been for years, making the base rate of "one state every 2-3 years" potentially less predictive for this specific short-term forecast.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** The base rate of Waymo's own history suggests a very slow expansion. A strong prior centered on the current number of 2 states (AZ, CA) is appropriate. The probability of adding a state in any given month is very low. (Equivalent n ≈ 25).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) Austin, TX has advanced to the employee-only testing phase, making it the sole viable candidate for a 3rd state by Jan 1, 2026.
    -   (↓ Large) The historical timeline from employee testing to full public launch is measured in many months, not weeks. With less than one month to resolution, this is a major barrier.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The lack of a firm public launch date announcement for Austin by early December 2025 makes a launch within the month highly unlikely. Companies typically pre-announce such milestones.
    -   (↔ Small) Expansion in existing markets (Phoenix, LA) confirms operational competence but diverts resources that could otherwise be used for a new state launch.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence confirms that while a 3rd state (Texas) is on the horizon, the extremely short timeline to resolution makes its inclusion by Jan 1, 2026 highly improbable. The posterior should remain very strongly concentrated on 2, with only a small tail probability for 3.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A Waymo press release or blog post explicitly announcing a public launch date in Austin, TX, before Jan 1, 2026.
    -   The Waymo app or website begins accepting sign-ups for a public waitlist in Austin.
    -   Texas state or Austin city officials issue a statement welcoming the imminent public launch of the service.
    -   Widespread media reports citing inside sources about a planned December 2025 launch in Austin.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A Waymo announcement stating they "look forward to welcoming the public in Austin in early 2026."
    -   Any report of a software issue, safety incident, or regulatory delay concerning the Austin fleet.
    -   Continued silence from the company regarding a public launch date as the end of December approaches.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definition of "Available to the general public":** This could be ambiguous. A launch with a very long waitlist or a service restricted to a tiny downtown area might technically count, even if not widely available. Resolution depends on how Waymo presents it on their official site.
-   **Surprise "Holiday" Launch:** Waymo could, for marketing purposes, announce a surprise launch just before the new year. While logistically difficult, it's not impossible and represents the primary upside risk.
-   **Information Asymmetry:** Waymo's internal launch timeline is private. The forecast relies on interpreting public signals which may not reflect the true state of readiness.
-   **Resolution Source Lag:** Waymo's website might not be updated on the exact day of a launch, potentially creating ambiguity on the resolution date of January 1.

### Final Research Summary
Waymo is currently available to the public in two states (AZ, CA). While a third state (TX) is in the final stages of pre-launch testing, the operational and logistical timeline for a full public launch makes it extremely unlikely to occur before the January 1, 2026 deadline. The forecast should be overwhelmingly concentrated on a value of 2.

To forecast the number of US states where Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available to the general public by January 1, 2026, let's proceed through the steps outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Waymo's historical expansion rate is the most relevant base rate. Since launching its first public service in Arizona in 2020 and its second in California in 2023, Waymo has expanded at a rate of approximately one new state every 2-3 years. This suggests a base rate of about 0.4 states per year.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean is approximately 2 states by early 2026, with a low variance given the slow historical expansion.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with the historical base rate, as Waymo is still in the process of expanding its service within existing states rather than rapidly entering new ones.
   - **Differences:** The imminent pre-launch testing in Austin, TX, suggests a potential deviation from the base rate, but the timeline to a public launch is very tight.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Austin, TX Pre-Launch Testing (↑ Large):** This increases the likelihood of Texas becoming the third state, but the short timeline to January 1, 2026, is a significant barrier.
   - **No Public Launch Date (↓ Large):** The absence of a public launch date announcement for Austin by early December 2025 makes a launch by January 1, 2026, unlikely.
   - **Expansion in Existing Markets (↔ Small):** Confirms operational capability but does not contribute to new state launches.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Posterior Update:** The prior distribution strongly centered on 2 states is adjusted slightly upwards due to the potential for a launch in Texas. However, the lack of a public launch date and the historical timeline from testing to launch suggest the probability remains low for a third state by the deadline.
   - **Shift:** The posterior remains concentrated on 2 states, with a small probability tail for 3 states.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of a surprise launch or a broader definition of "available to the general public."
   - **Tail Risks:** Consider the unlikely but possible scenario of a rapid launch in Texas or another state.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast assuming a surprise launch in Texas could argue for a higher probability of 3 states, but the lack of evidence for such a rapid timeline makes this less plausible.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the forecast should reflect a high probability of 2 states, with a small chance of 3 states due to the potential for a surprise launch in Texas.

P20: 2

# Forecasting Waymo's State-Level Expansion by January 1, 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use Waymo's own historical expansion rate as the primary base rate:

- Waymo launched its first public rider-only service in Arizona in 2020
- Added California (San Francisco, then Los Angeles) in 2023
- This gives a base rate of approximately 1 new state every 3 years, or ~0.33 states/year

The prior distribution is therefore centered around 2 states (the current number), with some probability mass on 3 states (if they add Texas by the resolution date) and minimal probability on higher values given the historical pace.

Mean of prior: ~2.3 states
Variance: Low (concentrated between 2-3 states)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Waymo continues to follow a methodical, safety-first expansion approach
- The company still faces the same regulatory hurdles and operational challenges
- The technical requirements for mapping and validating new service areas remain similar

**Differences from base case:**
- Waymo now has a more established playbook for launching in new markets
- The company has begun employee testing in Austin, TX, indicating progress toward a third state
- Recent focus has been on expanding within existing markets rather than adding new states
- The timeline to resolution (January 1, 2026) is very close, giving limited time for new launches

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher values:**
- Waymo has begun employee-only testing in Austin, TX (May 2024), a critical pre-launch step
- The company has announced mapping operations in Atlanta, GA (October 2024)
- Waymo has demonstrated operational maturity by expanding service areas in existing markets
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes 3 states approximately 2× more likely than without it

**Evidence supporting lower values:**
- Historical timeline from employee testing to public launch typically takes 6+ months
- No announced public launch date for Austin as of December 2025
- Focus on expanding within existing markets (Phoenix, LA, SF) rather than new states
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes staying at 2 states approximately 5× more likely than without it

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered on 2 states with some probability of 3:
- Prior: P(2 states) = 0.7, P(3 states) = 0.25, P(4+ states) = 0.05

After updating on the evidence:
- The employee testing in Austin increases P(3 states) by a factor of ~2
- The lack of announced launch date and typical timeline decreases P(3 states) by a factor of ~5
- Net effect: P(3 states) is reduced by a factor of ~2.5

Posterior:
- P(2 states) ≈ 0.85
- P(3 states) ≈ 0.14
- P(4+ states) ≈ 0.01

The posterior distribution is more concentrated on 2 states than the prior, with a smaller but still significant probability of 3 states, and a very small probability of 4+ states.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Waymo's ability to accelerate launches based on their growing experience
- A surprise "end of year" launch in Austin could occur for marketing purposes
- The definition of "available to the general public" might be ambiguous (limited area, waitlist, etc.)

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would place more weight on 3 states, arguing that Waymo's employee testing in Austin indicates a launch is imminent. However, this ignores the typical timeline from testing to public launch and the lack of a public announcement as we approach the resolution date.

**Tail risks:**
- Upside: Surprise simultaneous launches in multiple states (extremely unlikely)
- Downside: Safety incident or regulatory issue causing Waymo to pause all expansion plans

After consideration, I'll slightly increase the probability of 3 states to account for the possibility of a surprise year-end launch in Austin.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Here is a full probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is Waymo's own history of state-level expansion for its rider-only service.
- **2020:** First state launch in Arizona (AZ).
- **2023:** Second state launch in California (CA).

This history establishes a reference class of adding one new state approximately every three years, or a rate of ~0.33 states per year. For the forecast period of roughly one year (from late 2024 to January 1, 2026), this base rate would suggest a high probability of adding 0 or 1 new states. The prior distribution, based purely on this rate, would be heavily skewed towards the current number of 2 states, with a smaller probability of reaching 3. For example: P(2 states) ≈ 70%, P(3 states) ≈ 30%, P(≥4 states) < 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs significantly from a generic one-year period in Waymo's history, requiring a substantial update to the prior.

- **Similarity:** The fundamental process of launching in a new state remains slow, capital-intensive, and subject to significant regulatory hurdles. This supports the base rate's suggestion that rapid expansion is unlikely.
- **Key Difference:** We are not starting from a neutral position. As of late 2024, Waymo is already in the final pre-launch phase in a third state, Texas. Rider-only trips for employees began in Austin in May 2024. This is the last major step before a public launch. Therefore, the question is not "Will Waymo start and finish a new state launch in one year?" but rather "Will Waymo complete the final, relatively short stage of an already advanced launch?" This makes a third state far more likely than the base rate suggests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Several key pieces of evidence from the background and research report allow for updating the prior distribution.

- **Evidence for 3 States (Austin, TX launch):** The fact that Waymo has been conducting employee-only rider-only trips in Austin since May 2024 is extremely strong evidence. This phase typically lasts for several months to a year for final system validation and operational scaling before a public launch. With a full year remaining until the resolution date, a public launch in Austin is highly probable. This evidence dramatically increases the likelihood of an outcome of 3 or more states.
- **Evidence for 4 States (Austin + one more launch):** Waymo began mapping Atlanta, GA, in October 2024. This signals intent for a fourth state. However, the timeline from initial mapping to a full public launch is long (typically 1.5-2 years). For Atlanta to be publicly available by January 1, 2026 (a ~14-month timeline from mapping start), the process would need to be significantly accelerated compared to past launches. While possible due to a more mature "launch playbook," it is an aggressive schedule. This evidence makes an outcome of 4 plausible but far from certain.
- **Evidence for 2 States (No new launches):** This outcome would require a major negative event, such as a significant safety incident (akin to the 2023 Cruise event) leading to a company- or regulator-imposed freeze on expansion, or the discovery of a critical flaw during Austin testing that requires a major delay. This is a non-zero tail risk.
- **Evidence for ≥5 States:** This is highly improbable. It would require launching Austin, Atlanta, and another currently unannounced city within a year. This pace is inconsistent with all available evidence on Waymo's strategy and operational capacity.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Let's update the prior distribution conceptually.

- **Prior:** P(2) ≈ 70%, P(3) ≈ 30%, P(4) ≈ 0%.
- **Update 1 (Austin is in pre-launch):** This evidence makes the base case of staying at 2 states the exception, not the rule. The probability mass shifts dramatically upwards. The probability of *not* launching Austin by Jan 2026 is now the small tail risk. Let's model this risk of a major setback at 10%. This means P(≥3) is now 90%.
- **Update 2 (Atlanta is being mapped):** Now we assess the conditional probability of launching Atlanta *given* that Austin has launched. The ~14-month timeline is tight. I estimate the probability of successfully navigating mapping, testing, and regulatory approval in Atlanta within this window to be about 25%.
- **Posterior Calculation:**
    - **P(2 states):** The probability of a major setback that halts the Austin launch. I estimate this at **10%**.
    - **P(3 states):** The probability that Austin launches successfully, but Atlanta does not launch in time. P(3) = P(No setback) × P(Atlanta delayed) = 90% × (1 - 25%) = 90% × 75% = **67.5%**.
    - **P(4 states):** The probability that both Austin and Atlanta launch successfully. P(4) = P(No setback) × P(Atlanta succeeds) = 90% × 25% = **22.5%**.
    - **P(≥5 states):** Negligible, <1%.

This results in a posterior distribution heavily centered on 3 states, with a significant upside chance of 4 and a small tail risk of remaining at 2.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence in Austin Launch:** Am I too confident Austin will launch? A 10% chance of failure seems low. However, Waymo has a very cautious safety culture, and they would not have entered the employee-only phase without high confidence. The 10% risk accounts for external shocks (regulation) or major unexpected technical failures.
- **Underestimating Atlanta Timeline:** Could Waymo's "launch playbook" be more effective than I estimate? Perhaps they can run processes in parallel and accelerate the timeline. If the probability of an Atlanta launch were closer to 50%, the P(4) would rise to ~45%, making the forecast a near coin-flip between 3 and 4. However, the historical precedents and the introduction of a new climate (more rain in Atlanta) suggest a 25% chance is a more prudent estimate.
- **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible alternative is that the regulatory environment post-Cruise slows everything down more than anticipated, delaying both the Austin public launch and the Atlanta progress. This would shift probability mass from 4 down to 3, and from 3 down to 2. My current distribution (P(2)=10%, P(3)=67.5%, P(4)=22.5%) already accounts for this by making 3 the strong modal outcome and keeping a 10% chance of no progress. The forecast seems robust to this consideration.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The posterior distribution is P(2) = 10%, P(3) = 67.5%, P(4) = 22.5%. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is: P(X≤2) = 10%; P(X≤3) = 77.5%; P(X≤4) = 100%. The percentiles are derived from this CDF.
