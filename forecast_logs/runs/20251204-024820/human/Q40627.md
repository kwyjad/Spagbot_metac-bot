### Reference class & base rates
-   **Donald Trump's First-Term Approval Rating (2017-2021):** This is the most relevant reference class. Trump's approval was uniquely stable, operating within a narrow band (roughly 37% to 46%) for almost his entire term. The standard deviation of his daily approval in the FiveThirtyEight aggregator was ~1.5 percentage points. The 10-day change was typically less than +/- 1 point. This suggests a base rate of extreme stability, with the current value being the strongest predictor.
-   **Post-WWII Presidential Approval Ratings:** This class shows more volatility than Trump's, but approval is still a slow-moving variable. Over a 10-day period, a change of more than 1-2 points is rare outside of a major national crisis or event. This class reinforces the expectation of high inertia.
-   **Current Approval as the Base Rate:** Given the 10-day forecast horizon, the most powerful base rate is the current value itself. The question is not "What is a typical approval rating?" but "How much will the current 41.1% change in 10 days?" The historical base rate for change over such a short period is near zero.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-28] Background info notes approval at 41.1% with a net of -14. (→) — Establishes the current anchor point for the forecast. The consistency mentioned is key.
-   [2025-11-25] Trump issues standard Thanksgiving proclamation and message. (→) — Routine presidential actions that are already priced into public opinion. Unlikely to cause any shift.
-   [2025-11-24] Politifact reports Trump's approval is declining and near first-term lows. (↓) — Confirms the recent, slight downward trend noted in the background, suggesting momentum is slightly negative.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Partisan Polarization:** The primary driver of the stability in Trump's approval. His support has a high floor (~37-38%) and a low ceiling (~46-47%) due to deeply entrenched partisan identities. This is a large driver of *stasis*.
-   **Macroeconomic Data Releases:** Key reports like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the monthly jobs report can cause small, slow shifts in approval. A major surprise in either direction could have a small, immediate effect.
-   **Major News Events (Crises/Scandals):** This is the only mechanism that could cause a large, rapid shift. An unexpected foreign policy crisis ("rally 'round the flag" effect) or a significant administration scandal could move the needle by several points, but such events are unpredictable and have a low probability of occurring and impacting polls within this 10-day window.
-   **Presidential Actions & Rhetoric:** In this polarized environment, the marginal impact of Trump's typical statements is very small. They primarily reinforce existing opinions rather than persuading undecideds.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extreme Short Horizon:** The 10-day forecast horizon is the most critical difference. It minimizes the potential impact of accumulating events and maximizes the power of inertia, making the current rating an exceptionally strong predictor.
-   **Second-Term Dynamics:** Unlike his first term, Trump is now in his second. Presidents historically tend to see their approval ratings sag during their second term as political capital wanes. The recent downward drift is consistent with this historical pattern.
-   **Heightened Polarization:** Political polarization in the U.S. is even more intense now than during Trump's first term, likely making his approval ratings even less volatile and more "sticky" than the 2017-2021 reference class would suggest.
-   **Focus on a Specific Aggregator:** The question resolves to a specific model (Silver Bulletin), not "true" public opinion. This means we are forecasting the output of a model, which has its own inertia and may lag slightly behind real-world events.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A very tight distribution centered on the current approval rating of 41.1%, with a standard deviation of perhaps 0.5 points. This reflects extreme inertia (equivalent n > 200).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (→) **Inertia:** The historical stability of Trump's approval over short periods is an extremely strong force for stasis. (Large)
    -   (↓) **Recent Trend:** The background and Politifact source indicate a slight downward drift in strong approval and overall numbers. This suggests the immediate momentum is negative. (Small)
    -   (→) **Event Horizon:** The lack of any scheduled, high-impact political or economic events between now and Dec 14 removes any obvious catalyst for change. (Moderate)
-   **Net effect:** The posterior should remain very close to the prior. The evidence of a slight downward trend suggests a minor downward adjustment, moving the mean from 41.1% to a value in the 40.8% - 41.0% range. The variance should remain very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A significant, unexpected positive economic report (e.g., inflation falling sharply).
    -   A "rally 'round the flag" event where Trump is seen as a strong leader.
    -   A major legislative victory or successful bipartisan deal.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Any new, significant scandal involving the administration.
    -   A major, unforced political gaffe that alienates moderate voters.
    -   Worse-than-expected economic data (e.g., jobs or inflation).
    -   High-profile defections or public criticism from within the Republican party.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Black Swan Event:** The forecast assumes no major, unforeseen crisis (e.g., terrorist attack, natural disaster, market crash). Such an event would invalidate the assumption of inertia.
-   **Polling Aggregator Dynamics:** The resolution depends on Nate Silver's model. Changes to his model's methodology or the inclusion/exclusion of certain pollsters could shift the number independently of public opinion.
-   **Clustered Polling Release:** Sometimes polls are released in batches. If a cluster of polls that all lean in one direction (due to methodology or random chance) are released just before the resolution date, they could temporarily move the average.
-   **Data Lag:** Polling takes time to conduct and process. The aggregator on Dec 14 will reflect public opinion from the preceding days, not from that exact moment.

**Final Research Summary:**
Donald Trump's approval rating exhibits extreme inertia due to political polarization, a phenomenon that is magnified over a very short 10-day forecast horizon. The current rating of 41.1% is the strongest predictor, with a slight downward momentum suggesting the final number will be very close to, but likely fractionally below, this value.

To forecast Donald Trump's approval rating on December 14, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is Trump's current approval rating of 41.1%, given the historical stability of his approval ratings. This stability is characterized by a narrow range and low volatility, with a standard deviation of ~1.5 percentage points during his first term. The current approval rating serves as a strong anchor due to the short 10-day forecast horizon.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in terms of political polarization and the absence of major events that could cause significant shifts. However, the slight downward trend in approval ratings and the second-term dynamics suggest a minor deviation from the base case, potentially leading to a small decrease in the approval rating.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Inertia:** The historical stability of Trump's approval ratings over short periods strongly supports the current rating remaining stable. This is a large factor for stasis.
   - **Recent Trend:** The slight downward trend in strong approval ratings suggests a small likelihood of a decrease.
   - **Event Horizon:** The absence of scheduled high-impact events supports stability, with moderate influence.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 41.1% with low variance, the evidence of a slight downward trend suggests a minor downward adjustment. The posterior mean is adjusted to approximately 40.9%, with a very low variance reflecting the strong inertia.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as a black swan event or changes in polling methodology, suggests maintaining caution against overconfidence. The forecast should account for potential small shifts due to unforeseen events, but the likelihood remains low.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for Trump's approval rating on December 14, 2025, are as follows:

P10: 40.5  
P20: 40.7  
P40: 40.9  
P60: 41.0  
P80: 41.2  
P90: 41.4

# Forecasting Donald Trump's Approval Rating on December 14, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use Donald Trump's recent approval ratings as the most appropriate base rate. According to the background information:
- Current approval rating (as of November 28, 2025): 41.1%
- Current disapproval rating: 55.3%
- Net approval: -14 percentage points

Trump's approval ratings during his first term (2017-2021) were historically stable, typically ranging between 37% and 46%, with a standard deviation of approximately 1.5 percentage points. This stability appears to be continuing in his second term.

The mean of my prior is 41.1% (current value), with a standard deviation of about 1.5 percentage points, reflecting the historical volatility of Trump's approval ratings over short time periods.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Trump's approval ratings have historically shown remarkable stability due to intense political polarization
- The current political environment remains highly polarized, suggesting continued stability
- No major scheduled events between now and December 14 that would significantly shift public opinion

**Differences from base rate:**
- We're in Trump's second term, where presidents typically experience declining approval over time
- The background information indicates a recent downward trend in "strongly approve" ratings (reaching a second-term low of 24.0%)
- The forecast horizon is very short (approximately 10 days from the latest data point), which suggests even less volatility than the historical standard deviation

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for stability or slight decline:**
- "Trump's net approval rating has been hovering around -14 since last week" - indicates recent stability
- "I'd expect that consistency to continue through Sunday" - expert opinion suggesting short-term stability
- "The share of Americans who strongly approve of Trump is still decreasing" - indicates a negative momentum

**Evidence for potential changes:**
- The holiday season (Thanksgiving to Christmas) might reduce political attention, potentially stabilizing ratings
- No major scheduled events are mentioned that would drive significant changes
- The 10-day forecast window is extremely short, limiting the probability of major shifts

The likelihood ratio strongly favors a forecast very close to the current value, with a slight downward bias given the noted decline in "strongly approve" ratings.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 41.1% with a standard deviation of 1.5 percentage points, I'll update based on the evidence:

- The statement about "consistency" continuing suggests the distribution should be tighter than the historical standard deviation for such a short time period
- The declining "strongly approve" ratings suggest a slight downward adjustment to the mean

Applying Bayes' rule conceptually:
- Prior: Normal(41.1%, 1.5%)
- Likelihood: Evidence suggests stability with slight downward pressure
- Posterior: Normal(~40.9%, ~1.0%)

The posterior mean shifts slightly downward to account for the negative momentum in "strongly approve" ratings, while the variance decreases to reflect the short forecast horizon and explicit expectation of consistency.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating stability - unexpected events can occur (international crises, scandals, etc.)
- The holiday season might affect polling frequency or response rates
- Polling aggregation methodologies can change or be affected by which polls are released
- I might be underestimating the impact of the declining "strongly approve" ratings on overall approval

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major news event could cause a sudden shift (±3-5 points)
- A cluster of polls with methodological biases could be released just before December 14
- The declining "strongly approve" ratings could accelerate and pull down overall approval more significantly

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties
- I'll maintain the slight downward adjustment to the mean
- I'll ensure my tail percentiles reflect the possibility of unexpected events

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 39.5
P20: 40.1
P40: 40.7
P60: 41.0
P80: 41.4
P90: 41.8

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

The most appropriate base rate for this 10-day forecast is a distribution centered on the current known value, with a spread determined by the historical short-term volatility of Donald Trump's approval rating.

*   **Reference Class:** The daily change in Trump's approval rating during his first term (2017-2021). This period is characterized by extreme stability due to high partisan polarization. The 10-day change was typically less than +/- 1 percentage point.
*   **Anchor Point:** The background states the approval rating is 41.1% as of November 28, 2025. Given the short time until the forecast date (December 14, 2025), this is the strongest piece of information.
*   **Prior Distribution:** I will model my prior as a normal distribution centered at the current value of 41.1%, with a standard deviation of 0.6 points. This reflects the high inertia (low volatility) observed historically over 10-day periods. This implies roughly a 95% probability that the rating will stay within the 39.9% to 42.3% range, absent new information.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

*   **Similarities:** The primary driver of stability—intense partisan polarization—remains a dominant feature of the political landscape, and the research report suggests it may be even stronger now. This supports the use of a low-volatility prior. The extremely short 10-day forecast horizon makes inertia the most powerful force.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the current context. Unlike a random point in his first term, the background and research report both indicate a recent, slight downward trend. The background notes a decreasing share of "strongly approve," and a Politifact report confirms a recent decline. This suggests a negative momentum that was not always present in the base case.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

*   **Evidence 1: Current Downward Trend (↓):** The background states "the share of Americans who *strongly approve* of Trump is still decreasing," and the research report cites Politifact noting his approval is "declining." This evidence is more consistent with a final value slightly *below* 41.1% than above it. This suggests a downward adjustment to the mean of the distribution.
*   **Evidence 2: Extreme Inertia (→):** The historical stability of Trump's approval rating is the strongest factor. It makes large shifts in either direction highly unlikely over just 10 days. This evidence acts to keep the variance of the forecast distribution very low.
*   **Evidence 3: Lack of Scheduled High-Impact Events (→):** The research report notes the absence of major scheduled economic data releases or political events that would be likely to shift public opinion. This reinforces the inertia argument and makes a significant change even less probable.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**

*   **Prior:** Normal distribution with Mean = 41.1, Standard Deviation = 0.6.
*   **Update Step:** The primary evidence is the slight downward momentum. This pushes the center of my distribution down. A continuation of a slow drift over 10 days might result in a change of -0.1 to -0.3 points. I will update the mean of my distribution from 41.1 to 40.9. The evidence of inertia and lack of events confirms that the variance should remain low. I will maintain the standard deviation at 0.6, as it already represents a very stable system.
*   **Posterior Distribution:** My posterior is a normal distribution with a mean of 40.9 and a standard deviation of 0.6. The distribution is now centered slightly below the last known value, reflecting the negative momentum, while the spread remains narrow due to high inertia.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

*   **Alternative Scenarios:** What could cause a larger deviation?
    1.  **"Black Swan" Event:** An unexpected major crisis (foreign or domestic) could cause a "rally 'round the flag" effect (pushing approval up) or a major scandal could emerge (pushing it down). The probability of such an event occurring *and* being fully captured in polling data within 10 days is low, but it argues against an overly narrow distribution.
    2.  **Polling Cluster:** The aggregator could be updated with a batch of new polls that, by chance or methodology, all lean in one direction, causing a temporary shift in the average.
*   **Critique of Forecast:** My initial standard deviation might be too small, reflecting overconfidence in stability. While a major event is unlikely, the possibility of a 1-point swing due to polling noise or a minor event is plausible. My chosen standard deviation of 0.6 creates a P10-P90 range of about 1.6 points (from ~40.1 to ~41.7), which seems to adequately account for these low-probability tail risks without abandoning the high-confidence central scenario of minimal change. The downward shift of the median to 40.9 appropriately incorporates the evidence of negative momentum.

**6. Final Percentiles**

My final forecast is based on a normal distribution with a mean of 40.9 and a standard deviation of 0.6.

P20: 40.4

P60: 41.1
