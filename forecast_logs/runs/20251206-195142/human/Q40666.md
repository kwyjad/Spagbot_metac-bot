### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical base rate for resignations among Pakistan's superior court judges, particularly in protest?
    *   What is the total size of the relevant judicial pool (Supreme Court + 5 High Courts)?
    *   How severe is the 27th Amendment perceived as a threat by the judiciary, and what are the specific mechanisms of protest (individual vs. collective)?
    *   What are the incentives and disincentives for a judge to resign now versus staying on?
    *   What is the current political and institutional context? How are key actors like the Chief Justice, bar associations, and the government reacting?
    *   How does the short time remaining in the resolution period (Dec 6 - Dec 31) affect the likelihood of further resignations?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `"total number of judges Pakistan Supreme Court High Courts"`
    *   `"history of judicial resignations in Pakistan"`
    *   `"Pakistan Lawyers' Movement 2007 judge resignations"`
    *   `"Pakistan Bar Council statement 27th Amendment"`
    *   `"Supreme Court Bar Association reaction 27th Amendment"`
    *   `"Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa on 27th Amendment"`
    *   `"profiles of independent judges Pakistan judiciary"`
    *   `"political pressure on Pakistan judiciary 2025"`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The total number of superior court judges is approximately 160-170 (17 in SC, ~150 across the 5 HCs). Three have already resigned, representing ~2% of the total.
    *   Resignations, especially in protest, are historically very rare. The most significant recent judicial crisis was the 2007 Lawyers' Movement, but this involved the *sacking* of judges by a military ruler, not resignations in response to a constitutional amendment. The judges fought for reinstatement, not to resign. This makes the current situation highly unusual.
    *   The 27th Amendment is a fundamental restructuring of judicial power, widely seen as an existential threat to judicial independence by its critics (e.g., IBAHRI, resigned judges).
    *   The initial three resignations came from judges known for their independent and principled stances. This signals that the most ideologically committed have likely acted first.
    *   The remaining time is short (~3 weeks). Immediate, visceral reactions have likely already occurred. Further resignations would require new triggers or coordinated action, which takes time to organize.
    *   Key actors like the Chief Justice and the major bar associations have condemned the amendment but have not (as of now) issued a collective call for mass resignations, instead focusing on legal challenges and protests.

4.  **Drafting the Research Brief:**
    *   The brief will be structured according to the required format, integrating the synthesized findings to provide a clear, decision-useful analysis for the statistician.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Protest Resignations from Superior Courts (Global):** Resignations of senior judges in protest of government actions are extremely rare events in most judicial systems. When they occur, they are typically single-digit events tied to a specific, acute crisis. The base rate is likely less than one such event per country per decade.
*   **Pakistani Judicial Crises:** Pakistan has a history of executive-judiciary conflict, most notably the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement. However, this is an imperfect analogue. In 2007, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and ~60 other judges were *sacked* by a military ruler; they did not resign. They fought for reinstatement. This suggests a strong tradition of resistance, but not necessarily through resignation. The base rate for *protest resignations* in Pakistan is near zero, even during major crises.
*   **Total Pool of Judges:** The Supreme Court has an authorized strength of 17 judges. The five High Courts (Lahore, Sindh, Peshawar, Balochistan, Islamabad) have a combined authorized strength of approximately 150 judges. The total reference class pool is ~167 judges. The three resignations to date represent roughly 2% of this pool.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-10-21** 26th Amendment passed — ↑ — Increased government influence over judicial appointments, setting the stage for further executive consolidation and priming judicial discontent.
*   **2024-12-22** New Judicial Commission rules finalized — ↑ — Formalized the new, more executive-influenced process for judicial appointments, making the threat to independence more concrete.
*   **2025-01-25** Reference filed against LHC Justice Mirza — ↑ — Showed a willingness by the executive to use legal mechanisms (SJC) to pressure individual judges, potentially increasing the incentive to resign pre-emptively.
*   **2025-11-13** 27th Amendment passed and signed into law — ↑ (large) — The primary, acute trigger for the crisis. Fundamentally alters judicial power, making resignation a plausible response for principled judges.
*   **2025-11-14** Two SC judges (Shah, Minallah) resign in protest — ↑ (large) — Established a precedent and broke the collective inaction. Signaled the severity of the crisis and created a potential focal point for a resignation cascade.
*   **2025-11-15** One LHC judge (Mirza) resigns — ↑ — Showed the protest was not limited to the Supreme Court, broadening the scope of the crisis. Justice Mirza was already under pressure, suggesting this may be a mixed-motive resignation.
*   **2025-11-26** IBAHRI condemns the amendment — ↑ (small) — Provides international validation for the protesting judges' position, potentially emboldening others, but unlikely to be a primary driver of domestic decisions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Principled Stand/Conscience:** Judges with a strong commitment to judicial independence may feel they cannot ethically serve under the new constitutional framework. This was the primary driver for the first three resignations. (Effect: Large for a small number of judges, but diminishing).
*   **Resignation Cascade/Solidarity:** The initial resignations could lower the barrier for others to follow suit, creating a "wave." This requires coordination or a shared sense of a tipping point. (Effect: Potentially large, but has not yet materialized beyond the first few days).
*   **Coercive Government Action:** The new power to forcibly transfer High Court justices could be used punitively. A judge threatened with an undesirable transfer may choose to resign instead. (Effect: Moderate, as this is a potential future driver, not a current one).
*   **Institutional Inertia & Counter-Pressure:** The judiciary is a conservative institution. Many judges may believe they can better resist from within, or may be unwilling to sacrifice their careers, pensions, and status. The Chief Justice may be urging calm to prevent the institution's collapse. (Effect: Large, acts as a strong brake on resignations).
*   **Bar Association & Civil Society Pressure:** Organized and sustained protests by lawyers' bodies could create an environment where staying on the bench becomes untenable for some judges. (Effect: Moderate, depends on the intensity and unity of the bar associations).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Constitutional vs. Extra-Constitutional Action:** Unlike the 2007 crisis driven by a military dictator's decree, this change was passed as a constitutional amendment by parliament. This gives it a veneer of legality that is harder to challenge and makes resistance more complex than simply opposing an illegitimate order.
*   **Fundamental Restructuring:** The 27th Amendment is not just about personnel; it fundamentally strips the Supreme Court of its constitutional jurisdiction. This is arguably a more profound and permanent threat to the judiciary's role than the 2007 sackings.
*   **Precedent of Resignation:** The base rate was near-zero, but we now have three confirmed protest resignations. This has broken the taboo and established resignation as a valid form of protest in this specific crisis.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves at the end of December. The initial "shock" resignations occurred in mid-November. The window for immediate, emotional responses has largely closed. Any further resignations in the next three weeks are more likely to be the result of new provocations or a delayed, calculated decision.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Given the extreme historical rarity, a prior distribution for the total number of resignations should be strongly centered on a very low number (e.g., a Poisson distribution with a mean of 0.5-1). The "equivalent n" is low due to sparse historical data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   The 27th Amendment's severity: ↑ (large) - A powerful shock that makes the improbable plausible.
    *   The three initial resignations: ↑ (large) - Confirms the shock was sufficient to trigger the rare event and provides a new baseline of 3. The question is now about *additional* resignations.
    *   Passage of time since the amendment: ↓ (moderate) - The lack of a wider wave of resignations in the three weeks since the amendment suggests a large cascade is not imminent.
    *   Lack of a unified call for resignation from Bar Councils: ↓ (moderate) - A key coordinating mechanism for collective judicial action has not been activated in this specific way.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence dramatically shifts the distribution upwards from the near-zero prior. The posterior should be anchored at the 3 resignations that have already occurred, with a tail allowing for a few more. The central tendency for the *total* number should move from ~1 to perhaps the 4-6 range. The probability of a very large number (>10) remains low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The government using its new power to transfer a High Court judge, prompting a resignation.
    *   A major Bar Council (e.g., Pakistan Bar Council, SCBA) explicitly calling for judges to resign.
    *   Another senior, respected judge resigning, which could trigger a new, smaller wave.
    *   Statements from the current Chief Justice that are exceptionally critical of the government, signaling a breakdown of relations.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Chief Justice or other senior judges issue statements calling for institutional stability and working within the new system.
    *   Bar associations focus their efforts on legal challenges and street protests rather than pressuring judges to resign.
    *   The government offers concessions or opens a dialogue with the judiciary, lowering the political temperature.
    *   No further resignations occur in the next 1-2 weeks, indicating the initial shock has dissipated.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for judicial resignations in protest in Pakistan is extremely low, near zero, even during major crises like the 2007 Lawyers' Movement. The global base rate for protest resignations among senior judges is also very low, typically less than one event per country per decade. Given the rarity, a Poisson distribution with a mean of 0.5-1 is a reasonable prior for protest resignations.
   - Mean/Median: ~0.5-1 resignations; Variance: Low due to the rarity of such events.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The current situation involves a significant constitutional crisis, akin to past judicial crises in Pakistan, which could theoretically lead to resignations.
   - Difference: The 27th Amendment is a constitutional change rather than an extra-constitutional action, which complicates resistance. The amendment fundamentally alters judicial power, making resignation a more plausible response for some judges.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The passage of the 27th Amendment is a severe shock, increasing the likelihood of resignations (↑ large).
   - The three initial resignations confirm the shock's impact and establish a new baseline (↑ large).
   - The lack of a broader resignation wave in the weeks following the amendment suggests a limited cascade effect (↓ moderate).
   - No unified call for mass resignations from major bar associations (↓ moderate).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 0.5-1 resignations, the evidence of three resignations shifts the distribution upwards.
   - The posterior distribution is now anchored at 3 resignations, with a tail allowing for a few more, reflecting the potential for additional resignations but acknowledging the short time frame and lack of further immediate triggers.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast should account for the possibility of unexpected developments or coordinated actions that could lead to more resignations.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden escalation in government actions or a new call for resignations could increase the number significantly.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slightly wider distribution to account for tail risks, ensuring the forecast is not overly narrow.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted distribution for additional resignations is centered around 3-5, with a low probability of exceeding 10.
   - Percentiles are adjusted to reflect the potential for a few more resignations while maintaining a low likelihood of a large wave.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 4  
P60: 5  
P80: 6  
P90: 7

# Forecasting Judicial Resignations in Pakistan's Superior Courts

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I need to establish a prior distribution for judicial resignations in protest situations. The most relevant base rates are:

- **Historical judicial protest resignations in Pakistan**: Near zero outside the current crisis. The 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement involved judges being sacked rather than resigning.
- **Total pool of judges**: Approximately 167 judges across the Supreme Court (~17) and five High Courts (~150).
- **Current situation**: 3 judges have already resigned (2 Supreme Court, 1 High Court) since the 27th Amendment passed on November 13, 2025.

Given the extreme rarity of judicial protest resignations historically, a reasonable prior would be a right-skewed distribution with a mean of 0.5-1 resignations per constitutional crisis. However, since we already have 3 resignations, I'll use this as my anchor point for the prior.

My prior distribution is centered around 3-4 total resignations, with a right tail allowing for the possibility of more resignations but with rapidly diminishing probability.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The judiciary in Pakistan has historically shown resistance to executive overreach
- Constitutional amendments affecting judicial independence have occurred before
- Judges generally prefer to fight from within the system rather than resign

**Differences from base case**:
- The 27th Amendment is unusually severe, fundamentally restructuring judicial power
- Three judges have already resigned, establishing a precedent that breaks historical patterns
- The amendment was passed constitutionally rather than through extra-constitutional means
- The short time window remaining (Dec 6-31, 2025) limits the potential for a large cascade
- The amendment specifically targets the Supreme Court's constitutional jurisdiction

These differences suggest we should expect more resignations than the historical base rate would indicate, but the short remaining timeframe and institutional inertia will likely limit the total number.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting more resignations**:
- The severity of the 27th Amendment represents an existential threat to judicial independence (strong upward push)
- Three judges have already resigned, breaking the taboo and potentially triggering others (moderate upward push)
- International condemnation from IBAHRI provides moral support for resigning judges (weak upward push)
- The amendment gives the government power to forcibly transfer High Court judges, which might prompt pre-emptive resignations (moderate upward push)

**Evidence supporting fewer resignations**:
- Three weeks have passed since the amendment with no additional resignations (strong downward push)
- No unified call for mass resignations from Bar Councils (moderate downward push)
- Institutional inertia and career/pension considerations discourage resignations (strong downward push)
- The Chief Justice has not publicly supported resignations (moderate downward push)
- Only about 3 weeks remain in the resolution period (strong downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 3-4 total resignations, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **First update - Severity of amendment and initial resignations**: This shifts my distribution rightward, suggesting potentially more resignations. The likelihood ratio strongly favors higher numbers.
   - Prior mean: ~3.5 resignations
   - After update: ~5-6 resignations

2. **Second update - Time passed without additional resignations**: This is strong evidence against a large cascade. The likelihood ratio strongly favors lower numbers.
   - After first update: ~5-6 resignations
   - After second update: ~4-5 resignations

3. **Third update - Short remaining timeframe**: With only about 3 weeks left, the window for additional resignations is closing. This further reduces the expected number.
   - After second update: ~4-5 resignations
   - After third update: ~4 resignations

My posterior distribution is now centered around 4 total resignations, with a right skew allowing for the possibility of a few more, but with rapidly diminishing probability beyond 6-7 resignations.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the potential for coordinated action. If bar associations or opposition leaders call for mass resignations, we could see a sudden spike.
- I might be overweighting the importance of the time that has passed. Judges might be deliberating carefully and could act collectively after coordination.
- The government might take provocative actions using their new powers in the coming weeks, triggering new resignations.

**Alternative forecast**:
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 7-8 total resignations, assuming that the initial three are just the beginning of a broader movement. This would imply 4-5 additional resignations in the next three weeks.

**Rebuttal to alternative**:
The lack of additional resignations in the three weeks since the amendment suggests that the most principled and independent judges have already acted. The remaining judges are likely more institutionally oriented or pragmatic. Without new provocations or coordinated action, a large wave seems unlikely.

**Adjustment**:
I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for these considerations, particularly the possibility of coordinated action or government provocations triggering new resignations.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The relevant base rate is the number of protest resignations by superior court judges in Pakistan during a political crisis. Historically, this is an extremely rare event. Even during the most significant recent judicial crisis, the 2007 Lawyers' Movement, the conflict was characterized by judges being unconstitutionally removed and fighting for reinstatement, not by judges resigning in protest. Therefore, the base rate for protest resignations in any given two-month period is effectively zero, or extremely close to it. A reasonable prior distribution would be a Poisson distribution with a mean (λ) of less than 0.1, heavily concentrated on the outcome of 0.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs dramatically from the base case in several key ways:
*   **Nature of the Trigger:** The 27th Amendment is a fundamental, *constitutional* restructuring of the judiciary, stripping the Supreme Court of its core powers. This is arguably a more profound and permanent threat than the extra-constitutional dismissal of a Chief Justice in 2007. This makes resignation a more logical response for judges who believe the system itself is now illegitimate.
*   **Precedent-Setting Event:** The base rate has been shattered. Three judges have already resigned in protest in mid-November. This is a crucial difference; we are not forecasting from a baseline of zero. The event has already occurred, and the question is now about its magnitude. The prior assumption of rarity has been proven wrong in this specific context.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The forecast must account for the total number of resignations in November and December 2025. We know for a fact that three have already occurred. The task is to forecast any *additional* resignations between today (December 6) and December 31.

*   **Evidence Pushing the Forecast Up (more than 3):**
    *   **Severity of the Amendment:** The changes are so fundamental that they create a strong motive for principled resignation. This is the primary driver.
    *   **Initial Resignations as a Catalyst:** The resignations of two respected Supreme Court justices and one High Court justice could create a "solidarity" or "cascade" effect, lowering the barrier for others to follow.
    *   **Potential for Government Provocation:** The amendment grants the government new powers, such as forcibly transferring High Court judges. The use of this power against a specific judge before the end of the year could easily trigger another resignation.

*   **Evidence Pushing the Forecast Down (holding at 3):**
    *   **Time Lag:** The resignations occurred on November 14-15, in the immediate aftermath of the amendment's passage. Approximately three weeks have passed with no further resignations. This is strong evidence that an immediate, large-scale wave of protest resignations has not materialized and is unlikely to. The initial shock has likely dissipated.
    *   **Institutional Inertia:** The judiciary is a conservative institution. Many judges may be reluctant to sacrifice their careers, status, and pensions. The prevailing sentiment may be to resist from within the system rather than abandon it.
    *   **Lack of a Coordinated Call to Resign:** Key actors like the major Bar Associations have condemned the amendment but have not issued a unified call for mass resignations. Without such a coordinating signal, resignations are more likely to remain isolated, individual acts.
    *   **"First Mover" Profile:** The judges who resigned first were noted for their independent stances. It is plausible that those most ideologically committed to resigning have already done so.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My reasoning shifts from estimating the probability of a rare event to estimating the tail of an event that has already begun.

*   **Prior:** A strong belief that zero protest resignations would occur.
*   **Evidence:** The 27th Amendment is passed, and three judges immediately resign.
*   **Update:** This evidence completely overwhelms the prior. The distribution is now anchored at a minimum of 3. The key question is the probability of *additional* resignations (X) in the remaining 25 days of December.
*   **Posterior for X:** The time lag is the most significant piece of evidence. It suggests that X is likely to be small. I estimate the probability distribution for the *total* number of resignations (Y = 3 + X) as follows:
    *   P(Y=3) ≈ 60%. The most likely scenario is that the initial wave is over.
    *   P(Y=4) ≈ 25%. A single additional resignation, perhaps triggered by a specific government action or a delayed personal decision, is plausible.
    *   P(Y=5) ≈ 10%. Two more resignations are possible but less likely.
    *   P(Y≥6) ≈ 5%. A larger second wave would require a new catalyst, which is unlikely in the short time remaining.

This results in a posterior distribution with a mode and median of 3, but a mean of approximately 3.6, reflecting the right-skewed risk of a few more resignations.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily weighted towards the number of resignations staying at 3. Could I be wrong?
*   **Argument for a Higher Number:** I might be underestimating the level of coordination happening behind the scenes. Perhaps a second, delayed wave of resignations is planned for later in December to maximize political impact. A provocative government action, like the punitive transfer of a respected judge, could also be a catalyst that I am not sufficiently weighting.
*   **Argument for a Lower Number (i.e., a thinner tail):** My current model already has 3 as the most likely outcome. The argument for an even thinner tail is that the three judges who resigned were unique outliers, and the institutional pressure to stay on the bench is immense. The window for protest resignations may have effectively closed after the first week.
*   **Adjustment:** My distribution, with a 60% chance of no further resignations but a 40% chance of at least one more, seems to strike a reasonable balance. It acknowledges that the initial momentum has stalled while respecting the ongoing risk from a volatile political situation. I will not make a major adjustment.

### 6. Final Percentiles

Based on the posterior distribution derived above (P(3)=60%, P(4)=25%, P(5)=10%, P(≥6)=5%), the cumulative probabilities are: P(≤3)=60%, P(≤4)=85%, P(≤5)=95%. This translates to the following percentiles.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 4
P90: 5
