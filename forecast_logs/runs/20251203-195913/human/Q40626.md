### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern Capital Relocations (20th/21st Century):** Countries that have successfully initiated the process of moving their capital. Examples include Brazil (Brasília, 1960), Nigeria (Abuja, 1991), Kazakhstan (Astana, 1997), Myanmar (Naypyidaw, 2005), and Egypt (New Administrative Capital, ongoing). This has occurred roughly 10-15 times in the last 75 years, suggesting a global base rate of an announcement in any given country-year of well under 1%.
    *   **Base Rate Estimate:** 0.1% - 0.5% per year.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a rare, nation-defining, and enormously expensive event. The number of countries is ~200, and such an event happens perhaps once every 5-7 years somewhere in the world.
2.  **Capital Relocation Proposals in Large Nations:** Countries that have seriously debated but not (yet) acted on moving their capital due to megacity dysfunction. Examples include Indonesia (Jakarta) which has passed a law but faces delays, and past discussions in Mexico and South Korea. This class has a higher rate of *discussion* but a very low rate of *official announcement of a specific site*.
    *   **Base Rate Estimate (for announcement):** 1% - 3% per year, given serious, ongoing discussion.
    *   **Reasoning:** The political and economic hurdles are immense. For every country that acts, several others discuss it for years or decades without a concrete, official decision on a location. Iran has been in this class for over a decade.
3.  **Major Policy Announcements in Iran:** The rate at which the Iranian government makes definitive, large-scale, multi-decade strategic announcements. Given the political system's factionalism and need for consensus among key power centers (Supreme Leader, IRGC, Presidency, Majlis), such decisions are slow and deliberate.
    *   **Base Rate Estimate (for this scale of project):** Extremely low in any given month. Perhaps one such decision every 5-10 years.
    *   **Reasoning:** The system is designed for stability and resistance to radical change, not rapid, decisive action on non-emergency domestic policy.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[Hypothetical 2025-10]** President Pezeshkian's statement — ↑ — The new president explicitly revived the capital relocation debate, framing it as an ecological necessity, not an option. This puts the issue back on the high-level political agenda.
*   **[Hypothetical 2025-11]** Media reports on Tehran's worsening land subsidence — ↑ — Ongoing scientific reports and media coverage amplify the core justification for a move, increasing public and political pressure for a long-term solution.
*   **[Hypothetical 2025-11]** Majlis (Parliament) budget debates begin — ↓ — Initial discussions for the next fiscal year focus on inflation, sanctions relief, and social spending, with no mention of funding for a capital relocation feasibility study, signaling it is not a near-term fiscal priority.
*   **[Throughout 2024-2025]** No formation of a high-level committee — ↓ — Despite renewed talk, there is no evidence of the necessary first step: creating a formal, empowered body with a mandate to identify and propose a specific new location.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Ecological Imperative (Water Crisis & Subsidence):** The physical unsustainability of Tehran is a powerful, non-negotiable driver. This is the primary justification and its severity is increasing. (Size: Large, but acts over years, not weeks).
2.  **Presidential Will & Legacy:** President Pezeshkian has personally endorsed the idea. A new president may see this as a legacy-defining project, similar to other national leaders who have built new capitals. (Size: Moderate, as the Iranian presidency has limited power relative to other state institutions).
3.  **Economic Constraints & Sanctions:** The cost of planning, let alone building, a new capital is astronomical. Iran's economy is severely hampered by international sanctions, inflation, and mismanagement, making such an expenditure nearly impossible. (Size: Large, acts as a powerful brake).
4.  **Political Inertia & Veto Points:** The plan requires consensus from multiple, often competing, power centers, including the Supreme Leader, the IRGC (which has vast economic interests in Tehran), and the Majlis. Tehran's entrenched elite would also resist. (Size: Large, a very strong brake).
5.  **Geopolitical & Security Strategy:** Decentralizing government functions from Tehran, which is vulnerable to earthquakes and foreign attack, could be a powerful motivator for the security establishment. (Size: Moderate).
6.  **Bureaucratic Process:** Even with political will, the process of site selection, feasibility studies, and planning would take years. An announcement of a specific location cannot happen without this groundwork, which has not been done. (Size: Large, especially on a 1-month timeline).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Economic Duress:** Unlike oil-boom Kazakhstan or a rising Brazil, Iran is under a "maximum pressure" sanctions regime. Its financial capacity to undertake a multi-hundred-billion-dollar project is effectively zero, a stark contrast to the reference class of capital-movers.
*   **Severity of the "Push" Factor:** Tehran's combination of extreme water stress, world-record land subsidence, and high seismic risk creates a more urgent and severe set of push factors than faced by most other cities in the reference class.
*   **Decades of Precedent for Inaction:** The idea of moving Iran's capital is not new. It has been formally and informally debated since at least the 1990s. This long history of discussion without a decision establishes a strong local prior for "talk over action."
*   **Complex, Factionalized Power Structure:** Unlike the more centralized decision-making in Kazakhstan or Myanmar, Iran's power is diffuse. A presidential initiative can easily be stalled or vetoed by other powerful bodies like the Guardian Council or the Supreme Leader's office.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior based on the reference classes (e.g., 1-3% annual rate of announcement), implying a prior of <0.25% for a one-month period. The "equivalent n" is high (e.g., n=100) due to the strong historical pattern of inaction on this specific issue in Iran.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (small): Presidential rhetoric puts the topic on the agenda.
    *   ↑ (small): Worsening environmental data adds urgency, but this is a slow-burning fuse.
    *   ↓ (large): The absence of any allocated budget or formal planning committee is a strong signal against near-term action.
    *   ↓ (very large): The one-month time horizon is fundamentally incompatible with the multi-year bureaucratic and political process required for such a monumental decision.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. The posterior should remain very low, likely moving even closer to zero. The short timeline is the decisive factor.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An official decree from the Supreme Leader establishing a "Capital Relocation Council."
    *   A line item, however small, for "capital planning" or "site feasibility study" appearing in draft budgets.
    *   Public statements of support from high-ranking IRGC commanders.
    *   State media beginning a coordinated campaign to build public support for a move.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continued silence on the issue from the Supreme Leader's office.
    *   Statements from parliamentary leaders or economic ministers emphasizing prohibitive costs.
    *   The government's focus remaining entirely on immediate economic and foreign policy crises.
    *   President Pezeshkian's statement being framed by others as "aspirational" or "long-term."

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** What constitutes an "official announcement"? A statement by the President in a speech, or a formal cabinet decree or act of parliament? The resolution criteria require a *specific location*, which makes it a higher bar to clear.
*   **Symbolic vs. Substantive Announcement:** The government could announce a *plan to select a location* rather than the *location itself*. This would not meet the resolution criteria but could be misinterpreted.
*   **Opacity of Decision-Making:** The final decision will be made behind closed doors in Tehran, likely by the Supreme National Security Council or the Supreme Leader himself. Public indicators may be lagging or misleading.
*   **The Timeline is Key:** The one-month horizon (Dec 3, 2025 to Jan 3, 2026) is exceptionally short for any government to finalize and announce a decision of this magnitude. This constraint is the single most important factor in the forecast.

**Final Research Summary:**
While the ecological pressures on Tehran are severe and growing, the combination of immense economic constraints, deep-seated political inertia, and the extremely short one-month timeline makes an official announcement of a new capital location profoundly unlikely. The long history of discussion on this topic has consistently failed to overcome these same structural barriers.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a country announcing a new capital location is extremely low. Based on historical data, the global base rate for such announcements is approximately 0.1% to 0.5% per year. Given Iran's history of discussing but not acting on this issue, a base rate of 1% to 3% per year is more appropriate for Iran. For a one-month period, this translates to a prior probability of less than 0.25%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Iran has a history of discussing capital relocation due to ecological and infrastructural issues, similar to other countries that have moved capitals.
   - Differences: Iran faces severe economic constraints due to sanctions, and its political system is highly factionalized, making rapid decisions difficult. The short timeline further complicates the likelihood of an announcement.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Presidential Statement: The president's recent statement increases the probability slightly, as it puts the issue back on the agenda. However, without concrete actions, this is a weak signal.
   - Worsening Environmental Conditions: These conditions add urgency but are long-term issues, not immediate catalysts.
   - Lack of Budget and Planning: The absence of budget allocation or a planning committee is a strong negative signal, indicating no immediate action.
   - Short Timeline: The one-month period is incompatible with the bureaucratic process required for such a decision, strongly decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: Let's assume a prior probability of 0.25% for the one-month period.
   - Likelihood ratio: The evidence (lack of budget, short timeline) strongly suggests no announcement, reinforcing the prior.
   - Posterior odds: Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability remains very low, likely even lower than the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The forecast considers the possibility of a surprise announcement but finds it unlikely due to structural and temporal constraints.
   - Alternative Scenarios: A sudden geopolitical shift or internal political change could alter the landscape, but these are low-probability events.
   - Adjustments: Given the evidence and constraints, the probability remains low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and short timeline, the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, is extremely low.

Final: 0.1%

# Will Iran announce a new capital location before January 3, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for Iran announcing a specific new capital location within the next month (from December 3, 2025 to January 3, 2026).

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Countries that have relocated their capitals in modern times
- Countries that have seriously discussed capital relocation but not acted
- Iran's historical pattern of major policy announcements

Looking at modern capital relocations (Brazil, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Egypt), this is an extremely rare event globally - perhaps 10-15 occurrences in the past 75 years among ~200 countries. This suggests a base rate of less than 1% per country-year, or roughly 0.08% per country-month.

For countries actively discussing relocation (like Indonesia with Jakarta), the announcement rate is still very low - perhaps 1-3% per year or 0.08-0.25% per month.

Iran specifically has discussed moving its capital for decades without action, suggesting an even lower local base rate.

**Prior probability: 0.1% (1 in 1000)** for a one-month period, given Iran's history of inaction on this issue despite long-standing discussions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other countries considering relocation, Iran faces genuine ecological pressures (water scarcity, land subsidence)
- The capital relocation idea has been discussed for years, as is typical before actual decisions
- The political system requires consensus among multiple power centers

**Key differences:**
- **Economic situation:** Iran faces severe sanctions and economic constraints, making it far less capable of funding such a massive project than most countries that have relocated capitals
- **Timeline:** The one-month window is extremely short for finalizing such a monumental decision
- **Preparation:** There's no evidence of the necessary groundwork (site studies, budgeting, committee formation) that typically precedes an announcement
- **Political urgency:** While ecological problems are severe, they've developed over decades and don't create a crisis requiring immediate action within weeks

These differences, especially the economic constraints and short timeline, significantly reduce the probability below the already low base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's recent statement**
- P(E|H): If Iran were about to announce a new capital, the president would likely make preparatory statements = 0.9
- P(E|~H): If Iran were not about to announce, such statements might still occur as political rhetoric = 0.3
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- This moderately increases probability, but presidential statements alone are insufficient

**Evidence 2: Absence of budget allocation or planning committee**
- P(E|H): If an announcement were imminent, we would almost certainly see budget discussions and formal committees = 0.05
- P(E|~H): If no announcement is coming, we would expect no such preparations = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05
- This strongly decreases probability, as formal preparations are a necessary precursor

**Evidence 3: Worsening ecological conditions in Tehran**
- P(E|H): If an announcement were coming, we would expect worsening conditions = 0.8
- P(E|~H): If no announcement is coming, we would still see these conditions = 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 1.14
- This slightly increases probability, but the effect is minimal as these are slow-developing problems

**Evidence 4: Iran's economic crisis and sanctions**
- P(E|H): If an announcement were imminent, Iran would need some economic capacity = 0.1
- P(E|~H): Iran's current economic situation is consistent with no announcement = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- This strongly decreases probability, as the economic constraints are severe

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.001 / 0.999 ≈ 0.001

Updating with Evidence 2 (absence of preparations):
Posterior odds = 0.001 × 0.05 = 0.00005
Posterior probability = 0.00005 / (1 + 0.00005) ≈ 0.005%

Updating with Evidence 4 (economic constraints):
Posterior odds = 0.00005 × 0.11 = 0.0000055
Posterior probability = 0.0000055 / (1 + 0.0000055) ≈ 0.0005%

Even if we update with the positive evidence (President's statement and ecological conditions), the probability remains extremely low, below 0.01%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- I might underestimate the possibility of a surprise announcement driven by internal political factors not visible to outside observers
- There could be secret preparations that haven't been publicly reported
- The Supreme Leader could make a sudden decision for strategic reasons (e.g., security concerns about Tehran's vulnerability)

Alternative scenario: Iran might announce a symbolic "new administrative district" within or near Tehran rather than a full capital relocation, which could be done more quickly and cheaply.

However, even considering these possibilities, the fundamental constraints remain:
- The enormous cost during an economic crisis
- The need for extensive planning and site selection
- The extremely short one-month timeline
- The requirement for consensus among power centers

These factors make even the alternative scenarios highly unlikely within the given timeframe.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the extremely low base rate, the absence of necessary preparations, severe economic constraints, and the very short timeline, I assess the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026 to be extremely low.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a country officially announcing a new, specific location for its capital. This is a rare, monumental, and costly decision.

*   **Reference Class:** Countries that have seriously discussed or initiated a capital move in the 20th and 21st centuries (e.g., Brazil, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Indonesia).
*   **Frequency:** Such an announcement occurs globally perhaps once every 5-7 years. Among the ~200 countries, this gives a very low base rate for any given country in a given year.
*   **Refined Base Rate:** A more specific reference class is "countries with megacity problems under serious, public discussion for capital relocation." Iran has been in this class for over a decade. For such countries, the annual probability of moving from "discussion" to "official announcement of a specific site" is still low, but higher than for a random country. I estimate this annual probability to be around 2-4%.
*   **Prior for the Forecast Period:** The forecast period is one month (Dec 3, 2025, to Jan 3, 2026). Taking a 3% annual rate, the monthly base rate is approximately 3% / 12 = 0.25%.

My initial prior probability P(H) is **0.25%**. In odds, this is approximately 1-in-400.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
How does Iran's situation compare to the reference class (e.g., Kazakhstan in the 90s, Egypt recently)?

*   **Similarities:** The "push" factors are similar or even more severe: extreme water stress, world-record land subsidence, overcrowding, and high seismic risk in Tehran. The new President's public statements bring the issue to the forefront, which is a common trigger.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Economic Capacity (Strongly Negative):** Unlike oil-boom Kazakhstan or a developing Brazil, Iran's economy is severely constrained by international sanctions, mismanagement, and inflation. The financial capacity to undertake a project costing hundreds of billions of dollars is practically non-existent. This makes Iran far less likely to act than the typical case.
    *   **Political Structure (Strongly Negative):** Iran's power structure is factionalized, with multiple veto points (Supreme Leader, IRGC, Majlis). A presidential initiative is not sufficient. This contrasts with more centralized states like Kazakhstan or Myanmar where such decisions could be made by a small group or single leader.
    *   **History of Inaction (Negative):** This specific topic has been debated in Iran for decades with no concrete action, establishing a strong local track record of inertia.

Overall, Iran's specific circumstances make it significantly *less* likely to make such an announcement than the average member of the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence, particularly in the context of the very short, one-month timeline.

*   **E1: President Pezeshkian's statement that moving the capital is "no longer optional."**
    *   This evidence increases the probability slightly. It puts the topic back on the high-level agenda.
    *   P(E1 | H): High. An announcement would likely be preceded by such framing.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): Also quite high. Such statements are common in politics to show concern without committing to the immense costs of a solution.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) is slightly greater than 1.** This is weak positive evidence.

*   **E2: Absence of a formal committee or allocated budget for site selection/feasibility studies.**
    *   This is the most critical piece of evidence for the short timeline. Announcing a *specific location* requires a formal, technical, and political process of selection, which takes years.
    *   P(E2 | H): Extremely low. It is nearly impossible to officially announce a specific, vetted location if the preparatory bureaucratic work (committees, studies, budgets) has not been done.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): Extremely high. If no announcement is planned, it is the default state to not have these mechanisms in place.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) is very close to 0.** This is extremely strong evidence against an announcement happening via a normal, procedural path.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior:** 0.25% (or 1:399 odds).
*   **Step 1: Update with President's statement (LR ≈ 2).**
    *   The odds shift slightly in favor, perhaps to 2:399 (≈ 1:200). The probability rises to ~0.5%.
*   **Step 2: Update with lack of preparatory work (LR << 0.1).**
    *   This evidence is decisive for any "normal process" announcement. It effectively reduces the probability of a procedurally sound announcement in the next month to near zero.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 1:200 * (LR) ≈ close to zero.

The only remaining possibility for a "Yes" resolution is a non-procedural, surprise announcement, likely via a decree from the Supreme Leader. The forecast, therefore, becomes an estimate of the probability of this specific tail-risk scenario.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The entire process has been conducted in secret by a high-level body (e.g., the Supreme National Security Council or the IRGC), and the President's statement was the first step in a surprise rollout. The announcement could be used as a distraction from economic woes or to signal long-term strategic resolve.
*   **Plausibility:** This is plausible in an opaque political system like Iran's. The move of Myanmar's capital to Naypyidaw was also done with great secrecy and speed. Therefore, the probability is not absolute zero.
*   **Counter-argument:** Even a surprise announcement of this magnitude would be politically risky without building some consensus among the elite. Furthermore, announcing a *specific location* invites immediate, focused criticism and questions about logistics and cost, making it a less effective distraction than a vague promise.
*   **Adjusting the Forecast:** The forecast must account for this small, non-zero probability of a surprise decree. How likely is such a specific, monumental, and out-of-the-blue announcement in any given month? A 1-in-100 chance seems to be a reasonable estimate for such a high-impact tail risk. It is very unlikely, but not impossible. Given the integer constraint on the final answer, rounding a probability like 0.25% or 0.5% down to 0% would incorrectly imply impossibility.

### 6. Final Forecast
The combination of extreme economic constraints, political inertia, and a complete lack of observable preparatory work (committees, budget) makes a procedurally normal announcement of a new capital location in the next month virtually impossible. The probability of the event occurring rests entirely on the small chance of a sudden, top-down decree from the Supreme Leader. While this is a tail risk, it is not a zero probability. I assess this small chance to be in the range of 0.1% to 1%. Given the requirement for a single integer percentage, 1% is the most appropriate forecast to reflect that the event is extremely unlikely but not strictly impossible.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
For the event of Iran announcing a new capital location within a one-month period, I select the reference class of "Capital Relocation Proposals in Large Nations" from the research report, which includes countries like Indonesia, Mexico, and South Korea that have seriously debated but rarely acted on such moves. This class has a base rate of 1-3% per year for an official announcement of a specific site, based on historical patterns where discussions often span years or decades without resolution. Given about 10-20 such nations in ongoing debates globally, and perhaps 1-2 announcements per decade, this aligns with the estimate.

Why this base rate? It's more specific to Iran's situation than the global rate (0.1-0.5% per year), as Iran has been discussing relocation since the 1990s due to Tehran's megacity issues, similar to Jakarta's subsidence problems. However, the rate of actual announcements remains low due to high barriers. For a one-month window (1/12 of a year), this translates to a prior probability of about 0.1-0.25% (e.g., 2% annual / 12 ≈ 0.17%). In odds form: roughly 1:999 (very low).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that Iran fits the profile of a large nation with a dysfunctional megacity capital (like Jakarta in Indonesia), where ecological pressures (water shortages, subsidence) have led to repeated discussions but no swift action. For instance, Indonesia debated moving from Jakarta for decades before passing a law in 2022, but even then, implementation has been delayed.

Differences: Iran's case has more severe "push" factors (extreme subsidence at 35 cm/year and acute water crisis), which could accelerate urgency compared to milder issues in some base cases. However, Iran's economic sanctions and factionalized politics (involving the Supreme Leader, IRGC, and Majlis) create stronger barriers than in more centralized systems like Kazakhstan's. The ultra-short one-month timeline is a key difference—base cases typically take years for announcements, making this window unusually compressed and thus less likely. These differences matter by reinforcing inertia: while urgency might nudge probability up slightly in the long term, the short horizon and lack of preparatory steps (e.g., no committee) make it far less probable than the base rate suggests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Presidential statement (Oct 2025)**: This revives the debate, framing relocation as unavoidable. P(E | H) is high (near 1, as an announcement would likely follow high-level endorsement). P(E | ~H) is moderate (0.3-0.5, as presidents often make aspirational statements without follow-through). Likelihood ratio: ~2-3 (mildly increases probability).
- **Worsening environmental reports (Nov 2025)**: Amplifies urgency with data on subsidence and water loss. P(E | H) high (0.8-0.9, as crises often precede big decisions). P(E | ~H) also high (0.6-0.7, since reports happen regardless). Likelihood ratio: ~1.2-1.5 (slightly increases probability, but it's a slow driver).
- **No budget allocation or committee formation (ongoing)**: No fiscal or bureaucratic steps toward site selection. P(E | H) low (0.1-0.2, as announcements require groundwork). P(E | ~H) high (0.9, consistent with inaction). Likelihood ratio: ~0.1-0.2 (strongly decreases probability).
- **Short one-month timeline**: Bureaucratic processes for such decisions take years. P(E | H) very low (0.05, as rushed announcements are rare). P(E | ~H) high (1, normal for no action in short windows). Likelihood ratio: ~0.05 (dramatically decreases probability).

Overall, upward evidence is weak and qualitative, while downward evidence (economic constraints, inertia, timeline) is strong and structural, netting a low combined likelihood ratio (~0.1-0.3).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:599 (from ~0.17% probability: P(H) = 0.0017, odds = 0.0017 / 0.9983 ≈ 0.0017).

Apply likelihood ratios conceptually:
- First update for presidential/environmental evidence (combined LR ~2): Posterior odds = 0.0017 × 2 ≈ 0.0034.
- Major update for no groundwork/short timeline (combined LR ~0.1): Posterior odds = 0.0034 × 0.1 ≈ 0.00034.
- Posterior probability = 0.00034 / (1 + 0.00034) ≈ 0.034% (or ~0.03%).

This reflects a significant downward adjustment from the prior due to the dominant negative evidence. Confidence is high in the low probability due to the strong historical and structural brakes, but uncertainty remains from Iran's opaque politics (e.g., a surprise decree could happen, though unlikely).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the low end by underweighting tail risks, like a sudden geopolitical shift (e.g., sanctions relief enabling funding) or a seismic event in Tehran forcing rapid action—though these are improbable in one month. Blind spot: I could be over-relying on Western analogies, ignoring how Iran's theocratic system might enable top-down decisions faster than expected if the Supreme Leader intervenes.

Alternative forecast: A more optimistic view might put it at 1-2% (e.g., if focusing only on presidential will and crisis severity, assuming quick consensus). This is plausible if viewing Pezeshkian's statement as a tipping point, but rebutted by the lack of supporting indicators (no committee, no budget) and the one-month constraint, which historically dooms such rushed outcomes. To account for tails, I nudge up slightly to cover improbable scenarios, adjusting to ~0.05%.

Final: 0%
