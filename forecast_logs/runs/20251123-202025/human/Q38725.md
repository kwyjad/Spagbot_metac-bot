Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **What is the historical precedent for terminating major, bipartisan U.S. foreign aid initiatives?** This will establish the reference class and a base rate. How durable are programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) or PMI itself?
2.  **What are the specific mechanisms and powers the executive branch can use to terminate or functionally disable a program like PMI?** This involves understanding the interplay between Executive Orders, Congressional appropriations (the "power of the purse"), and the operational capacity of implementing agencies (USAID).
3.  **What is the current political and operational status of PMI as of late 2025?** I need to synthesize the provided sources to build a timeline of events, focusing on the impact of Executive Order 14169, the USAID layoffs, the lack of a waiver, and the FY2026 budget process.
4.  **How does PMI's political support compare to similar programs, specifically PEPFAR?** The fact that PEPFAR received a waiver while PMI did not is a critical piece of evidence. Understanding the reasons for this divergence is key.
5.  **What are the potential pathways for PMI to survive past the January 1, 2026 deadline?** This involves considering Congressional action (e.g., a Continuing Resolution with specific funding), legal challenges, or a potential reversal by the administration.

### **Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

1.  **For Precedent:**
    *   `US foreign aid programs terminated by president`
    *   `history of PEPFAR funding challenges`
    *   `bipartisan support for global health initiatives US Congress`
    *   `durability of presidential initiatives across administrations`
2.  **For Mechanisms:**
    *   `presidential authority to freeze appropriated funds`
    *   `Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and executive orders`
    *   `can a president unilaterally end a congressionally funded program`
    *   `USAID program termination process`
3.  **For Current Status (based on provided sources):**
    *   `analysis of Executive Order 14169 foreign aid`
    *   `impact of USAID layoffs 2025 on global health`
    *   `status of FY2026 State Foreign Operations appropriations bill`
    *   `congressional response to Trump foreign aid freeze 2025`
4.  **For Comparative Analysis:**
    *   `why PEPFAR received waiver EO 14169`
    *   `political coalition behind PEPFAR vs PMI`
    *   `George W. Bush Institute statements on PMI 2025`
5.  **For Survival Pathways:**
    *   `continuing resolution foreign aid funding 2025`
    *   `lawsuits challenging Executive Order 14169`
    *   `NGO advocacy to save President's Malaria Initiative`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

After reviewing the provided sources and simulating the search process, the key findings are:

*   **Low Base Rate, Extreme Circumstances:** Historically, major bipartisan initiatives like PMI are exceptionally durable. They are legacy-defining programs with deep support. However, the current situation is an extreme departure from the norm.
*   **Multi-pronged Attack:** The Trump administration is not just cutting funds; it is using a three-pronged strategy: (1) an executive order to freeze current operations, (2) bureaucratic dismantling of the implementing agency (USAID layoffs), and (3) a legislative push to eliminate future funding (proposed FY26 budget cuts).
*   **The Waiver is Key:** PEPFAR securing a waiver while PMI did not is a powerful signal. It indicates that either PMI's political coalition is weaker or the administration has specifically targeted it for elimination, viewing it as less critical or more symbolic of the type of aid it opposes.
*   **Operational Incapacitation:** The mass layoffs at USAID are a critical mechanism. Even if Congress were to restore funding, the agency may lack the personnel and institutional capacity to restart operations quickly. This makes the program functionally non-existent, which would meet the resolution criteria.
*   **Short Timeline:** With the deadline of January 1, 2026, only a few weeks away from the current date (November 23, 2025), the window for a successful counter-maneuver (e.g., a lawsuit or specific Congressional action) is extremely narrow. The government is likely operating under a Continuing Resolution (CR), and the administration would have significant leverage to block any specific language protecting PMI.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Major Bipartisan U.S. Global Health Initiatives:** This is the most relevant class, including programs like PEPFAR. These are typically created by one party, adopted and expanded by the other, and enjoy broad, durable support. The base rate for termination of such a program in any given year is extremely low, likely **<1%**. They are considered major foreign policy and soft power successes.
*   **Federal Programs Targeted for Elimination by a New Administration:** A broader class includes programs of any type that a new presidential administration, particularly one with a strong ideological agenda, seeks to eliminate. The termination rate here is higher, perhaps **5-10%**, but often fails due to Congressional resistance or bureaucratic inertia.
*   **Limitations:** This specific case involves a direct, multi-faceted assault on both the program and its implementing agency by the executive branch, making historical precedents less reliable. The combination of executive orders, bureaucratic dismantling, and budgetary pressure is highly unusual.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-01-20] President Trump signs EO 14169, pausing foreign aid and targeting USAID. ↑ — Initiates a hostile review and operational freeze, directly threatening PMI's existence.
*   [2025-02-01] PEPFAR receives a waiver from the foreign aid freeze; PMI does not. ↑↑ — A crucial divergence, signaling PMI is not considered essential enough for an exemption and is likely a specific target.
*   [2025-02-23] Mass layoffs begin at USAID, PMI's implementing agency. ↑↑ — Cripples the operational capacity to run the program, making it functionally non-existent even if funding were to be restored.
*   [2025-02-28] UN Foundation and other NGOs issue urgent statements. ↑ — Confirms the severity of the threat and the halt in operations, but advocacy has not yet yielded a policy reversal.
*   [2025-10-16] KFF reports the administration's proposed FY2026 budget eliminates PMI funding. ↑↑ — Signals clear, long-term intent to terminate the program through the most definitive legislative means.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Executive Order & Funding Freeze (Large):** The President's EO provides the immediate legal pretext to halt all program activities and fund disbursement, effectively shutting PMI down in the short term.
*   **Bureaucratic Dismantling (Large):** The mass layoffs at USAID are a powerful and difficult-to-reverse mechanism. A program cannot exist without the people and infrastructure to run it. This functionally terminates PMI's operations.
*   **Congressional Appropriations Process (Large):** The administration's proposal to zero-out PMI in the FY2026 budget is the ultimate kill switch. While Congress holds the power of the purse, overcoming a presidential veto or determined opposition in a polarized environment is difficult.
*   **"America First" Ideological Commitment (Moderate):** This provides the political rationale and sustained motivation for the administration's actions, making a reversal based on traditional foreign policy arguments less likely.
*   **Targeted Selection (Moderate):** The decision to grant PEPFAR a waiver but not PMI suggests a specific animus or strategic choice to make an example of PMI, reducing its chances of survival relative to peers.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct Executive Hostility:** Unlike previous administrations which championed PMI, the current executive branch is actively and publicly hostile to the program's existence.
*   **Attack on Implementing Agency:** The base rate assumes a functional bureaucracy. Here, PMI's parent agency (USAID) is being systematically dismantled, an attack on the system itself, not just one program.
*   **Speed and Severity:** The actions taken since January 2025—an immediate freeze, mass layoffs, public website takedown—are far more rapid and severe than a typical budgetary decline or program reorganization.
*   **Erosion of Bipartisan Shield:** While latent bipartisan support for PMI exists, its power to constrain a determined executive in a hyper-partisan environment appears significantly diminished.
*   **Lack of a High-Profile Champion:** Unlike PEPFAR, which has often been vocally defended

To forecast whether the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) will cease to exist before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Historically, major bipartisan U.S. foreign aid initiatives like PMI have been durable, with a very low termination rate. However, given the current administration's actions, a broader class of federal programs targeted for elimination by a new administration might be more relevant. This suggests a higher base rate of 5-10%.
   - **Chosen Prior:** Given the extreme circumstances and the administration's actions, I will start with a prior probability of 10% that PMI will cease to exist.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** PMI is a major bipartisan initiative, similar to PEPFAR, which historically enjoys strong support.
   - **Differences:** The current administration is actively targeting PMI through executive orders, budget proposals, and operational incapacitation, which is atypical for such programs.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Executive Order 14169:** This order directly targets PMI, increasing the likelihood of its termination. Likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
   - **USAID Layoffs:** The mass layoffs severely impact PMI's operational capacity, further increasing the likelihood of termination. Likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
   - **No Waiver for PMI:** Unlike PEPFAR, PMI did not receive a waiver, indicating a higher risk of termination. Likelihood ratio greater than 1.
   - **Proposed FY2026 Budget Cuts:** The proposal to eliminate PMI funding is a strong indicator of intent to terminate. Likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence, let's assume a combined likelihood ratio of 5:1.
   - **Posterior Odds:** 1:9 × 5 = 5:9.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 5 / (5 + 9) = 5/14 ≈ 35.7%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be overconfident given the historical durability of such programs. However, the evidence is strong and multifaceted.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A potential Congressional intervention or legal challenge could save PMI, but the short timeline and current political climate make this unlikely.
   - **Rebuttals:** The administration's actions are unprecedented, and PMI's lack of a waiver is a critical signal of vulnerability.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the strong evidence and the unusual circumstances, the probability that PMI will cease to exist before January 1, 2026, is adjusted to reflect the significant risk.

Final: 36%

# Will the President's Malaria Initiative program cease to exist before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for the likelihood that a major U.S. global health initiative would cease to exist within a specific timeframe.

The most appropriate reference class is "major bipartisan U.S. global health initiatives," which includes programs like PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and PMI itself. These programs typically:
- Are created with strong executive support
- Gain bipartisan congressional backing
- Become institutionalized within the foreign policy apparatus
- Develop constituencies both domestically and internationally

Historically, such programs have been extremely durable. Since the creation of major global health initiatives like PEPFAR (2003) and PMI (2005), none have been completely terminated. They may face budget fluctuations or reorganizations, but complete elimination is rare.

Given this historical pattern, I would estimate a base rate of approximately **5%** for such a program ceasing to exist in any given year. This reflects the strong institutional inertia and bipartisan support these programs typically enjoy.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- PMI remains a program with a strong track record of success (credited with saving ~940,000 lives)
- It was created by a Republican president (Bush) and continued under both Democratic and Republican administrations
- It addresses a clear global health need with measurable outcomes

**Critical differences:**
- The Trump administration has explicitly targeted foreign aid programs through Executive Order 14169
- Unlike PEPFAR, PMI did not receive a waiver from the foreign aid freeze
- USAID, which operates PMI, is undergoing mass layoffs (beginning February 23, 2025)
- The PMI website is already down (showing an error message)
- The timeline is extremely short - we're evaluating whether PMI will cease to exist in just over a month (by January 1, 2026)

These differences significantly increase the likelihood of PMI ceasing to exist compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Executive Order 14169 targeting foreign aid and USAID specifically**
- P(E|H): If PMI will cease to exist, we would very likely see an executive order targeting it = ~0.9
- P(E|~H): If PMI will continue, such a targeting executive order would be unlikely = ~0.2
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5 (strong evidence for cessation)

**Evidence 2: PEPFAR received a waiver on February 1, but PMI did not**
- P(E|H): If PMI will cease to exist, we would expect it not to receive a waiver = ~0.95
- P(E|~H): If PMI will continue, the lack of a waiver would be surprising = ~0.3
- Likelihood ratio: 3.17 (strong evidence for cessation)

**Evidence 3: Mass layoffs at USAID beginning February 23, 2025**
- P(E|H): If PMI will cease to exist, we would expect implementing agency layoffs = ~0.9
- P(E|~H): If PMI will continue, such extensive layoffs would be unlikely = ~0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 3.6 (strong evidence for cessation)

**Evidence 4: PMI website already showing error message**
- P(E|H): If PMI will cease to exist, we would expect its online presence to deteriorate = ~0.8
- P(E|~H): If PMI will continue, website issues might still occur but less likely = ~0.4
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0 (moderate evidence for cessation)

**Evidence 5: Short timeframe until January 1, 2026 (about 5 weeks from current date)**
- P(E|H): If PMI will cease to exist, a short timeframe gives little opportunity for intervention = ~0.8
- P(E|~H): If PMI will continue, we would expect more time for congressional or legal action = ~0.5
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6 (moderate evidence for cessation)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior probability of 5% that PMI will cease to exist:

Prior odds = 0.05 / 0.95 = 0.0526

Applying the first piece of evidence (Executive Order 14169):
Posterior odds = 0.0526 × 4.5 = 0.237

Converting back to probability:
P = 0.237 / (1 + 0.237) = 0.192 or ~19%

Applying the second piece of evidence (lack of waiver):
Posterior odds = 0.237 × 3.17 = 0.751

Converting back to probability:
P = 0.751 / (1 + 0.751) = 0.429 or ~43%

Applying the third piece of evidence (USAID layoffs):
Posterior odds = 0.429 / 0.571 × 3.6 = 2.7

Converting back to probability:
P = 2.7 / (1 + 2.7) = 0.73 or ~73%

Applying the fourth piece of evidence (website down):
Posterior odds = 2.7 × 2.0 = 5.4

Converting back to probability:
P = 5.4 / (1 + 5.4) = 0.84 or ~84%

Applying the fifth piece of evidence (short timeframe):
Posterior odds = 5.4 × 1.6 = 8.64

Converting back to probability:
P = 8.64 / (1 + 8.64) = 0.896 or ~90%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Let me critically evaluate this forecast:

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- I may be overestimating the administration's ability to completely terminate a program in such a short timeframe
- Congressional appropriations could specifically protect PMI funding
- Legal challenges might temporarily preserve the program
- The resolution criteria require complete cessation, not just operational disruption

**Alternative scenarios:**
- PMI could be nominally preserved but with drastically reduced funding and scope
- It could be folded into another program rather than eliminated entirely
- A last-minute political compromise could preserve core functions

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for PMI's survival would be that Congress, through a continuing resolution or omnibus spending bill, explicitly protects PMI funding despite executive opposition. Additionally, legal challenges might temporarily block the administration's ability to terminate the program.

**Rebuttals:**
- The administration has multiple mechanisms to functionally disable PMI even with appropriated funds
- The mass layoffs at USAID create an operational reality where the program cannot function
- The lack of a waiver (unlike PEPFAR) suggests PMI is specifically targeted
- The short timeframe makes congressional or legal intervention difficult

Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the possibility of nominal continuation despite functional cessation. I'll adjust from 90% to 85%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Based on the historical durability of major global health initiatives (base rate), but strongly updated by the specific evidence of Executive Order 14169, the lack of a waiver for PMI, ongoing USAID layoffs, the non-functioning website, and the short timeframe until the resolution date, I forecast an 85% probability that the President's Malaria Initiative will cease to exist before January 1, 2026.

Final: 85%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
*   **Reference Class:** Major, bipartisan U.S. global health initiatives. This class includes programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) itself. These programs are typically created by a president from one party, then adopted and expanded by subsequent administrations of both parties, enjoying broad and durable support.
*   **Reasoning:** Historically, these programs are exceptionally resilient. They are often seen as legacy-defining achievements and key instruments of American soft power. In the last 20+ years, no program of this stature has been terminated. The base rate of such a program ceasing to exist in any given year is therefore extremely low.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will set a prior probability of **2%** for PMI ceasing to exist in the given timeframe. This is slightly higher than a raw historical frequency of zero to account for the inherent possibility of major policy shifts with new administrations. In odds, this is 2:98, or approximately 1-to-49 odds against termination.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** PMI fits the profile of the reference class perfectly—it was a signature initiative of a Republican president (George W. Bush), has operated for two decades, and has a track record of success credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives.
*   **Differences:** The current situation deviates dramatically from the historical norm.
    *   **Executive Hostility:** The base case assumes a neutral-to-supportive executive branch. The current scenario involves an administration that is actively hostile, having issued Executive Order 14169 to freeze foreign aid and specifically targeting PMI's implementing agency, USAID.
    *   **Operational Sabotage:** The base case assumes a functional bureaucracy. The mass layoffs at USAID are not just a funding cut but an attack on the operational capacity to run the program. A program cannot exist if there is no one to administer it.
    *   **Targeted Action:** The administration's actions are not a blanket cut. The decision to grant a waiver to PEPFAR while denying one to PMI is a crucial distinction, indicating PMI has been specifically selected for elimination.

These differences are so profound that the low base rate will serve as a starting point to be almost entirely overwhelmed by the specific evidence.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "PMI will cease to exist before Jan 1, 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Executive Order 14169 freezing aid and targeting USAID.**
    *   This is a necessary first step if the goal is to terminate PMI (P(E|H) is high). It is highly unlikely if the goal was for PMI to continue normally (P(E|~H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (increases the probability).

*   **Evidence 2: PEPFAR receives a waiver, but PMI does not.**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. If the administration intended to terminate PMI while preserving other, more politically powerful programs, this is exactly the strategy they would use (P(E|H) is very high). If they intended PMI to survive, it is extremely unlikely they would single it out for non-exemption (P(E|~H) is very low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors H (massively increases the probability).

*   **Evidence 3: Mass layoffs at USAID.**
    *   A program cannot function without personnel. Gutting the implementing agency is a direct and effective method of termination (P(E|H) is very high). An administration would not do this if it wanted the program to continue (P(E|~H) is extremely low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors H (massively increases the probability).

*   **Evidence 4: The short timeline.** The question is being evaluated in late 2025 for a Jan 1, 2026 resolution.
    *   The program has been functionally inert since February 2025. With only weeks remaining, the inertia of the current situation makes a reversal extremely difficult. Any legislative or legal remedy would be slow.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (increases the probability).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:49 against termination (a 2% probability), we update with the evidence.

1.  **Prior Odds:** 1:49
2.  **Update with Evidence 2 (No Waiver for PMI):** This is a powerful signal. Let's estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of 20 (i.e., this specific event is 20 times more likely if PMI is being terminated than if it's not).
    *   Posterior Odds = 1:49 × 20 = 20:49 ≈ 1:2.5
    *   This alone moves the probability from 2% to about 28%.
3.  **Update with Evidence 3 (USAID Layoffs):** This is an even more direct mechanism of termination. Let's assign another strong likelihood ratio, say 25.
    *   New Posterior Odds = 20:49 × 25 = 500:49 ≈ 10:1
    *   New Posterior Probability = 10 / (1 + 10) ≈ 91%.

The combined weight of the evidence—the hostile EO, the specific targeting by withholding a waiver, the operational dismantling of its agency, and the public signals like the website being down—is overwhelming. The low prior is completely swamped, pushing the probability of termination very high.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Plausible Path to Survival:** The main counterargument is that Congress holds the "power of the purse." A bipartisan coalition could, in theory, force funding for PMI into a must-pass government funding bill before the end of the year. This could create a high-stakes standoff with the White House.
*   **Rebuttal:** This scenario is unlikely to succeed. First, the timeline is extremely tight. Second, even if Congress appropriates funds, the executive branch has significant power to slow-walk or obstruct their use, especially when the implementing agency (USAID) has been severely weakened by layoffs. A line item in a budget cannot instantly recreate a functioning program. Third, the President could veto the bill, and overriding that veto would be very difficult in a polarized environment.
*   **Alternative Interpretation:** Could "cease to exist" be interpreted strictly as formal deauthorization by Congress? Under this view, the program might exist "on the books" even if it's non-operational. However, the resolution criteria include "the initiative being terminated" and functionally ceasing to operate as a distinct organization. The current state of affairs, with a funding freeze and no staff, appears to meet this criterion. The program is, for all practical purposes, already non-existent.

The risk of being wrong here comes from underestimating the power of Congressional pushback or a successful, rapid legal challenge. However, given the evidence, these are tail risks. The central scenario is that the administration's actions have already effectively terminated the program.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for terminating a major, successful, bipartisan program like PMI is very low. However, the evidence presented is exceptional and points uniformly toward a determined and effective effort by the executive branch to eliminate the program. The specific targeting of PMI (by denying it a waiver granted to PEPFAR) combined with the operational crippling of its parent agency (USAID) constitutes a fatal blow. With the resolution date just weeks away, the chances of a successful reversal are minimal. The program is functionally non-existent, and this state is overwhelmingly likely to persist past the deadline.

Final: 94%
