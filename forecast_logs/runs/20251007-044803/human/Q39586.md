### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia "President's Party" Curse:** In the 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections held since 1977, the party holding the White House has lost 11 times. The only exception was in 2013 (Terry McAuliffe, D). This establishes a strong reference class base rate of ~92% for a Republican victory in 2025, assuming the current Democratic president is still in office. This is the most specific and powerful historical pattern for the Virginia race.
*   **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (Modern Era):** In the last six gubernatorial elections in New Jersey (since 2001), Democrats have won four times (2001, 2005, 2017, 2021) and Republicans have won twice (2009, 2013). This suggests a baseline probability of a Democratic win of ~67%. While NJ is a solidly blue state in federal elections, its gubernatorial races are often more competitive.
*   **U.S. Off-Year Gubernatorial Elections:** These elections often serve as a referendum on the sitting president's performance. The president's party typically faces headwinds, especially if the president's approval rating is below 50%. This class is broader but reinforces the negative environment for the president's party (Democrats) in both states.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-03** WaPo-Schar School poll shows Spanberger (D) leading Earle-Sears (R) by 12 points (52-40) in Virginia. **(↑ for Both/Only VA)** — A large lead from a reputable pollster this close to the election is a very strong signal, directly challenging the historical "curse" base rate.
*   **2025-10-03** John Zogby Strategies poll shows Sherrill (D) leading Ciattarelli (R) by 8 points (50-42) in New Jersey. **(↑ for Both/Only NJ)** — Corroborates other polling, indicating a stable and significant lead for the Democrat.
*   **2025-09-30** Fox News poll shows Sherrill (D) leading Ciattarelli (R) by 8 points (50-42) in New Jersey. **(↑ for Both/Only NJ)** — Reinforces the consensus of a high single-digit Democratic lead, reducing the likelihood that any single poll is an outlier.
*   **2025-08-21** Rutgers-Eagleton poll shows Sherrill (D) leading Ciattarelli (R) by 9 points (44-35) in New Jersey. **(↑ for Both/Only NJ)** — Demonstrates the durability of Sherrill's lead over several months, suggesting it is not a recent, transient phenomenon.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **National Political Environment:** The approval rating of the sitting Democratic president is a primary driver. A low rating creates strong headwinds for both Democratic candidates, depressing turnout and persuading swing voters. (Size: Large)
*   **Candidate Quality and Ideological Fit:** Spanberger's profile as a moderate former CIA agent who has won competitive congressional races is a strong asset in purple Virginia. Ciattarelli's near-win in 2021 shows he can appeal to NJ's electorate, but being a repeat candidate can also be a liability. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Off-Year Election Turnout:** Gubernatorial elections in odd-numbered years have much lower and more unpredictable turnout than federal elections. The party that is more successful at motivating its base and persuading low-propensity voters will have a significant advantage. (Size: Large)
*   **State-Level Incumbency (Party):** In New Jersey, eight years of Democratic Governor Phil Murphy could lead to voter fatigue or a desire for change, a dynamic that helped Ciattarelli in 2021. In Virginia, the GOP holds the governorship, which may temper the anti-presidential-party effect slightly. (Size: Small to Moderate)
*   **Campaign Fundraising and Spending:** A significant financial advantage allows for greater ad buys and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts in the final weeks, which can be decisive in a close race. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Virginia Polling vs. Historical Trend:** The most significant difference is the current polling, which shows Spanberger with a double-digit lead. This is a direct and powerful contradiction of the ~92% base rate of the president's party losing the Virginia governorship.
*   **Candidate Profile in Virginia:** Abigail Spanberger is arguably a stronger-than-average Democratic candidate for Virginia. Her background and moderate positioning are well-suited to the state's suburban swing voters, potentially allowing her to overcome the national headwinds that drive the historical trend.
*   **Repeat Challenger in New Jersey:** Jack Ciattarelli is not a generic Republican. He is a known quantity who came within 3 points of winning in 2021. This prior performance makes the race potentially more competitive than a generic D vs. R matchup in a blue state would suggest.
*   **Absence of a GOP Wave Environment (as of Oct 2025):** The 2021 elections (where the GOP won in VA and nearly won in NJ) occurred in a strong pro-GOP environment. The current polling does not suggest a similar "wave" is building, making the 2021 results a less reliable guide for 2025.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference classes, a plausible prior would be a high probability of a Republican win in Virginia and a moderate probability of a Democratic win in New Jersey. The modal prior outcome would be "Only New Jersey." (Equivalent n: ~10-12 for VA trend, ~6 for NJ races).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** Consistent, recent polling showing a 12-point Spanberger lead in VA. This is the single most important piece of new evidence and it strongly counters the historical prior.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Consistent, recent polling showing an 8-9 point Sherrill lead in NJ. This reinforces the prior that NJ leans Democratic.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Spanberger's strong candidate profile, providing a causal story for why the historical VA trend might break this cycle.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance, a reminder that NJ gubernatorial races can be tighter than polls suggest and that he is a capable challenger.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence from Virginia is strong enough to overwhelm the historical prior, moving the forecast from a likely GOP win to a likely Democratic win. The evidence from New Jersey reinforces the prior. The posterior should move decisively toward "Both elections" being the most probable outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Democrats):**
    *   Final polling averages in both states showing stable or widening Democratic leads.
    *   Reports of high Democratic enthusiasm or early voting turnout.
    *   A major gaffe or scandal involving Earle-Sears or Ciattarelli.
    *   An uptick in the national approval rating of the Democratic president.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Republicans):**
    *   Polling averages tightening to mid-single digits or less, especially in Virginia.
    *   A significant national event (e.g., economic downturn, foreign policy crisis) that damages the Democratic party brand.
    *   Evidence of a "shy" Republican voter effect, where polls understate GOP support (as seen in NJ 2021).
    *   Major Republican figures (e.g., popular former governors) campaigning effectively for Earle-Sears or Ciattarelli.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Polling Error:** Off-year election polls are notoriously difficult due to challenges in modeling a lower-turnout electorate. Polls in the 2021 NJ race, for example, overstated the Democratic lead. A systematic error in the 2025 polls is a key risk.
*   **The Virginia "Curse" is Real:** The historical trend in Virginia is not spurious; it reflects a consistent pattern of voter behavior. Dismissing it entirely based on polling that is four weeks out is risky. The electorate could "snap back" to the historical pattern by election day.
*   **Late-Breaking Events:** With one month to go, a major event could fundamentally alter the dynamics of either race.
*   **Turnout Asymmetry:** The "enthusiasm gap" is critical. If one party's base is significantly more motivated than the other's, it can produce a result that defies polling averages.

### Final Research Summary
Current evidence, dominated by significant and stable polling leads in both states, points toward the Democrats winning both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections. While a powerful historical trend favors the Republican in Virginia, the magnitude of the Democratic polling lead there suggests this is the year the trend is most likely to break.

To forecast the outcome of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to update our probabilities based on historical data and recent polling evidence.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Virginia:** Historically, Virginia has elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President in 11 out of the last 12 elections (~92% probability of a Republican win if a Democrat is President). However, given the current polling, we will adjust this base rate.
- **New Jersey:** Democrats have won 4 out of the last 6 gubernatorial elections (~67% probability of a Democratic win).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia:** The historical trend strongly favors Republicans, but current polling shows Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading by 12 points. This is a significant deviation from the historical pattern.
- **New Jersey:** The historical trend is less pronounced, and current polling shows Democrat Mikie Sherrill leading by 8-9 points, aligning with the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia Polling:** A 12-point lead for Spanberger is a strong indicator that the historical trend may not hold this year. The likelihood of such a lead occurring if the historical trend were to continue is low.
- **New Jersey Polling:** Consistent 8-9 point leads for Sherrill suggest a stable Democratic advantage, making it likely that the Democrats will win.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia:** 
  - Prior odds for a Republican win: 92% / 8% = 11.5
  - Likelihood ratio (polling evidence): Assume a strong likelihood ratio of 0.2 (since a 12-point lead is significant).
  - Posterior odds = 11.5 * 0.2 = 2.3
  - Posterior probability for a Republican win = 2.3 / (1 + 2.3) ≈ 70%
  - Therefore, the probability of a Democratic win in Virginia is 30%.

- **New Jersey:**
  - Prior odds for a Democratic win: 67% / 33% = 2
  - Likelihood ratio (polling evidence): Assume a likelihood ratio of 0.5 (consistent polling lead).
  - Posterior odds = 2 * 0.5 = 1
  - Posterior probability for a Democratic win = 1 / (1 + 1) = 50%
  - Therefore, the probability of a Democratic win in New Jersey is 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Virginia:** The historical trend is strong, but the polling lead is significant. Consider the possibility of polling error or late-breaking events.
- **New Jersey:** Polling errors in past elections suggest caution, but the consistent lead is reassuring.

### 6. Final Normalization

- **Both elections:** Probability of Democrats winning both = 30% (VA) * 50% (NJ) = 15%
- **Only Virginia:** Probability of Democrats winning only Virginia = 30% (VA) * 50% (1-NJ) = 15%
- **Only New Jersey:** Probability of Democrats winning only New Jersey = 70% (1-VA) * 50% (NJ) = 35%
- **Neither election:** Probability of Democrats winning neither = 70% (1-VA) * 50% (1-NJ) = 35%

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 15%  
Only Virginia: 15%  
Only New Jersey: 35%  
Neither election: 35%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and historical trends, with adjustments for potential polling errors and other uncertainties.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical pattern: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections since 1977, the party opposite the White House has won
- This gives a base rate of ~8% for Democrats winning Virginia with a Democrat in the White House
- Virginia has been trending blue in recent years, with Democrats winning all statewide races from 2017-2021 before Republicans won in 2021
- Adjusted base rate: 15% for Democrats winning Virginia

**New Jersey:**
- Democrats have won 4 of the last 6 gubernatorial elections (~67%)
- New Jersey is a reliably Democratic state in federal elections (D+6 to D+10)
- The last Republican governor (Chris Christie) left office in 2018
- Base rate: 70% for Democrats winning New Jersey

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Both are off-year elections with typically lower turnout
- The president's party often faces headwinds in these elections
- Both states have term-limited governors, creating open-seat races

**Differences from base rate:**
- Virginia: Abigail Spanberger appears to be an exceptionally strong Democratic candidate with moderate credentials and a background as a former CIA officer
- Virginia: Current polling shows Spanberger with a substantial 12-point lead, much stronger than typical for a candidate from the president's party
- New Jersey: Jack Ciattarelli nearly won in 2021 (lost by only 3 points), making him a stronger-than-average Republican candidate
- New Jersey: Mikie Sherrill has a strong profile as a former Navy helicopter pilot and prosecutor

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia evidence:**
- WaPo-Schar School poll shows Spanberger leading by 12 points (52-40)
  - P(E|Dem wins): Very high (~0.9) - This polling lead is consistent with a Democratic victory
  - P(E|Dem loses): Very low (~0.1) - Such a large polling lead would be unusual if Republicans were to win

- Spanberger's moderate profile and background
  - P(E|Dem wins): Moderately high (~0.7) - Strong candidates help overcome structural disadvantages
  - P(E|Dem loses): Moderate (~0.4) - Even strong candidates can lose in unfavorable environments

**New Jersey evidence:**
- Multiple polls (John Zogby, Fox News, Rutgers-Eagleton) showing Sherrill with 8-9 point leads
  - P(E|Dem wins): High (~0.8) - Consistent polling leads align with a Democratic victory
  - P(E|Dem loses): Low (~0.2) - Multiple polls would need to be systematically wrong

- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (48% of the vote)
  - P(E|Dem wins): Moderate (~0.5) - Democrats can still win against a proven challenger
  - P(E|Dem loses): Moderately high (~0.7) - Previous strong performance suggests potential for victory

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia update:**
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio for polling evidence: 0.9/0.1 = 9
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 9 = 1.584
- Posterior probability: 1.584/(1+1.584) = 0.613 or ~61%

**New Jersey update:**
- Prior odds: 70/30 = 2.33
- Likelihood ratio for polling evidence: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 2.33 × 4 = 9.32
- Posterior probability: 9.32/(1+9.32) = 0.903 or ~90%

**Joint probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 0.61 × 0.90 = 0.549 or ~55%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 0.61 × (1-0.90) = 0.061 or ~6%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: (1-0.61) × 0.90 = 0.351 or ~35%
- Neither Democratic win: (1-0.61) × (1-0.90) = 0.039 or ~4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polling error: Off-year election polls often have higher error margins due to turnout uncertainty
- The Virginia "president's party curse" is remarkably consistent and may reflect deeper voter psychology
- Late-breaking events could shift dynamics in the final month
- Polls in New Jersey overestimated Democratic support in 2021

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Virginia's historical pattern reasserts itself as election day approaches
- Republican turnout exceeds expectations in both states
- Undecided voters break disproportionately for Republicans

**Adjustments:**
- Reducing confidence in Virginia Democratic win from 61% to 58%
- Slightly reducing New Jersey Democratic win from 90% to 87%
- This increases "Only New Jersey" and "Neither" probabilities

## 6. Final Normalization

Recalculating joint probabilities:
- Both Democratic wins: 0.58 × 0.87 = 0.5046 or ~50%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 0.58 × (1-0.87) = 0.0754 or ~8%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: (1-0.58) × 0.87 = 0.3654 or ~37%
- Neither Democratic win: (1-0.58) × (1-0.87) = 0.0546 or ~5%

## 7. Output Format

Both elections: 50%
Only Virginia: 8%
Only New Jersey: 37%
Neither election: 5%
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will analyze each race separately using the most relevant historical reference class.

*   **Virginia:** The most powerful reference class is the "President's Party Curse." In the 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections since 1977, the party holding the White House has lost 11 times. With a Democrat in the White House, this establishes a strong prior probability for a Republican victory at P(R Win) ≈ 92%, and thus a Democratic win at P(D Win) ≈ 8%.
*   **New Jersey:** A relevant reference class is modern NJ gubernatorial elections. Since 2001 (6 elections), Democrats have won 4 times. This suggests a prior of P(D Win) ≈ 67%. This aligns with New Jersey's general blue lean in federal elections, while acknowledging that state-level races can be more competitive.

Based on these priors, the initial ordering of outcomes would be:
1.  Only New Jersey: P(R Win VA) * P(D Win NJ) = 0.92 * 0.67 ≈ 62%
2.  Neither: P(R Win VA) * P(R Win NJ) = 0.92 * 0.33 ≈ 30%
3.  Both: P(D Win VA) * P(D Win NJ) = 0.08 * 0.67 ≈ 5%
4.  Only Virginia: P(D Win VA) * P(R Win NJ) = 0.08 * 0.33 ≈ 3%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Both elections are off-year contests, which often serve as a referendum on the sitting president. This dynamic is the likely cause of the Virginia "curse" and creates headwinds for Democrats in both states.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference from the base case is the current polling, which strongly contradicts the historical priors, especially in Virginia. Candidate quality is also a key factor; Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) is presented as a particularly strong candidate for a purple state, potentially capable of breaking the historical trend. In New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli (R) is a known quantity who significantly overperformed polls in his narrow 2021 loss, suggesting he is a stronger-than-average challenger and that polls in the state may be systematically biased.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence, which is the recent polling data.

*   **Evidence 1: Virginia Polling.** A Washington Post poll shows Spanberger (D) leading by 12 points (52-40).
    *   P(E | D wins VA): A double-digit lead from a reputable pollster one month before an election is very likely if the Democrat is on track to win.
    *   P(E | R wins VA): This evidence is extremely unlikely if the Republican is on track to win. It would require a polling error far greater than seen in recent cycles.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence strongly favors a Democratic win, likely by a factor of 20:1 or more.

*   **Evidence 2: New Jersey Polling.** Multiple polls show Sherrill (D) with a stable 8-9 point lead.
    *   P(E | D wins NJ): A high single-digit lead is very likely if the Democrat is going to win.
    *   P(E | R wins NJ): This is unlikely, but made more plausible by the 2021 election, where polls overstated the Democratic lead by about 5 points against the same Republican candidate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence favors a Democratic win, but its strength is tempered by the 2021 precedent.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will update the initial priors based on the strong polling evidence.

*   **Virginia Update:**
    *   Prior Odds (D Win / R Win) = 0.08 / 0.92 ≈ 0.09.
    *   The likelihood ratio from the D+12 poll is very strong. Let's use a conservative factor of 20.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.09 * 20 = 1.8.
    *   Posterior P(D Win VA) ≈ 1.8 / (1 + 1.8) ≈ 64%.
    *   Given the strength of the poll, I will adjust this upward slightly, as the historical trend is a pattern, not an iron law, and a 12-point lead is an exceptionally strong signal. I'll estimate the final **P(D Win VA) at 75%**.

*   **New Jersey Update:**
    *   Prior Odds (D Win / R Win) = 0.67 / 0.33 ≈ 2.0.
    *   The D+8/9 polls strengthen the case for a Democratic win. However, the 2021 polling error provides strong counter-evidence against taking the polls at face value. The net effect is a moderate increase in confidence. The polls confirm the prior lean of the state but don't dramatically shift it given the known risk of error. I will update the probability to **P(D Win NJ) at 80%**.

Now, I will combine these individual probabilities to find the probabilities for the four options, assuming independence as a first step:
*   P(Both) = 0.75 * 0.80 = 60%
*   P(Only NJ) = 0.25 * 0.80 = 20%
*   P(Only VA) = 0.75 * 0.20 = 15%
*   P(Neither) = 0.25 * 0.20 = 5%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily reliant on current polling. The biggest risk is a systematic polling error that undercounts Republican support, similar to what happened in NJ in 2021. Such an error, or a late shift in the national environment, would likely affect both races, creating a correlation. This means the "Both" and "Neither" outcomes are slightly more likely than the independent calculation suggests, and the split outcomes are slightly less likely.

If the polls are wrong by 5 points towards the GOP:
*   VA becomes D+7 (still a likely D win).
*   NJ becomes D+3/4 (a toss-up).
This scenario makes "Only Virginia" and "Both" the most likely outcomes.

If the VA "curse" is the dominant factor and voters "snap back" to the historical trend:
*   VA flips to GOP.
*   NJ likely stays with the Democrat.
This scenario makes "Only New Jersey" the most likely outcome.

To account for these correlated risks, I will slightly increase the probability of the uniform outcomes ("Both" and "Neither") at the expense of the split outcomes. I will take 2% from "Only NJ" and 2% from "Only VA" and add 3% to "Both" and 1% to "Neither".

*   Adjusted P(Both) = 60% + 3% = 63%
*   Adjusted P(Only NJ) = 20% - 2% = 18%
*   Adjusted P(Only VA) = 15% - 2% = 13%
*   Adjusted P(Neither) = 5% + 1% = 6%

This distribution reflects that the Democrats winning both races is the most probable outcome based on current data, but it assigns a significant 37% probability to other scenarios, acknowledging the historical headwinds in Virginia and the potential for polling error in both states.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities sum to 100% (63 + 18 + 13 + 6 = 100). The final forecast is consistent with the step-by-step reasoning.

Both elections: 63%
Only New Jersey: 18%
Only Virginia: 13%
Neither election: 6%
