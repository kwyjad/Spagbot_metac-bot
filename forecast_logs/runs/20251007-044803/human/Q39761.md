### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the legal and political procedure for extending martial law in Ukraine?** Understanding the mechanism (e.g., presidential decree, parliamentary vote, constitutional constraints) is crucial to assess the likelihood of extension.
*   **Q2: What is the current status of the Russo-Ukrainian War?** The state of the conflict is the primary justification for martial law. Is there any indication of de-escalation, a ceasefire, or a peace settlement that could materialize before November 5, 2025?
*   **Q3: What is the domestic political sentiment in Ukraine regarding martial law and elections?** Is there significant pressure from opposition parties, civil society, or the public to end martial law and hold the postponed elections?
*   **Q4: What is the stance of Ukraine's key international partners (e.g., US, EU)?** Are they exerting any pressure on Kyiv to lift martial law as a condition for continued financial or military aid?
*   **Q5: What precedent has been set by the previous 16 extensions?** Is the process routine and politically uncontroversial, or has opposition grown over time?

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** "Ukraine constitution martial law extension," "Verkhovna Rada vote martial law process," "legal basis for postponing elections Ukraine."
*   **Q2:** "Russo-Ukrainian war frontline status October 2025," "Ukraine Russia peace talks 2025," "military situation Ukraine recent analysis," "Institute for the Study of War Ukraine update."
*   **Q3:** "Ukrainian public opinion martial law 2025," "political opposition to Zelenskyy martial law," "pressure to hold elections in Ukraine."
*   **Q4:** "US policy Ukraine elections 2025," "EU conditions for Ukraine aid martial law," "international statements on Ukrainian democracy during war."
*   **Q5:** "history of martial law extensions Ukraine 2022-2025," "Verkhovna Rada voting records martial law," "Ukrainian political debate on martial law extensions."

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The provided sources and general knowledge indicate that Ukraine remains on a full wartime footing. The government is engaged in long-term planning for reconstruction *during* the conflict (UBN News, World Bank), and President Zelenskyy's leadership is framed entirely by the war effort (Wilson Center, WEF). The legal framework under the Ukrainian constitution explicitly prohibits national elections during a state of martial law. Therefore, lifting martial law would trigger a constitutional crisis over holding elections in wartime, with millions of citizens displaced or serving in the military. The precedent of 16 prior extensions, typically passing with overwhelming parliamentary support, has made the process a political and administrative routine. There is no evidence of significant domestic or international pressure to lift martial law while the country's sovereignty is under active and existential threat. The core driver—the war—persists with no near-term resolution in sight.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

The following research brief is the output of this plan.

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Ukraine's Own Precedent (2022-2025):** The most specific reference class is Ukraine's own behavior since the full-scale invasion. Martial law has been extended 16 times without fail. This establishes a base rate of **~100% (16 out of 16)** for extension when the government requests it during the current conflict. This is a very strong, highly relevant prior.
*   **States Under Martial Law During Active Invasion:** Historically, nations that have declared martial law or a state of emergency in response to a full-scale, existential invasion do not lift it until the conflict ends or transitions to a stable, frozen state. Examples include the UK's emergency powers in WWII. The base rate for lifting such measures *while active, large-scale combat continues on sovereign territory* is extremely low, likely **<5%**.
*   **Protracted Interstate Wars:** In modern protracted wars, emergency legal frameworks tend to remain in place for the duration of hostilities. Lifting them is a signal of a return to normalcy that is not credible while fighting continues. The base rate for a belligerent nation voluntarily revoking its core wartime legal framework before a ceasefire or peace treaty is very low, likely **<10%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-09-28] Ukraine's government approves a comprehensive 2025-2027 recovery plan. — ↑ — This long-term planning, focused on reintegrating territories, signals an expectation that the war and its associated governance structures (including martial law) will continue.
*   [2025-08-12] The Verkhovna Rada approves the previous 90-day extension of martial law. — ↑ — This most recent extension (from August to November 5) passed with a large majority, reinforcing the strong political consensus and procedural routine.
*   [2025-07-10] The EU announces a major investment package at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. — ↑ — International partners are committing long-term funds under the current wartime conditions, indicating no immediate pressure for a political shift away from martial law.
*   [2025-05-29] Wilson Center analysis highlights Zelenskyy's role as a wartime leader. — ↑ — The framing of Ukraine's political situation by key international observers remains entirely focused on the war, not on a post-war transition.
*   [2025-05-01] Russian forces launch a renewed offensive in the Donbas region. — ↑ — Intensified military activity on the front lines provides a direct and powerful justification for continuing the state of martial law for national security.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **State of the War:** The intensity and continuation of the Russian invasion is the primary driver. As long as there is active, large-scale combat, the security justification for martial law is unassailable. (Size: Large)
*   **Constitutional Link to Elections:** The Ukrainian Constitution prohibits national elections under martial law. Lifting it would create a legal and practical crisis over how to conduct elections with millions displaced, territory occupied, and soldiers at the front. This creates a powerful incentive to maintain the status quo. (Size: Large)
*   **Domestic Political Consensus:** The shared existential threat from the invasion has created a strong elite and public consensus to prioritize national defense over normal political processes. A breakdown in this unity is required to challenge the extensions. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Lack of International Pressure:** Ukraine's allies have prioritized its stability and military effectiveness. While they support democracy in principle, there is no evidence of them pressuring Kyiv to hold elections (and thus lift martial law) at the cost of wartime stability. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Existential Nature of the Conflict:** Unlike many conflicts that trigger states of emergency, this is a full-scale war of survival for Ukraine. This elevates the justification for martial law far beyond that of a typical insurgency or limited conflict.
*   **Unbroken Precedent:** The sheer number of routine, successive extensions (16) has created an incredibly strong status quo bias. Not extending it would be a radical departure from established procedure.
*   **Clear Legal Prohibition on Elections:** The constitutional link is unusually direct and inflexible, creating a high barrier to lifting martial law. There is no legal "middle ground" to allow for a partial return to normalcy.
*   **High Degree of National Mobilization:** The entire state and society are organized around the war effort. Martial law is the legal backbone of this mobilization (e.g., for conscription, directing economic resources). Dismantling it is not a simple switch to flip.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very high prior (>95%) is warranted, based on the perfect 16/16 record of extensions in this conflict (a strong, specific reference class) and the near-zero rate of nations lifting martial law during an active invasion. Equivalent n > 20.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The war continues with no ceasefire or peace treaty imminent.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The political process for extension is routine and faces no significant opposition.
    *   (↑ Small) Recent government and international actions (recovery plans, aid packages) are predicated on a continuing wartime reality.
    *   (↓ Negligible) There is no evidence of any significant new factor (e.g., domestic unrest, international pressure) that would disrupt the established pattern.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly and uniformly reinforces the high prior. The posterior should move further towards certainty, likely in the 98-99.9% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   Official submission of a presidential decree to the Verkhovna Rada to extend martial law.
    *   Statements from senior Ukrainian officials emphasizing the ongoing threat from Russia.
    *   Any significant Russian military escalation or offensive action.
    *   A routine, high-margin preliminary vote in a Rada committee.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   Announcement of sudden, credible, high-level peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.
    *   A surprise, comprehensive ceasefire agreement taking effect.
    *   Public statements from key partners (e.g., the White House, European Commission) explicitly linking future aid to the resumption of electoral processes.
    *   An unexpected and severe domestic political crisis in Ukraine challenging the government's legitimacy.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast assumes no sudden, paradigm-shifting events, such as the collapse of a frontline, the death

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this event is derived from Ukraine's own precedent since the Russian invasion began in 2022. Martial law has been extended 16 times consecutively, establishing a base rate of 100% for extension when requested by the government during the ongoing conflict. This is a highly relevant and strong prior.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors the past instances where martial law was extended. The war is ongoing, and the government has consistently extended martial law as a response to the conflict.
   - Differences: There are no significant differences that would suggest a deviation from the established pattern of extending martial law. The conflict remains active, and there is no indication of a peace settlement or ceasefire.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Continued Conflict**: The war persists with active combat, making the extension of martial law likely. P(E | H) is high, as martial law is expected to continue under these conditions. P(E | ~H) is low, as it would be unusual to lift martial law during active conflict. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
   - **Routine Extensions**: The process of extending martial law has become routine and faces no significant opposition. P(E | H) is high, reinforcing the likelihood of extension. P(E | ~H) is low, as there is no precedent for not extending it. This evidence increases the probability.
   - **International and Domestic Support**: There is no significant pressure from international partners or domestic political forces to lift martial law. P(E | H) is high, as continued support aligns with the extension. P(E | ~H) is low, as lifting martial law would be unexpected. This evidence slightly increases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 100% (16/16 extensions)
   - Likelihood ratio: Strong evidence supports the continuation of martial law.
   - Posterior odds: Remain very high, close to certainty.
   - Posterior probability: Given the strong prior and reinforcing evidence, the posterior probability is extremely high, likely in the range of 98-99.9%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The forecast is based on a strong historical precedent and current evidence, but it is important to consider potential black swan events, such as a sudden peace agreement or international pressure.
   - Alternative Scenarios: A credible peace process or significant international pressure could alter the situation, but there is no current evidence of these factors.
   - Adjustments: Given the lack of contrary evidence, no significant adjustments are necessary.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final forecast reflects the strong base rate and reinforcing evidence, resulting in a very high probability of martial law being extended beyond November 5, 2025.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Ukraine's own precedent as the most relevant base rate. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has extended martial law 16 times without fail - a 100% extension rate. This creates an extremely strong prior of approximately 95-99%.

Supporting this high prior:
- Nations under active invasion historically maintain emergency powers until the conflict ends or stabilizes
- The constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law creates a strong legal incentive to maintain it
- The precedent of 16 consecutive extensions has established a clear pattern

I'll use a prior of 97% (odds of 32.3:1 in favor of extension).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental driver - active warfare on Ukrainian territory - remains unchanged
- The legal and constitutional framework linking martial law to elections is the same
- The political process for extension is routine and faces minimal opposition
- The existential nature of the conflict continues to justify extraordinary measures

**Differences from base case:**
- The war has now continued for over 3.5 years, potentially increasing "martial law fatigue"
- The length of time since elections (which would have occurred in 2023) increases democratic legitimacy concerns
- International partners may be more sensitive to democratic norms as the conflict becomes protracted

However, these differences appear minor compared to the overwhelming similarity to the base case - Ukraine remains in an active, existential war with Russia.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Ongoing active warfare**
- P(E|H): ~100% - If martial law will be extended, we would almost certainly see continued active warfare
- P(E|~H): ~5% - If martial law won't be extended, it's extremely unlikely active warfare would continue
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 2: Government's long-term recovery planning (2025-2027)**
- P(E|H): ~90% - Long-term planning during wartime is highly consistent with continued martial law
- P(E|~H): ~40% - Such planning could still occur without martial law, but would likely be structured differently
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 3: Lack of international pressure to hold elections**
- P(E|H): ~95% - If martial law will continue, we'd expect minimal international pressure
- P(E|~H): ~30% - If martial law won't continue, we'd likely see significant international pressure
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.17:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 4: Recent Russian offensive in Donbas (May 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~80% - Continued or escalated Russian offensives are consistent with martial law extension
- P(E|~H): ~10% - It's unlikely martial law would end during an active offensive
- Likelihood ratio: ~8:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 32.3:1 (97% probability)

Update on Evidence 1 (ongoing warfare):
- Posterior odds = 32.3 × 20 = 646:1
- Posterior probability = 646/(646+1) ≈ 99.85%

Update on Evidence 2 (long-term planning):
- Posterior odds = 646 × 2.25 = 1453.5:1
- Posterior probability = 1453.5/(1453.5+1) ≈ 99.93%

Update on Evidence 3 (lack of international pressure):
- Posterior odds = 1453.5 × 3.17 = 4607.6:1
- Posterior probability = 4607.6/(4607.6+1) ≈ 99.98%

Update on Evidence 4 (recent Russian offensive):
- Posterior odds = 4607.6 × 8 = 36860.8:1
- Posterior probability = 36860.8/(36860.8+1) ≈ 99.997%

This extremely high posterior probability reflects the overwhelming evidence supporting martial law extension. However, I should be cautious about overconfidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a sudden ceasefire or peace agreement
- There could be growing domestic political pressure for elections that isn't captured in available data
- The constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law could be amended or reinterpreted
- A major shift in international support could force Ukraine to demonstrate democratic credentials

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden, unexpected breakthrough in peace negotiations could occur
- A major political crisis could erupt in Ukraine challenging the legitimacy of continued martial law
- International donors could explicitly condition aid on democratic reforms including elections

**Adjusting for overconfidence:**
My calculated posterior of 99.997% seems unrealistically high given the inherent uncertainty in geopolitics. While the evidence strongly supports extension, I should acknowledge the possibility of unforeseen developments. A more reasonable probability would be in the 95-98% range.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the extremely strong prior based on 16 consecutive extensions, the ongoing active warfare, the government's long-term planning, the lack of international pressure to hold elections, and the recent Russian offensive, I assess there is a very high probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025.

However, I must account for the possibility of unforeseen developments such as a sudden breakthrough in peace negotiations or a major shift in international support. While the evidence overwhelmingly supports extension, I'll adjust downward slightly from my calculated posterior to avoid overconfidence.

Final: 97%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own record of extending martial law since the full-scale invasion began on February 24, 2022. As of the date of this forecast, martial law has been extended 16 consecutive times without fail whenever it has come up for renewal. This creates a very strong, specific reference class.

*   **Reference Class:** Extensions of martial law in Ukraine during the 2022-2025 period of full-scale war.
*   **Base Rate:** 16 extensions out of 16 opportunities = 100%.

Given that a 100% base rate can lead to overconfidence, it's prudent to start with a slightly moderated but still very high prior. A prior probability of **98%** seems appropriate. This is equivalent to prior odds of 49:1 in favor of extension, acknowledging a tiny chance of an unexpected event changing the circumstances.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation in October 2025 is fundamentally identical to the conditions under which the previous 16 extensions were passed. The core driver—an active, large-scale war of national survival against Russia—persists. Key Ukrainian territories remain occupied, and there is ongoing combat along the front lines. The same government is in power, and the same constitutional framework is in place.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the sheer duration of the war and martial law. One could argue that war fatigue or political friction might increase over time. However, the research report indicates no significant domestic political opposition or international pressure to change course. In fact, long-term recovery planning by Ukraine and its partners suggests an acceptance of the current wartime reality continuing. Therefore, the differences are not significant enough to suggest a deviation from the established pattern.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025."
Let ~H be the hypothesis that it will not.

*   **Evidence 1: The war is ongoing with no imminent peace settlement or ceasefire.**
    *   The likelihood of observing this evidence if Ukraine plans to extend martial law is extremely high. The war is the justification for the extension. P(E1 | H) ≈ 1.
    *   The likelihood of observing this evidence if Ukraine does *not* plan to extend martial law is extremely low. The most plausible reason for not extending would be an end to hostilities. P(E1 | ~H) is very low, perhaps <0.05.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H)) >> 1.** This evidence strongly increases the probability of extension.

*   **Evidence 2: The Ukrainian Constitution prohibits national elections during martial law.**
    *   This is a powerful structural factor. Lifting martial law would trigger a constitutional and logistical crisis over holding elections while millions are displaced or serving in the military and territory is occupied.
    *   This legal reality creates a strong incentive to maintain the status quo (extend martial law) to avoid a destabilizing political crisis during wartime.
    *   This factor makes ~H (non-extension) much less likely, as it would require the government to have a solution for this crisis, which is not apparent. This evidence strongly supports H.

*   **Evidence 3: The political process for extension is routine and has a strong precedent.**
    *   The 16 previous extensions have passed the Verkhovna Rada with large majorities, making the process a political formality.
    *   The likelihood of this being the case if another extension is planned (H) is very high.
    *   If a non-extension (~H) were a serious possibility, one would expect to see rising political debate, closer votes, or public opposition in the preceding months. The absence of this makes ~H less likely.
    *   This evidence increases the probability of extension.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 49:1 (from a 98% prior probability).
*   **Evidence Update:** All key pieces of evidence (the continuing war, the constitutional lock-in with elections, and the political precedent) have likelihood ratios significantly greater than 1. They all point in the same direction, reinforcing the prior.
*   Let's perform a conceptual update. We start with a belief that extension is almost certain (49:1 odds). The evidence confirms that all the conditions that made the previous 16 extensions necessary are still in place. There is no new counter-evidence. This should move our confidence from "almost certain" to "extremely certain."
*   **Posterior Odds:** The combined effect of the evidence would result in posterior odds significantly higher than 49:1. For example, even a conservative combined likelihood ratio of 10 would yield posterior odds of 490:1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** Odds of 490:1 correspond to a probability of 490 / (490 + 1) = 99.8%. A slightly more conservative final probability accounts for unknown unknowns. A posterior of **99%** reflects the overwhelming weight of evidence while still leaving a sliver of probability for a highly unexpected event.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The primary reason this forecast would be wrong is a sudden and unexpected end to the war before the extension vote in early November 2025. This could be triggered by a "black swan" event like a political collapse in Moscow, a decisive military breakthrough, or a secret peace deal.
*   **Plausibility:** While not impossible, these scenarios are extremely low-probability. Current military analysis suggests a protracted conflict.
*   **Other Risks:** Another risk could be a severe internal political crisis in Ukraine or a sudden reversal of policy from key international partners (e.g., making aid conditional on lifting martial law). There is currently no evidence to suggest either is likely.
*   **Conclusion:** The 1% chance of non-extension adequately covers the small probability of these high-impact, low-likelihood events occurring in the next month. The forecast of 99% appears robust.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate, established by 16 prior consecutive extensions, is nearly 100%. The current evidence—the continuation of the war, the constitutional prohibition on elections under martial law, and the lack of any significant political or international pressure to change course—all strongly reinforce this base rate. The only plausible scenarios for non-extension involve low-probability, high-impact events like a sudden end to the war. Therefore, the probability of another extension is extremely high.

Final: 99%
