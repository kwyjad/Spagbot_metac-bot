### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Midterm Generic Ballot Lead for the Non-Presidential Party (T-1 Year):** The most relevant class is the generic ballot standing for the party not holding the presidency approximately one year before a midterm election. Historically, the "out" party typically holds a lead as a check on the president's power. Based on the provided spreadsheet, the average lead for the non-presidential party at this point in the cycle (Nov/Dec of the year prior to the midterm) is approximately **D/R +2 to +4 points**. This serves as a strong historical prior.
2.  **Generic Ballot Volatility (1-Week Period):** Given the extremely short 7-day forecast horizon, the most critical reference class is the typical movement of the RCP average itself over a one-week period. Analysis of historical data from the provided spreadsheet shows that the RCP average is stable. In a typical week without major political events, the average moves by **+/- 0.3 percentage points**. Movement greater than 0.7 points in one week is rare.
3.  **Post-Presidential Election Midterm Cycle:** This is the first midterm following the 2024 presidential election. In this specific cycle, the Republicans control the presidency (per sources mentioning "Trump's low approval") and both houses of Congress (per the Strength in Numbers source). This "unified government" setup often creates a stronger backlash, potentially leading to a larger-than-average lead for the out-party (Democrats).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-19** Marist/NPR/PBS poll released showing a D+14 lead. — ↑ (Large) — This major outlier poll was included in the RCP average, significantly pulling the Democratic lead upward to its current level.
*   **2025-11-19** Marquette Law School poll released showing a D+5 lead. — ↑ (Small) — A more conventional result that, when added to the average, still contributes to the overall Democratic advantage.
*   **2025-11-18** Strength in Numbers poll released showing a D+5 lead. — ↑ (Small) — Similar to the Marquette poll, this reinforces the trend of a Democratic lead in the mid-single digits, helping to establish a floor under the outlier-driven average.
*   **2025-11-17** RCP Average updated to D+4.8. — (Baseline) — This is the current value we are forecasting from, incorporating the recent polls. The key question is how it will change from this point.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Polling Aggregator Dynamics (Large):** The primary driver over the next 7 days is not public opinion change, but the mechanics of the RCP average. A new poll being added or an old poll dropping out will have a direct and immediate impact. The recent D+14 Marist poll is exerting strong upward pressure.
2.  **Presidential Approval (Moderate):** As noted in the sources, President Trump's approval rating is a key anchor for the generic ballot. A sudden change could shift sentiment, but his ratings are historically stable, making a large shift in one week unlikely.
3.  **Mean Reversion (Moderate):** The D+14 Marist poll is a significant outlier compared to other recent polls (D+5). It is statistically likely that the next poll to enter the average will be closer to the D+5 consensus, which would pull the average down from its current D+4.8 level.
4.  **Major News Events (Low):** The forecast period covers the US Thanksgiving holiday week, which is typically a very slow news period. The probability of a major, poll-moving political event is lower than usual.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Magnitude of the Polling Outlier:** The current RCP average is heavily influenced by the Marist D+14 poll. This is a much larger lead than other contemporaneous polls and is significantly above the historical base rate for the out-party at this stage.
*   **Unified Republican Government:** Unlike many past midterms where power was divided, the sources indicate Republicans control the Presidency, House, and Senate. This unified control can focus public discontent and may be amplifying the Democratic lead beyond historical norms.
*   **Stable, Low Presidential Approval:** President Trump's approval ratings have historically been very low but also very stable. This may create a more static political environment, making the generic ballot less volatile than in cycles with more popular or fluctuating presidents.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior should be tightly centered on the current RCP average of **D+4.8**. Given the 7-day horizon, the process is highly autocorrelated. An "equivalent n" should be very high, suggesting high confidence that the final value will be near the starting one. A Normal(4.8, 0.5²) is a reasonable starting point.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↔) **High Autocorrelation:** The 7-day horizon is the strongest piece of evidence, suggesting minimal change. (Large)
    *   (↓) **Mean Reversion:** The D+4.8 average is inflated by a D+14 outlier. Any new poll is likely to be closer to the D+5 consensus, pulling the average down. (Moderate)
    *   (↔) **Low-News Environment:** The Thanksgiving holiday makes new, market-moving information (and thus new polling) less likely to emerge. (Small)
    *   (↑/↓) **Polling Churn:** The main uncertainty is whether an old, more Republican-leaning poll drops out of the average, which would push the number up slightly. This is a random, unpredictable factor. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests the posterior should move slightly down from the current D+4.8, reflecting the likely pull of mean reversion if any new data comes in. The final distribution should be centered slightly lower than the prior, perhaps around **D+4.5**, but with the variance largely unchanged.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Release of a new poll showing a Democratic lead > 5 points.
    *   An older, R-leaning poll (e.g., from October) being dropped from the RCP average.
    *   A sudden dip in President Trump's approval rating.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Release of a new poll showing a Democratic lead < 5 points or a Republican lead.
    *   The D+14 Marist poll being dropped from the RCP average.
    *   An older, D-leaning poll being dropped from the RCP average.
    *   Positive economic news (e.g., lower inflation figures).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **RCP Methodology Opacity:** The exact timing of when RCP adds or removes polls from its average is not public. This introduces a degree of randomness into the forecast.
*   **Forecast of an Artifact:** This is a forecast of a statistical average, not of underlying public opinion. The two can diverge, especially when driven by outliers.
*   **Holiday Polling Scarcity:** It is less likely that new polls will be conducted and released during the Thanksgiving week, potentially leaving the average static. However, a poll conducted earlier could still be released.
*   **Source Reliability:** The provided sources are hypothetical for November 2025. This analysis assumes they are accurate representations of the political and polling environment at that time.

**Final Research Summary:** The current RCP average is D+4.8, a recent high driven by a D+14 outlier poll. Given the extremely short 7-day horizon over a holiday week, the most probable outcome is a value very close to the current one, with a slight downward pull from mean reversion being the most likely source of change.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the Democrats' lead in the congressional generic ballot on December 2, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from historical generic ballot averages for the non-presidential party one year before midterms. Historically, the out-party holds a lead of about +2 to +4 points. Given the current RCP average of D+4.8, we use this as the prior mean, with a variance reflecting typical weekly volatility of +/- 0.3 points.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the base case in that the Democrats are the out-party, typically holding a lead. However, the D+14 Marist poll is an outlier, inflating the average. The unified Republican government may amplify the Democratic lead beyond historical norms.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The D+14 Marist poll exerts upward pressure, but mean reversion suggests a downward adjustment as new polls are likely closer to D+5. The low-news environment of Thanksgiving week reduces the likelihood of major shifts.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior of Normal(4.8, 0.5²), the evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment due to mean reversion. The posterior mean is adjusted to around D+4.5, with similar variance.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks includes the possibility of a new poll showing a much larger or smaller lead. However, given the stability of the current environment, these are unlikely. The main alternative scenario is a static average due to the holiday week.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect a slight downward shift from the current average, accounting for mean reversion and the holiday period's stability.

P10: 4.0  
P20: 4.2  
P40: 4.4  
P60: 4.6  
P80: 4.8  
P90: 5.0

# Forecast: Democrats' Lead in Congressional Generic Ballot on Dec 2, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two key reference distributions:

**Primary Base Rate**: The current RCP average of D+4.8 points (as of November 25, 2025)
- This is the most relevant starting point given the short 7-day forecast window
- For short-term polling averages, autocorrelation is extremely high
- Standard deviation for weekly changes in generic ballot polling is typically around ±0.5 points

**Secondary Base Rate**: Historical generic ballot advantage for the non-presidential party at T-1 year
- Typically ranges from D/R +2 to +4 points
- Provides context for whether current polling is unusual

The prior distribution is therefore centered at D+4.8 with a standard deviation of 0.5 percentage points, reflecting the high stability of polling averages over short time periods.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- We're in a typical midterm cycle where the out-party (Democrats) holds an advantage
- The current D+4.8 is within the historical range for out-party advantage
- Polling averages are inherently stable over short periods

**Key differences**:
- The current average is heavily influenced by an outlier D+14 Marist poll
- Republicans have unified government control (presidency, House, Senate), which can amplify opposition party advantage
- The forecast period covers Thanksgiving week, typically a low-news, low-polling period

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for a decrease in Democratic lead**:
- Mean reversion: The D+14 Marist poll is a significant outlier compared to other recent polls showing D+5
- If new polls are released, they're statistically likely to be closer to the consensus D+5, pulling the average down
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring a slight decrease

**Evidence for stability**:
- Thanksgiving holiday week means fewer new polls are likely to be conducted or released
- RCP methodology doesn't guarantee any changes to the average in a given week
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring minimal change from current value

**Evidence for an increase in Democratic lead**:
- If an older Republican-leaning poll drops out of the average, it could push the Democratic lead higher
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:3 against an increase (less likely than decrease)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with Prior: Normal(4.8, 0.5²)

First update - Mean reversion pressure:
- Evidence suggests a slight pull downward due to the outlier poll
- Updating the prior with this evidence shifts the mean to approximately 4.5
- Posterior after first update: Normal(4.5, 0.45²)

Second update - Holiday week stability:
- The Thanksgiving holiday suggests fewer new polls, increasing stability
- This slightly narrows our uncertainty but doesn't shift the mean much
- Final posterior: Normal(4.5, 0.4²)

The posterior distribution is therefore centered at D+4.5 with slightly reduced variance, reflecting both the mean reversion pressure and the holiday-induced stability.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overestimating the stability of the RCP average over a week
- I might be underestimating the chance that the Marist poll gets dropped from the average
- I haven't fully accounted for potential news events that could occur despite the holiday

**Alternative scenarios**:
- Significant drop scenario: If the Marist D+14 poll is removed from the average, we could see a drop to around D+3.5
- Significant rise scenario: If a new poll showing D+10 or higher is added, or if multiple Republican-leaning polls drop out, we could see an increase to D+5.5 or higher

**Adjustments for tail risks**:
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for the possibility of larger changes in the average
- I'll shift the lower percentiles down more to account for the asymmetric risk of mean reversion

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.5
P20: 3.9
P40: 4.3
P60: 4.7
P80: 5.1
P90: 5.4

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

The target variable is the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average for the 2026 generic congressional ballot on a date just 7 days from the present. For such a short-term forecast of a time-series variable, the most appropriate prior is a distribution centered on the current value, with variance informed by its historical short-term volatility.

*   **Prior Mean/Median:** The current RCP average is D+4.8. This serves as the anchor for the forecast.
*   **Prior Spread:** The research report notes that in a typical week, the RCP average moves by approximately +/- 0.3 percentage points, and movements greater than 0.7 points are rare. This suggests a tight prior distribution, for instance, a Normal distribution with a mean of 4.8 and a standard deviation of around 0.4 (N(4.8, 0.4²)).

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

*   **Similarities:** The forecast period is a standard week, and the political environment is not described as being in an unusual state of flux. The high autocorrelation typical of polling averages should hold.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is that this 7-day period includes the US Thanksgiving holiday. The research report correctly identifies this as a typically slow news period, which would likely suppress volatility even further than the base rate suggests, as fewer new polls are expected to be released. Another key difference is that the current average is influenced by a significant D+14 outlier poll, making the average potentially unstable if new, more moderate polls are added or old polls are removed.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

I will evaluate the evidence based on how it might shift the distribution from the prior centered at D+4.8.

*   **Short Time Horizon & Holiday Week (Strong evidence for stability):** The 7-day forecast window, combined with the Thanksgiving holiday, makes large shifts in public opinion or polling releases highly unlikely. This evidence strongly favors an outcome very close to the current D+4.8 and suggests tightening the variance of the forecast distribution. The single most likely outcome is no change at all.
*   **Mean Reversion / Polling Churn (Moderate evidence for a downward shift):** The current D+4.8 average is inflated by a D+14 outlier, while other recent polls are closer to a D+5 consensus. The research report's "Bayesian update sketch" concludes there is a net downward pressure on the average. This is the most significant piece of evidence suggesting a directional change. This could happen if a new, more moderate poll (e.g., D+4) is added, or if an older, strongly Democratic poll drops out of the average. This evidence pushes the center of my forecast distribution down from 4.8.
*   **Possibility of New Polls (Weak evidence for an upward shift):** While a slow week, it's not impossible for a new poll to be released. If a new poll reflects the non-outlier "consensus" of D+5, and it is added to the current average of D+4.8, it would pull the average slightly *up*. This acts as a countervailing force to the downward pressure from mean reversion.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**

*   **Prior:** A tight distribution centered at D+4.8, e.g., N(4.8, 0.4²).
*   **Update Step:** The strongest evidence is for stability, but the most significant directional evidence points slightly downward. The "no change" outcome of 4.8 is highly plausible, but the risks appear skewed to the downside. I will update my prior by shifting the mean downward to reflect the net effect of potential polling churn, as synthesized in the research report. A shift from 4.8 to 4.5 seems appropriate for a "slight" downward move.
*   **Posterior:** I will model my posterior distribution as a Normal distribution with a mean of 4.5. To account for the small but real risk of an unexpected poll causing a larger-than-normal shift (a tail risk), I will use a slightly wider standard deviation than the base rate, setting it to 0.5. My final posterior is N(4.5, 0.5²). This distribution has its median at 4.5, but the starting value of 4.8 is still a very plausible outcome (around the 73rd percentile), reflecting the high chance of stasis.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

My forecast centers on a slight decrease from D+4.8 to D+4.5. The biggest risk is that I have misjudged the direction of the next move or that there is no move at all.

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: No Change.** Given the holiday week, it's highly probable that no polls are added or dropped, and the value remains exactly 4.8. My distribution places 4.8 between P60 and P80, acknowledging this as a high-probability outcome but not the median. This seems reasonable.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Upward Movement.** If an old, R-leaning poll drops off, or a new D+5 poll is added, the average would likely tick up towards 5.0. My P80 and P90 values (4.9 and 5.1) account for this possibility.
*   **Overconfidence:** The N(4.5, 0.5²) distribution has a P10-P90 range of about 1.3 points. This is wider than a typical weekly move (+/- 0.7), which appropriately reflects the slight instability caused by the outlier poll in the average. I feel this avoids overconfidence in a specific outcome while still making a directional forecast based on the evidence.

The forecast seems robust, balancing the high likelihood of stability with a reasoned, evidence-based expectation of a slight downward drift.

**6. Final Percentiles**

P10: 3.9
P20: 4.1
P40: 4.4
P60: 4.6
P80: 4.9
P90: 5.1
