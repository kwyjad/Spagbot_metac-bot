### Reference class & base rates
*   **Early Orbital Booster Propulsive Landing Attempts:** The most relevant reference class is the initial set of attempts by a company to land an orbital-class first stage booster via propulsive vertical landing. The only successful precedent is SpaceX's Falcon 9. SpaceX experienced multiple failures before its first successful droneship landing. Of their first six attempts to land on a droneship (the correct analogue for New Glenn's sea-based platform), all failed. This suggests a base rate for success on any given early attempt is low, perhaps **15-25%**.
*   **Second Attempt After a Failure:** A narrower class is the second attempt at a specific maneuver after a first-attempt failure. In complex aerospace systems, data from the first failure is invaluable for correcting flaws. While still difficult, the probability of success on a second attempt is generally higher than the first, provided the failure mode was well-understood and correctable. This might adjust the base rate slightly upward, but the task remains fundamentally challenging.
*   **Maiden Flight of a New Heavy-Lift Rocket:** The first few flights of any new large rocket have a historically high rate of partial or total failure. The fact that New Glenn's first flight successfully reached orbit is a positive deviation from this class. However, the landing is a secondary objective and a distinct engineering challenge. The base rate for full mission success, including secondary objectives like landing, on a second flight is likely in the **50-60%** range, but this is a broader class than just the landing itself.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** Blue Origin confirms a Nov 9 launch date for NG-2. — ↑ — Solidifies the timeline, indicating high confidence and that the vehicle is ready. A launch is imminent.
*   **2025-10-31** Blue Origin completes a successful static fire test of the NG-2 booster. — ↑ — Major technical de-risking event. Confirms the seven BE-4 engines are functioning as expected on the pad, a critical prerequisite for launch.
*   **2025-10-06** Jeff Bezos confirms the NG-2 mission will carry NASA's ESCAPADE probes. — ↑ — Adds schedule pressure and external validation from a key government customer, making a significant delay less likely.
*   **2025-06-10** Blue Origin delays the second launch from an earlier window to no earlier than August 15. — ↓ — Showed initial schedule slip after the January failure, highlighting the complexity of diagnosing and fixing the issue from the first flight.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Technical Learnings from First Failure (Large):** The primary driver of success is whether Blue Origin correctly identified and fixed the cause of the January 2025 landing failure. Their cautious culture suggests they would not re-attempt without high confidence in the fix.
*   **BE-4 Engine Reliability & Throttling (Large):** The seven BE-4 engines must perform multiple complex sequences: launch, shutdown, coast, a re-entry burn, and a final landing burn with deep throttling. The success of the static fire is positive, but in-flight performance for landing is unproven.
*   **Guidance, Navigation, & Control (GNC) Software (Large):** The onboard software is responsible for calculating the precise burn timing, duration, and orientation to hit a moving target at sea. This is an exceptionally complex software challenge where small errors lead to total failure.
*   **Launch Window & Weather (Moderate):** The launch is scheduled for November 9. The remaining time in 2025 is short (~7 weeks). Any significant technical or weather-related delays could push the launch into 2026, causing the question to resolve as "No" even if the eventual landing is successful. The Mars launch window for ESCAPADE also imposes constraints.
*   **Corporate Philosophy (Moderate):** Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" (step-by-step, ferociously) culture means they are methodical. This increases the likelihood that the vehicle is well-prepared but also means they are more likely to delay the launch for minor issues compared to SpaceX.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Single Precedent:** The reference class (SpaceX) has an n-of-1. There is no broad statistical base rate for this specific engineering feat; it's a highly path-dependent problem dominated by the specific design and operational choices of one other company.
*   **Patient, Private Funding:** Unlike early SpaceX, which faced existential financial risks, Blue Origin is funded by Jeff Bezos. This allows for a much slower, more deliberate, and expensive development process without the same commercial pressures to "fly at all costs."
*   **Advanced Engine Technology:** New Glenn uses powerful, modern methalox-fueled BE-4 engines. While this offers performance advantages, it also introduces novel challenges compared to the Falcon 9's more mature kerolox Merlin engines, particularly regarding engine relight and landing dynamics.
*   **Extensive Ground-Testing:** Consistent with their cautious culture, Blue Origin has invested heavily in ground test infrastructure. This suggests they may have a better-characterized vehicle pre-flight than early Falcon 9, potentially reducing in-flight surprises.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the reference class of early propulsive landing attempts. A prior of **~25%** seems appropriate, reflecting the high difficulty but giving some credit for it being the second, not first, attempt. (Equivalent n=4, with 1 success).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Successful static fire test completed. This is the most significant recent piece of evidence, clearing a major technical hurdle and confirming vehicle readiness.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Firm launch date of Nov 9 with a NASA payload. This signals strong internal confidence and external schedule pressure, making a launch in 2025 highly probable.
    *   ↑ (Small): 10-month gap since the first attempt. This allowed ample time for a thorough investigation and implementation of fixes, consistent with their cautious methodology.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): Very short time remaining in 2025. The risk of a multi-week slip due to weather or minor technical issues pushing the launch into 2026 is non-trivial.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is strongly positive. The successful static fire and firm launch date substantially de-risk the "launch before 2026" component and signal high confidence in the "successfully land" component. The posterior should move **significantly upward** from the 25% prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Launch proceeds on or within a few days of November 9.
    *   Favorable weather forecasts for the launch window at Cape Canaveral.
    *   Successful launch and ascent phase of the NG-2 mission.
    *   Positive statements from Blue Origin or NASA during the launch countdown.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any scrub or delay of the Nov 9 attempt for technical reasons (not weather).
    *   A "hold" in the countdown lasting more than a few hours.
    *   Reports of anomalous data from the booster after stage separation.
    *   A persistent unfavorable weather pattern forecast for mid-to-late November.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opacity of Blue Origin:** The company is notoriously private. The exact cause of the first landing failure and the specific fixes implemented are not public knowledge, creating significant uncertainty about their efficacy.
*   **Small 'n' Problem:** The reference class is extremely small, making the base rate highly speculative and sensitive to interpretation.
*   **Binary Resolution:** The question requires both a launch *and* a successful landing in 2025. A successful launch followed by a landing failure, or a launch slip into January 2026 followed by a successful landing, would both resolve as "No".
*   **Definition of "Successful Landing":** This is assumed to mean the booster lands intact on the droneship in a recoverable state. Any major damage, a hard landing, or a tip-over would likely count as a failure.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a second attempt at a novel booster landing is low, but strong recent evidence—particularly a successful static fire and a firm launch date—indicates Blue Origin has high confidence and has cleared major pre-flight hurdles. The primary remaining risks are an unforeseen technical issue during the landing sequence or a launch delay pushing the attempt into 2026.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for early orbital booster propulsive landing attempts is approximately 15-25%, based on SpaceX's initial attempts. Given that this is Blue Origin's second attempt, and assuming they have learned from the first failure, a slightly higher base rate of around 25% is reasonable. This reflects the increased probability of success on a second attempt after a failure.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both involve early attempts at landing a large orbital-class booster on a sea-based platform. The technical challenges and risks are comparable.
   - Differences: Blue Origin's cautious approach and extensive ground testing may increase their chances compared to SpaceX's early attempts. However, the lack of public information about the specific fixes implemented adds uncertainty.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Successful static fire test: This is a strong positive indicator, suggesting the vehicle is technically ready. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Firm launch date with NASA payload: Indicates high confidence and external pressure to succeed. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - 10-month gap since first attempt: Allows time for thorough investigation and fixes. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Short time remaining in 2025: Increases risk of delay into 2026. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 25% probability = 1:3 odds.
   - Evidence: The successful static fire and firm launch date are strong positive indicators, suggesting a likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1. The risk of delay is a moderate negative factor.
   - Posterior odds: Adjusting for the positive evidence, the odds improve. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 2 for the positive evidence and 0.8 for the delay risk.
   - Posterior odds = 1:3 × 2 × 0.8 = 1.6:3 = 0.53:1.
   - Posterior probability = 0.53 / (1 + 0.53) ≈ 34.6%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The small sample size and lack of transparency from Blue Origin could lead to overconfidence in the positive indicators.
   - Alternative scenario: A delay into 2026 due to unforeseen technical issues or weather is plausible.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unforeseen technical challenges and the impact of Blue Origin's cautious culture, which might lead to a delay.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, positive evidence, and potential risks, a probability of approximately 35% seems reasonable.

Final: 35%

# Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a successful orbital-class booster landing on an early attempt.

The most relevant reference class is early propulsive landing attempts of orbital-class boosters. SpaceX's Falcon 9 provides the only precedent:
- SpaceX failed their first 6 droneship landing attempts before succeeding
- This suggests a base rate of ~15% for any single early attempt

However, this is Blue Origin's second attempt after learning from a first failure, which should improve their odds somewhat. Companies typically incorporate significant learnings from first failures, especially with Blue Origin's methodical approach.

I'll select a prior of **25%** for a successful landing on this second attempt, reflecting both the historical difficulty and the advantage of having data from the first failure.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like early SpaceX attempts, this involves a large orbital-class booster attempting propulsive landing
- It's an early attempt (only the second) in the development program
- The landing platform is sea-based, adding complexity compared to land landings
- The fundamental physics and engineering challenges remain similar

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has had 10 months to analyze and fix issues from the first attempt
- Blue Origin has a more cautious, methodical development approach than SpaceX
- New Glenn uses BE-4 methalox engines versus Falcon 9's kerosene Merlin engines
- Blue Origin has unlimited funding from Jeff Bezos, allowing for more extensive testing
- The first flight successfully reached orbit, showing basic vehicle functionality
- A successful static fire test has been completed, confirming engine functionality

These differences generally favor a higher probability than the base rate, particularly the successful static fire and the extended time to implement fixes.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Successful static fire test (October 31, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful landing would almost certainly be preceded by a successful static fire
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even with a failed landing, we'd expect a successful static fire
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.58
- This significantly increases the probability of success

**Evidence 2: Firm launch date of November 9 with NASA payload**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - With high confidence in success, they would set a firm date
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.7) - They might still set a date even with moderate landing confidence
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.29
- This moderately increases the probability of success

**Evidence 3: 10-month gap since first attempt**
- P(E|H): High (~0.85) - Success requires thorough analysis and fixes
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.75) - Even with failure, they would take time to analyze
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.13
- This slightly increases the probability of success

**Evidence 4: Short time remaining in 2025 (7 weeks)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.7) - Even with a successful landing, schedule risks remain
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.7) - This factor affects timing more than landing success
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.0
- This is neutral for the landing success but creates risk for the "before 2026" requirement

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 25% (odds of 1:3), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on static fire test:**
- Prior odds: 1:3 (25%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.58
- Posterior odds: 1.58:3 = 0.527:1
- Posterior probability: 0.527/(1+0.527) = 34.5%

**Update on firm launch date:**
- Prior odds: 0.527:1 (34.5%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.29
- Posterior odds: 0.68:1
- Posterior probability: 0.68/(1+0.68) = 40.5%

**Update on 10-month analysis period:**
- Prior odds: 0.68:1 (40.5%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.13
- Posterior odds: 0.77:1
- Posterior probability: 0.77/(1+0.77) = 43.5%

**Update on time remaining in 2025:**
- This doesn't affect landing success probability directly, but creates a ~15% risk of the launch slipping to 2026
- Adjusting for this timing risk: 43.5% × 0.85 = 37%

After Bayesian updating, my posterior probability is approximately **37%**.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the value of the static fire test, which validates engines but not the complex GNC systems needed for landing
- I might be underestimating the fundamental difficulty of the landing maneuver
- Blue Origin's opacity means we don't know if they've truly identified and fixed the root cause of the first failure
- The reference class is extremely small (essentially n=1 with SpaceX)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The launch could be delayed by weather or technical issues into 2026, even if the landing would have been successful
- Blue Origin might have solved the major issues but encounter a new, unforeseen failure mode
- The NASA payload adds pressure that might force them to launch even if landing systems aren't fully ready

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would put the probability at 20-25%, arguing that:
- The first landing failure might indicate fundamental design issues
- Blue Origin lacks SpaceX's iterative experience with landings
- The November 9 date is ambitious and likely to slip

However, this view underweights the significance of the successful static fire and firm launch date, which demonstrate high internal confidence.

A more optimistic view might put the probability at 50-60%, arguing that:
- Blue Origin's methodical approach means they wouldn't attempt without high confidence
- The 10-month gap provided ample time to fix issues
- The successful first orbital flight demonstrates overall vehicle maturity

This view likely overestimates Blue Origin's capabilities given their lack of demonstrated landing experience.

After considering these alternatives, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to 35% to account for the fundamental difficulty of the landing maneuver and the risk of schedule slips.

## 6. Final Forecast

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a successful propulsive landing of a new orbital-class booster on its second attempt, following a failure on the first. The most relevant reference class is SpaceX's early attempts with the Falcon 9.

*   **Reference Class:** Early attempts to land an orbital booster on a sea-based platform.
*   **Data:** SpaceX's first four attempts to land on a droneship failed. Their first success came on the fifth attempt. This suggests a raw success rate for any given early attempt is low, around 1 in 5, or 20%.
*   **Reasoning:** This task is fundamentally one of the most difficult in rocketry, as demonstrated by the world's only successful operator. While this is the *second* attempt for Blue Origin, which should have a higher chance of success than the first, the base rate of difficulty is extremely high.
*   **Prior Selection:** I will start with a prior probability of **25%**. This is slightly more optimistic than the raw SpaceX data to account for this being a second attempt where lessons from the first failure have been incorporated. In odds form, this is 1:3 (one chance of success for every three chances of failure).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with Blue Origin's New Glenn has key differences from the early days of SpaceX's Falcon 9.

*   **Similarities:** The core engineering challenge of a propulsive vertical landing of a large liquid-fueled first stage on a moving sea platform is nearly identical.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Corporate Culture:** Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" (step-by-step, ferociously) motto reflects a cautious, methodical approach, in contrast to SpaceX's rapid "fail-to-learn" iterative cycle. This suggests Blue Origin would only re-attempt the landing after extensive analysis and with high confidence that the initial failure mode is fixed. This points towards a higher probability of success for this specific attempt.
    *   **Hindsight:** Blue Origin has had the benefit of observing SpaceX's decade-long public journey of successes and failures. While they lack proprietary data, the fundamental physics and engineering feasibility are now proven, which was not the case when SpaceX started.
    *   **Funding:** Blue Origin's patient, private funding from Jeff Bezos removes the existential financial pressure that drove some of SpaceX's early risk-taking.

These differences suggest that Blue Origin's second attempt is better positioned for success than a generic "early attempt" from the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The question requires two conditions to be met: (1) a launch before 2026, and (2) a successful landing.

*   **Evidence 1: Successful Static Fire Test (Oct 31, 2025).** This is a major technical de-risking event. It confirms the booster's seven BE-4 engines are ready for flight.
    *   P(E | H): Very high. A successful launch/landing almost certainly requires a preceding successful static fire.
    *   P(E | ~H): Lower. A fundamental flaw that would cause mission failure might have been detected during this test.
    *   **Impact:** Strongly increases the probability by clearing a critical pre-flight milestone.

*   **Evidence 2: Firm Launch Date of Nov 9, 2025, with a NASA payload.** This signals high internal confidence from Blue Origin and external validation from NASA.
    *   P(E | H): Very high. A successful mission in 2025 requires setting a launch date.
    *   P(E | ~H): Lower. A company with low confidence would be less likely to commit to a firm date for a high-profile customer mission.
    *   **Impact:** Strongly increases the probability, especially for the "launch before 2026" component.

*   **Evidence 3: Short Time Remaining in 2025.** The Nov 9 target date leaves approximately seven weeks in the year.
    *   This is a key constraint. New rockets are prone to delays from weather or minor technical issues. A multi-week slip is common.
    *   **Impact:** This acts as a cap on the final probability. It introduces a significant risk that the event resolves as "No" simply due to a schedule slip into 2026, regardless of the booster's technical readiness.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will update my 25% prior by breaking the problem into two independent components and then combining them.

1.  **Probability of Launch before 2026:** The static fire is complete and a firm date is set. This is very strong positive evidence. However, the 7-week buffer is not huge. I estimate an **80%** chance of launching before the end of the year, acknowledging a 20% risk of a slip due to weather or last-minute technical scrubs.

2.  **Probability of Successful Landing (conditional on launch):** My prior was 25%. The strong signals of confidence (cautious company proceeding, NASA payload, firm date) are significant evidence that Blue Origin believes it has solved the problem from the first flight. This warrants a substantial upward revision. I will update the conditional probability of a successful landing to **60%**. This reflects a belief that success is now more likely than not, but still acknowledges the immense difficulty with a 40% chance of failure.

*   **Posterior Calculation:**
    Posterior P(H) = P(Launch before 2026) × P(Successful Landing | Launch)
    Posterior P(H) = 0.80 × 0.60 = 0.48

The final probability after incorporating the evidence is **48%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 48% is close to a coin flip, which seems appropriate for such a high-stakes, high-difficulty event.

*   **Why might the forecast be too high?** I may be overweighting the "soft" evidence of corporate confidence. The physics of landing a rocket remains incredibly difficult. A new, unknown failure mode could easily appear, just as it did for SpaceX multiple times. If the true conditional landing probability is closer to my prior (e.g., 35%), the final forecast would be much lower (0.80 * 0.35 = 28%).
*   **Why might the forecast be too low?** Blue Origin's opacity means they could be far more advanced and confident than is publicly known. Their cautious nature means they might not even attempt this unless their simulations showed a >90% chance of success. If their internal confidence is that well-founded, my 60% estimate for the landing could be too conservative.
*   **Conclusion:** The 48% forecast appropriately balances the low base rate of success for this task against the strong positive signals from recent milestones and the company's behavior. It acknowledges that failure (either of the landing or to launch in time) remains a very real possibility.

### Final Forecast
My analysis combines a low base rate for this difficult task with a significant upward update based on strong recent evidence like the successful static fire and the setting of a firm launch date with a NASA payload. The main risks are an unforeseen technical issue during the complex landing sequence or a schedule slip into 2026.

Final: 48%
