### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: States of emergency in Ecuador (2020-2025).** Ecuador has frequently used states of emergency to address security crises (gang violence, prison riots), social unrest (protests), and public health emergencies (COVID-19). These are typically declared for 30 or 60 days and are often geographically targeted, though nationwide declarations occur. The Ecuadorian Constitution allows a 60-day declaration, renewable once for 30 days upon approval by the Constitutional Court.
    *   *Base Rate:* In any given month over the last three years, there has been a state of emergency active in at least one province roughly 40-50% of the time. The number of provinces involved varies widely, from 1-3 for localized crime to all 24 for nationwide crises. The median for a major event is high (10+ provinces).
*   **Reference Class 2: States of emergency in response to major indigenous-led protests (e.g., 2019, 2022).** These events are characterized by widespread, disruptive protests against economic policies (typically fuel subsidy cuts). Historically, these confrontations end after 2-3 weeks of intense conflict, culminating in negotiations where the government often concedes on the core policy issue to restore order.
    *   *Base Rate:* These specific events are rarer but have a clear pattern. The state of emergency is a tool during the conflict, not a permanent state. The base rate suggests such declarations are lifted once a political settlement is reached, which usually happens within the initial 30-60 day period.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-06] Declaration expanded to 16 provinces. — ↑ — The expansion to include key economic hubs like Guayas shows the government perceives the threat as widespread and severe, justifying a prolonged and broad response.
*   [2025-10-05] Five arrested for alleged assassination attempt on President Noboa. — ↑ — This event provides the government with a powerful justification to frame the protests as a violent, criminal enterprise, rather than legitimate social dissent, making a negotiated de-escalation less likely.
*   [2025-10-04] President Noboa declares a 60-day state of emergency in 10 provinces. — ↑ — The initial trigger for the current situation. The 60-day duration means it is scheduled to expire on December 3, 2025, three weeks *before* the resolution date.
*   [2025-09-16] State of emergency declared in Carchi and Imbabura. — (neutral) — A pre-existing condition related to security on the northern border, but now subsumed into the larger crisis.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Government-Protester Negotiation:** A successful dialogue, likely mediated by the Catholic Church or international bodies, could lead to a deal that ends the protests and the state of emergency. This is the primary off-ramp. (Large impact)
2.  **Noboa's Political Strategy:** The President's decision to frame the protests as "narco-terrorism" linked to foreign cartels, rather than a domestic social movement, signals a hardline security-focused approach. This strategy makes extension more likely than negotiation. (Large impact)
3.  **Constitutional Court Ruling:** The court must approve any extension beyond the initial 60 days. It has a history of scrutinizing and sometimes limiting the executive's use of emergency powers, potentially forcing a de-escalation. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Persistence of Protests:** If indigenous groups (led by CONAIE) can sustain roadblocks and demonstrations, they will maintain pressure on the government to either negotiate or keep security measures in place. A loss of momentum would allow the state of emergency to lapse. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Underlying Fiscal Pressure:** The diesel subsidy cuts are driven by Ecuador's difficult fiscal situation and IMF commitments. This structural pressure is not easily resolved, meaning the root cause of the conflict will persist, incentivizing the government to maintain its policy. (Moderate impact)
6.  **Emergence of a New Crisis:** A separate, major security event (e.g., a large-scale prison riot, a series of gang attacks) could trigger a new state of emergency or justify extending the current one on different grounds. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Hardline Presidential Rhetoric:** Unlike presidents in the 2019 and 2022 protests who eventually entered dialogue, Noboa has immediately and aggressively linked protesters to transnational organized crime ("Tren de Aragua"). This escalatory framing makes a negotiated settlement more difficult and a security-based extension more likely.
*   **Dual Crises:** Ecuador is simultaneously battling a deep-rooted gang violence crisis and this new wave of social unrest. This allows the government to conflate the two issues, providing a broader and more durable justification for emergency powers than in past protest-driven events.
*   **Timing Relative to Expiration:** The resolution date (Dec 25) falls just 22 days after the scheduled end of the initial 60-day period (Dec 3). This proximity makes a 30-day extension a very plausible and simple tool for the government if the situation remains tense, as it would cover the resolution date.
*   **Noboa's Political Capital:** As a relatively new president who won on a security platform, Noboa may perceive that backing down to protesters would be more politically damaging than it was for his predecessors, incentivizing him to hold a firm line.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The initial 60-day state of emergency is scheduled to end on Dec 3, 2025. Therefore, a naive prior for the number of provinces on Dec 25 should be centered at **0**. The strength is low (low "n") because extensions and new declarations are common in Ecuador.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The resolution date falls squarely within the constitutionally-allowed 30-day extension period.
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's "narco-terrorism" framing actively undermines the potential for a negotiated off-ramp before the initial 60 days are up.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The underlying fiscal drivers for the subsidy cuts are structural and will not be resolved quickly, ensuring the core grievance remains.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The Constitutional Court may block or limit an extension, acting as a significant check on executive power.
    *   (↓ Small) Economic and public fatigue from a prolonged crisis could pressure both sides toward a resolution before an extension is needed.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the prior of 0 is incorrect. The political posture of the government and the timing make an extension of the current state of emergency highly probable. The posterior should shift significantly upward, with a high probability mass on the current number of provinces (16) or a slightly reduced number (e.g., 10-12) if the government makes a token de-escalation.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Formal request by the government to the Constitutional Court to extend the state of emergency.
    *   Breakdown of any preliminary talks between the government and CONAIE.
    *   Sustained or escalating violence at protest sites.
    *   Noboa's administration doubling down on the "terrorist" narrative in public statements.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a formal, mediated negotiation process.
    *   A Constitutional Court ruling that denies or significantly curtails a requested extension.
    *   CONAIE or other protest leaders announcing a "truce" or pause in demonstrations to allow for dialogue.
    *   The government announcing a partial rollback or modification of the diesel subsidy cuts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Constitutional Clock:** The entire forecast hinges on the 60-day limit and the 30-day extension mechanism. The key event to watch is the government's action as the December 3 deadline approaches.
*   **Conflation of Crises:** The government may let the protest-related declaration expire but immediately issue a new one for the same provinces, citing gang violence as the reason. This would resolve as "true" but stem from a different causal mechanism.
*   **Data Reliability:** Information will be highly politicized. The government will emphasize violence and foreign influence, while protest leaders will highlight state repression. True ground-level intensity will be difficult to gauge.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The declaration for Bolívar province only specified the Echeandía canton. For resolution, it's critical to confirm if this counts the entire province. Assume any partial declaration counts the whole province unless specified otherwise.

**Final Research Summary:** The current state of emergency is scheduled to expire before the resolution date, suggesting a baseline of zero provinces. However, President Noboa's hardline anti-terrorist rhetoric and the proximity of the resolution date to a potential 30-day extension make it highly probable that the state of emergency will be extended, likely covering 10-16 provinces.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1**: States of emergency in Ecuador (2020-2025). Historically, states of emergency have been declared in 1-3 provinces for localized issues and up to all 24 provinces for nationwide crises. The median for major events is high (10+ provinces).
   - **Reference Class 2**: States of emergency in response to major indigenous-led protests. These events typically resolve within 30-60 days, with states of emergency lifted after negotiations.
   - **Base Rate**: Given the current situation, the base rate is centered around 10+ provinces, reflecting the current state of emergency in 16 provinces.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity**: The current situation involves widespread protests and a significant government response, similar to past events where large numbers of provinces were under emergency.
   - **Difference**: The hardline stance of President Noboa and the framing of protests as linked to organized crime suggest a more prolonged state of emergency than typical protest resolutions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Prolonged Emergency Likelihood**: The framing of protests as "narco-terrorism" and the unresolved fiscal issues increase the likelihood of an extended state of emergency.
   - **Negotiation Likelihood**: The potential for negotiations or court intervention could reduce the number of provinces under emergency.
   - **Likelihood Ratios**: The evidence suggests a higher likelihood of maintaining or slightly reducing the current number of provinces under emergency rather than a complete resolution.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior**: Centered around 10-16 provinces.
   - **Evidence Update**: The likelihood of a 30-day extension and the hardline government stance shift the distribution towards maintaining the current number of provinces under emergency.
   - **Posterior**: The posterior distribution is skewed towards 10-16 provinces, with a slight possibility of reduction due to potential negotiations or court rulings.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of a rapid de-escalation or a new crisis that could alter the situation.
   - **Alternative Scenarios**: A successful negotiation could lead to a significant reduction, while a new crisis could maintain or increase the number of provinces under emergency.
   - **Adjustment**: Account for these scenarios by slightly widening the distribution to include lower and higher outcomes.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles are as follows:

P10: 8  
P20: 10  
P40: 12  
P60: 14  
P80: 16  
P90: 18

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two key reference classes to establish my prior:

**Reference Class 1: Recent States of Emergency in Ecuador**
- Ecuador has 24 provinces total
- Currently (as of October 2025), 16 provinces are under a state of emergency
- The declaration is for 60 days (expiring December 3, 2025)
- Constitutional provisions allow for a 30-day extension (which would cover December 25)
- Historical pattern shows states of emergency are active in at least one province roughly 40-50% of the time

**Reference Class 2: Indigenous-Led Protest Outcomes**
- Previous major indigenous protests (2019, 2022) typically resolved within 2-3 weeks
- These usually end with negotiations and government concessions
- States of emergency are typically lifted once political settlements are reached

Based on these reference classes, my prior distribution is:
- Mean/Median: 0-2 provinces (assuming the emergency expires on December 3 and isn't renewed)
- Variance: High (0-24 provinces possible)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The constitutional framework remains the same (60-day limit with possible 30-day extension)
- Indigenous groups are leading protests against economic policy changes
- The government initially responds with security measures

**Key differences:**
- President Noboa has framed protesters as linked to "narco-terrorism" and the Tren de Aragua cartel
- The alleged assassination attempt provides stronger justification for continued emergency measures
- The resolution date (Dec 25) falls within the potential 30-day extension period
- Ecuador faces dual crises (gang violence and protests) that the government is conflating

These differences suggest a significant upward shift from the base rate, as they make extension more likely than in previous cases.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting higher values:**
- The timing of the resolution date (Dec 25) falls within the potential 30-day extension period (makes extension ~3× more likely)
- Noboa's "narco-terrorism" framing undermines negotiation paths (makes extension ~2× more likely)
- The alleged assassination attempt provides political cover for continued emergency measures (makes extension ~1.5× more likely)
- Underlying fiscal pressures remain unresolved (makes extension ~1.2× more likely)

**Evidence supporting lower values:**
- Constitutional Court must approve extensions and has historically scrutinized them (makes expiration ~1.3× more likely)
- Economic costs of prolonged emergency may pressure resolution (makes expiration ~1.2× more likely)
- Historical pattern of indigenous protests ending with negotiations (makes expiration ~1.5× more likely)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 0-2 provinces (assuming expiration), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update 1: Timing of resolution date**
- The December 25 resolution date falls within the potential 30-day extension period
- This significantly increases the likelihood that the emergency will still be active
- Posterior shift: from 0-2 provinces to 8-12 provinces

**Update 2: Noboa's hardline rhetoric**
- The framing of protesters as terrorists makes negotiated settlement less likely
- This increases the probability that the full set of provinces remains under emergency
- Posterior shift: from 8-12 provinces to 12-16 provinces

**Update 3: Constitutional constraints**
- The Court must approve extensions, which introduces uncertainty
- This slightly reduces the expected number of provinces
- Posterior shift: from 12-16 provinces to 10-14 provinces

The posterior distribution is now centered around 12 provinces, with significant probability mass between 8-16 provinces.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the government's desire to maintain the emergency status
- The Constitutional Court could reject the extension entirely
- A negotiated settlement could occur before December 3
- New crises could emerge, changing the provinces under emergency

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative is that the emergency expires completely (0 provinces). This could happen if:
- The protests lose momentum before December
- The Constitutional Court rejects an extension
- International pressure forces a negotiated settlement
- Economic costs become too high to sustain emergency measures

However, given Noboa's security-focused approach and the framing of protesters as terrorists, this seems less likely than continuation.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: A major escalation could lead to a nationwide emergency (all 24 provinces)
- Lower tail: A complete resolution before December 3 (0 provinces)

I'll widen my distribution to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 5
P40: 10
P60: 14

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the number of provinces in Ecuador under a state of emergency on a specific future date, December 25, 2025.

A naive but crucial starting point is the legal status of the current declaration. The 60-day state of emergency declared on October 4/6, 2025, is scheduled to expire on December 3, 2025. Therefore, without any further information, the most likely outcome on December 25 (22 days later) is **0 provinces**. This forms the initial anchor for my prior distribution.

A broader reference class is the general political situation in Ecuador. The research report notes that over the last three years, a state of emergency has been active somewhere in the country 40-50% of the time. This suggests a prior distribution that is not entirely concentrated at zero. It should be bimodal: a significant probability mass at 0 (for when things are calm or declarations have expired) and another mass spread across a range of positive values (for when a crisis is active).

Combining these, my prior distribution is heavily weighted towards 0, but acknowledges the non-trivial chance of a new or extended state of emergency.
*   **Prior Median**: 0
*   **Prior Distribution**: P(0) ≈ 60%, P(>0) ≈ 40%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The trigger for the crisis—protests led by indigenous groups (like CONAIE) against fuel subsidy cuts—is a recurring event in recent Ecuadorian history (e.g., 2019, 2022).
*   The government's response tool—a geographically targeted, 60-day state of emergency—is standard procedure.

**Differences:**
*   **Presidential Stance:** President Noboa's rhetoric is significantly more hardline than his predecessors. By immediately framing the protests as "narco-terrorism" linked to foreign cartels and surviving an alleged assassination attempt, he has made a negotiated, political off-ramp much more difficult. This points towards a prolonged, security-focused response rather than a quick settlement.
*   **Timing:** The resolution date (Dec 25) is perfectly situated within the 30-day window for a constitutionally-permitted extension of the initial 60-day declaration. If the crisis is unresolved by Dec 3, a 30-day extension is a simple and powerful tool for the government that would cover the resolution date.
*   **Conflation of Crises:** Ecuador is simultaneously fighting a well-established gang violence crisis. This allows the government to justify prolonged emergency powers by conflating social protest with organized crime, a justification that may be more durable than in past protest-only events.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior belief (that the number will be 0) based on the new evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Noboa's Hardline Rhetoric & "Narco-Terrorism" Framing.** This evidence strongly decreases the likelihood of a negotiated settlement before the 60-day period ends. It makes a prolonged standoff, and thus the need for an extension, much more probable. This is a strong update *away* from 0.
*   **Evidence 2: Proximity of Resolution Date to Extension Window.** The fact that a single 30-day extension would cover Dec 25 makes this a very low-cost, high-impact action for the government if they deem it necessary. This makes the outcome of "16 provinces" (or a similar number) much more likely than it would be if the resolution date were, for example, January 15, 2026. This is another strong update *away* from 0.
*   **Evidence 3: Constitutional Court as a Check.** This is the primary piece of evidence supporting a lower outcome. The court must approve any extension and has a history of scrutinizing these requests. It could deny the extension (forcing the outcome to 0) or limit its scope (e.g., reducing the number of provinces from 16 to a smaller number). This moderates the push towards high numbers and increases the probability of 0 or a number less than 16.
*   **Evidence 4: Historical Precedent of Protest Resolution.** Past major protests have typically been resolved within a few weeks. While Noboa's stance is different, the severe economic and social disruption from a prolonged crisis creates immense pressure on both sides to find a resolution, especially before the Christmas holidays. This provides a plausible path back to 0.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior**: P(0) ≈ 60%, P(>0) ≈ 40%.
*   **Update**: The evidence of Noboa's hardline stance and the convenient timing for an extension are very powerful. They significantly outweigh the historical precedent of quick resolutions. I estimate this evidence flips the odds, making a non-zero outcome more likely than a zero outcome. The Constitutional Court acts as a moderating factor, re-introducing uncertainty and the possibility of a limited extension.
*   **Posterior Shape**: My posterior distribution is now bimodal.
    *   There is still a significant chance of **0 provinces** (perhaps 35%), if negotiations succeed or the court blocks an extension.
    *   There is a high probability of the state of emergency being extended, likely covering the current **16 provinces** (perhaps a 30% chance).
    *   There is also a notable chance of a partial extension, covering a number between the original 10 and the current 16, as a compromise to secure court approval (perhaps a 25% chance for numbers in the 1-15 range).
    *   A small chance (10%) remains for other outcomes (e.g., a new, unrelated crisis).

This results in a distribution with a median likely in the low double-digits, but with large probability masses at 0 and 16.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily dependent on President Noboa maintaining his hardline stance. A key vulnerability is underestimating the economic and political pressure to normalize the country before Christmas. Business elites and the general public may tire of the conflict, forcing the government to the negotiating table despite the harsh rhetoric. This would push the outcome to 0. I have accounted for this with a 35% chance of 0, which feels appropriate.

Another possibility is that the government allows the protest-related declaration to expire but immediately issues a new one for some of the same provinces (e.g., the coastal ones like Guayas) citing the ongoing gang crisis. This would still result in a non-zero number. This scenario reinforces the likelihood of a non-zero outcome, making my overall distribution more robust.

I might be too anchored on the current number of 16. The court could approve an extension for only the 3-5 most problematic provinces. My P40 of 5 is intended to capture this possibility. The distribution seems to reasonably cover the main scenarios: full resolution (0), full extension (16), and partial extension (5-14).

### 6. Final Percentiles

The percentiles are derived from the bimodal posterior distribution described above, which has significant probability concentrations at 0 and 16.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 5
P60: 14
P80: 16
P90: 16
