### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Executive Actions Challenged on Statutory Grounds:** This is the most relevant class. In recent years, the Court has frequently reviewed significant executive actions based on broad interpretations of older statutes. The executive branch has often lost. Examples include the OSHA vaccine mandate (*NFIB v. OSHA*, 2022), the EPA's Clean Power Plan (*West Virginia v. EPA*, 2022), and the CDC eviction moratorium (*Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. HHS*, 2021).
    *   **Base Rate:** The executive branch losing a merits ruling in such cases is high, perhaps **60-70%**. This reflects the current Court's skepticism of broad agency power under the "major questions doctrine."
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings After Oral Arguments Signal a Clear Majority View:** Reports from experienced Supreme Court observers on the tenor of oral arguments are highly predictive. When a clear majority of justices express skepticism towards one side's core argument, that side usually loses.
    *   **Base Rate:** The outcome signaled during oral arguments is realized in the final ruling in **85-95%** of cases. The provided sources strongly indicate skepticism toward the government's position.
3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Power under IEEPA:** This is a narrow reference class with very few data points. The landmark case is *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), where the Court upheld broad presidential authority to nullify attachments on Iranian assets. However, that case involved a specific foreign policy crisis with a history of congressional acquiescence, a different context than broad tariff imposition.
    *   **Base Rate:** Given the N of ~1 major case, this class is not statistically useful for a base rate but provides important context for what makes the current case different.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms (7-4) that the tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. ↓ — Matters because it establishes a second appellate court ruling against the tariffs, creating a strong consensus in the lower courts that the Supreme Court is reviewing.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. ↓ — The expedited schedule makes a "No 2025 ruling" outcome highly unlikely and signals the Court views the issue as urgent and ripe for a merits decision.
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held. Multiple reports indicate a majority of justices expressed skepticism about the President's claimed authority under IEEPA. ↓↓ — This is the most significant recent event. It provides a strong signal of the Court's likely direction, pointing heavily toward an "unlawful" or "mixed" ruling.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's current conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming vast new powers of major economic and political significance without explicit, clear authorization from Congress. Imposing trillions of dollars in tariffs arguably qualifies as a "major question." (Large impact, pushes toward **Unlawful**).
2.  **Textual Interpretation of IEEPA:** The core legal dispute is whether IEEPA's language allowing the President to "regulate... any... importation... of... any property" includes the power to set tariffs, which are a form of tax. Constitutionally, the power to tax is granted to Congress. A textualist reading may find that "regulate" does not unambiguously encompass "tax." (Large impact, pushes toward **Unlawful**).
3.  **Distinction Between Tariff Rationales:** The Court could differentiate between the "trafficking tariffs" (linked to a traditional national security threat like cartels) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (linked to a purely economic issue like trade deficits). The former has a stronger, more plausible nexus to IEEPA's "unusual and extraordinary threat" language. This could lead the Court to split its decision. (Moderate impact, pushes toward **Mixed ruling**).
4.  **Non-Delegation Doctrine Concerns:** While the Court is unlikely to revive the non-delegation doctrine in full, its principles will inform the statutory interpretation. Justices may interpret IEEPA narrowly to avoid finding that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its core taxing and commerce powers to the President. (Moderate impact, pushes toward **Unlawful**).
5.  **Precedent & National Security Deference:** The government's case relies on a broad reading of precedent like *Dames & Moore* and general deference to the executive in national security. However, the Court has been narrowing deference doctrines, and the link between trade deficits and a national "emergency" is more tenuous than past IEEPA triggers. (Small impact, pushes toward **Lawful** but is a weak driver).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Judicial Philosophy Shift:** Compared to the Court that decided *Dames & Moore* in 1981, the current Court is far more focused on separation of powers and limiting executive authority, particularly via the major questions doctrine.
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** This case does not involve targeted sanctions against a hostile state (the historical use of IEEPA) but rather a fundamental reordering of U.S. trade policy with nearly all trading partners. The sheer economic scale is novel.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Declaring a trade deficit a "national emergency" to trigger IEEPA is a legally aggressive and novel interpretation, stretching the statute's original purpose far more than in prior cases.
*   **Expedited Review:** The Court's decision to take the case before all appellate review was complete and schedule it for a quick resolution underscores its perceived importance and makes a non-merits or delayed ruling very improbable.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of major executive actions, a reasonable prior might be centered on the government losing. E.g., Prior: **Unlawful (60%)**, Mixed (15%), Lawful (15%), Other/No Ruling (10%), with an equivalent n of ~10.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Unanimous lower court outcomes against the tariffs: ↑ Unlawful (moderate).
    *   Rise of the Major Questions Doctrine in current SCOTUS jurisprudence: ↑ Unlawful (large).
    *   Strongly skeptical oral argument reports from a majority of justices: ↑↑ Unlawful (large).
    *   Plausible legal distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs: ↑ Mixed (moderate).
    *   Expedited schedule granted by the Court: ↓ Other/No Ruling (large).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior belief that the government will lose. The posterior probability for **Unlawful** should increase significantly, drawing probability mass from all other options, especially "Lawful." "Mixed" remains a secondary but plausible outcome, while "Other" and "No Ruling" become near-zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Tariffs unlawful/Mixed):**
    *   Decisions in other, unrelated cases released before this one that continue the trend of narrowly interpreting statutory grants of executive power.
    *   Public speeches or writings by any of the justices that touch on themes of separation of powers or statutory interpretation, reinforcing a skeptical view of executive overreach.
    *   Unusually long delays in issuing the opinion, which could signal a fractured court or difficulty in writing a narrow opinion, potentially increasing the chance of a mixed/plurality outcome.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Tariffs unlawful/Mixed, i.e., pointing toward Lawful):**
    *   A major new international crisis that could make the Court more hesitant to curb presidential emergency powers.
    *   Leaked reports (highly unlikely) suggesting the post-argument conference vote was closer than the oral arguments implied.
    *   A surprising decision in another case that grants broad deference to the executive, suggesting a reversal of the recent trend.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Oral Arguments Can Mislead:** Justices sometimes play devil's advocate to test arguments. While a strong signal, it is not infallible.
*   **The "Mixed Ruling" Gotcha:** The key complexity is the possibility of a split decision. A forecast focused only on a binary lawful/unlawful outcome risks missing this nuance. The resolution criteria are specific about "some...lawful and some unlawful."
*   **Definition of "Other ruling":** A remand to the lower courts to reconsider the case under a new legal test announced by the Court, without a direct holding on the tariffs' legality, would resolve as "Other." This is a low-probability but possible outcome.
*   **Composition of Lower Court Majorities:** The Federal Circuit majority was bipartisan (6 D-appointees, 1 R-appointee), suggesting the legal arguments against the tariffs have purchase across the ideological spectrum, making it more likely the Supreme Court's majority will see it similarly.

**Final Research Summary:** The legal and evidentiary landscape points strongly toward the Supreme Court ruling against the Trump administration. The Court's recent jurisprudence limiting executive power, combined with deeply skeptical questioning during oral arguments, makes a finding that the tariffs are at least partially unlawful the most probable outcome. The main uncertainty is whether the Court invalidates all the tariffs ("Tariffs unlawful") or upholds the more narrowly targeted "trafficking tariffs" while striking down the broader "reciprocal tariffs" ("Mixed ruling").

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we'll apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities for each outcome.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful:** Historically, the Supreme Court has occasionally upheld broad executive powers under specific statutes like IEEPA, but recent trends show skepticism. Base rate: **15%**.
- **Tariffs unlawful:** Given the Court's recent decisions limiting executive power and the major questions doctrine, the base rate for the executive losing is high. Base rate: **60%**.
- **Mixed ruling:** The possibility of a nuanced decision, where some tariffs are upheld and others struck down, is plausible given the different justifications for the tariffs. Base rate: **15%**.
- **Other ruling:** While possible, the expedited schedule and consolidated review make a non-merits ruling less likely. Base rate: **5%**.
- **No 2025 ruling:** The expedited schedule and urgency suggest a ruling will occur. Base rate: **5%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current case aligns with the base rate scenario of the executive losing due to the major questions doctrine and skepticism of broad executive power. Differences include the unprecedented scope of the tariffs and the expedited review, which reduce the likelihood of "Other" and "No 2025 ruling."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unanimous lower court rulings against tariffs:** Strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful. Likelihood of this evidence if tariffs are unlawful is high.
- **Oral arguments indicating skepticism:** Strong indicator of an unlawful ruling. Likelihood of this evidence if tariffs are unlawful is very high.
- **Major questions doctrine:** Supports an unlawful ruling. Likelihood of this evidence if tariffs are unlawful is high.
- **Expedited schedule:** Reduces likelihood of "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs unlawful:** Prior odds = 60/40. Likelihood ratio from oral arguments and lower court rulings strongly favors unlawful. Posterior odds increase significantly.
- **Mixed ruling:** Prior odds = 15/85. Likelihood of nuanced decision due to different tariff justifications increases odds slightly.
- **Tariffs lawful:** Prior odds = 15/85. Likelihood ratio from evidence against lawful decreases odds.
- **Other ruling:** Prior odds = 5/95. Expedited schedule decreases odds further.
- **No 2025 ruling:** Prior odds = 5/95. Expedited schedule decreases odds further.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence check:** Consider the possibility of a mixed ruling due to different tariff justifications.
- **Tail risks:** A major international crisis could shift the Court's stance on executive power.
- **Alternative forecast:** A mixed ruling is plausible if the Court differentiates between tariff justifications.

### 6. Final Normalization

Adjust probabilities to sum to 100%:

- **Tariffs unlawful:** 70%
- **Mixed ruling:** 20%
- **Tariffs lawful:** 5%
- **Other ruling:** 3%
- **No 2025 ruling:** 2%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 70%  
Mixed ruling: 20%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 60%)**
- The Supreme Court has increasingly limited executive power under the "major questions doctrine" in recent cases like *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), and *Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. HHS* (2021).
- When executive actions are challenged on statutory grounds, the current Court has frequently ruled against broad interpretations of agency authority.
- Both lower courts have already ruled the tariffs unlawful, albeit with different reasoning.

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 20%)**
- The Court often seeks narrower grounds when possible, especially in cases with multiple distinct issues.
- There's a meaningful distinction between the "trafficking tariffs" (national security) and "reciprocal tariffs" (economic policy).
- The Court might find different statutory authority applies to different categories of tariffs.

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 10%)**
- Historical precedent in *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981) granted broad presidential authority under IEEPA.
- The Court sometimes defers to the executive branch on matters involving national security.

**Other ruling (Prior: 5%)**
- The Court occasionally avoids direct rulings on contentious issues through procedural means.
- This could include remanding without a clear merits holding.

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 5%)**
- The Court has granted expedited review with arguments already held in November 2025.
- Given the timeline, a ruling before January 2026 is highly likely.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other recent "major questions" cases, this involves an executive branch claim of broad authority under an existing statute.
- The case involves separation of powers questions that the current Court has shown interest in addressing.
- Lower courts have already ruled against the executive branch.

**Key differences:**
- The scope of these tariffs is unprecedented under IEEPA, affecting trillions of dollars in trade.
- The "national emergency" justification for trade deficits stretches IEEPA's original purpose more than previous applications.
- The Court has taken the unusual step of expedited review before complete appellate consideration.
- Oral arguments have already occurred with reports indicating significant skepticism from the justices.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Lower court rulings**
- Both the Court of International Trade and DC District Court ruled against the tariffs.
- The Federal Circuit affirmed (7-4) that the tariffs exceed IEEPA authority.
- P(E|Unlawful) = Very high (~90%)
- P(E|Lawful) = Low (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "Unlawful"

**Evidence 2: Oral argument reports**
- Multiple reports indicate a majority of justices expressed skepticism about the President's claimed authority.
- P(E|Unlawful) = High (~80%)
- P(E|Lawful) = Very low (~10%)
- P(E|Mixed) = Moderate (~50%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "Unlawful" or "Mixed" over "Lawful"

**Evidence 3: Expedited review schedule**
- The Court granted certiorari on an expedited schedule with arguments in November.
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~5%)
- P(E|Any ruling in 2025) = Very high (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio strongly disfavors "No 2025 ruling"

**Evidence 4: Distinction between tariff types**
- The "trafficking tariffs" have a stronger nexus to national security than the "reciprocal tariffs."
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = High (~75%)
- P(E|Unlawful) = Moderate (~40%)
- P(E|Lawful) = Low (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio favors "Mixed ruling"

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the strongest evidence: oral argument reports indicating judicial skepticism.

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 60%
- Prior odds: 60/40 = 1.5
- Likelihood ratio: 80/20 = 4
- Posterior odds: 1.5 × 4 = 6
- Posterior probability: 6/(1+6) = 6/7 ≈ 85.7%

For "Mixed ruling":
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 50/50 = 1
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 1 = 0.25
- Posterior probability: 0.25/(1+0.25) = 0.25/1.25 = 20%

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 10%
- Prior odds: 10/90 = 0.11
- Likelihood ratio: 10/90 = 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 0.11 = 0.012
- Posterior probability: 0.012/(1+0.012) ≈ 1.2%

Now let's update further based on the distinction between tariff types:

For "Mixed ruling":
- Prior (from previous update): 20%
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 75/25 = 3
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 3 = 0.75
- Posterior probability: 0.75/(1+0.75) = 0.75/1.75 ≈ 42.9%

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior (from previous update): 85.7%
- Prior odds: 85.7/14.3 = 6
- Likelihood ratio: 40/60 = 0.67
- Posterior odds: 6 × 0.67 = 4
- Posterior probability: 4/(1+4) = 4/5 = 80%

After these updates, the expedited schedule evidence further reduces "No 2025 ruling" to near-zero.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the oral argument reports. Justices sometimes play devil's advocate.
- The Court could surprise by finding a novel legal theory that upholds some tariffs.
- I might be underestimating the Court's deference to the executive on national security matters.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could issue a narrow ruling that avoids the core IEEPA question, perhaps finding procedural defects in the tariff implementation.
- The Court might remand with instructions for lower courts to apply a new test, which would resolve as "Other ruling."
- International developments could influence the Court to be more cautious about limiting presidential powers.

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase probability for "Other ruling" slightly given the complexity of the case.
- I should reduce "Tariffs unlawful" slightly to account for the possibility that oral arguments were misleading.
- The "No 2025 ruling" probability should remain very low given the expedited schedule.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and red team considerations:

Tariffs unlawful: 65%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Other ruling: 3%
Tariffs lawful: 1.5%
No 2025 ruling: 0.5%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 65%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Other ruling: 3%
Tariffs lawful: 1.5%
No 2025 ruling: 0.5%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "major executive actions challenged on statutory grounds before the current Supreme Court." Recent history in cases like *NFIB v. OSHA* (vaccine mandate), *West Virginia v. EPA* (climate regulations), and *Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. HHS* (eviction moratorium) shows a strong tendency for the Court to rule against broad executive interpretations of statutory authority, especially when they involve issues of major economic and political significance (the "major questions doctrine"). In these cases, the executive branch has consistently lost.

Based on this, I will set a prior probability that the government will lose on the merits (i.e., the outcome is "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling") at approximately 65%. I'll assign the remaining probability to the government winning ("Tariffs lawful") or a procedural outcome.

*   **P(Tariffs unlawful):** 50%
*   **P(Mixed ruling):** 15%
*   **P(Tariffs lawful):** 30%
*   **P(Other ruling):** 3%
*   **P(No 2025 ruling):** 2%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This case is highly similar to the base rate scenario. The President is using a 1977 statute (IEEPA) to justify a sweeping economic policy (nationwide tariffs) not explicitly authorized by the text. This is a classic "major questions" fact pattern.

The case is different in that IEEPA explicitly deals with presidential power in national emergencies, which could argue for more deference to the executive. However, this difference arguably makes the government's case *weaker*, not stronger, for two reasons:
1.  The "emergency" of a trade deficit is a novel and legally aggressive interpretation of IEEPA, stretching the statute beyond its traditional national security applications.
2.  The power to impose tariffs is constitutionally granted to Congress (the power of the purse), making any claimed delegation of that authority subject to intense scrutiny.

Therefore, the specifics of this case reinforce the base rate expectation that the Court will be skeptical of the executive's claims.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence provided:

*   **Evidence 1: Lower Court Rulings.** Two different federal courts, including the specialized Court of International Trade, have ruled the tariffs unlawful. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed one of those rulings. This creates a strong judicial consensus against the government's position. This evidence is highly likely if the tariffs are indeed unlawful (P(E|H)) and unlikely if they are lawful (P(E|~H)). This evidence strongly pushes probability away from "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Evidence 2: Expedited Supreme Court Review.** The Court's decision to grant certiorari and fast-track the case for a decision in 2025 makes the "No 2025 ruling" option extremely unlikely. It signals the Court sees the issue as urgent and intends to resolve it on the merits. This drives the probability of "No 2025 ruling" to near zero and slightly reduces the chance of an "Other ruling" (like a procedural punt).

*   **Evidence 3: Skeptical Oral Arguments.** Multiple reports indicate that a majority of justices expressed skepticism toward the government's arguments. As noted in the research report, strong signals from oral arguments are highly predictive of the final outcome (85-95% accuracy). This is the single most powerful piece of evidence. The likelihood of such reports is very high if the Court is planning to rule against the government and very low if it plans to rule for the government. This evidence justifies a massive update away from "Tariffs lawful" and toward "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

*   **Evidence 4: Distinction Between Tariff Types.** The case involves two distinct sets of tariffs: "trafficking tariffs" (linked to a traditional security threat) and "reciprocal tariffs" (linked to an economic issue). This factual distinction provides the Court with a clear path to issue a split decision, upholding one while striking down the other. This evidence increases the relative likelihood of a "Mixed ruling" compared to a clean sweep "Tariffs unlawful" ruling.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
I will conceptually update my priors based on the evidence.

1.  **Initial Priors:** P(Unlawful/Mixed) ≈ 65%, P(Lawful) ≈ 30%.
2.  **Update for Lower Courts:** The unanimous lower court losses strengthen the initial prior. Let's shift 10 points from "Lawful" to "Unlawful/Mixed". New state: P(Unlawful/Mixed) ≈ 75%, P(Lawful) ≈ 20%.
3.  **Update for Oral Arguments:** This is the strongest update. Given the 85-95% predictive power, the probability of the government winning ("Lawful") must drop dramatically. Let's reduce P(Lawful) from 20% down to 5%. The 15 points of probability are transferred to "Unlawful" and "Mixed". New state: P(Unlawful/Mixed) ≈ 90%, P(Lawful) ≈ 5%.
4.  **Update for Expedited Schedule:** P(No 2025 ruling) drops to its floor, around 1%. P(Other ruling) is also reduced, perhaps to 4%.
5.  **Distribute between "Unlawful" and "Mixed":** The remaining 90% must be split between these two. The "Mixed ruling" option is very plausible as it offers a path of judicial minimalism, allowing the Court to curb the most aggressive use of IEEPA without completely stripping the President of emergency economic powers. However, a clean "Unlawful" ruling based on the core principle that IEEPA does not grant taxing power is also a very strong possibility. I will assign a higher probability to the cleaner, more sweeping "Unlawful" ruling but give substantial weight to the "Mixed" outcome. This leads to a final distribution of roughly 54% for "Unlawful" and 36% for "Mixed".

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk is over-reliance on the signals from oral arguments, which are not infallible. A justice could have been playing devil's advocate, or a silent justice could be the decisive vote. I have accounted for this by leaving a 5% probability for "Tariffs lawful." Another risk is underestimating the chance of a procedural outcome ("Other ruling"), such as the Court creating a new legal test and remanding the case. I have assigned 4% to this, which seems appropriate for a low-probability but plausible "off-ramp" for the Court. The biggest uncertainty is the split between "Unlawful" and "Mixed." The 54/36 split reflects my judgment that a broad ruling is more likely than a narrow one, but the narrow one is a very close second. This distribution seems well-calibrated to the available information.

### 6. Final Normalization
The final probabilities are:
*   Tariffs lawful: 5%
*   Tariffs unlawful: 54%
*   Mixed ruling: 36%
*   Other ruling: 4%
*   No 2025 ruling: 1%
The sum is 100%. The distribution reflects a very high probability (90%) that the government will lose on the merits, with the main uncertainty being whether the loss is total or partial.
