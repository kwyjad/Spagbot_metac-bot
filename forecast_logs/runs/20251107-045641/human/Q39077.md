### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Prime Ministers during the French Fifth Republic (1958-Present):** There have been 26 Prime Ministers. The vast majority (~85%) have come from the same political side as the sitting President. This base rate suggests a high probability of a PM from the President's coalition (Together for the Republic, The Democrats, Horizons). However, this class is of limited use due to the current unprecedented parliamentary situation.
2.  **Prime Ministers during "Cohabitation" (1986-88, 1993-95, 1997-2002):** In these three instances (representing ~10% of the Fifth Republic's duration), the President was forced to appoint a PM from an opposition party that held an absolute majority in the National Assembly. This is not the current situation, as no party has a majority. This reference class suggests that a President will bow to parliamentary reality, but only when that reality is unambiguous.
3.  **Governments in a Tri-polar Hung Parliament (2024-Present):** This is the most relevant, but also the smallest, reference class. It contains only two data points: the Barnier (Republican Right) and Bayrou (The Democrats) governments. Both were short-lived and collapsed due to an inability to command a stable majority. This class suggests a ~100% failure rate for forming a durable government under current conditions, making instability and caretaker periods the norm.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-28 (Assumed):** PM Bayrou announces a confidence vote for his budget plan. ↑ for "No Prime Minister" — Signals a high-stakes gamble that, given the parliamentary arithmetic and opposition statements, is likely to fail and trigger another government collapse.
*   **2025-09-08 (Assumed):** Bayrou's government is brought down by a vote of no confidence. ↑↑ for "No Prime Minister" — Confirms the parliamentary deadlock is unbreakable. Macron has now tried a PM from the center-right and his own centrist camp; both failed, leaving him with very few options.
*   **2025-09-10 (Assumed):** President Macron begins consultations with party leaders for the third time in a year. ↑ for "No Prime Minister" — This process is now familiar and unlikely to yield a new, stable outcome. Parties' positions have hardened, making a compromise candidate harder to find.
*   **2025-10-15 (Assumed):** Media reports suggest Macron is exploring a "technocratic" government of non-politicians. ↑ for "Other" or "No Prime Minister" — This is a classic last-ditch effort in a deadlock. It is unlikely to receive parliamentary support, making a prolonged caretaker period more probable.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Appointment Power:** Macron retains the sole authority to nominate the Prime Minister. His demonstrated refusal to appoint from the NFP or National Rally, despite their parliamentary strength, severely narrows the field of viable candidates. (Large effect)
2.  **Parliamentary Arithmetic & the "Unholy Alliance":** The tri-polar structure means no two blocs can form a majority without the third. The far-left (LFI) and far-right (RN) have repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to form a temporary "negative coalition" to vote down any centrist or center-right government. (Large effect)
3.  **Constitutional Constraints:** Macron can dissolve parliament, but having done so recently with poor results, he is likely extremely reluctant to try again so soon. This removes his main threat and encourages parliamentary gridlock. (Moderate effect)
4.  **Political Exhaustion:** After more than a year of crisis, parties and the public may be exhausted. This could either lead to a breakthrough compromise on a unity candidate (low probability) or, more likely, a resigned acceptance of a prolonged caretaker government to handle day-to-day affairs. (Moderate effect)
5.  **Short Time Horizon:** With less than two months until the resolution date, there is very little time to conduct lengthy negotiations, appoint a new PM, form a cabinet, and win (or at least not lose) a confidence vote. The path of least resistance is to continue with a caretaker government. (Large effect)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Tri-polar Parliament:** Unlike past left-right cohabitations, the current three-bloc system (center, left, far-right) makes stable majority-building almost mathematically impossible, as the ideological distance is too great.
*   **Failed Minority Governments:** The rapid collapse of both the Barnier and (assumed) Bayrou governments establishes a powerful recent precedent that minority governments are not viable, a departure from some other European parliamentary systems.
*   **Weakened Presidency:** President Macron lacks the parliamentary majority that has been the bedrock of presidential power for most of the Fifth Republic. His initiatives are dead on arrival without broad, and unlikely, cross-party support.
*   **Prevalence of Caretaker Status:** The resolution criteria define a caretaker government as "No Prime Minister." Historically, caretaker periods were brief, transitional formalities. The current crisis has made a prolonged caretaker government a plausible, stable outcome in itself.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a weak prior (n≈5) centered on the President's coalition (The Democrats, Together, Horizons), reflecting the historical base rate but acknowledging the instability. Distribute low probabilities to other parties and "No Prime Minister."
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Barnier's government collapse (Dec 2024): ↑ Large for "No Prime Minister," demonstrating the power of the negative coalition.
    *   Bayrou's appointment (Dec 2024): ↓ Small for "No Prime Minister," as it was an attempt to break the deadlock.
    *   Bayrou's (assumed) government collapse (Sep 2025): ↑↑ Very Large for "No Prime Minister." This is the crucial update, showing the failure of yet another formula and the exhaustion of Macron's credible options.
    *   Short time to resolution (Nov-Dec 2025): ↑ Moderate for "No Prime Minister," as the default outcome of inaction/deadlock is a caretaker government.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points toward the failure of conventional governance. The posterior probability for **"No Prime Minister"** should be revised sharply upwards to become the most likely outcome. Probabilities for all other named parties should decrease significantly.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for a specific party PM):**
    *   Macron holds a public, high-profile meeting with a single opposition leader (e.g., Marine Le Pen, Jean-Luc Mélenchon), suggesting a major concession.
    *   A major party (e.g., Socialists, Republicans) publicly splits, with a faction offering to support a government.
    *   Prominent figures from different parties co-author an op-ed calling for a "government of national unity" around a specific individual.
    *   Serious discussions of a new election in early 2026, which might incentivize a short-term stable government to oversee it.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring "No Prime Minister"):**
    *   Macron makes a televised address emphasizing the need for "responsibility" and "continuity of the state" without naming a new PM.
    *   The current caretaker PM is delegated significant but non-controversial tasks (e.g., representing France at an international summit).
    *   Party leaders issue statements blaming each other for the deadlock and ruling out further compromises.
    *   Media focus shifts from "who will be PM?" to "how does a caretaker government function long-term?"

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria:** The "caretaker government = No Prime Minister" clause is critical. Given the high likelihood of a prolonged political vacuum, this option is a major contender and must not be overlooked.
*   **The "Other" Candidate:** A surprise "technocrat" or a consensus figure from civil society could be appointed. This person would not belong to a parliamentary group, resolving as "Other." This is a plausible "out of the box" solution for Macron.
*   **Constitutional Hardball:** The situation is unprecedented. Macron could attempt a novel and legally ambiguous constitutional maneuver, creating an unpredictable outcome.
*   **Fictional Scenario:** The prompt is based on a fictional projection. Real-world events could introduce unforeseen dynamics, though the core logic of the parliamentary deadlock is sound.
*   **Definition of "Belonging":** A PM might be a member of a party (e.g., The Republicans) but not formally sit with their parliamentary group. The resolution hinges on the "National Assembly grouping," which is a precise definition.

### Final Research Summary
The French political system is in a state of sustained deadlock following the successive collapses of the Barnier and Bayrou governments. With no viable path to a stable majority and a short time until year-end, President Macron's most probable course of action is to allow a caretaker government to remain in place, making "No Prime Minister" the most likely outcome.

To forecast the probability of which grouping the Prime Minister of France will belong to on December 31, 2025, I will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **The Democrats, Together for the Republic, Horizons**: Historically, Prime Ministers often come from the President's coalition. However, given the current political crisis and the failure of the Bayrou government, the base rate for these options is lower than usual.
- **La France Insoumise, Socialists and affiliated, Republican Right, National Rally**: These options are less likely due to the current political deadlock and Macron's reluctance to appoint from these groups.
- **Other**: This includes technocrats or non-political figures. Historically rare, but given the deadlock, this is a plausible option.
- **No Prime Minister**: The current political situation and the recent history of failed governments suggest a high probability for this outcome.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The historical tendency for the President to appoint a PM from his coalition.
- **Differences**: The unprecedented tri-polar parliament and the failure of recent governments make the current situation unique.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Bayrou's government collapse**: Strong evidence for "No Prime Minister" as it shows the failure of another government.
- **Macron's consultations and technocratic government exploration**: Suggests difficulty in forming a stable government, increasing the likelihood of "No Prime Minister" or "Other".
- **Short time horizon**: Increases the likelihood of "No Prime Minister" due to the lack of time for negotiations.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior for "No Prime Minister"**: Given the evidence, this starts relatively high.
- **Evidence from Bayrou's collapse**: Increases the likelihood significantly.
- **Technocratic exploration**: Slight increase for "Other", but primarily supports "No Prime Minister".
- **Short time horizon**: Further increases the likelihood of "No Prime Minister".

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Consider the possibility of a last-minute political breakthrough or a surprise technocratic appointment.
- **Alternative scenarios**: A unity government could emerge, though unlikely given current dynamics.
- **Rebuttals**: The consistent failure of forming stable governments supports the "No Prime Minister" outcome.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Here is the final forecast:

The Democrats: 5%  
Together for the Republic: 5%  
Horizons: 5%  
La France Insoumise: 5%  
Socialists and affiliated: 5%  
Republican Right: 5%  
National Rally: 5%  
Other: 15%  
No Prime Minister: 50%  

These probabilities reflect the high likelihood of continued political deadlock leading to a caretaker government, with some chance of a technocratic or unexpected appointment.

# Analysis of French Prime Minister Grouping by December 31, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by considering historical patterns and the current political landscape:

**For President's Coalition (Together for the Republic, The Democrats, Horizons):**
- Historically, ~85% of PMs in the Fifth Republic have come from the President's political side
- However, the current hung parliament significantly reduces this probability
- Prior: 30% combined (10% each for The Democrats, Together for the Republic, Horizons)

**For Opposition Parties (LFI, Socialists, Republican Right, National Rally):**
- During "cohabitation" periods (~10% of Fifth Republic), PMs came from opposition
- Current parliamentary arithmetic gives these groups significant power
- Prior: 40% combined (10% each)

**For "No Prime Minister" (caretaker government):**
- Historically rare in Fifth Republic, but the current crisis has already produced extended periods without a formal PM
- Prior: 25%

**For "Other":**
- Technocrats or unity candidates outside major parties occasionally emerge in crises
- Prior: 5%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to historical base rate:**
- Constitutional framework remains the same (President appoints PM)
- Political parties still organize along left-center-right spectrum
- Parliamentary approval still required for government to function

**Critical differences:**
- Unprecedented tri-polar parliament with no workable majority coalition
- Two failed governments already in this cycle (Barnier and Bayrou)
- Macron's weakened position after failed snap election gambit
- Short timeframe until resolution (less than two months)
- Demonstrated willingness of ideologically opposed parties to form "negative coalitions"

These differences substantially reduce the likelihood of a stable government forming before year-end.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Barnier government collapse**
- P(E|H="No PM"): Very High (~0.9) - Shows the difficulty of forming stable government
- P(E|H="Party PM"): Moderate (~0.5) - Could be specific to Barnier, not the system

**Evidence: Bayrou's assumed government collapse in September 2025**
- P(E|H="No PM"): Very High (~0.95) - Confirms systemic problem, not just one-time failure
- P(E|H="Party PM"): Low (~0.3) - Two consecutive failures suggest fundamental deadlock

**Evidence: Short timeframe until resolution (less than 2 months)**
- P(E|H="No PM"): High (~0.8) - Favors status quo/caretaker government
- P(E|H="Party PM"): Low (~0.2) - Insufficient time for complex negotiations

**Evidence: Tri-polar parliamentary arithmetic**
- P(E|H="No PM"): High (~0.8) - Makes stable majority nearly impossible
- P(E|H="Party PM"): Low (~0.2) - Would require unprecedented cross-ideological cooperation

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the key evidence of Bayrou's government collapse:

For "No Prime Minister":
- Prior probability: 25%
- Prior odds: 0.25/0.75 = 0.33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.3 = 3.17
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 3.17 = 1.05
- Posterior probability: 1.05/(1+1.05) = 51.2%

This single update more than doubles the probability of "No Prime Minister" outcome.

Further updating on the short timeframe:
- Prior probability (from above): 51.2%
- Prior odds: 51.2/48.8 = 1.05
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 1.05 × 4 = 4.2
- Posterior probability: 4.2/(1+4.2) = 80.8%

These updates dramatically increase the likelihood of "No Prime Minister" while correspondingly decreasing probabilities for all party options.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent events (recency bias)
- I might underestimate Macron's creativity in finding a compromise candidate
- The "Other" category could be more likely if a technocratic government emerges

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A national crisis (economic/security) could force compromise on a unity government
- Macron might make major concessions to one bloc to secure a PM
- A splinter group from a major party could provide crucial votes for a compromise candidate

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest alternative is that Macron appoints a technocratic PM from "Other" category who focuses narrowly on budget passage and administrative continuity. This could be acceptable as a temporary solution to all parties.

**Rebuttal:** The evidence suggests even technocratic governments would face no-confidence votes, as parties are incentivized to maintain the deadlock until the 2027 presidential election.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming, I'll adjust my probabilities:

- No Prime Minister: 65% (caretaker government most likely outcome)
- Other: 10% (technocratic/unity candidate possibility)
- The Democrats: 5% (Macron's closest allies)
- Together for the Republic: 5% (Macron's party)
- Horizons: 3% (Macron-aligned but distinct)
- Socialists and affiliated: 4% (more moderate left option)
- Republican Right: 3% (already tried with Barnier)
- La France Insoumise: 2% (ideologically distant from Macron)
- National Rally: 3% (Macron has strongly resisted)

## 7. Final Forecast

The Democrats: 5%  
Together for the Republic: 5%  
Horizons: 3%  
La France Insoumise: 2%  
Socialists and affiliated: 4%  
Republican Right: 3%  
National Rally: 3%  
Other: 10%  
No Prime Minister: 65%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Initial Base Rate:** In the French Fifth Republic, the President almost always appoints a Prime Minister from their own political coalition. This would suggest a high prior for "Together for the Republic," "The Democrats," or "Horizons."
*   **Relevant Reference Class:** However, the current situation is a tri-polar hung parliament, which is unprecedented. The most relevant, albeit tiny, reference class is the period from July 2024 to the present (fictional November 2025). In this period, two governments from different political groupings (Republican Right, The Democrats) have been appointed and have quickly collapsed. This establishes a new, highly relevant "base rate" of extreme instability, where no appointed government can survive.
*   **Chosen Prior:** My prior will be heavily weighted by this new reference class. The default state of this system is not a stable government, but rather a political deadlock. Therefore, the prior for "No Prime Minister" (which includes a caretaker government) should be significantly higher than for any specific party. I will set a conceptual prior of ~50% for "No Prime Minister" and distribute the remaining 50% among the other options, with a slight preference for a technocrat ("Other") or a centrist compromise.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarity:** The situation on November 7, 2025, is identical in its core political arithmetic to the situation that led to the fall of the Barnier government and the (imminent) fall of the Bayrou government. The three blocs in parliament have not changed their fundamental positions.
*   **Differences & Why They Matter:** The key difference is political exhaustion and the exhaustion of options. President Macron has now tried appointing a PM from the center-right (Barnier) and his own center (Bayrou). Both attempts failed. This makes a third attempt with a candidate from an established party much less likely to be tried or to succeed. The "solution space" has shrunk dramatically, making the default outcome of continued deadlock more probable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the two key pieces of evidence from the fictional timeline:

*   **Evidence 1: The collapse of the Barnier (Republican Right) government in late 2024.**
    *   **P(E1 | A stable PM is possible):** Low. This event demonstrates that even a coalition with the center-right is not viable against the "negative coalition" of the far-left and far-right.
    *   **P(E1 | Deadlock is the norm):** High. This is exactly what one would expect if the parliament is fundamentally ungovernable.
    *   **Update:** This evidence strongly increases the probability of "No Prime Minister" and decreases the probability of a "Republican Right" PM.

*   **Evidence 2: The (assumed) collapse of the Bayrou (The Democrats) government in September 2025.**
    *   **P(E2 | A stable PM is possible):** Very Low. This is the crucial piece of evidence. It shows that even a PM from the President's own camp, who should theoretically be the easiest to build a coalition around, cannot survive. It proves the deadlock is persistent.
    *   **P(E2 | Deadlock is the norm):** Very High. This confirms the hypothesis from Evidence 1.
    *   **Update:** This evidence provides a massive update towards "No Prime Minister" and severely reduces the probabilities for "The Democrats," "Together for the Republic," and "Horizons."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update on the odds of "No Prime Minister" (H) versus "Any stable Prime Minister" (~H).

*   **Prior Odds:** Let's start with my chosen prior of 50/50, meaning the odds are 1:1.
*   **Evidence:** The successive failures of both the Barnier and Bayrou governments. This combined evidence is much more likely if the system is in a state of permanent deadlock (H) than if a stable solution is findable (~H). Let's estimate the likelihood ratio, P(E|H) / P(E|~H), to be around 4-to-1. It's at least four times more likely to see two consecutive government collapses if the underlying state is "deadlock" than if it's "a solution is possible."
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds (1/1) × Likelihood Ratio (4/1) = 4/1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** A 4/1 odds ratio translates to a probability of 4 / (4+1) = 80%.

This calculation suggests a very high probability for "No Prime Minister." I will use this as a strong anchor for my final distribution, tempering it slightly to account for unforeseen events. The short timeframe (less than two months to the resolution date) further strengthens this conclusion, as forming a new, stable government is a slow process.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating President Macron's ability to create a political surprise? The main alternative to deadlock is a "government of national unity" or a "technocratic government." This would most likely resolve as "Other," or possibly "Socialists" or "Republican Right" if a consensus figure emerges from one of those parties. This is the most plausible scenario where my forecast is wrong.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** The best alternative forecast would place "Other" as the most likely option. The reasoning would be that the political crisis becomes so untenable that Macron is forced to appoint a neutral, non-political figure to manage the budget and essential state functions, and that the opposition parties, fearing public backlash, would reluctantly allow such a government to function for a short period.
*   **Rebuttal:** While plausible, even a technocratic government would need at least tacit support from parliament. The same "negative coalition" that brought down Barnier and Bayrou could easily vote it down on the first major piece of legislation. Therefore, a prolonged caretaker government remains the path of least resistance and the more probable outcome.
*   **Adjustment:** I will ensure that "Other" has the second-highest probability, reflecting its status as the most credible alternative to continued deadlock. I will also assign small but non-zero probabilities to the moderate opposition parties (Socialists, Republican Right) as potential sources of a compromise candidate.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the reasoning above, I will set the probability for "No Prime Minister" to be very high, reflecting the persistent deadlock and short timeframe. "Other" will be the next most likely, representing the "technocratic solution." The remaining probabilities will be distributed thinly across the established parties, with the extremes (LFI, RN) being the least likely.

The Democrats: 2%
Together for the Republic: 3%
Horizons: 2%
La France Insoumise: 2%
Socialists and affiliated: 5%
Republican Right: 3%
National Rally: 2%
Other: 13%
No Prime Minister: 68%
