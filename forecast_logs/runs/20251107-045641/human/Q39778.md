### Reference class & base rates
-   **Contested COP Host Selections:** The primary reference class is the selection of a COP host within a designated UN regional group when more than one country bids. Historically, the vast majority of these contests are resolved by consensus in favor of one of the bidders. A failure to reach consensus, triggering the default to Bonn, Germany, is extremely rare.
    -   **Base Rate:** A bidding nation is selected >95% of the time. The default host (Bonn) is selected <5% of the time.
-   **Bids from WEOG Members:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is politically diverse, containing the EU bloc, the CANZUKUS countries (Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, US), and others like Turkey and Israel. Bids from established EU members often proceed smoothly. Bids from non-EU members like Australia or Turkey can involve more complex geopolitical calculations. In a two-bidder race within this group, the outcome is often determined by diplomatic capital and the strength of the narrative.
    -   **Base Rate:** A naive starting point for a two-bidder race could be 50/50, but this should be heavily adjusted by diplomatic factors. A bid with strong backing from a major bloc (like the EU or US) is significantly more likely to succeed.
-   **"Climate Justice" Themed Bids:** Bids that incorporate a strong narrative of climate justice or partnership with vulnerable nations (like Australia's bid with the Pacific) are a more recent phenomenon. This framing is designed to appeal to the core mission of the UNFCCC and can be a powerful diplomatic tool, especially with European nations.
    -   **Base Rate:** This is an emerging class with few data points, but such bids appear to have a strong advantage in securing broad support if perceived as authentic.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-13] Australia's Department of Climate Change (DCCEEW) re-confirms its latest NDC submission. ↑ Reinforces the seriousness of Australia's climate policy shift, a cornerstone of its COP31 bid's credibility.
-   [2025-09-18] Australian Government announces its 2035 emissions reduction target (62-70% below 2005 levels). ↑ **Large.** This is the most significant recent event, directly addressing historical criticism of Australia as a climate laggard and substantially strengthening its case within WEOG.
-   [2025-08-19] CDP highlights the importance of Australia's new NDC for its COP31 bid. ↑ Shows that key international climate organizations link the bid's success to policy ambition, a test Australia has now passed.
-   [2024-11-10] A UNSW report notes Australia's bid has received support from countries in the WEOG group. ↑ Early indicator that Australia's diplomatic outreach is proving effective, making consensus more likely.
-   [2024-11-01] The South Australian government formally launches its bid for Adelaide to be the host city. ↑ Demonstrates concrete sub-national commitment and logistical readiness, moving the bid from concept to a tangible project.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **WEOG Consensus:** (Large) This is the determinative mechanism. The decision requires consensus among all WEOG members. Strong opposition from even a small bloc can derail a bid. Australia's traditional alliances (CANZUKUS) and its Pacific partnership narrative are key assets for building this consensus.
-   **Climate Policy Credibility:** (Large) A host country is expected to lead by example. Australia's past reputation as a climate laggard was its biggest liability. The new, ambitious 2035 NDC largely neutralizes this weakness and turns it into a strength, showcasing a dramatic policy shift.
-   **Diplomatic Narrative & Alliances:** (Moderate) Australia's "co-hosted with the Pacific" narrative is diplomatically potent, framing the event around the nations most affected by climate change. This appeals strongly to the EU and other progressive members. Turkey's narrative and support base within WEOG appear less defined.
-   **Geopolitical Headwinds for Turkey:** (Moderate) Turkey's complex relationship with several key EU members and the US could complicate its ability to build a unanimous consensus within WEOG, independent of the merits of its bid.
-   **Risk of Stalemate:** (Small) If both Australia and Turkey have enough support to block the other but not enough to win, a stalemate could occur. The high cost and diplomatic failure associated with defaulting to Bonn create strong incentives for WEOG members to broker a compromise, making this a low-probability outcome.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Host as a Former "Laggard":** Unlike typical European hosts, Australia is a major fossil fuel exporter attempting a rapid energy transition. Hosting COP31 is a central part of this "redemption arc," making the stakes and the narrative fundamentally different from a standard bid.
-   **Innovative Co-Host Model:** The formal partnership with Pacific Island nations is a unique and strategic feature. It is not just a theme but a core part of the bid's diplomatic structure, designed to secure the moral high ground.
-   **High-Profile Bipolar Contest:** This is not a quiet, technocratic selection but a visible contest between two significant, non-EU WEOG members. This raises the political stakes and makes the outcome a reflection of broader geopolitical alignments within the group.
-   **Explicit Default Condition:** The well-understood default to Bonn acts as a "Schelling point" in case of failure. This clarity might pressure the parties to avoid a complete breakdown in negotiations, potentially favoring the bid with the broadest (if not deepest) support.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of contested bids, a reasonable prior would place a high probability on a bidder winning. An informed prior might be: Australia 65%, Turkey 30%, Germany 5%. (Equivalent n ≈ 15, reflecting moderate confidence in Australia's structural advantages).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑ **Large:** Australia's ambitious 2035 NDC submission fundamentally improves its credibility.
    -   ↑ **Moderate:** The "co-host with the Pacific" narrative is a powerful and unique diplomatic tool.
    -   ↑ **Small:** Confirmed sub-national support (Adelaide) and early reports of WEOG backing show momentum.
    -   ↓ **Moderate (for Turkey):** Lack of recent public momentum or a strong counter-narrative from Turkey's bid.
    -   ↓ **Small (for Germany):** The strength of Australia's bid makes a complete deadlock, the only path to a Bonn COP, less likely.
-   **Net effect:** The recent evidence, particularly the new NDC, is overwhelmingly positive for Australia. The posterior probability for Australia should increase significantly, primarily by drawing probability away from Turkey, and secondarily from Germany.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    -   Public endorsements of Australia's bid by major WEOG players (e.g., the EU Presidency, Germany, France, Canada, US).
    -   Joint statements or events featuring Australian and Pacific Island leaders promoting the bid.
    -   Reports from diplomatic circles (e.g., at COP30) of a consensus forming around Australia.
    -   Turkey publicly scaling back its lobbying efforts or withdrawing its bid.
-   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    -   A major WEOG country or bloc publicly endorsing Turkey's bid.
    -   Prominent Pacific Island nations criticizing the partnership as tokenistic or insufficient.
    -   Reports of a deadlock in WEOG negotiations, with factions forming around each candidate.
    -   Turkey announcing a significant new climate commitment or a compelling diplomatic partnership of its own.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Opaque Negotiations:** The final decision is made in closed-door WEOG meetings. Public statements may not reflect the true state of negotiations; a "quiet" bid from Turkey is not necessarily a "weak" one.
-   **Geopolitical Volatility:** A sudden diplomatic dispute between Australia and a key WEOG bloc, or conversely, a charm offensive by Turkey, could rapidly alter the consensus-building process.
-   **Bid Authenticity Scrutiny:** Australia's bid relies on its climate transformation narrative. Any new policy seen as backsliding on climate (e.g., approving new major fossil fuel projects) could be highly damaging.
-   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The "Another Pacific Island Nation" option is highly improbable. The bid is for a co-hosted event with the venue in Adelaide, Australia. Resolution would be "Australia." A separate, successful bid from a Pacific nation is a black swan event.
-   **Conditional Support:** Support for Australia's bid may be conditional on further climate policy actions, which may or may not materialize before the decision is made.

**Final Research Summary:** Australia is the decisive frontrunner to host COP31. Its bid is strengthened by a powerful diplomatic narrative of partnership with vulnerable Pacific nations and, most critically, has been legitimized by a new, ambitious 2035 climate target that addresses its primary historical weakness.

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the historical context of contested COP host selections, where a bidding nation is selected over 95% of the time, and considering Australia's strong diplomatic narrative and recent climate policy shifts, a reasonable prior for Australia is 65%.
- **Turkey**: As the only other official bidder within the WEOG group, Turkey's prior probability is set at 30%, reflecting its bid's potential but acknowledging geopolitical complexities.
- **Germany**: As the default host, Germany's prior is less than 5% due to the rarity of defaulting to Bonn.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This option is highly improbable as the bid is for a co-hosted event with Australia, not a separate bid. Prior probability is negligible.
- **Other**: This option is also negligible given the current bids.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The current case is similar to the base rate scenario where a strong bid with diplomatic backing is likely to succeed. The difference is Australia's unique co-hosting model with Pacific nations, which enhances its bid.
- **Turkey**: Similar to other non-EU bids, Turkey faces geopolitical challenges. The difference is the lack of a strong counter-narrative or recent momentum.
- **Germany**: Similar to the base case of default hosts, but unlikely due to strong bids from Australia and Turkey.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Not applicable as a separate bid.
- **Other**: Not applicable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**:
  - **2035 NDC Submission**: Highly likely if Australia is to host, reinforcing its climate policy credibility.
  - **Co-hosting with Pacific Nations**: Likely if Australia is to host, appealing to climate justice narratives.
  - **WEOG Support**: Likely if Australia is to host, as early indicators show diplomatic success.
- **Turkey**:
  - **Geopolitical Headwinds**: Likely if Turkey is not to host, as it complicates consensus-building.
- **Germany**:
  - **Default Host**: Unlikely unless a stalemate occurs, which is rare.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: 
  - Prior odds: 65% / (1 - 65%) = 1.857
  - Likelihood ratio: Strong evidence (e.g., NDC submission) increases odds significantly.
  - Posterior odds: 1.857 × High likelihood ratio = Increased odds
  - Posterior probability: Adjusted upwards from 65% based on strong evidence.

- **Turkey**: 
  - Prior odds: 30% / (1 - 30%) = 0.429
  - Likelihood ratio: Moderate to low due to lack of momentum.
  - Posterior odds: 0.429 × Moderate likelihood ratio = Slightly decreased odds
  - Posterior probability: Adjusted downwards from 30%.

- **Germany**: 
  - Prior odds: <5% / (1 - <5%) = Very low
  - Likelihood ratio: Low due to strong bids.
  - Posterior probability: Remains low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Ensure not overly biased towards Australia's narrative. Consider Turkey's potential diplomatic maneuvers.
- **Tail Risks**: Consider geopolitical shifts or new climate commitments from Turkey.
- **Alternative Forecast**: Turkey could gain momentum if it secures significant endorsements or partnerships.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% after adjustments.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 75%  
Turkey: 20%  
Germany: 4%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0%  
Other: 1%  

This distribution reflects Australia's strong position bolstered by recent evidence, while accounting for Turkey's potential and the low likelihood of defaulting to Germany.

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia is one of two official bidders from the WEOG group, which is scheduled to host COP 31. In a two-bidder race, a naive starting point would be 50%, but I'm adjusting slightly downward due to Australia's historical reputation as a climate laggard, which could create some resistance despite recent policy changes.

**Turkey**: 35% 
- Rationale: As the other official bidder from WEOG, Turkey starts with a strong position. However, I'm setting this lower than Australia due to less visible diplomatic momentum and potentially more complex relationships with key WEOG members.

**Germany**: 15%
- Rationale: Germany is the default host (Bonn) if consensus cannot be reached. Historically, such defaults are rare (<5%), but given the potential for a deadlock between two significant non-EU WEOG members, I'm assigning a higher probability than the historical base rate.

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 3%
- Rationale: While Australia is proposing co-hosting with Pacific nations, the actual venue would be in Adelaide. A standalone bid from a Pacific nation would be highly unusual and outside the regional rotation system.

**Other**: 2%
- Rationale: This accounts for any unexpected outcomes, such as a different WEOG country emerging as a compromise candidate or procedural changes.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The host selection follows the established UN regional rotation system
- The decision requires consensus within the designated regional group (WEOG)
- Multiple countries have submitted bids, creating a competitive selection process
- The default mechanism (Bonn, Germany) exists as a fallback

**Key differences:**
- Australia's bid includes an innovative co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations, creating a unique diplomatic narrative
- Australia has recently made a dramatic policy shift with its ambitious 2035 emissions target (62-70% below 2005 levels), fundamentally changing its climate credentials
- This is a high-profile contest between two significant non-EU WEOG members, raising the political stakes
- The explicit "co-hosting" model with vulnerable nations creates a compelling climate justice narrative that aligns with UNFCCC priorities

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring Australia:**
- Australia's new 2035 emissions reduction target (62-70% below 2005 levels)
  - P(E|Australia wins): ~90% (This policy shift strongly supports their bid)
  - P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~60% (They would likely make this commitment regardless)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~1.5

- Australia's "co-hosting with Pacific" narrative
  - P(E|Australia wins): ~95% (This is a core strength of their bid)
  - P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~40% (This partnership might not exist without the bid)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~2.4

- South Australian government's formal launch and funding commitment
  - P(E|Australia wins): ~90% (Shows serious preparation)
  - P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~50% (Could happen regardless, but less likely)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~1.8

- Reports of early WEOG support for Australia
  - P(E|Australia wins): ~80% (Expected if they're on track to win)
  - P(E|Australia doesn't win): ~30% (Less likely if their bid is weak)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~2.7

**Evidence regarding Turkey:**
- Lack of recent public momentum for Turkey's bid
  - P(E|Turkey wins): ~30% (Winners usually show more public momentum)
  - P(E|Turkey doesn't win): ~70% (Consistent with a struggling bid)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.43 (favors Turkey not winning)

- Turkey's complex relationships with EU members
  - P(E|Turkey wins): ~50% (Winners can overcome such challenges)
  - P(E|Turkey doesn't win): ~70% (This could be a significant obstacle)
  - Likelihood ratio: ~0.71 (favors Turkey not winning)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on Australia's new 2035 emissions target, which is the most significant recent development:

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 1.5 = 1.23
- Posterior probability: 1.23/(1+1.23) = 55.2%

This single piece of evidence shifts Australia from 45% to about 55%, which is substantial.

Now let's consider the "co-hosting with Pacific" narrative:
- Prior probability (after first update): 55.2%
- Prior odds: 55.2/44.8 = 1.23
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 1.23 × 2.4 = 2.95
- Posterior probability: 2.95/(1+2.95) = 74.7%

The combination of Australia's climate policy shift and its strategic partnership with Pacific nations dramatically increases its chances.

For Turkey, the lack of public momentum and complex EU relationships both reduce its probability:
- Starting from Turkey's prior of 35%
- After accounting for lack of momentum (LR: 0.43) and EU relationship challenges (LR: 0.71)
- Combined likelihood ratio: 0.43 × 0.71 = 0.31
- Prior odds: 35/65 = 0.54
- Posterior odds: 0.54 × 0.31 = 0.17
- Posterior probability: 0.17/(1+0.17) = 14.5%

Germany's probability as the default host depends on the likelihood of a deadlock. With Australia's strengthened position and Turkey's weakened one, the chance of deadlock decreases:
- Starting from Germany's prior of 15%
- Adjusting downward due to reduced deadlock probability (by ~50%)
- New probability: ~7.5%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting public information and underestimating behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts by Turkey
- The "co-hosting with Pacific" narrative could face criticism as tokenistic if not substantiated with meaningful climate finance
- Australia's fossil fuel exports could still create resistance despite its domestic emissions targets
- Turkey might have strategic importance to certain WEOG members that outweighs climate considerations

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could announce a similarly ambitious climate target or innovative partnership before the decision
- A diplomatic incident could damage Australia's standing within WEOG
- The EU bloc could unite behind Turkey for geopolitical reasons
- A compromise candidate could emerge if the Australia-Turkey deadlock persists

After considering these factors, I should adjust Australia's probability downward slightly (from ~75% to ~70%) and increase Turkey's chances (from ~14.5% to ~18%). Germany remains a significant possibility at ~8%, with small probabilities for other outcomes.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:
- Australia: 70%
- Turkey: 18%
- Germany: 8%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
- Other: 2%

Total: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Australia: 70%  
Turkey: 18%  
Germany: 8%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%  
Other: 2%  
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The selection of a host for a UN COP conference within a designated regional group where there is more than one bidder.
*   **Prior Probabilities:**
    *   **A Bidder Wins vs. Default:** Historically, a consensus is almost always reached. The default to the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, Germany, is a rare outcome, representing a diplomatic failure. I estimate the base rate of a default (Germany hosting) at around 5%. This leaves a 95% chance that one of the bidding nations (Australia or Turkey) will be chosen.
    *   **Among Bidders:** In a two-candidate race with no other information, the naive prior would be 50/50. This gives us a starting point:
        *   Australia: 47.5%
        *   Turkey: 47.5%
        *   Germany: 5%
    *   **Other Options:**
        *   "Another Pacific Island Nation": This is extremely unlikely. The Australian bid is a *co-hosting* arrangement with the venue in Adelaide. A separate, successful bid from a Pacific nation is not on the table, and they are not part of the WEOG regional group. Prior is <1%.
        *   "Other": This would require a new WEOG country to enter the race very late and win, or a violation of the regional rotation. This is also a tail risk with a prior of <1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process follows the standard UN procedure: a regional group (WEOG) must reach a consensus on a host from among its members.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Australia's Profile:** Unlike a typical European host, Australia is a major fossil fuel exporter with a historically poor climate record. This makes its climate policy credibility the central issue of its bid.
    2.  **Co-Hosting Narrative:** The "co-hosted with Pacific island nations" model is a unique and powerful diplomatic strategy. It frames the bid around climate justice, appealing directly to the core mission of the UNFCCC.
    3.  **Geopolitical Context:** Turkey's complex relationships with several key EU members and the US could complicate its ability to build the required unanimous consensus within the diverse WEOG group.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the initial priors.

*   **Evidence 1: Australia's "co-host with the Pacific" narrative.**
    *   This is a strong positive for Australia. It creates a compelling story that is hard for other nations, especially in Europe, to oppose. It significantly increases the likelihood of Australia winning compared to Turkey. P(E1 | Australia wins) >> P(E1 | Turkey wins).
    *   **Effect:** Shifts probability from Turkey to Australia.

*   **Evidence 2: Australia's new, ambitious 2035 emissions reduction target (NDC).**
    *   This is the most crucial piece of evidence. It directly addresses Australia's primary weakness (its "climate laggard" reputation). By tabling a strong NDC, Australia demonstrates commitment and lends credibility to its bid. This action is highly likely given they want to win, and less likely otherwise. P(E2 | Australia wins) is very high.
    *   **Effect:** Massively shifts probability from Turkey and Germany to Australia. It makes Australia a much more palatable consensus candidate, reducing the chance of a deadlock.

*   **Evidence 3: Turkey's potential geopolitical hurdles within WEOG.**
    *   Consensus is required. Any significant opposition from a key bloc (e.g., the EU or North America) makes a bid non-viable. While the extent of this opposition is not public, the risk is higher for Turkey than for Australia, which has strong traditional alliances (CANZUKUS).
    *   **Effect:** Shifts probability from Turkey to Australia and slightly to Germany (as it could contribute to a deadlock).

*   **Evidence 4: Strong sub-national support and planning in Australia (Adelaide).**
    *   This demonstrates logistical readiness and seriousness, making the bid more concrete and credible. It's a minor but positive piece of evidence.
    *   **Effect:** Small shift of probability towards Australia.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through a conceptual update.

1.  **Prior Odds (Australia vs. Rest of Field):** ~47.5 / 52.5 ≈ 0.9:1.
2.  **Update with Narrative & Geopolitics:** The combination of Australia's powerful Pacific narrative and Turkey's geopolitical headwinds gives Australia a significant diplomatic advantage. This might be a likelihood ratio of 3:1 in favor of Australia.
    *   **New Odds (Aus vs. RoF):** (0.9:1) * 3 ≈ 2.7:1. This implies P(Australia) ≈ 73%.
3.  **Update with New NDC:** This is the game-changer. It neutralizes Australia's biggest negative. This evidence is much more likely if Australia is to be the future host. Let's apply another strong likelihood ratio, say 4:1.
    *   **Final Odds (Aus vs. RoF):** (2.7:1) * 4 ≈ 10.8:1.
    *   **Posterior Probability (Australia):** 10.8 / 11.8 ≈ 91.5%.

This calculation suggests a very high probability for Australia. I will distribute the remaining ~8.5% among the other options, keeping in mind that Turkey is the only other official bidder. The stronger Australia's bid becomes, the less likely a deadlock is, which slightly reduces Germany's probability from the initial prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Could I be overconfident in Australia?** Yes. The WEOG negotiations are opaque. Turkey may have secured quiet support from key partners. European nations might still view Australia's NDC as insufficient given its fossil fuel exports, viewing the bid as "greenwashing" and blocking consensus. This could lead to a deadlock (Germany) or a surprise consensus around Turkey as a "compromise" candidate.
*   **Plausible Alternative:** The most plausible alternative is not a win for Turkey, but a deadlock. If a small but determined bloc of WEOG countries finds Australia unacceptable and another bloc finds Turkey unacceptable, the group could fail to reach consensus, defaulting to Germany.
*   **Adjustment:** My calculated 91.5% for Australia feels slightly too high given the inherent uncertainty of closed-door diplomatic negotiations. I will pull this down to the mid-80s and assign the difference primarily to Turkey (as the official challenger) and Germany (as the deadlock outcome).

### 6. Final Normalization

After considering the evidence and red-teaming my own confidence, I arrive at the following distribution:

*   **Australia:** The clear and strong frontrunner. The combination of a powerful narrative and a credible new climate policy makes it the most likely consensus choice. I place this probability at 84%.
*   **Turkey:** The only other official candidate. It remains a possibility if Australia's bid falters or if Turkey's diplomacy proves more effective than is publicly apparent. I assign it 10%.
*   **Germany:** The default option in case of a deadlock. The strength of Australia's bid makes a deadlock less likely than my initial prior, but it remains a key tail risk. I assign it 5%.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation / Other:** These remain extremely low-probability, black swan events. I will assign a combined 1% to them.

This distribution sums to 100% and reflects my assessment of Australia as the overwhelming favorite.

### Final Forecast

Australia: 84%
Turkey: 10%
Germany: 5%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0.5%
Other: 0.5%
