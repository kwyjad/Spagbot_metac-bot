### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Longest Field Goal by Season (2015-2024):** This class establishes a recent historical baseline. Over the last 10 seasons, the longest field goal has ranged from 61 to 66 yards. The median longest kick was 62 yards. This class suggests a central tendency in the low 60s but with a clear upward trend in the maximum distance. Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021 represents the prior peak of this era.
    *   *Limitation:* This class does not account for the rule changes or specific personnel of the 2025 season, which appears to be a step-change from the past.
2.  **All-Time Top 10 Longest Regular Season Field Goals:** This class focuses on the extreme tail of the distribution. Prior to 2025, the record was 66 yards. Kicks of 63+ yards have occurred roughly once every 2-3 seasons. This class highlights the rarity of such events but also shows their increasing frequency, with four of the top five prior to 2025 occurring since 2021.
    *   *Limitation:* This is a collection of outliers, not a time series, making it difficult to derive a "rate" of occurrence. However, it effectively demonstrates the previously understood limits of kicking.
3.  **2025 Season-to-Date (Weeks 1-9):** This is the most relevant, albeit small, reference class. The season has already seen kicks of 64, 65, and a record-breaking 68 yards. This suggests the distribution for 2025 is fundamentally different from previous years. The current "longest kick" is 68 yards.
    *   *Limitation:* With only half the season complete, this data is incomplete and may be biased by early-season warm weather conditions.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-02** Cam Little kicks a 68-yard field goal, setting a new NFL record. (↑) — Establishes a new, very high floor for the season's longest kick and confirms his demonstrated preseason range is viable in a regular season game.
*   **2025-10-03** Reporting confirms the "K-ball" rule change is a leading theory for increased distances, though overall 50+ yard accuracy is flat. (↑) — Provides a plausible physical mechanism for why kickers might have more confidence and consistency on maximum-range attempts this specific year.
*   **2025-09-29** By Week 4, two of the five longest field goals in history (64 and 65 yards) are made by two different kickers. (↑) — Demonstrates that the trend of longer kicks is not isolated to a single player and that conditions in 2025 are broadly conducive to long attempts.
*   **2025-08-09** Jaguars rookie Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. (↑) — Broke a major psychological and physical barrier, demonstrating that 70 yards is achievable under game conditions, even if unofficial.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Generational Talent (Cam Little):** The primary driver is the emergence of a specific kicker with unprecedented, demonstrated leg strength. Little has proven a 70-yard range in a game setting and holds the 68-yard official record. His presence dramatically increases the probability of a new maximum. (Size: Large)
2.  **Altitude Advantage:** Games played at high altitude (Denver) significantly reduce air resistance, allowing a football to travel ~5-10% farther. A strong-legged kicker playing in Denver on a calm day has the highest potential to set a record. (Size: Large, but situational)
3.  **"K-Ball" Rule Change:** The 2025 rule allowing kickers to practice with and "break in" their game-day kicking balls is a new, plausible mechanism. This could allow for better feel, consistency, and potentially more distance on well-struck balls, especially at the limit of a kicker's range. (Size: Small to Moderate)
4.  **Game Situation & Coaching Philosophy:** Record attempts almost exclusively occur at the end of a half or game, where a miss has minimal negative consequences. With the record already at 68 yards, coaches may be more willing to attempt kicks from 65+ yards in these situations, increasing the number of opportunities. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Weather & Domes:** Warm, calm conditions are optimal for long kicks. Games played in domes or in warm-weather locations later in the season (e.g., Florida, Texas, Arizona, California) provide more favorable environments than cold, windy, late-season games in the Northeast or Midwest. (Size: Moderate, situational)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **A New Record Already Exists:** Unlike any prior season, the forecasting challenge is not about breaking a long-standing record (e.g., Tucker's 66-yarder), but about re-breaking a record set just days ago. The floor for the final number is already 68 yards.
*   **A Proven 70-Yard Kicker is Active:** Past seasons had kickers with *theorized* 70-yard range (like Tucker or Prater in their prime). The 2025 season has a kicker, Cam Little, who has *actually done it* in a live NFL game (preseason). This removes speculation about the feasibility of such a kick.
*   **Novel Rule Change:** The "K-ball" rule is a structural change unique to the 2025 season. The base rate data from 2015-2024 was generated under a different set of rules, potentially making it a less reliable guide.
*   **Psychological Barrier Shattered:** Little's 70-yard preseason kick and 68-yard record, plus the other 64+ yard kicks this season, have likely made coaches and kickers view 65+ yard attempts as more plausible, potentially leading to more attempts in the remainder of the season.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A distribution based on the 2020-2024 seasons, likely centered around 64 yards with a tail extending to 66-67. Equivalent n: ~5 seasons.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Cam Little's demonstrated 70-yard preseason kick and 68-yard regular season record fundamentally reshapes the right tail of the distribution.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Multiple other kickers making 64+ yard field goals suggests a league-wide environmental or technological shift, not just an individual phenomenon.
    *   (↑ Small) The "K-ball" rule provides a plausible causal reason for a league-wide increase in maximum kicking distance.
    *   (↓ Small) The season is more than half over, reducing the number of remaining game opportunities for a record attempt.
*   **Net effect:** A significant upward shift in the entire distribution. The prior is largely overwhelmed by the 2025 evidence. The posterior should have a mode at 68 yards, but with substantial probability mass on 69, 70, and perhaps even 71 yards. The probability of the final number being *exactly* 68 is high, but the probability of it being *greater than* 68 is non-trivial.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any team with a strong-legged kicker (Jaguars, Chiefs, Cowboys, Lions) has an upcoming game in a dome or at altitude (Denver).
    *   Another kicker successfully makes a 65+ yard field goal.
    *   Cam Little is in a close game with an end-of-half/game situation between the 48- and 52-yard lines.
    *   Media reports or coach interviews expressing increased confidence in attempting 65+ yard field goals.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   An injury to Cam Little, Brandon Aubrey, Jake Moody, or another top distance kicker.
    *   The Jaguars' remaining schedule involves primarily outdoor, cold-weather venues.
    *   A series of high-profile misses on 60+ yard attempts, potentially making coaches more risk-averse.
    *   The Jaguars are consistently in blowouts (either winning or losing), reducing the likelihood of a meaningful end-of-game/half attempt.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Small Sample Size:** Attempts from 65+ yards are exceptionally rare. We are forecasting based on a handful of historical events and a single phenomenal talent.
*   **Single Point of Failure:** The forecast for a new record (69+ yards) is heavily dependent on the health and opportunity of one player: Cam Little. An injury would dramatically lower the ceiling.
*   **Fluke Potential:** While unlikely given his preseason kick, Little's 68-yarder could have been a perfect combination of strike, wind, and adrenaline that is not easily repeatable. The final number could stand at 68.
*   **Opportunity is Not Guaranteed:** Having the ability to kick 70 yards is not enough. The precise game situation (score, time, field position) must arise. There are only ~8 weeks of games left, and the right opportunity may not present itself again.
*   **Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves on the regular season only. A longer kick in the playoffs would not count.

**Final Research Summary:** The 2025 season is a paradigm shift for field goal distances, driven by the emergence of a generational talent in Cam Little and a potential assist from a new rule change. The current 68-yard record serves as a firm baseline, and there is a significant, non-trivial probability that it will be broken again before the regular season concludes.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the longest field goal in an NFL season from 2015 to 2024 ranges from 61 to 66 yards, with a median of 62 yards. The variance is relatively low, given the historical clustering around the low 60s, but with an upward trend in recent years.
   - I chose this base rate because it reflects the historical performance of NFL kickers over the past decade, capturing both typical outcomes and the recent trend towards longer kicks.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The base case reflects the general improvement in kicking performance over time, which aligns with the ongoing trend of increasing field goal distances.
   - Differences: The 2025 season has already seen a record-breaking 68-yard field goal, and a preseason 70-yarder, indicating a significant shift in the distribution towards longer kicks. The "K-ball" rule change and the presence of a kicker like Cam Little further differentiate this season from the historical base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Cam Little's 68-yard regular-season kick and 70-yard preseason kick suggest a higher likelihood of kicks exceeding 68 yards this season. This evidence strongly pushes the forecast upwards.
   - The "K-ball" rule change provides a moderate upward push, as it offers a plausible mechanism for increased kicking distances.
   - The presence of multiple 64+ yard kicks by different kickers this season indicates a broader trend, further supporting the likelihood of longer kicks.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 64 yards, the evidence of a 68-yard kick and a 70-yard preseason kick shifts the distribution significantly upwards.
   - The posterior distribution now has a mode at 68 yards, with substantial probability mass extending to 69, 70, and potentially 71 yards, reflecting the new evidence and trends.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast heavily relies on Cam Little's performance and the assumption that similar opportunities will arise.
   - Tail risks: An injury to key kickers or adverse weather conditions could limit opportunities for long kicks.
   - Alternative forecast: A conservative forecast might place more weight on the 68-yard kick as the upper limit, but given the evidence, this seems less plausible.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a 69 or 70-yard kick, but keep the probability of exceeding 70 yards low due to the rarity of such events.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and adjustments, the percentiles are as follows:

P10: 66  
P20: 67  
P40: 68  
P60: 69  
P80: 70  
P90: 71

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two primary reference classes to establish my prior:
- **Recent historical longest field goals per season (2015-2024)**: The median longest kick was 62 yards, with a range from 61-66 yards.
- **2025 season-to-date**: The longest field goal so far is 68 yards by Cam Little, which is already a new NFL record.

Given the clear upward trend in recent years and the already-established new record this season, my prior distribution will be centered at 68 yards (the current season record), with a moderate right skew to account for the possibility of further records.

Prior distribution:
- Median: 68 yards
- 80% credible interval: [66, 70] yards

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- NFL field dimensions remain unchanged
- The fundamental physics of kicking remain the same
- Most games are still played in similar environmental conditions

**Key differences:**
- A new NFL record (68 yards) has already been set this season, establishing a higher floor
- Cam Little has demonstrated 70-yard capability in preseason
- The "K-ball" rule change allows kickers to practice with game balls all week
- Multiple kickers have already made 64+ yard kicks this season
- The psychological barrier of what's possible has shifted upward

These differences suggest a significant upward shift from historical base rates.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring longer kicks (≥69 yards):**
- Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick demonstrates physical capability (+2x likelihood)
- Little's 68-yard regular season record shows in-game capability (+1.5x likelihood)
- The "K-ball" rule change provides a plausible mechanism for increased distances (+1.2x likelihood)
- Multiple kickers making 64+ yard kicks suggests a broader trend (+1.3x likelihood)

**Evidence favoring status quo (68 yards):**
- Only half the season remains, reducing opportunities (-1.2x likelihood)
- Optimal conditions (warm weather, altitude) become less common later in season (-1.1x likelihood)
- 68 yards is already an exceptional outlier (-1.3x likelihood)

**Net likelihood ratio:** The evidence favors a longer kick (≥69 yards) by approximately 1.5x over the status quo (68 yards).

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 68 yards with an 80% interval of [66, 70], I'll update based on the evidence.

The strongest evidence is Cam Little's demonstrated capability of 70 yards in preseason and his 68-yard record in a regular season game. This shifts my distribution rightward.

**Posterior update calculation:**
- Prior probability of ≥69 yards: ~30%
- Likelihood ratio for ≥69 yards: ~1.5x
- Posterior probability of ≥69 yards: ~40%

This shifts my median from 68 to approximately 68.5 yards, and extends the right tail of my distribution.

Updated posterior:
- Median: ~68.5 yards
- 80% credible interval: [67, 71] yards

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent evidence (recency bias)
- I might be underestimating the difficulty of recreating perfect conditions
- The "K-ball" rule's impact may be overstated if accuracy hasn't improved
- I could be underestimating injury risk to key kickers

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a more conservative forecast centered exactly at 68 yards with less probability mass above 70. The argument would be that Little's 68-yarder was already an exceptional outlier, and the conditions (game situation, weather, etc.) may not align again for an even longer attempt.

**Tail risks:**
- Upside: A perfect storm of factors (Denver altitude + strong tailwind + end-of-half situation + Cam Little) could potentially enable a 72+ yard kick
- Downside: Injuries to strong-legged kickers or consistently poor weather conditions could mean no further attempts beyond 68 yards

After considering these factors, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty while maintaining the rightward shift from my prior.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After all considerations, my final forecast for the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season:

P10: 67
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 69
P80: 70
P90: 71

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My initial base rate is the distribution of the longest field goal in each NFL regular season from 2015 to 2024. This 10-year period captures the modern era of kicking.

*   **Data:** The longest field goal in these seasons ranged from 61 to 66 yards.
*   **Distribution:** The median of this set is 62 yards. The distribution is tight, with most values between 61 and 63 yards, and a right tail extending to Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021.
*   **Rationale:** This reference class reflects the league's baseline capabilities under recent conditions, before accounting for the specific, unusual factors of the 2025 season. It establishes a prior expectation that a "normal" season's longest kick would be in the low 60s, with an exceptional outcome being in the mid-60s.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the base rate period in several critical ways:

*   **Similarity:** The underlying game mechanics remain the same. Record-long attempts are still rare and only occur in specific end-of-half or end-of-game situations where a miss has low consequences.
*   **Difference 1 (Massive Impact):** A new NFL record of 68 yards has *already been set* by Cam Little in Week 9. This is the single most important piece of information. It establishes a hard floor for the final value, rendering the lower half of the base rate distribution irrelevant. The question is no longer "What will the longest kick be?" but "What is the probability the new 68-yard record is broken *again*?"
*   **Difference 2 (Large Impact):** The emergence of a specific, generational talent. Cam Little's 70-yard field goal in the preseason was not a fluke practice kick but occurred under game conditions. This provides concrete evidence that a 69+ yard kick is within his demonstrated, repeatable range, something no kicker in the base rate period had proven so definitively.
*   **Difference 3 (Moderate Impact):** A new "K-ball" rule allows kickers to prepare game balls all week. This provides a plausible physical mechanism for increased maximum distance and consistency across the league, supported by the fact that multiple other kickers have already made 64+ yard kicks in 2025.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the new evidence for 2025.

*   **Evidence:** The current record is 68 yards.
    *   **Likelihood:** This evidence makes any value below 68 impossible. It forces a complete re-anchoring of the distribution. The probability of the final value being ≥ 68 is 100%.
*   **Evidence:** Cam Little's demonstrated 70-yard range (preseason) and 68-yard make (regular season).
    *   **Likelihood:** This makes outcomes of 69, 70, or even 71 yards far more likely than they would be for any other kicker in history. It dramatically increases the probability mass in the right tail of the distribution (i.e., P(X > 68)).
*   **Evidence:** The season is more than half over.
    *   **Likelihood:** This is a factor pushing the forecast down slightly. With only ~8 weeks remaining, there are fewer opportunities for the perfect combination of game situation, field position, and weather to arise for another record attempt. This increases the likelihood that the final value remains 68.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My reasoning follows a conceptual Bayesian update: `Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood`.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** A distribution centered around 62-63 yards.
2.  **Apply Evidence:** The evidence from 2025 is so strong that it essentially overwhelms the prior. The fact that the record is already 68 yards truncates the distribution entirely.
3.  **Form the Posterior:** My posterior is a discrete probability distribution starting at 68. The core of the forecast is estimating the probability that the record is broken again.
    *   I estimate a ~55% chance that the record remains at 68 yards for the rest of the season. This is the modal outcome, reflecting the difficulty and rarity of such attempts.
    *   I assign a ~45% chance that the record is broken again. This is a substantial probability, justified by Little's proven ability and the general trend of longer kicks.
    *   I distribute this 45% as follows:
        *   P(69 yards): ~25% (most likely new record)
        *   P(70 yards): ~12% (matches his preseason best)
        *   P(71+ yards): ~8% (unlikely but possible tail risk)

This creates a posterior distribution heavily skewed to the right, with a mode at 68 but a mean around 68.75.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Primary Risk:** Am I overestimating the chance of a new record? The 68-yarder could have been a "perfect storm" of conditions and a well-struck ball that is hard to replicate. An injury to Cam Little would also dramatically increase the probability of the record staying at 68.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative forecast would place the probability of the record staying at 68 at 80-90%. This would shift all percentiles (P10 through P80) to 68.
*   **Rebuttal:** This conservative view seems to underweight the significance of the 70-yard preseason kick. That kick proved that 68 is not Little's absolute physical limit. Furthermore, with the psychological barrier shattered, coaches may be more aggressive in attempting such kicks in the final weeks, increasing the number of opportunities. My 45% estimate for a new record seems like a reasonable balance between the rarity of the event and the unprecedented evidence in its favor. I will stick with my distribution which reflects this significant, but not guaranteed, upside.

### 6. Final Percentiles

Based on the cumulative probabilities of my posterior distribution (P(≤68) = 55%, P(≤69) = 80%, P(≤70) = 92%), I derive the following percentiles.

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 69
P80: 69
P90: 70
