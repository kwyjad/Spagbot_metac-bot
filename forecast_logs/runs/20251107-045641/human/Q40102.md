### Reference class & base rates
1.  **UK Refugee Resettlement Schemes (e.g., Syrian VPRS, Afghan ACRS):** These schemes are proactive, planned relocations. The Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme resettled ~20,000 people over 5 years (avg. 4,000/year). The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme aimed for 5,000 in its first year but faced significant delays, admitting far fewer initially.
    *   **Base Rate:** Such schemes often start slowly due to vetting and logistics, typically admitting a few hundred to a couple of thousand people in their first 6-12 months of operation.
    *   **Limitations:** This new agreement is *reactive* (tied to returns), not proactive, making the flow dependent on a different, more complex process.
2.  **Intra-European Asylum Returns (e.g., Dublin Regulation):** Before Brexit, the UK used the Dublin Regulation to return asylum seekers to other EU countries. The number of successful returns was consistently low. In 2018, the UK made 5,597 requests to other EU states but only carried out 248 enforced returns.
    *   **Base Rate:** Successful returns under bilateral agreements are notoriously difficult and often represent a very small fraction (e.g., <5%) of the target population. This suggests the "input" for the one-in-one-out scheme will be severely constrained.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a new treaty, not the Dublin Regulation, and the "one-out" is paired with a "one-in" incentive for France, which might improve cooperation, though this is not guaranteed.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-06** Agreement enters into force. — (↑) — Establishes the legal mechanism for the program to begin, making a non-zero outcome possible.
*   **2025-09-24** First 3 people admitted under the scheme. — (↔) — Confirms the program is operational, but the number is extremely small, suggesting a slow, cautious start.
*   **2025-10-09** Total admissions reach 18 people. — (↓) — The rate over the 15 days since the first report is 1 person/day, a very low operational tempo.
*   **2025-10-24** Total admissions reach 23 people. — (↓) — The rate over the subsequent 15 days slowed to ~0.33 people/day, indicating deceleration, not acceleration.
*   **2025-10-24** RFI reports the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting. — (↓) — Lack of deterrent effect undermines the primary political goal, potentially reducing political will to scale the program.
*   **2025-11-05** An Iranian man is returned to France for a second time under the scheme. — (↔) — Confirms the "returns" part of the mechanism is functioning, but provides no data on the overall rate of returns.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Number of Successful Returns to France (Large):** The number of admissions is strictly capped by the number of people the UK successfully returns to France. This is the primary bottleneck. Legal challenges, French administrative capacity, and migrant absconding will constrain this number.
2.  **UK/French Administrative Capacity (Large):** The speed of vetting, security checks, and visa issuance by the UK Home Office, and the corresponding processing by French authorities to propose candidates, is a major rate-limiter. Bureaucratic friction is high in such processes.
3.  **Weather in the English Channel (Moderate):** Crossings typically decrease significantly during the winter months (November-December) due to poor weather. Fewer crossing attempts mean fewer interceptions and fewer potential returns, thus reducing the input to the scheme.
4.  **Political Will & Perceived Success (Moderate):** If the scheme is seen as a failure (i.e., not deterring crossings), political support may wane, leading to de-prioritization and minimal resource allocation. Conversely, pressure to show *some* success could lead to a small, managed batch of admissions before year-end for PR purposes.
5.  **Legal Challenges (Small-to-Moderate):** Legal challenges by human rights groups against the returns process in the UK could slow or temporarily halt the "out" portion of the scheme, thereby stopping the "in" portion.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Reactive vs. Proactive:** Unlike standard resettlement schemes (Ref Class 1) which have targets and actively select refugees, this program's intake is entirely dependent on the unpredictable and difficult process of intercepting and returning migrants.
*   **Pilot Scheme Status:** The agreement is explicitly a pilot running until June 2026. Pilot programs are designed to be small-scale and test concepts; they are not typically expected to handle large volumes, especially in the initial months.
*   **Direct "Quid Pro Quo" Nature:** The one-in, one-out link is a novel mechanism compared to the more diffuse obligations of the Dublin Regulation (Ref Class 2). This could, in theory, improve French cooperation, but also makes the system brittle—if one part fails, the other stops.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves at the end of 2025, less than five months after the agreement's activation. This is a very short period for a complex international administrative process to ramp up, making high numbers extremely unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the reference classes (slow-starting resettlement schemes, low-success returns agreements) would suggest a distribution centered in the low hundreds (e.g., 100-300) for the first ~5 months of a new program. Equivalent n should be low, reflecting the imperfect analogies.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The observed rate of admissions after two months is exceptionally low (<1 person/day) and is decelerating.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The program's primary input (Channel crossings) is seasonally expected to decrease sharply over the resolution period (Nov-Dec).
    *   (↓ Small) Reports of mounting criticism and lack of deterrent effect reduce the likelihood of a major political push to accelerate the scheme.
    *   (↔ Small) The program is confirmed to be operational, both for returns and admissions, preventing a forecast of zero.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the prior was too optimistic. The posterior should be revised significantly downwards, with the median likely falling into the double digits (e.g., 40-80 range).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official UK or French government press release announcing a "significant milestone" or a large batch of arrivals.
    *   Leaked reports of a streamlined vetting process being implemented.
    *   Unseasonably calm weather in the Channel leading to a spike in crossings and returns.
    *   A joint statement by the UK Prime Minister and French President reaffirming and committing new resources to the scheme.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official statistics on small boat crossings showing a sharp seasonal decline.
    *   Any high-profile court ruling in the UK that temporarily blocks a return to France.
    *   Statements from French officials expressing frustration with the process.
    *   A gap of several weeks with no new media reports on admissions, suggesting the program has stalled.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lags & Opacity:** The government may not release official numbers regularly. Resolution may depend on sporadic media reports, which could miss some admissions or be out of date.
*   **Batch Processing:** The numbers may not grow linearly. A large batch could be processed and admitted at once (e.g., just before Christmas for positive media coverage), causing a sudden jump.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria is "received visas." This may or may not be the same as "arrived in the UK." A batch of visas could be issued in late December, but the individuals might not travel until January. The forecast should target the number of visas issued.
*   **Pilot Program Volatility:** As a pilot, the scheme's rules or implementation could be changed with little notice, drastically altering the rate of admissions.
*   **Political Motivation:** The numbers could be manipulated for political ends. The government has an incentive to show the program is working, which could lead to a "Potemkin" surge in numbers near the end of the year that isn't representative of the program's true capacity.

### Final Research Summary
The program is operational but has started at a glacial pace that is already decelerating. Given the severe administrative and logistical bottlenecks, coupled with the expected winter decline in Channel crossings that provide the program's inputs, the final number of admissions by year-end is likely to be very low, probably not exceeding double digits.

To forecast the number of people admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** We consider the UK Refugee Resettlement Schemes as a reference class, where initial admissions are slow, typically a few hundred to a couple of thousand in the first 6-12 months. Given the reactive nature of this agreement, a more conservative base rate is appropriate.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Assume a mean of 100-300 admissions in the first five months, with a wide variance due to the novelty and complexity of the scheme.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Both involve complex international cooperation and bureaucratic processes, leading to slow initial admissions.
- **Differences:** This scheme is reactive and dependent on successful returns, which are historically low. The one-in-one-out mechanism adds complexity and potential bottlenecks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Current Admissions:** Only 23 people admitted by late October, with a slowing rate. This suggests a lower-than-expected operational capacity.
- **Seasonal Effects:** Expected decrease in Channel crossings during winter, reducing potential returns and admissions.
- **Political and Operational Challenges:** Mounting criticism and lack of deterrence may reduce political will to scale up admissions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 100-300 admissions.
- **Evidence Impact:** The low current admission rate and expected seasonal decline suggest revising the prior downward.
- **Posterior Mean/Variance:** Adjusted to reflect a likely outcome in the double digits, with a median around 40-80 admissions.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider potential for a sudden batch of admissions or policy changes that could increase numbers.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A political push for success could lead to a temporary increase in admissions.
- **Tail Risks:** A large batch of visas issued in December could skew results upward.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the evidence and adjustments, the forecasted percentiles for the number of people admitted are:

P10: 20  
P20: 30  
P40: 50  
P60: 70  
P80: 90  
P90: 110

# Forecast: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of two reference classes:

1. **Early-stage refugee resettlement schemes in the UK**: These typically admit a few hundred to a few thousand people in their first 6-12 months. However, these are proactive schemes with targets, unlike this reactive scheme.

2. **UK-EU asylum return agreements**: Under the Dublin Regulation, the UK historically achieved very low actual return rates (around 5% of requests), suggesting severe constraints on the "one-out" portion that drives this scheme.

Given that this program has been operational for only 3 months by the resolution date, and considering its reactive nature, I'll use a prior centered around 100-150 people, with a wide variance to reflect uncertainty in a new program.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Administrative complexity and vetting requirements similar to other UK refugee schemes
- Bilateral cooperation challenges similar to previous return agreements
- Political sensitivity around migration issues

**Key differences:**
- This is a reactive scheme entirely dependent on successful returns to France
- The program has only been operational for 3 months (Aug-Dec 2025)
- The "one-in, one-out" mechanism creates a strict ceiling on admissions
- Winter months (Nov-Dec) typically see reduced Channel crossings due to weather
- This is explicitly a pilot program, designed for small-scale testing

These differences suggest my prior is likely too optimistic.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Observed admission rate**
- First 3 people admitted on Sept 24 (7 weeks after launch)
- Increased to 18 people by Oct 9 (rate: 1 person/day)
- Reached 23 people by Oct 24 (rate: 0.33 people/day)
- The rate is decelerating, not accelerating
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors lower numbers (~0.2x for higher numbers)

**Evidence 2: Seasonal factors**
- November-December typically sees reduced Channel crossings due to weather
- Fewer crossings means fewer interceptions and returns
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors lower numbers (~0.5x for higher numbers)

**Evidence 3: Political context**
- Reports indicate the deal is not deterring crossings
- Mounting criticism reduces political incentive to scale up quickly
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors lower numbers (~0.8x for higher numbers)

**Evidence 4: Program is operational**
- The mechanism is functioning for both returns and admissions
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors non-zero numbers (~1.2x against zero)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 100-150 people, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on observed rate:**
- At the current decelerated rate (0.33 people/day), we would expect only ~20 more people by year-end
- This suggests a total of ~43 people (23 current + 20 additional)
- This is significantly lower than my prior
- Posterior after this update: centered around 40-60 people

**Update on seasonal factors and political context:**
- Winter weather and lack of political momentum further reduce expectations
- Combined effect suggests the upper end of my range should be reduced
- Posterior after these updates: centered around 35-50 people

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a "PR push" near year-end to show the program is working
- Batch processing could lead to sudden jumps in numbers
- The UK government might prioritize this program to demonstrate post-Brexit border control success

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would be centered around 80-100 people, assuming:
- The current slow rate is just initial setup friction
- A significant batch of admissions occurs in December
- Political pressure leads to expedited processing

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The observed deceleration contradicts the "initial friction" theory
- No evidence of political prioritization; criticism is mounting instead
- Winter weather will reduce the "input" (Channel crossings) regardless of political will

**Adjustment for uncertainty:**
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these possibilities, particularly the chance of a December PR push.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the performance of other novel UK refugee/migrant admission schemes in their initial phase. Two relevant reference classes are:

1.  **Proactive Resettlement Schemes:** Programs like the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (~20,000 people over 5 years) or the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (aimed for 5,000 in year one) provide a benchmark for the UK's administrative capacity to vet and admit people. These schemes often start very slowly, admitting only a few hundred people in their first 3-6 months due to high bureaucratic friction, security checks, and logistical setup.
2.  **Reactive Returns Agreements:** The predecessor to this type of agreement, the Dublin Regulation, demonstrates the difficulty of returning individuals. In 2018, the UK only managed 248 returns out of over 5,500 requests. This suggests that any process reliant on returns as an input will be severely constrained.

Combining these, my prior distribution for a new scheme over its first ~5 months (August to December) would be centered low, with a median of around **150 people**, but with very high uncertainty. The distribution would be wide, perhaps with a 90% confidence interval from 20 to 500, reflecting the possibility of either a near-complete stall or a surprisingly effective start.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation has crucial differences from the base rate that suggest a lower outcome:

*   **Reactive Bottleneck:** Unlike a proactive resettlement scheme, this program is *reactive*. The number of admissions is strictly capped by the number of successful returns to France. The returns process (Reference Class 2) is known to be the most difficult and legally contentious part, acting as a severe bottleneck on the entire system. This is the single most important factor pushing the forecast down from the resettlement scheme base rate.
*   **Pilot Program Status:** The agreement is a pilot scheme. Such programs are intentionally small-scale to test procedures and are not designed for high volume, especially in the initial months.
*   **Short Timeframe:** The forecast resolves at the end of 2025, less than five months after the program's inception. This is an extremely short window for a complex bilateral administrative process to ramp up.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the background information:

*   **Observed Data (Very Strong Downward Pressure):** The program's performance to date is the most powerful evidence.
    *   By Sep 24 (after ~7 weeks): 3 people.
    *   By Oct 9 (next 15 days): 15 more people (rate of 1/day).
    *   By Oct 24 (next 15 days): 5 more people (rate of ~0.33/day).
    This evidence is extremely compelling. The rate of admissions is not only low, but it is *decelerating*. This is highly consistent with a very low final number (in the dozens) and makes outcomes in the hundreds extremely unlikely.

*   **Seasonality (Strong Downward Pressure):** The remaining forecast period is November and December. Historically, small boat crossings of the English Channel decrease significantly during these winter months due to poor weather. Fewer crossings mean fewer interceptions, fewer potential returns, and therefore fewer inputs for the admission scheme. This provides a causal mechanism for why the already low rate is unlikely to increase.

*   **Political Context (Moderate Downward Pressure):** The RFI report notes that the deal is not deterring crossings and that criticism is mounting. If the program is failing in its primary political objective (deterrence), there will be less political will and fewer resources dedicated to scaling up its secondary, administrative function (admissions).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior Median:** ~150 people.
*   **Evidence:** The observed data (23 people by late October, with a decelerating rate) is a massive update.
*   **Update Step:** My prior suggested a possibility of hundreds. The evidence of a rate of ~0.33 people/day makes this highly improbable. Let's project forward from the last data point (23 people on Oct 24). There are 68 days left until the end of the year.
    *   *Projection at current rate:* 23 + (68 days * 0.33 people/day) ≈ 23 + 22 = **45 people**.
*   **Posterior Shift:** The evidence forces a dramatic downward revision of my prior. The posterior distribution is now anchored by the 23 people already admitted and centered on a simple extrapolation of the most recent, slow rate. The median of the posterior distribution shifts from ~150 down to the **40-60 range**. The variance also decreases significantly, as we have moved from pure speculation to data-driven extrapolation.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Could the forecast be too low?** The main risk is a "Potemkin" scenario. The government, facing criticism that the scheme is failing, could orchestrate the admission of a single, large batch (e.g., 50-100 people) in December for a positive press release before Christmas. This would cause a sudden, non-linear jump in the numbers. My upper percentiles must account for this plausible political maneuver.
*   **Could the forecast be too high?** Yes. The winter weather could halt crossings almost entirely, or a legal challenge could freeze the returns process. In this scenario, the program could stall completely, with the final number being only slightly higher than the 23 already reported. My lower percentiles must be anchored close to this floor.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** An alternative view is that the first few months were a slow test, and the program will now accelerate. However, the *decelerating* rate observed between Oct 9 and Oct 24 directly contradicts this hypothesis. The seasonality argument also provides a strong rebuttal.
*   **Adjustment:** My central estimate seems sound, but I will widen the upper tail of my distribution to reflect the "political batch" risk. My P80 and P90 will be higher than a simple linear extrapolation would suggest.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is anchored by the 23 people already admitted and centered on a continuation of the very slow, recently observed rate. The distribution is right-skewed to account for the small but real possibility of a politically motivated batch of admissions before the end of the year.

P10: 28
P20: 33
P40: 42
P60: 58
P80: 80
P90: 110
