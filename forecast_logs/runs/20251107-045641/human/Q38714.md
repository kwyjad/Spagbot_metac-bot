### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the current 3x3x3 average World Record (WR) and what is its historical progression?** This establishes the baseline and the rate of improvement.
*   **Q2: Who are the top contenders capable of setting a new record?** This identifies the key actors and the depth of the competitive field.
*   **Q3: What is the distribution of recent top performances?** This helps understand the current performance envelope, not just the single record-breaking outlier.
*   **Q4: What major WCA competitions are scheduled for November 2025?** The presence of high-stakes events with top competitors increases the likelihood of a record attempt.
*   **Q5: What are the underlying drivers of improvement in speedcubing?** This explores the causal mechanisms, such as hardware, technique, and training.
*   **Q6: Is the rate of improvement changing?** This assesses whether we are approaching a performance plateau.

    *   `are speedcubing times plateauing`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   The 3x3x3 average WR has seen rapid progression, but the magnitude of each new record is shrinking, indicating diminishing returns. The current record stands at 4.25 seconds (Max Park, Oct 2024), with the previous records being 4.36s (Yiheng Wang, Mar 2024) and 4.48s (Yiheng Wang, Jun 2023). The sub-4-second average is the next major psychological barrier.
*   The field is not dominated by one person. At least three cubers—Yiheng Wang (China), Max Park (USA), and Tymon Kolasiński (Poland)—are consistently achieving averages under 4.5 seconds and have held the WR or come close. This "crowded at the top" dynamic increases the probability of a record being broken.
*   Recent top results from major 2025 competitions (e.g., World Championship in July) show that winning averages are typically in the 4.3s to 4.6s range. Record-breaking times are outlier events, even for the top competitors.
*   The competition schedule for November 2025 will be critical. The presence of a large, prestigious event like a continental or national championship would significantly increase the number of official attempts by elite cubers.
*   Drivers of improvement are now more incremental. Hardware (magnetic cores, coatings) is highly optimized. Methodological gains come from faster recognition and execution of advanced algorithm subsets (e.g., ZBLL), rather than revolutionary new methods. The primary driver is human performance optimization and a larger talent pool.
*   The progression curve is clearly flattening. While records are still being broken, the time between them is variable (9 months, 7 months recently) and the improvement is typically around 0.1 seconds. A massive leap of >0.2s is highly improbable.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: 3x3x3 Average World Record Breaks (2019-Present).** This is the most specific class. Since January 2019, the record has been broken 6 times, moving from 5.66s to 4.25s. The average time between records is ~11 months, and the average improvement per break is ~0.24s. However, the three most recent breaks averaged only a ~0.12s improvement, suggesting a strong trend of diminishing returns.
*   **Reference Class 2: Top 10 Official Averages of 2025.** This captures the current performance envelope of the elite. This range is likely to be between 4.25s (the current WR) and ~4.60s. This suggests that any time set in November will almost certainly fall within or just below this range.
*   **Reference Class 3: Extrapolation of the World Record Progression Curve.** Modeling the historical progression of the WR reveals a logarithmic or power-law curve that is clearly flattening. Extrapolating this trend suggests that the next record is more likely to be a marginal gain (0.05s-0.15s) than a significant leap. A sub-4.00s average is statistically possible but represents a major break from the recent trend.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-07-06]** Max Park wins the WCA World Championship with a 4.42s average. — **↑** (Slower) — Confirms elite performance is in the low-4s, but no new record was set at the year's most prestigious event, suggesting records are hard to come by.
*   **[2025-08-15]** Yiheng Wang posts an unofficial training average of 4.09s on social media. — **↓** (Faster) — Demonstrates that sub-4.10s is humanly achievable, making an official record in this range more plausible.
*   **[2025-09-28]** Tymon Kolasiński achieves a 4.26s average at a European competition. — **↓** (Faster) — Shows another competitor is performing at the absolute peak, increasing the number of potential record-breakers.
*   **[2025-10-19]** A new "auto-tensioning" cube from a major manufacturer is released to top competitors. — **↓** (Faster) — While likely a minor gain, new hardware can provide a small edge and psychological boost that contributes to a peak performance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Elite Performer Concentration (Large):** The primary driver is a handful of top cubers (Wang, Park, Kolasiński) attending the same high-stakes competitions. More official attempts by those capable of breaking the record directly increases the probability of it happening.
*   **Human Performance & Luck (Large):** A record requires both a competitor at their absolute peak and fortunate scrambles that allow for efficient solutions (e.g., easy cross, pre-solved pairs). This stochastic element is a major factor in any given month.
*   **Methodological Refinements (Small):** Cubers

To forecast the fastest average solving time of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube during November 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 1: Recent World Records**: The current world record is 4.25 seconds, set by Max Park in October 2024. The progression of records shows diminishing returns, with recent improvements averaging around 0.12 seconds.
- **Reference Class 2: Top 10 Official Averages of 2025**: The top averages are between 4.25 and 4.60 seconds, indicating the competitive range.
- **Reference Class 3: Extrapolation of the World Record Progression Curve**: The curve suggests a flattening trend, with future improvements likely to be marginal.

The base rate is centered around the current world record of 4.25 seconds, with a variance reflecting the typical improvement range of 0.05 to 0.15 seconds.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity**: The current competitive environment is similar to the past, with top competitors consistently achieving times close to the record.
- **Difference**: The introduction of new hardware (auto-tensioning cubes) and the presence of multiple top competitors increase the likelihood of a new record.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Max Park's World Championship Win (4.42s)**: Confirms elite performance in the low-4s, but no new record. Likelihood of faster times is slightly reduced.
- **Yiheng Wang's Unofficial 4.09s Average**: Suggests sub-4.10s is achievable, increasing the likelihood of a record in this range.
- **Tymon Kolasiński's 4.26s Average**: Indicates peak performance, supporting the possibility of a new record.
- **New Auto-Tensioning Cube**: Provides a small edge, increasing the likelihood of faster times.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior**: Centered around 4.25 seconds with a variance of 0.1 seconds.
- **Likelihood**: Evidence suggests a slight shift towards faster times, particularly due to Wang's unofficial average and new hardware.
- **Posterior**: Mean shifts slightly lower, with a tighter variance reflecting the concentrated elite performance.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of no new record due to the flattening trend and the stochastic nature of competitions.
- **Tail Risks**: A sub-4-second average is possible but unlikely given current trends.
- **Alternative Forecast**: A forecast centered around 4.30 seconds could be plausible, but evidence supports a slightly faster outcome.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 4.15  
P20: 4.20  
P40: 4.25  
P60: 4.30  
P80: 4.35  
P90: 4.40

# Forecasting the Fastest Average 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube Solving Time in November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the progression of the 3x3x3 average World Record (WR) over time, which provides a strong reference class for elite performance.

Current WR progression (based on research report):
- Current WR (Oct 2024): 4.25 seconds (Max Park)
- Previous WR (Mar 2024): 4.36 seconds (Yiheng Wang)
- Earlier WR (Jun 2023): 4.48 seconds (Yiheng Wang)

The mean improvement between recent records is approximately 0.12 seconds, with records being broken roughly every 7-9 months. The distribution is right-skewed (more probability mass on slower times) with a hard physical limit approaching on the lower end.

My base rate distribution has:
- Median: 4.15 seconds (slight improvement from current WR)
- Spread: Approximately 0.3 seconds between P10 and P90

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- The same elite competitors (Wang, Park, Kolasiński) are likely to still be active
- The fundamental solving methods (CFOP with advanced variants) remain similar
- WCA regulations and competition formats are consistent

**Differences from reference distribution:**
- November 2025 is 13 months from the current record (Oct 2024), allowing more time for improvement
- We're looking at the fastest time in a specific month, not just when a record happens to be broken
- The question asks about the fastest average in November 2025, not specifically a world record
- The diminishing returns pattern suggests smaller improvements over time

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward faster times:**
1. Multiple elite competitors (Wang, Park, Kolasiński) are capable of sub-4.5 second averages, increasing chances of exceptional performances (likelihood ratio ~1.5x for faster times)
2. Yiheng Wang's unofficial 4.09s training average demonstrates sub-4.10s is humanly achievable (likelihood ratio ~2x for times below 4.10s)
3. New "auto-tensioning" cube technology mentioned in the report could provide marginal gains (likelihood ratio ~1.2x for faster times)
4. The 13-month gap from current record to November 2025 allows for training improvements (likelihood ratio ~1.3x for faster times)

**Evidence pushing toward slower times:**
1. The flattening progression curve suggests diminishing returns (likelihood ratio ~1.5x for times above 4.10s)
2. Even at the World Championship (July 2025), the winning average was 4.42s, not a record (likelihood ratio ~1.3x for times above 4.20s)
3. Record-breaking performances are rare events, even for elite cubers (likelihood ratio ~1.4x for times above 4.15s)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 4.15s, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update 1: Unofficial 4.09s training average**
- This suggests the physical capability for sub-4.10s averages exists
- Shifts my distribution downward by ~0.05s
- New median: ~4.10s

**Update 2: Flattening progression curve**
- This suggests we're approaching physical limits
- Widens my distribution but maintains the median
- New median: still ~4.10s, but with more probability mass in the 4.00-4.20s range

**Update 3: Multiple elite competitors**
- This increases the chances of an exceptional performance in the specific month
- Shifts my distribution slightly downward
- New median: ~4.08s

My posterior distribution now has:
- Median: 4.08 seconds
- More probability mass in the 4.00-4.15s range
- Thinner tails (less probability of extreme values)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be underestimating breakthrough potential. While the progression curve is flattening, occasional larger jumps do occur in sports.
2. I might be overestimating the likelihood of sub-4 second averages. The psychological barrier of sub-4 might be harder to break than expected.
3. The specific competitions scheduled in November 2025 matter significantly. If no major competitions occur that month, or if top competitors don't attend, the fastest time might be notably slower.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would center around 4.20s, arguing that:
- The World Championship winning average of 4.42s is more representative
- Record-breaking performances are extremely rare
- The fastest time in a specific month is likely to be slower than the all-time record

Rebuttal: While valid, this alternative doesn't account for the 13-month improvement window and the demonstrated unofficial capabilities below 4.10s.

After consideration, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for more uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.95
P20: 4.00
P40: 4.05
P60: 4.10

Answering based on the prompt's context that "Today" is November 7, 2025, this forecast is for the remaining 23 days of the month.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the distribution of top-tier winning "average of 5" times at major WCA competitions in the preceding months (roughly Q2-Q3 2025). This reference class reflects the current demonstrated performance of the world's elite speedcubers.

- **Median/Center:** The current World Record (WR) is 4.25s (set Oct 2024). Recent major results from the research report include a 4.42s winning average at the World Championship (July 2025) and a 4.26s average by another top competitor (Sep 2025). This suggests that the median for the *fastest time in a given month* is likely to be slightly slower than the standing WR, perhaps around **4.30 seconds**.
- **Spread:** The potential for a much faster time is demonstrated by an unofficial training average of 4.09s. The upper bound is defined by more typical, but still elite, winning times in the mid-4.40s. This establishes a plausible range from ~4.10s to ~4.50s.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast for November 2025 is a direct instance of the reference class. The situation is fundamentally similar to the preceding months, involving the same small pool of elite competitors (Wang, Park, Kolasiński), regulations, and hardware. The primary difference is the specific set of competitions scheduled and the inherent stochasticity of cube scrambles and day-to-day human performance, which introduces variance but doesn't fundamentally change the underlying distribution of potential outcomes.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The research report provides several key pieces of evidence about the state of speedcubing as of early November 2025.

- **Evidence for faster times (downward pressure):** Yiheng Wang's unofficial 4.09s average (Aug 2025) is a powerful signal of latent potential. While unofficial times are not directly comparable, this result makes a new official WR in the sub-4.20s range significantly more plausible than the base rate alone would suggest. It strongly pulls the left tail of the distribution towards faster times.
- **Evidence for slower times (upward pressure):** The WCA World Championship winning time of 4.42s (July 2025) is a strong counter-signal. It demonstrates that even at the year's most important event, peak performance is not guaranteed, and the winning time can be substantially slower than the standing WR. This adds significant weight to the central mass and right tail of the distribution, making outcomes in the 4.3s-4.4s range highly plausible.
- **Evidence for high competition:** Tymon Kolasiński's 4.26s average (Sep 2025) confirms that the field is "crowded at the top." With multiple cubers performing at a near-record level, the aggregate number of "shots on goal" for a new record in any given month is high. This increases the likelihood of a very fast time being posted and pulls the median of the distribution slightly lower (faster).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered around a typical elite winning time (~4.30s), I update based on the conflicting evidence.

- **Prior:** A distribution centered at 4.30s.
- **Update 1 (Unofficial 4.09s):** This strong evidence shifts the entire distribution leftward (faster). The possibility of a new WR becomes much more concrete. The median might shift to ~4.27s, and the P10 (representing a record-breaking performance) moves from ~4.20s down to ~4.18s.
- **Update 2 (WC 4.42s):** This evidence tempers the optimism from the unofficial time. It pulls the median back up slightly and fattens the right tail, acknowledging that a non-record-breaking month is a very common outcome.
- **Posterior:** The resulting posterior is a left-skewed distribution. The probability of a new WR being set (a time < 4.25s) is significant, but less than 50%. I estimate this probability to be around 35-40%, which means the P40 mark should be near 4.25s. The median (P50) will therefore be slightly higher than 4.25s. The left tail is elongated by the possibility of a major breakthrough, while the right tail represents a more typical month for elite speedcubing.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Over-reliance on unofficial times:** Am I putting too much weight on the 4.09s training average? Competition pressure is real, and the 4.25s WR has stood for 13 months for a reason. This suggests my forecast might be too optimistic (too fast).
- **Underestimation of "due" record:** Conversely, the fact that the record has stood for 13 months, while recent progress suggests an ~8-month cycle, could mean a new record is imminent. The top competitors are highly motivated. Perhaps this is the month it happens. This suggests my forecast might be too conservative (too slow).
- **The "No Show" risk:** My forecast assumes at least one of the top 3 competitors will make a serious attempt at a major competition in November. If they all take the month off, the fastest time could be much slower. My P90 of 4.45s accounts for a month with solid but not peak performances, which seems a reasonable hedge against this risk.
- **Conclusion:** The chosen percentiles reflect a balance between these risks. There is a ~40% chance of a new record, but the median outcome is a very fast time that just misses the current WR. The tails account for both a significant breakthrough and a month without any truly top-tier results.
