### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent Peak Anomaly Years (2023-2024):** The last two Nov/Dec periods provide a high-end reference. In Nov/Dec 2023, under a strong El Niño, the peak daily anomaly reached approximately **+1.95°C**. In Nov/Dec 2024, during a transition to La Niña, the peak was lower, around **+1.75°C**. This class suggests a range of **1.7°C to 2.0°C** for a very warm year.
-   **Recent La Niña Years (e.g., 2020-2022):** The "triple-dip" La Niña from 2020-2022 offers a cooling-influenced baseline. During these years, peak winter anomalies were significantly lower, generally in the **+1.1°C to +1.3°C** range. This class is likely too low given the substantial increase in background warming and ocean heat content since then.
-   **Current Year Trajectory (2025):** The daily anomaly in Sep-Oct 2025 has been tracking around **+1.5°C**, below both 2023 and 2024 levels for the same period. This provides a contemporary, short-term anchor for the forecast.

*Reasoning:* The most relevant class is a blend of the recent peak years, adjusted downwards for the confirmed La Niña. The 2020-2022 class is useful for gauging La Niña's cooling potential but is outdated due to the rapid background warming.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-06-12** La Niña chances increase — ↑/↓ (neutral) — Forecasters noted ENSO-neutral conditions but saw increasing chances of La Niña by winter, signaling a potential cooling influence ahead.
-   **2025-09-11** La Niña Watch issued — ↓ — US National Weather Service's CPC issued a La Niña Watch with a 71% probability for Oct-Dec, strengthening the case for a cooling influence on global temperatures.
-   **2025-10-09** La Niña Advisory declared — ↓ — NOAA confirmed La Niña conditions were present and expected to persist through winter, making its cooling effect on Nov/Dec temperatures highly probable.
-   **2025-10-20** Forecasts solidify on weak La Niña — ↓ — IRI models showed a 65% probability of La Niña for Oct-Dec, but projections pointed towards a weak event, limiting the potential magnitude of global cooling.
-   **2025-11-03** La Niña persistence confirmed — ↓ — NOAA's latest update affirmed La Niña is present and expected to continue through the Northern Hemisphere winter, locking in its influence for the resolution period.
-   **2025-11-07** Copernicus reports 2024 as record warm — ↑ (for baseline) — Confirmation that 2024 was the warmest year on record (at 1.60°C above pre-industrial) highlights the extremely high thermal baseline from which 2025 is operating.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **ENSO State (La Niña):** The primary driver for short-term deviation from the trend. The current weak La Niña exerts a moderate cooling pressure on global temperatures by cooling a large surface area of the equatorial Pacific. (Size: **Moderate**)
-   **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The inexorable rise in baseline temperature due to greenhouse gas emissions. Each year is expected to be warmer than past years with similar ENSO conditions. (Size: **Large**, secular)
-   **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** Outside the equatorial Pacific, many ocean basins (especially the Atlantic) remain at record or near-record warmth. This widespread marine heatwave counteracts some of La Niña's cooling effect. (Size: **Moderate**)
-   **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Eruption (Jan 2022):** The stratospheric injection of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) is thought to have a lingering, small net warming effect on the climate system, slightly elevating the baseline. (Size: **Small**)
-   **Weather-related Variability:** The final resolution is the single *highest daily* anomaly, which is subject to short-term, random global weather patterns that can cause significant positive or negative spikes around the monthly average. (Size: **Small to Moderate**)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Conflicting Ocean Signals:** Unlike typical La Niña years, the cooling in the equatorial Pacific is occurring amidst unprecedented warmth across other global oceans. This "warm world, cool ENSO" pattern is a key source of uncertainty and likely mutes La Niña's global cooling impact.
-   **Elevated Thermal Baseline:** The world is substantially warmer than during the last La Niña (2020-2022). The global energy imbalance is larger, meaning a weak La Niña will struggle to pull anomalies down to levels seen just a few years ago.
-   **Lingering Stratospheric Perturbations:** The climate system is still processing the effects of the Hunga Tonga eruption, adding a small but persistent warming influence not present in prior reference periods.
-   **Weak La Niña Event:** Forecasts consistently point to a weak, and possibly short-lived, La Niña. Stronger La Niña events have a much more pronounced and unambiguous global cooling effect.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on the recent Nov/Dec 2024 peak anomaly (~1.75°C), reflecting the current high-temperature regime but without the influence of a strong El Niño. Equivalent n: low, reflecting high recent volatility.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↓ (Large): Confirmed emergence of La Niña, which has a well-established global cooling effect.
    -   ↑ (Moderate): The La Niña is forecast to be weak, limiting the magnitude of its cooling effect.
    -   ↑ (Moderate): Persistent and extreme sea surface temperature anomalies outside the Pacific are actively counteracting the ENSO cooling signal.
    -   ↓ (Small): The 2025 temperature anomaly has been tracking below 2023 and 2024 levels for several months, suggesting the global system is already in a cooler phase.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should move down from the 2023/2024 peaks. The downward shift from the established La Niña is the dominant factor, but its magnitude is significantly dampened by the weak event strength and background ocean warmth. The final posterior should be centered moderately below the 2024 peak.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Weekly Niño 3.4 index readings weakening (moving toward -0.5°C from below).
    -   Copernicus/NOAA monthly reports for October showing a smaller-than-expected drop in the global anomaly.
    -   Strengthening of positive sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic or Indian Oceans.
    -   Forecasts for a strong positive phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagating across the Pacific.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Weekly Niño 3.4 index readings strengthening (moving toward -1.0°C or below).
    -   Evidence of strong atmospheric coupling with the oceanic La Niña (e.g., stronger trade winds).
    -   Unusually large negative temperature anomalies appearing over major landmasses (e.g., Siberia, North America).
    -   A significant short-term increase in global aerosol optical depth (e.g., from volcanic eruptions or wildfires).

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Daily vs. Monthly Average:** The question resolves on the *highest daily* peak, which will be higher and more volatile than the monthly average. A single day of specific weather patterns could cause a spike.
-   **Model Disagreement:** While models agree on a weak La Niña, its precise impact and interaction with the warm background state are uncertain.
-   **Lag Effects:** The maximum cooling impact of La Niña on global air temperatures typically lags the oceanic signal by several months. The full impact may not be felt by December 2025.
-   **Data Reanalysis:** The final Copernicus ERA5 data used for resolution is a reanalysis product. The "real-time" figures may be adjusted slightly in later versions.

### Final Research Summary
The peak daily temperature anomaly for Nov/Dec 2025 will likely be lower than in the past two years due to a confirmed weak La Niña. However, this cooling will be significantly muted by unprecedented warmth across other global oceans and a higher overall climate baseline, preventing a return to the cooler conditions of the 2020-2022 La Niña period.

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured probabilistic approach using Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Distribution:** The most relevant base rate is derived from recent peak anomaly years (2023-2024) during November and December. In 2023, under a strong El Niño, the peak anomaly reached approximately +1.95°C, while in 2024, during a transition to La Niña, it was around +1.75°C. This suggests a range of 1.7°C to 2.0°C for very warm years.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** We will use a mean of 1.75°C with a variance reflecting the range from 1.7°C to 2.0°C.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current year (2025) shares the elevated thermal baseline with 2023 and 2024, driven by long-term anthropogenic warming and high ocean heat content.
- **Differences:** The confirmed weak La Niña introduces a cooling influence, unlike the strong El Niño in 2023. However, the weak nature of the La Niña and the unprecedented warmth in other ocean basins may mute its effect.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **La Niña Conditions:** The presence of La Niña typically suggests a cooling effect, making lower anomalies more likely. However, the weak strength of this La Niña limits its impact.
- **Ocean Heat Content:** Record warmth in non-Pacific oceans counteracts La Niña's cooling, making higher anomalies more likely.
- **Current Year Trajectory:** The anomaly tracking around +1.5°C in Sep-Oct 2025 suggests a cooler phase compared to previous years, supporting a downward adjustment.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at 1.75°C, reflecting recent high-temperature regimes.
- **Likelihood Adjustments:** 
  - La Niña (↓): Suggests a downward shift.
  - Weak La Niña (↑): Limits the magnitude of the downward shift.
  - Ocean Heat Content (↑): Supports higher anomalies.
  - Current Year Trajectory (↓): Suggests a cooler phase.
- **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The posterior distribution shifts slightly downward from the prior, centering around 1.65°C with a narrower variance due to the weak La Niña and counteracting ocean warmth.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the potential for unexpected weather patterns causing spikes.
- **Tail Risks:** A single day of extreme weather could push the anomaly higher than expected.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where La Niña strengthens unexpectedly could lower the anomaly further.
- **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the variance to account for these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025 are:

P10: 1.50  
P20: 1.55  
P40: 1.60  
P60: 1.70  
P80: 1.80  
P90: 1.90

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly for Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use recent historical peak daily temperature anomalies during November-December periods:
- Nov-Dec 2023 (El Niño): ~1.95°C peak daily anomaly
- Nov-Dec 2024 (ENSO transition): ~1.75°C peak daily anomaly
- Nov-Dec 2020-2022 (La Niña years): ~1.1-1.3°C peak daily anomalies

Given that we're forecasting for a confirmed La Niña period but with a much warmer baseline than previous La Niña events, I'll center my prior around 1.5°C with a moderate spread to account for uncertainty. This represents a compromise between recent warm years and the expected cooling effect of La Niña.

Prior distribution: Mean = 1.5°C, with a 90% interval of approximately 1.2-1.8°C.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- We're looking at the same measurement (global surface air temperature anomaly)
- We're examining the same seasonal period (November-December)
- We're considering daily peaks rather than monthly averages

**Key differences:**
- Confirmed La Niña conditions for Nov-Dec 2025 (unlike 2023-2024)
- The La Niña is forecast to be weak, limiting its cooling effect
- The baseline global temperature is significantly higher than during previous La Niña events (2020-2022)
- Unprecedented warmth in non-Pacific ocean basins is counteracting some of La Niña's cooling
- The climate system has experienced additional warming from the Hunga Tonga eruption's water vapor

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing temperatures lower:**
- Confirmed La Niña conditions (NOAA advisory from October 9): This typically reduces global temperatures by 0.1-0.3°C. Likelihood ratio: 3:1 favoring lower values.
- 2025 temperature anomalies tracking below 2023-2024 levels in recent months: This suggests the cooling phase has already begun. Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring lower values.

**Evidence pushing temperatures higher:**
- Weak La Niña forecast: Weak events have less cooling impact than strong ones. Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring higher values within the La Niña context.
- Record ocean heat content outside the Pacific: This provides thermal inertia and counteracts Pacific cooling. Likelihood ratio: 3:1 favoring higher values than typical La Niña years.
- 2024 confirmed as warmest year on record (1.6°C above pre-industrial): This establishes an extremely high thermal baseline. Likelihood ratio: 4:1 favoring higher values than previous La Niña periods.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 1.5°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - La Niña presence:**
- Prior: Mean = 1.5°C
- Evidence: Confirmed La Niña (likelihood ratio 3:1 favoring lower values)
- Intermediate posterior: Shift downward to mean ≈ 1.4°C

**Second update - Weak La Niña + record ocean warmth:**
- Intermediate posterior: Mean = 1.4°C
- Evidence: Weak La Niña + record ocean heat (combined likelihood ratio ≈ 1.5:1 favoring higher values than typical La Niña)
- Updated posterior: Shift slightly upward to mean ≈ 1.45°C

**Third update - Higher thermal baseline:**
- Updated posterior: Mean = 1.45°C
- Evidence: Record warm 2024 baseline (likelihood ratio 4:1 favoring higher values than previous La Niña periods)
- Final posterior: Mean ≈ 1.5°C, but with a narrower distribution than the prior

The posterior distribution has returned to approximately the same central value as my prior (1.5°C) but with a different shape - the lower tail has been pulled up by the evidence of a higher thermal baseline, while the upper tail has been pulled down by the evidence of La Niña conditions.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the cooling effect of La Niña if it strengthens beyond current forecasts
- I might be overestimating the persistence of ocean heat content in non-Pacific basins
- Daily peaks are subject to weather variability that could produce unexpectedly high or low spikes
- The interaction between La Niña and the background warming trend is complex and not fully understood

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Stronger La Niña scenario: If La Niña strengthens significantly, we could see anomalies closer to 1.3°C
- Weather variability scenario: A specific weather pattern could produce a brief but significant spike to 1.7°C or higher
- Rapid cooling scenario: If global oceans cool faster than expected, we might see anomalies below 1.2°C

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties
- I'll maintain the central estimate around 1.5°C as the most likely outcome

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary reference class for this forecast is the peak daily global surface air temperature anomaly observed during the November-December period in recent years. This class is most relevant due to the strong, ongoing anthropogenic warming trend, which makes data from even 5-10 years ago less comparable.

*   **High-End Anchor (2023):** Nov/Dec 2023, under a strong El Niño, saw a peak anomaly of approximately **+1.95°C**. This serves as a plausible upper bound for what is possible in the current climate system under maximum short-term warming conditions.
*   **Recent High Baseline (2024):** Nov/Dec 2024, during a transition from El Niño to La Niña, had a lower peak of around **+1.75°C**. This is a very strong reference point as it reflects the current high thermal state of the planet without the peak influence of El Niño.
*   **Cooling-Influence Anchor (2020-2022):** The "triple-dip" La Niña years saw peak anomalies in the **+1.1°C to +1.3°C** range. This class is useful for estimating the potential cooling effect of a La Niña but is likely too low as a direct forecast due to the significant background warming that has occurred since.

My prior distribution is centered on a value moderately lower than the 2024 peak, reflecting an expectation of some cooling but acknowledging the much higher thermal baseline compared to the last La Niña. A prior centered around **1.65°C** with a standard deviation of ~0.15°C seems appropriate, spanning the range between the old La Niña years (adjusted up) and the recent peaks.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental driver of long-term warming due to greenhouse gas emissions is unchanged. Furthermore, global ocean heat content outside of the equatorial Pacific remains at or near record levels, providing a persistent source of heat to the atmosphere, similar to 2023 and 2024.
*   **Differences:** The crucial difference is the state of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Nov/Dec 2025 is under a confirmed La Niña, a state associated with global cooling. This is in stark contrast to the strong El Niño of 2023 and the transitional state of 2024. However, this La Niña is forecast to be weak, which will likely mute its global cooling impact compared to the stronger events of 2020-2022. This "warm world, cool ENSO" configuration is the key source of uncertainty.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Confirmed La Niña (↓, Large Downward Pressure):** NOAA has declared a La Niña advisory. This is the single most important factor pushing the forecast down. Historically, La Niña periods are cooler than ENSO-neutral or El Niño periods. This evidence makes values above 1.8°C significantly less likely and values in the 1.5-1.7°C range more likely.
*   **Evidence 2: Weak La Niña Forecast (↑, Moderate Upward Pressure):** Model consensus points to a weak event. A weak La Niña has a much smaller cooling effect than a moderate or strong one. This evidence dampens the downward pressure from Evidence 1, making a return to the cooler anomalies of 2020-2022 highly improbable. It pushes the distribution back up from where a "generic La Niña" would place it.
*   **Evidence 3: Record High Ocean Heat Content (↑, Moderate Upward Pressure):** Extreme warmth persists in the Atlantic and other ocean basins. This acts as a powerful counterbalance to the cooling in the equatorial Pacific, effectively putting a "high floor" under potential global temperature anomalies. This makes values below 1.4°C very unlikely.
*   **Evidence 4: Current 2025 Trajectory (↓, Small Downward Pressure):** The temperature anomaly for Sep-Oct 2025 has been tracking around +1.5°C, already below the levels of 2023 and 2024 for the same period. This confirms that a cooling trend relative to the last two years is already in effect, supporting a posterior that is centered below the 2024 peak of +1.75°C.
*   **Evidence 5: Daily vs. Monthly Peak (Spreads Distribution):** The question asks for the *highest daily* peak, not the monthly average. Daily temperatures are more volatile. This means the tails of the distribution should be wider than for a forecast of the monthly average. A random alignment of warm weather patterns could cause a significant spike of +0.1°C or more above the monthly mean.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

1.  **Start with Prior:** A distribution centered at **1.65°C**, reflecting a baseline slightly cooler than the 2024 peak.
2.  **Update with La Niña:** The confirmation of La Niña provides strong evidence for a cooler outcome. This shifts the entire distribution downwards. The mean moves from 1.65°C to perhaps 1.55°C.
3.  **Update with Countervailing Factors:** The weakness of the La Niña and the extreme background ocean warmth provide strong evidence against a *large* cooling effect. This pushes the distribution back upwards, though not to its starting point. The mean shifts from 1.55°C back to ~**1.62°C**. These conflicting signals also increase the overall uncertainty, suggesting a wider posterior distribution.
4.  **Final Adjustment for Daily Peak:** The fact that we are forecasting a single daily peak rather than a monthly average suggests the final distribution should have fatter tails, especially on the upside. I will shift my median slightly higher to ~**1.65°C** and ensure the P80 and P90 percentiles account for a potential short-term spike.

The posterior distribution is centered significantly below the 2023 El Niño peak and moderately below the 2024 transitional peak. However, it remains well above the anomalies seen during the last La Niña (2020-2022).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario (Stronger Cooling):** What if the atmospheric response to La Niña is faster and stronger than models predict, or if the background ocean warmth finally begins to dissipate? In this case, the peak anomaly could fall closer to 1.50°C. The current trajectory of ~1.5°C lends some credence to this possibility. This argues for keeping the lower percentiles (P10, P20) relatively low.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Weak Cooling/Dominant Warmth):** What if the weak La Niña is almost entirely cancelled out by the record ocean heat content and the overall planetary energy imbalance? A particular alignment of global weather patterns could still push the daily peak up to challenge the 2024 record of +1.75°C. This argues for a high P80 and P90.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** The primary uncertainty comes from the interaction between the Pacific cooling and the global background warmth. My forecast attempts to balance these, but the outcome could easily fall closer to either extreme. Therefore, a reasonably wide P10-P90 range of ~0.3°C is necessary to avoid overconfidence. My proposed distribution reflects this uncertainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered around 1.65°C. It acknowledges the cooling influence of a weak La Niña but respects the extremely high thermal baseline of the planet, which prevents a return to the cooler temperatures of the last La Niña event. The tails are wide enough to account for the volatility of a daily peak measurement and the conflicting climatic signals.
