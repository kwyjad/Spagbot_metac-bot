### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine (Ervebo, 2019) *Zaire ebolavirus* Outbreaks in DRC:** This is the most relevant reference class. It accounts for the game-changing impact of the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine and modern response protocols in the country most experienced with Ebola.
    *   **Data:** There have been four such outbreaks since the end of the large Kivu epidemic in mid-2020.
        *   2020 (Équateur): 130 cases, 55 deaths
        *   2021 (North Kivu): 12 cases, 6 deaths
        *   2022 (Équateur): 5 cases, 5 deaths
        *   2022 (North Kivu): 1 case, 1 death
    *   **Base Rate:** Excluding the 2020 outlier which began just as the Kivu outbreak ended, the median death toll is 5. The mean is heavily skewed by the 2020 event. This class suggests that outbreaks are now typically contained with very few fatalities.
    *   **Limitations:** A very small sample size (n=4). The 2020 outbreak shows that a death toll over 50 is still plausible, even with vaccines.

2.  **All Ebola Outbreaks in DRC (1976-Present):** This class provides a broader historical perspective on the virus's potential in this specific country.
    *   **Data:** The DRC has experienced 16 outbreaks. Most have been small. The median number of deaths is low (likely <50). However, the distribution has a very fat tail, dominated by the 2018-2020 Kivu epidemic (2,280 deaths).
    *   **Base Rate:** The mean is skewed to over 200 deaths due to the Kivu outbreak. The median provides a more typical expectation of a smaller, contained event.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is heavily influenced by pre-vaccine, pre-modern-response-protocol data, making it less representative of current capabilities.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province. Initial report of 32 cases and 15 deaths signals a significant early transmission event. (↑)
*   **2025-10-15** CDC reports the outbreak has grown to 64 confirmed/probable cases and 45 deaths, confirming the initial severity and spread. (↑)
*   **2025-10-20** The last known Ebola patient is discharged from a treatment center, initiating a 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak. (↓↓↓) — This is the single most important development, indicating that active transmission chains have been successfully interrupted.
*   **2025-11-07** (Today) Approximately 18 days have passed in the 42-day countdown with no new reported cases, strengthening the view that the outbreak is contained. (↓)

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Vaccination Strategy (Large):** The "ring vaccination" strategy, where contacts of known cases and their contacts are vaccinated with the highly effective Ervebo vaccine, is extremely effective at halting transmission of the *Zaire ebolavirus* strain.
*   **Speed of Response (Large):** Rapid deployment of experienced national and international health teams for contact tracing, case management, and vaccination is the primary determinant of containment. Delays allow for geometric spread.
*   **Geographic Location (Moderate):** Outbreaks in dense, highly-connected urban centers (e.g., Goma during the Kivu outbreak) or regions with high population mobility pose a much greater risk of rapid, widespread transmission than those in more rural, isolated areas.
*   **Community Trust & Engagement (Moderate):** Mistrust of health workers can lead to hidden cases, avoidance of treatment centers, and unsafe burials, creating new transmission chains. The response in Kasaï appears to have secured sufficient community cooperation.
*   **Conflict and Security (Large):** The 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak was massively exacerbated by armed conflict that hampered response efforts. The relative stability of Kasaï Province is a major positive factor.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Outbreak is likely over:** The most significant difference is the current status. Unlike a typical forecasting scenario at the beginning or middle of an outbreak, this one appears to be in its final phase, with the 42-day countdown to being declared over already underway. This dramatically caps the potential for further deaths.
*   **Higher initial toll than recent outbreaks:** The current toll of 45 deaths is significantly higher than the three most recent post-vaccine DRC outbreaks (6, 5, and 1 deaths). This suggests the outbreak was either detected later than usual or had a more rapid initial spread before the response became effective.
*   **Absence of major conflict:** Unlike the Kivu epidemic (the largest DRC outbreak), the Kasaï region is not experiencing the same level of intense, organized armed conflict. This has allowed for a more effective and secure public health response.
*   **Experienced Response Teams:** The DRC has, by necessity, developed one of the world's most experienced Ebola response cadres. This institutional knowledge allows for faster and more effective deployment of countermeasures compared to countries experiencing their first outbreak.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the "Post-Vaccine DRC" reference class seems most appropriate. This would be a distribution centered low (e.g., median ~10-20 deaths) but with a right-skewed tail to account for the possibility of control failure. Equivalent n is low (perhaps n=4), reflecting the small sample size of this reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The initial death toll of 45 is an update that pushes the estimate well above the median of the most recent outbreaks, suggesting this event is an outlier relative to them.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The outbreak location in a non-conflict zone (vs. Kivu) is a strong positive indicator for effective containment.
    *   (↓↓↓ Very Large) The fact that the last patient has been discharged and the 42-day countdown has begun is overwhelming evidence that transmission has been halted. This should collapse the probability mass in the tail of the distribution.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of containment is far stronger than the evidence from the initial death toll. The posterior should be a tight distribution centered just above the currently reported 45 deaths, with very little probability mass assigned to numbers above 50.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new confirmed case reported by the DRC MoH or WHO before the 42-day countdown completes (around December 1, 2025). This would reset the clock.
    *   Reports of a linked case in a neighboring province or country.
    *   Discovery of a previously unknown transmission chain.
    *   Reports of significant community resistance to response teams or unsafe burials.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continued progress through the 42-day countdown with no new cases.
    *   Official WHO/DRC MoH statements confirming no new cases have been found.
    *   The official declaration that the outbreak has ended (expected around December 1, 2025).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting Lags & Revisions:** The final, official death toll from the DRC Ministry of Health may be revised slightly after the outbreak is declared over, as probable cases are confirmed or dismissed.
*   **Flare-ups:** Though rare, the virus can persist in survivors and cause a late relapse or new transmission chain (a "flare-up"). A new case emerging after the 42-day period from a survivor source could restart the outbreak, though this is a low-probability event within the short time horizon.
*   **Definition of "this outbreak":** The resolution criteria are clear, but a flare-up in early 2026 could create ambiguity about whether it's part of the "ongoing" outbreak or a new, distinct event. Given the Jan 1, 2026 deadline, this is a minor risk.
*   **Data Accuracy:** The number of deaths (45) is derived from the total cases (64) and recoveries (19) reported in news sources. The official final tally from the DRC MoH is the ground truth and could differ slightly.

**Final Research Summary:** The outbreak appears to be over, with the last patient having been discharged and a 42-day countdown to its official end already underway. The final death toll is therefore highly likely to be very close to the currently reported number of 45.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in the DRC before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class:** The most relevant base rate is the post-vaccine *Zaire ebolavirus* outbreaks in the DRC, given the impact of the Ervebo vaccine and modern response protocols.
- **Base Rate Data:** Excluding the 2020 outlier, the median death toll is 5, with a mean skewed by the 2020 event. This suggests that outbreaks are typically contained with few fatalities.
- **Base Rate Characteristics:** Median ~5 deaths, with a right-skewed distribution to account for rare larger outbreaks.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The outbreak is in the DRC, where there is significant experience in managing Ebola with vaccines and response protocols.
- **Differences:** The current outbreak has already resulted in 45 deaths, which is higher than recent post-vaccine outbreaks. However, the outbreak appears to be contained, with no new cases reported in the last 18 days.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Initial Death Toll (↑):** The initial toll of 45 deaths indicates a more severe outbreak than recent ones, suggesting a higher-than-median outcome.
- **Containment Evidence (↓↓↓):** The discharge of the last patient and the ongoing 42-day countdown with no new cases strongly indicate containment, reducing the likelihood of additional deaths.
- **Geographic and Conflict Context (↓):** The outbreak is in a relatively stable region, unlike the Kivu outbreak, which supports effective containment.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around a low median with a right-skewed tail.
- **Update:** The containment evidence is overwhelming, suggesting the outbreak is effectively over. The posterior distribution should be tightly centered around the current death toll of 45, with minimal probability of exceeding 50 deaths.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of reporting lags or a late flare-up, though these are unlikely given the current evidence.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A new case could emerge, but the probability is low given the containment measures.
- **Adjustment:** Maintain a tight distribution around 45 deaths, with slight consideration for reporting adjustments.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- Given the evidence and Bayesian update, the forecast is tightly centered around the current death toll, with minimal tail risk.

# Forecasting the Death Toll from the 2025 Kasaï Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the "Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks" as my primary reference class, as it's most relevant to the current situation:

- 2020 (Équateur): 130 cases, 55 deaths
- 2021 (North Kivu): 12 cases, 6 deaths
- 2022 (Équateur): 5 cases, 5 deaths
- 2022 (North Kivu): 1 case, 1 death

This gives a median of 5.5 deaths and a mean of 16.75 deaths, though heavily skewed by the 2020 outbreak. The distribution is right-skewed with most outbreaks being small but with occasional larger events.

I'll also consider the broader historical context of all DRC outbreaks, which suggests a median likely under 50 deaths, but with potential for much larger outbreaks (like the Kivu epidemic with 2,280 deaths).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- Same country (DRC) with experienced response teams
- Same virus (Zaire ebolavirus)
- Same vaccine and containment protocols available
- Similar rural setting for initial outbreak

**Key differences:**
- Current outbreak is already at 45 deaths, higher than 3 of the 4 post-vaccine outbreaks
- The outbreak appears to be in its final phase with the last patient discharged on October 20, 2025
- The 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak is already underway (18 days in)
- No active conflict in the region (unlike the Kivu outbreak)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing the forecast upward:**
- Initial death toll (45) is already higher than most recent outbreaks, suggesting either later detection or more rapid initial spread (strong upward push)
- The case fatality rate appears high (45/64 = ~70%), above the typical 50% (moderate upward push)

**Evidence pushing the forecast downward:**
- Last patient discharged on October 20, with no new cases for 18 days (very strong downward push)
- 42-day countdown to declare the outbreak over is already underway (very strong downward push)
- No conflict in the region to hamper response efforts (moderate downward push)
- Experienced response teams in DRC (moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior based on post-vaccine outbreaks (median ~10, but right-skewed):

**First update - Current death toll:**
- The evidence that 45 deaths have already occurred shifts our distribution significantly upward
- This immediately places a hard lower bound at 45
- Posterior median shifts to ~50 deaths

**Second update - Containment status:**
- The evidence that the last patient has been discharged and no new cases for 18 days dramatically collapses the right tail of our distribution
- This suggests very little chance of significant additional deaths
- Posterior median shifts to ~46-47 deaths, with a much narrower distribution

The final posterior distribution is centered just above the current 45 deaths, with a very narrow range and limited upside potential.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Reporting delays:** There could be unreported deaths in remote areas that haven't been counted yet
2. **Late complications:** Some current survivors might still die from Ebola complications
3. **Flare-ups:** Though rare, viral persistence in survivors could cause a new case before 2026
4. **Definition issues:** The final official count might differ slightly from current reports

Alternative forecast: One could argue for a slightly higher estimate (50-60 deaths) if assuming some unreported cases exist or if expecting complications among current survivors.

Rebuttal: The 18 days without new cases strongly suggests the outbreak is effectively over. Any additional deaths would likely be limited to the currently hospitalized patients or minor reporting adjustments.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the set of *Zaire ebolavirus* outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that have occurred since the approval and widespread use of the Ervebo (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine in 2019. This reference class best reflects current response capabilities, including highly effective vaccines and experienced medical teams.

*   **Reference Class:** Post-2019 DRC Ebola Outbreaks (n=4)
    *   2020: 55 deaths
    *   2021: 6 deaths
    *   2022: 5 deaths
    *   2022: 1 death
*   **Distribution:** This is a small dataset with a median of 5.5 deaths and a mean of 16.75 deaths. The distribution is heavily right-skewed, indicating that while most outbreaks are very small, a larger event (like the 55-death outbreak in 2020) remains possible. My prior distribution, therefore, would be centered low (median ~10-20) but with a significant right tail to account for the possibility of containment failure.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current outbreak involves the same virus strain (*Zaire ebolavirus*) in the same country (DRC) with the same advanced countermeasures available (Ervebo vaccine, experienced teams).
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Outbreak Status:** The most critical difference is that this outbreak appears to be over. The last known patient was discharged on October 20, 2025, and the 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak has begun. As of today (November 7), 18 days have passed without a new case. This is a profound difference from forecasting in the middle of an active outbreak.
    2.  **Initial Severity:** With 45 deaths reported so far, this outbreak is already significantly larger than three of the four outbreaks in the reference class, suggesting a more challenging initial transmission scenario before containment was achieved.
    3.  **Location:** The outbreak is in Kasaï Province, which, unlike the site of the 2018-2020 epidemic (Kivu), is not experiencing major armed conflict. This facilitates a more effective public health response.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
1.  **Initial Toll (45 deaths):** This evidence strongly suggests we are not in a "typical" post-vaccine scenario (like the 1, 5, or 6 death outbreaks). On its own, this would push the forecast much higher, making a final toll of >50 deaths seem plausible. (Upward pressure ↑)
2.  **Containment Signal (Last patient discharged, 42-day countdown started):** This is overwhelmingly strong evidence that transmission has been successfully interrupted. Standard epidemiological practice holds that two full incubation periods (2x21=42 days) without a new case means the outbreak is over. This evidence drastically reduces the probability of any significant future increase in deaths. (Massive downward pressure ↓↓↓)
3.  **Time Elapsed (18 days into countdown):** Each day that passes reinforces the containment signal, making the discovery of a new, unknown transmission chain less and less likely. (Strong downward pressure ↓↓)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A low-median (~15 deaths), right-skewed distribution based on post-2019 outbreaks.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence is dominated by the containment signal. While the initial death toll of 45 is high compared to the prior, the news that the last patient has recovered and the countdown is well underway acts as an extremely powerful update. This likelihood function assigns very low probability to any outcome significantly greater than the current death toll.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution is formed by this update. The prior's long tail is effectively truncated. The new distribution becomes very narrow and tightly centered just above the current reported number of 45 deaths. The remaining uncertainty is primarily about minor data revisions or the low-probability risk of a missed transmission chain. The posterior median will be very close to 45.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Primary Risk:** A new case is discovered before the 42-day countdown completes, revealing a hidden transmission chain. Given that 18 days have passed, this risk is diminishing but not zero. Such an event could add a handful of new deaths.
*   **Secondary Risk:** Data reconciliation. The final official number from the DRC Ministry of Health might be revised slightly up or down as probable cases are confirmed or re-classified. Upward revisions are generally more common than downward ones. A final tally of 46, 47, or 48 is plausible.
*   **Tail Risk:** A flare-up from a survivor (e.g., through sexual transmission or relapse) could seed a new cluster before the Jan 1, 2026 deadline. This is a known but rare phenomenon and represents the most plausible, though unlikely, path to a death toll of 50 or more.
*   **Adjustment:** My final percentiles must account for these risks. The distribution will not be a point estimate at 45. It will be a tight distribution centered near 45-46, with a right skew to account for the small but real possibility of a few more deaths. The P10, P20, and P40 will be anchored at 45, reflecting the high improbability of a downward revision. The P80 and P90 will capture the risks of a small cluster and a flare-up, respectively.
