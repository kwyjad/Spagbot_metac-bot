### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the current legal and regulatory status of Polymarket and Manifold in the United States?
    *   What is the primary U.S. regulatory body governing prediction markets, and what is its stance?
    *   What are the established pathways for a prediction market to become legal for real-money trading in the U.S.?
    *   How long do these legal and regulatory processes typically take?
    *   Are Polymarket or Manifold currently engaged in any public, late-stage legal or regulatory processes that could conclude by the end of 2025?
    *   What is the broader political and regulatory climate surrounding cryptocurrency and novel financial products?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `CFTC vs Polymarket settlement 2022`
    *   `Polymarket US market access status 2025`
    *   `Manifold Markets real money US regulation`
    *   `CFTC Designated Contract Market (DCM) application process timeline`
    *   `Kalshi CFTC approval history`
    *   `PredictIt CFTC no-action letter withdrawal`
    *   `US crypto regulation bill status 2025`
    *   `CFTC commissioner statements on event contracts`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The primary regulator is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which classifies event contracts as swaps or binary options.
    *   Polymarket has a history of non-compliance, culminating in a January 2022 settlement where they paid a $1.4 million fine and agreed to cease U.S. operations. To re-enter, they would need to reverse this status, likely by obtaining a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license.
    *   Manifold operates on play-money ("mana") specifically to avoid U.S. securities and commodities regulations. A shift to real money would require a complete change in their business model and a new, lengthy regulatory approval process from scratch.
    *   The established legal path is via a CFTC license (e.g., DCM), a process that is notoriously long, expensive, and complex. Kalshi, the main legal U.S. operator, spent several years and millions of dollars to get its license.
    *   The timeline is the most critical constraint. As of October 2025, less than three months remain in the year. Regulatory and legislative processes of this nature take years, not weeks. There is no public evidence that either firm is in the final stages of any such process.
    *   The broader regulatory environment remains cautious. While some crypto legislation (like the FIT21 Act) has been debated, it is slow-moving and does not create an immediate, simplified path for platforms like Polymarket. The CFTC's action to revoke PredictIt's no-action letter in 2022 further signals a tightening, not loosening, of oversight.

4.  **Drafting the Brief:**
    *   The final brief will be structured according to the required format, emphasizing the prohibitive timeline and the high regulatory barriers as the core drivers of a very low probability.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecaster**

**To:** Bayesian Forecasting Panel Statistician
**From:** Lead Researcher
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Subject:** Forecast Update: Legality of Polymarket/Manifold in the U.S. in 2025

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Unregulated offshore financial platforms seeking U.S. licensure:** This is the most direct reference class. Historically, the success rate for such platforms gaining a full, real-money license (like a CFTC DCM) within a single calendar year is extremely low. Over the last decade, we have seen very few entrants. Kalshi is the primary success story, while others (PredictIt, Polymarket) have faced regulatory shutdown. **Base Rate: <5% per year.**
2.  **Novel financial products seeking federal regulatory approval:** This broader class includes things like the first Bitcoin ETFs. The process is multi-year, often involving multiple rejection-and-resubmission cycles. The probability of approval in any specific year, especially for a controversial product, is low until the final stages are announced. **Base Rate: 5-10% per year for a product already deep in the application process.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The horizon is less than 3 months. The most relevant "recent" information is the continued *absence* of positive catalysts.
*   **2025-01 to 2025-10 (ongoing):** No public announcements from Polymarket or Manifold regarding any late-stage application, lawsuit, or settlement with the CFTC that would permit 2025 operations. (↓) — The clock is running out, and silence on this front is strong negative evidence.
*   **2025-07-01:** The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) remains stalled in the Senate after passing the House in May 2024. (↔/↓) — Shows that even priority crypto legislation moves slowly; bespoke prediction market relief is not on the agenda.
*   **2024-02-26:** A federal court upheld the CFTC's decision to shut down PredictIt's market, reinforcing the agency's authority over event contracts. (↓) — This precedent strengthens the CFTC's legal position, making a successful court challenge by Polymarket less likely.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **CFTC Licensing (DCM/SEF):** The primary legitimate pathway. This is a multi-year, resource-intensive process. **Effect Size: Large** (but process is too slow for 2025).
2.  **Congressional Legislation:** A new law could explicitly legalize and regulate prediction markets. This is highly improbable given political gridlock and lack of prioritization. **Effect Size: Large** (but probability is near-zero for 2025).
3.  **Favorable Court Ruling:** A successful lawsuit against the CFTC could force them to allow operations. These cases also take years to resolve. **Effect Size: Large** (but process is too slow for 2025).
4.  **CFTC Settlement/No-Action Relief:** Polymarket could negotiate a new settlement allowing re-entry, or the CFTC could grant no-action relief. This is the only mechanism that could plausibly occur quickly, but it is highly unlikely given Polymarket's history and the current regulatory climate. **Effect Size: Large** (but highly improbable).
5.  **Change in Business Model (Manifold):** Manifold would need to pivot from play-money to a real-money, compliance-first model and *then* begin the multi-year regulatory journey. **Effect Size: N/A for 2025**.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Prior Enforcement History:** Unlike a new, clean applicant, Polymarket has a prior enforcement action and settlement with the CFTC for illegal operation. This history of non-compliance creates a significant hurdle and likely subjects them to greater scrutiny.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in under 3 months. The reference class base rate is for a full year; the probability of a multi-year process concluding in a specific 2.5-month window without any prior public indication is minuscule.
*   **Existence of a Legal Competitor:** Kalshi's success provides a template for compliance but also sets a high bar. It demonstrates the CFTC has a preferred (and arduous) path, making them less likely to grant shortcuts or exceptions to past rule-breakers.
*   **Divergent Platform Situations:** The question bundles two very different platforms. Polymarket is an exiled ex-operator. Manifold would need a ground-up transformation. Manifold's inclusion does not materially increase the probability, as its path to 2025 legality is effectively zero.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~2-3% seems appropriate, derived from the low base rate of unregulated platforms gaining U.S. approval, adjusted down for the short remaining time in the year. (Equivalent n of ~30-50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓) **Prohibitive Timeline:** Less than 3 months remain in 2025, which is insufficient for any standard legal or regulatory process to conclude. (Large)
    *   (↓) **Polymarket's Negative History:** The 2022 CFTC settlement creates a significant barrier to re-entry and goodwill. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) **Lack of Public Progress:** There is no evidence (filings, announcements, court dockets) that either firm is in the final stages of any legalization pathway. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) **Manifold's Business Model:** Manifold is fundamentally not a real-money platform; a pivot and approval in 2025 is not feasible. (Moderate, as it eliminates one of the two paths to YES).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is uniformly negative and strongly reinforces the low prior. The posterior probability should be updated significantly downward, approaching a floor near zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official press release from the CFTC or Polymarket announcing a new settlement that explicitly permits U.S. operations.
    *   A surprise federal court ruling in favor of Polymarket in a previously unknown case.
    *   Introduction and fast-tracking of highly specific federal legislation benefiting prediction markets (extremely unlikely).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any public statement from Polymarket's CEO confirming they are not targeting a 2025 U.S. re-launch.
    *   New CFTC enforcement actions against other crypto-adjacent platforms, signaling a continued hawkish stance.
    *   The passage of Dec 31, 2025, without incident.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** "Legally offer" could theoretically include a limited no-action letter, not just

To forecast the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the United States in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for unregulated offshore financial platforms gaining U.S. licensure within a single calendar year is extremely low. Historically, the success rate for such platforms is less than 5% per year. Given the specific context of prediction markets and the regulatory environment, a prior probability of around 2-3% is reasonable. This is based on the historical difficulty of obtaining a CFTC license and the specific challenges faced by platforms like Polymarket and Manifold.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base case in that both Polymarket and Manifold are unregulated platforms seeking to enter a tightly controlled market. The regulatory hurdles and the need for a CFTC license are consistent with historical cases.
- **Differences:** The time horizon is much shorter than a full year, with less than three months remaining in 2025. Additionally, Polymarket has a history of non-compliance, which increases scrutiny and reduces the likelihood of a quick resolution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Prohibitive Timeline:** With less than three months left in 2025, the likelihood of completing the necessary regulatory processes is extremely low. This strongly decreases the probability.
- **Polymarket's Negative History:** The 2022 CFTC settlement and cessation of U.S. operations create significant barriers to re-entry. This also decreases the probability.
- **Lack of Public Progress:** No public announcements or filings indicate that either platform is in the final stages of any legalization pathway. This further decreases the probability.
- **Manifold's Business Model:** Manifold's current play-money model would require a complete overhaul to comply with real-money regulations, which is not feasible within the remaining timeframe. This decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 2-3% translates to odds of approximately 1:49 to 1:33.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the uniformly negative evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1, reinforcing the low prior.
- **Posterior Odds:** The posterior odds are further reduced by the negative evidence, approaching a floor near zero.
- **Posterior Probability:** The resulting posterior probability is extremely low, reflecting the cumulative impact of the evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast considers the possibility of unexpected regulatory changes or legal victories, but these are deemed highly unlikely within the timeframe.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A surprise regulatory shift or court ruling could change the outcome, but there is no current indication of such developments.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of public progress and the short timeline strongly counter any optimistic scenarios.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, the negative evidence, and the short timeframe, the probability of real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold becoming legal in the U.S. in 2025 is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold become legal in the United States in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for prediction markets like Polymarket or Manifold becoming legally operational with real money in the US within a specific timeframe.

The most appropriate reference class is "unregulated offshore financial platforms seeking U.S. licensure." According to the research brief, the historical success rate for such platforms gaining full, real-money licenses (like a CFTC DCM) within a single calendar year is extremely low, with a base rate of <5% per year.

Given that:
- We're already in October 2025, with less than 3 months remaining in the year
- The regulatory process typically takes years, not months
- Neither platform has announced being in the final stages of approval

I'll select a prior of 2% (0.02 probability), which is on the conservative side of the suggested 2-3% range in the research brief. This reflects the extremely low base rate combined with the short time remaining in 2025.

Prior probability: 2% (odds of 1:49)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Both Polymarket and Manifold fall into the category of novel financial platforms seeking regulatory approval
- The CFTC remains the primary regulatory body with jurisdiction over prediction markets
- The standard pathways for approval (DCM licensing, legislation, court rulings) remain unchanged

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline constraint:** We're in October 2025, with less than 3 months remaining in the year, making this much less likely than the annual base rate
- **Polymarket's enforcement history:** Unlike a typical applicant, Polymarket has a prior CFTC settlement ($1.4 million fine in 2022) and was forced to cease US operations, creating additional hurdles
- **Manifold's business model:** Manifold currently operates on a play-money model specifically to avoid US regulations; transitioning to real money would require a complete business model change and starting the regulatory process from scratch
- **Existence of Kalshi:** There is now a legal precedent (Kalshi) that demonstrates the preferred path for compliance, which took several years and millions of dollars

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate, as they represent additional hurdles and constraints beyond the typical case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Let's evaluate the key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Prohibitive Timeline (Less than 3 months remain in 2025)**
- P(E|H): If legalization will occur in 2025, how likely would we be to see only 3 months remaining with no public progress? Very unlikely, perhaps 0.05
- P(E|~H): If legalization won't occur in 2025, how likely would we be to see this timeline constraint? Very likely, perhaps 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Lack of Public Progress or Announcements**
- P(E|H): If legalization will occur in 2025, how likely would we be to see no public announcements or filings? Very unlikely, perhaps 0.1
- P(E|~H): If legalization won't occur in 2025, how likely would we see no announcements? Very likely, perhaps 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.111
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Polymarket's Negative Regulatory History**
- P(E|H): If legalization will occur in 2025, how likely would Polymarket have this negative history? Moderately likely, perhaps 0.4 (companies can overcome past issues)
- P(E|~H): If legalization won't occur in 2025, how likely would Polymarket have this history? Somewhat likely, perhaps 0.6
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.6 = 0.667
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Manifold's Current Business Model (Play Money)**
- P(E|H): If legalization will occur in 2025, how likely would Manifold currently be using a play-money model? Very unlikely, perhaps 0.2
- P(E|~H): If legalization won't occur in 2025, how likely would Manifold have this model? Very likely, perhaps 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior odds of 1:49 (probability of 2%), let's update based on the evidence:

**Update based on Timeline Constraint:**
- Prior odds: 1:49
- Likelihood ratio: 0.053
- Posterior odds = 1:49 × 0.053 = 0.053:49 ≈ 1:925
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+925) ≈ 0.0011 or about 0.11%

**Update based on Lack of Public Progress:**
- Prior odds: 1:925
- Likelihood ratio: 0.111
- Posterior odds = 1:925 × 0.111 = 0.111:925 ≈ 1:8,333
- Posterior probability = 1/(1+8,333) ≈ 0.00012 or about 0.012%

I'll stop the explicit calculation here as the probability is becoming extremely small. The remaining evidence factors would push it even lower.

After considering all evidence, the posterior probability is effectively approaching zero, but I'll be cautious about claiming absolute impossibility and set a reasonable floor.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- **Secret negotiations:** There could be confidential settlement discussions between Polymarket and the CFTC that aren't public
- **Limited scope approval:** The CFTC might grant a very limited form of approval or no-action letter that technically satisfies the resolution criteria
- **Legislative surprise:** While unlikely, a last-minute legislative rider attached to a must-pass bill could create a special carve-out
- **Definition ambiguity:** The resolution criteria might interpret "legally offer markets" more broadly than I've assumed

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A scenario where Polymarket has been quietly working with the CFTC for months and is about to announce a settlement that allows limited US operations
- A scenario where Manifold has been developing a parallel real-money platform that's further along in regulatory approval than publicly known

While these scenarios are possible, they remain highly improbable given the evidence. Even accounting for these possibilities, I would only adjust my estimate slightly upward from near-zero.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I arrive at a final forecast of 0.5%.

This reflects:
1. The extremely low base rate for regulatory approval in general
2. The prohibitively short timeline remaining in 2025
3. The lack of any public progress indicators
4. The specific challenges facing both Polymarket and Manifold
5. A small allowance for unknown factors or surprise developments

Final: 0.5%

Answering the question: **Will real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold become legal in the United States in 2025?**

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "unregulated or non-compliant financial platforms seeking U.S. regulatory approval." The research brief suggests a base rate of <5% for such a platform gaining approval in any given year. Let's use 3% as a starting point.

However, this question has a critical temporal constraint: the current date is October 16, 2025, leaving only ~2.5 months in the resolution period. Regulatory approvals are the culmination of long, public processes, not random events distributed evenly throughout the year. The probability of such a process concluding in a specific 2.5-month window without any prior public signals is far lower than a simple pro-rata share of the annual base rate.

Therefore, I will adjust the annual base rate of 3% sharply downward to reflect the short time remaining and the lack of any preceding signals. An initial prior probability P(H) of **1%** seems appropriate. This acknowledges that something is still theoretically possible while respecting the extreme time constraint.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is significantly more challenging than the general reference case for several reasons:

*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** With less than three months remaining in 2025, any standard regulatory pathway (e.g., a Designated Contract Market license application with the CFTC) is impossible to complete from a standing start. These processes take multiple years.
*   **Polymarket's Negative History:** Polymarket is not a new applicant. It has a prior enforcement action and a $1.4 million settlement with the CFTC for operating illegally. This history of non-compliance makes regulators less likely to grant swift or lenient approval compared to a new entity with a clean record.
*   **Manifold's Business Model:** Manifold is a play-money platform. To become legal for real-money betting, it would require a complete business model transformation *and* the initiation of a multi-year regulatory approval process. The probability of this happening in 2025 is effectively zero. Therefore, the question rests almost entirely on Polymarket.
*   **Existence of a Legal Competitor:** Kalshi's successful (but long and expensive) path to legality sets a high precedent for compliance. This makes the CFTC less likely to grant shortcuts or exceptions to past rule-breakers like Polymarket.

These factors all suggest the probability for this specific case should be lower than the base rate for an average member of the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Polymarket or Manifold becomes legal in the US in 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Absence of Public Progress.** As of mid-October 2025, there are no public announcements, court filings, or CFTC dockets indicating that either company is in the final stages of any legalization process.
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of seeing no public signs, if approval were just 2.5 months away, is extremely low. Such processes are typically public in their final stages.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of seeing no public signs, if approval is *not* imminent, is extremely high. This is the expected state of affairs.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H))**: Very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Hawkish Regulatory Climate.** Recent legal precedents, such as the federal court upholding the CFTC's shutdown of PredictIt, signal a tightening of regulatory control over event contracts, not a loosening.
    *   P(E2 | H): A sudden approval for a past offender is very unlikely in a climate of strengthening enforcement.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): A continued block on Polymarket is perfectly consistent with this climate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Small (< 1). This evidence decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds**: P(H) = 1% → Odds = 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 1:99.
*   **Update with Evidence 1 (Absence of Progress)**: This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The likelihood ratio is very small. A conservative estimate might be 1/20 (i.e., it's 20 times more likely to see no news if nothing is happening than if approval is imminent).
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio ≈ (1/99) × (1/20) = 1/1980.
    *   Posterior Probability = 1 / (1 + 1980) ≈ 0.05%.

The evidence strongly pushes the already low prior probability much closer to zero. The other negative evidence (regulatory climate, Polymarket's history) reinforces this conclusion. The updated probability is well below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome would involve a "black swan" event that bypasses the normal, slow processes.
*   **Alternative Scenario 1: A sudden political settlement.** The CFTC, perhaps under political pressure, could announce a surprise settlement allowing Polymarket to operate under supervision, possibly to capture the massive trading volume around U.S. elections.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: A legislative miracle.** A specific rider legalizing prediction markets could be attached to a must-pass, end-of-year government funding bill.
*   **Rebuttal:** Both scenarios are highly speculative and go against the grain of all available evidence. Regulatory agencies are risk-averse, especially regarding crypto-related entities with a history of non-compliance. Legislative action on such a niche issue without prior groundwork is also extremely rare. While these scenarios prevent the probability from being absolute zero, they are very low-probability events. My forecast should be low enough to reflect that these are tail risks, not central scenarios. A probability of 1% seems to adequately capture this sliver of uncertainty.

### 6. Final Forecast
The combination of an extremely short time horizon, a starting base rate that is already low, and uniformly negative evidence makes the probability of this event occurring by the end of 2025 exceptionally small. The known pathways to legalization are functionally closed by the calendar. A "Yes" resolution would require a surprising and unprecedented event, such as a sudden political settlement or a legislative miracle, for which there is no current evidence.

Final: 1%
