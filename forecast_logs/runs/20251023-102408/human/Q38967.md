### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Iranian-Initiated Disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz:** The most relevant reference class is major escalatory military action by Iran in the Strait. Since the 1979 revolution, there has been one major period of disruption: the 1984-1988 "Tanker War" phase of the Iran-Iraq War. During this ~4-year period, shipping was attacked, but the Strait was never closed. In the ~45 years since 1979, there has been no event meeting the resolution criteria. This suggests a very low base rate, perhaps **<2% per year**, for a disruption of this magnitude.
2.  **Major Global Maritime Chokepoint Disruptions:** This class includes events like the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction (Ever Given). Such events occur infrequently. Over the last 50 years, there have been perhaps 2-3 events of this scale (Suez 2021, Suez closures during wars in 1967, 1973). This suggests a base rate of a major chokepoint disruption somewhere in the world of **4-6% per year**. The Strait of Hormuz is arguably the most militarized and contested chokepoint, increasing its specific risk relative to this average.
3.  **Tanker Seizures/Harassment by Iran:** Iran has a history of seizing or harassing commercial vessels, often in response to sanctions or the seizure of Iranian tankers abroad (e.g., 2019, 2022, 2023). These events typically last for hours or days and affect individual ships but have not caused a fleet-wide halt. There have been roughly 5-6 such high-profile incidents in the last 6 years. While not closures, a sufficiently aggressive or large-scale seizure operation could deter traffic for a day. This suggests a base rate for a "major harassment event" of **~80% per year**, but the probability of it escalating to meet the resolution criteria is much lower.

*Limitations:* The primary limitation is the lack of a direct historical precedent for a near-total, albeit brief, closure. The resolution criteria's low bar (a single day <10 tankers) makes it a unique case not directly comparable to past sustained conflicts.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** ISW reports Iranian officials threatening closure to deter US sanctions enforcement and notes increased naval inspections. — ↑ — Indicates Iran is actively using the threat as a policy tool and increasing its operational readiness in the Gulf.
*   **2025-09-22** Unconfirmed reports of a close-pass incident between an IRGC fast boat and a US Navy destroyer near the Strait. — ↑ — Highlights the risk of miscalculation and accidental escalation in a tense environment, which could disrupt traffic.
*   **2025-08-15** The US announces the deployment of an additional squadron of F-35s to the region, citing the need to "deter Iranian aggression." — ↓ — Strengthens the primary military deterrent against an Iranian attempt to close the Strait, making such an action more costly for Tehran.
*   **2025-07-29** China's foreign ministry issues a statement calling for "all parties to exercise restraint" and ensure the "safety of global energy passages." — ↓ — Signals that Iran's most important economic partner and political ally would strongly oppose a closure, creating significant diplomatic and economic pressure.
*   **2025-06-19** Iranian media explicitly links the threat of closing the Strait to a potential war with the US, framing it as a "legitimate right." — ↑ — Establishes a clear public "red line" and trigger condition, increasing the likelihood of closure if that condition is met.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Direct Military Conflict (Israel/US vs. Iran):** A significant military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities or command structure is the most plausible trigger for a retaliatory closure attempt. This is the primary mechanism. (Size: Large)
2.  **Extreme Economic Desperation:** If US-led sanctions become so effective that the Iranian regime feels its survival is at stake, it might resort to a high-risk/high-reward action like a closure to force negotiations or inflict pain on the global economy. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Miscalculation or Accidental Escalation:** A skirmish in the Gulf between US/allied and Iranian naval forces could rapidly escalate, leading to a temporary de-facto closure as commercial shippers halt voyages out of caution. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **US/Allied Military Deterrence:** The presence and perceived credibility of the US 5th Fleet and other allied naval assets is the primary driver preventing a closure. Iran knows any attempt would be met with overwhelming force. (Size: Large)
5.  **Economic Self-Interest:** Iran relies on the Strait to export its own oil. A closure would be economically suicidal, crippling its primary source of revenue. This is a powerful structural deterrent. (Size: Large)
6.  **International Diplomatic Pressure:** Key oil importers, especially China, would exert immense pressure on Iran to keep the Strait open, as their economies are highly dependent on this traffic. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Lower Resolution Threshold:** The criteria is a *one-day dip* to <10 tankers, not a sustained blockade. This could be triggered by a large-scale military exercise, a mining announcement (even a bluff), or a single major incident that panics the shipping industry, making it more plausible than a true closure.
*   **Elevated Regional Conflict:** The ongoing "Iran-Israel war" (per the prompt) creates a live, high-stakes trigger environment that did not exist for most of the post-1988 period. The risk of a direct strike on Iran is higher than in previous decades.
*   **Advanced Asymmetric Capabilities:** Iran's drone, fast boat swarm, and anti-ship ballistic missile capabilities are significantly more advanced and proven than during the Tanker War, potentially giving them more confidence in their ability to impose a temporary closure.
*   **US Global Posture:** While the US 5th Fleet is a powerful deterrent, US attention and resources are potentially divided by other global priorities, which might affect Iran's risk calculus.
*   **Internal Regime Dynamics:** The Iranian regime is increasingly dominated by hardline factions who may be more ideologically driven and risk-tolerant than previous leaderships.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior, perhaps 5%, derived from the base rate of major chokepoint disruptions, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=20) to reflect the lack of direct historical precedent.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The active Iran-Israel conflict provides a clear and present trigger mechanism that dramatically elevates risk above the historical baseline.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The low-bar resolution criteria (<10 tankers for one day) makes a "Yes" outcome achievable through temporary panic or a limited military action, not just a full-scale war.
    *   ↑ (Small): Recent Iranian threats and increased naval readiness indicate intent and preparation.
    *   ↓ (Large): The fundamental deterrents of economic self-harm and guaranteed overwhelming US military response remain firmly in place and constrain Iranian behavior.
    *   ↓ (Small): Diplomatic pressure from key actors like China provides an additional layer of restraint.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence points to a significant upward revision. The powerful, active trigger (conflict) and lower resolution bar substantially increase the probability from the low historical base rate, even though the core deterrents are still strong. The posterior should move moderately to significantly higher.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Specific intelligence warnings from the US or UK maritime agencies (e.g., UKMTO) about mining or attack threats in the Strait.
    *   Iran conducting large-scale, unannounced naval exercises involving mine-laying or live-fire anti-ship missile tests in or near the main shipping channel.
    *   A direct Israeli or US strike on a high-value target inside Iran (e.g., a nuclear scientist, IRGC general, or facility).
    *   Movement of Iranian anti-ship missile batteries to coastal positions near the Strait.
    *   Major shipping companies (e.g., Maersk, BP) announcing a temporary halt to transits through the Strait.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Public, high-level de-escalatory talks between the US/E3 and Iran.
    *   A significant, verifiable setback or pause in the Iran-Israel conflict.
    *   The US offering or implementing targeted sanctions relief for Iran.
    *   Iran's leadership making public statements emphasizing the importance of regional stability and freedom of navigation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution hinges on a single day's data from one source (IMF Portwatch). A data anomaly, a major non-military accident, or a severe storm could theoretically trigger a "Yes" resolution without a deliberate military closure.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Intelligence regarding Iran's true intentions and capabilities is tightly held. Public threats may be bluffs designed for leverage, and true preparations for an attack would likely be concealed.
*   **Rational Actor Assumption:** The analysis assumes the Iranian regime will not take an action that is clearly suicidal. A cornered, ideologically-driven leadership might not follow this logic, especially if it perceives an existential threat.
*   **Proxy Actions:** A closure could be attempted by an Iranian proxy (e.g., the Houthis, though geographically difficult for Hormuz) to create ambiguity and plausible deniability, complicating the response.
*   **Short Horizon:** With less than three months to resolution, the outcome is highly sensitive to a single triggering event. The situation could change from stable to critical in a matter of hours.

**Final Research Summary:** A deliberate, sustained closure of the Strait remains a low-probability event due to powerful economic and military deterrents. However, the combination of an active regional war, Iran's enhanced capabilities, and a low-bar resolution criterion creates a significantly elevated risk of a temporary disruption that causes tanker traffic to drop below the threshold for a single day before 2026.

To forecast the probability of the Strait of Hormuz being closed before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of major disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz. Since the 1979 revolution, there has been no complete closure, suggesting a very low base rate for such an event. However, given the lower resolution threshold (a single day with fewer than 10 tankers), we can consider a slightly higher base rate. A reasonable prior might be around 5%, reflecting the rarity of such events but acknowledging the lower threshold.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves heightened tensions and military capabilities, similar to past periods of conflict.
   - Differences: The ongoing Iran-Israel conflict and Iran's advanced asymmetric capabilities increase the risk compared to historical norms. The lower resolution threshold also makes a temporary disruption more plausible.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Iran-Israel Conflict**: The active conflict increases the likelihood of a closure attempt. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Iranian Threats and Naval Readiness**: Recent threats and increased readiness suggest intent, increasing the probability. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **US Military Deterrence**: The presence of the US 5th Fleet is a strong deterrent, decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Economic Self-Interest**: Iran's reliance on the Strait for its own exports is a deterrent. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Diplomatic Pressure**: Pressure from key partners like China decreases the probability. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 5% / 95% = 0.0526
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios suggest a moderate increase in probability due to the active conflict and threats, but strong deterrents remain.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (net effect > 1 but < 2)
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds)
   - After updating, the probability might increase to around 15-20%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden escalation or miscalculation.
   - Alternative scenario: A significant military strike could trigger a closure attempt, increasing the probability.
   - Adjustments: Consider the potential for rapid changes in the geopolitical landscape.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for rapid changes, a calibrated probability of the Strait of Hormuz being closed before 2026 is around 18%.

Final: 18%

# Will the Strait of Hormuz be closed before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the Strait of Hormuz having fewer than 10 tankers pass through on at least one day before 2026 (approximately 2 months from now).

Looking at relevant reference classes:
- Historical closures of the Strait of Hormuz: There have been no complete closures since the Iranian Revolution in 1979 (over 45 years), despite multiple periods of high tension.
- Major maritime chokepoint disruptions globally: These occur at a rate of roughly 4-6% per year.
- The specific resolution criteria (fewer than 10 tankers in a single day) is a lower bar than a complete closure.

Given the short timeframe (2 months) and the specific criteria, I'll start with a base rate of approximately 3% for a 2-month period, which would translate to roughly 18% annualized. This reflects the rarity of such events but acknowledges the lower threshold for resolution.

**Prior probability: 3%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The US 5th Fleet remains a powerful deterrent against Iranian action
- Iran still depends economically on the Strait for its own exports
- Major powers like China have strong interests in keeping the Strait open

**Key differences:**
- The ongoing Iran-Israel war creates a heightened risk environment not present in most historical periods
- The resolution criteria only requires one day with fewer than 10 tankers, not a sustained blockade
- Iran has developed more sophisticated asymmetric warfare capabilities (drones, fast boats, missiles)
- Recent explicit threats by Iran to close the Strait as a "legitimate right" if the US enters the conflict
- The short timeframe (2 months) limits the window for an incident to occur

These differences, particularly the active conflict and explicit threats, suggest an upward adjustment to the base rate is warranted.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Ongoing Iran-Israel war**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Almost any scenario where the Strait closes would involve this conflict
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - The conflict could continue without affecting the Strait
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 2: Recent Iranian threats to close the Strait**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Public threats often precede action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Iran has made similar threats in the past without acting
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 3: Increased naval activity and inspections**
- P(E|H): High (~0.7) - Operational preparation would be expected
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Could be posturing or routine operations
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.3
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 4: Strong US military presence and deterrence**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with deterrence, a brief disruption is possible
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Deterrence is a major factor preventing closure
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.56
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 5: Economic self-harm to Iran from closure**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Iran might accept short-term economic pain
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Economic self-interest is a strong deterrent
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- Direction: Decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3% (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32)

First update using Evidence 1 (Iran-Israel war):
- Prior odds: 0.031 (3:97)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 1.8 = 0.056
- Posterior probability: 0.056/(1+0.056) ≈ 5.3%

Second update using Evidence 2 (Iranian threats):
- Prior odds: 0.056
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.056 × 2.0 = 0.112
- Posterior probability: 0.112/(1+0.112) ≈ 10.1%

Third update using Evidence 3 (Increased naval activity):
- Prior odds: 0.112
- Likelihood ratio: 2.3
- Posterior odds: 0.112 × 2.3 = 0.258
- Posterior probability: 0.258/(1+0.258) ≈ 20.5%

Fourth update using Evidence 4 (US deterrence):
- Prior odds: 0.258
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 0.258 × 0.56 = 0.144
- Posterior probability: 0.144/(1+0.144) ≈ 12.6%

Fifth update using Evidence 5 (Economic self-harm):
- Prior odds: 0.144
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.144 × 0.5 = 0.072
- Posterior probability: 0.072/(1+0.072) ≈ 6.7%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 6.7%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk of accidental escalation or miscalculation
- The resolution criteria (fewer than 10 tankers in one day) could be met by non-military factors like severe weather, technical issues with the tracking system, or shipping companies' precautionary measures
- The Manifold market shows a much higher community forecast (24%), suggesting I might be missing something important
- The short timeframe (2 months) might be causing me to underestimate the probability

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A single incident (like a tanker seizure) could cause shipping companies to temporarily halt transits out of caution
- A severe weather event combined with heightened tensions could push the number below the threshold
- Iran might conduct a large-scale naval exercise that effectively blocks the Strait for a day without formally "closing" it

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, particularly the low bar for resolution (just one day below 10 tankers) and the possibility of non-military factors contributing, I should adjust my estimate upward. The community forecast of 24% seems high given the historical rarity, but my 6.7% may be too low given the specific resolution criteria.

I'll adjust my forecast to approximately 15%, which better accounts for these factors while still reflecting the strong deterrents in place.

## 6. Final Forecast

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz drops below 10 ships on any single day in 2025. The most relevant reference class is major disruptions at global maritime chokepoints. Historically, events causing such drastic, albeit potentially brief, drops in traffic are rare.
- **Direct Precedent (Hormuz):** In the ~46 years since the Iranian Revolution, despite periods of intense conflict like the 1984-88 Tanker War, there has been no deliberate closure or disruption that meets this specific criterion. This suggests a historical annual base rate close to 0%.
- **Broader Reference Class (Major Chokepoints):** Major disruptions like the Suez Canal blockages (e.g., 1967, 2021) occur perhaps once every 15-20 years for a given chokepoint. This implies an annual base rate of around 5%. Given that the Strait of Hormuz is the world's most militarized and politically sensitive chokepoint, its baseline risk is likely higher than average.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prior for a severe disruption in any given year of heightened tension might be around **5%**. The question covers the full year 2025, but since it's still open in late October, we are primarily forecasting the remaining ~2 months. However, the base rate should apply to the entire period. Let's set the prior at P(H) = 5%. This translates to prior odds of 5:95, or 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical base case in several critical ways:
- **Active Conflict:** The prompt specifies an ongoing "Iran-Israel war." This is a significant departure from the typical state of "tense but contained" proxy conflicts. A direct state-on-state conflict provides a clear and plausible trigger for an extreme retaliatory action by Iran.
- **Low Resolution Threshold:** The criterion is not a sustained blockade but a single day with fewer than 10 tankers. The normal daily average is close to 100. A >90% reduction for one day is a much lower bar to clear than a full military closure. It could be triggered by a credible threat (e.g., a mine-laying announcement), a single major attack that panics shippers into a 24-hour pause, or a brief but intense military skirmish.
- **Iran's Capabilities:** Iran's asymmetric warfare capabilities (drones, anti-ship missiles, fast attack craft) are more advanced than in the past, potentially increasing their confidence in their ability to impose a temporary disruption.

These differences, particularly the active conflict and low resolution bar, suggest the probability is substantially higher than the historical base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the Strait is closed (per resolution criteria) and ~H be the event that it is not.
- **Evidence 1: Active "Iran-Israel war" and explicit Iranian threats.**
    - P(E1 | H): Very high. A closure is almost certainly a consequence of a major military escalation, which is the definition of this context.
    - P(E1 | ~H): Moderate. A war can exist without Iran resorting to this economically suicidal and militarily risky option.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (LR) > 1:** This evidence strongly increases the probability from the prior. It provides the primary causal mechanism.

- **Evidence 2: Strong Deterrents (US 5th Fleet, Economic Self-Harm).**
    - P(E2 | H): Low. For a closure to happen, Iran would have to decide to act despite knowing it would cripple its own economy and trigger a devastating US military response.
    - P(E2 | ~H): Very high. These deterrents are the primary reason the Strait has remained open for over 40 years.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (LR) << 1:** This evidence strongly decreases the probability. These are powerful, structural constraints on Iranian action.

- **Evidence 3: Chinese Diplomatic Pressure.**
    - P(E3 | H): Low. A closure would mean Iran is directly defying the wishes of its most critical economic and diplomatic partner.
    - P(E3 | ~H): High. China's strong interest in freedom of navigation acts as a significant additional restraint on Iran.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (LR) < 1:** This evidence decreases the probability.

The evidence is conflicting. The active conflict provides a powerful reason *why* a closure might happen, while the structural deterrents provide powerful reasons why it *won't*. The key is the low resolution bar, which makes a temporary, panic-induced "closure" more plausible than a sustained one.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior odds of 1:19 (5% probability).

The combination of an active war and the low resolution bar dramatically increases the risk. This context is the single most important factor. Let's estimate this has a combined Likelihood Ratio of around 4, as it makes a previously unthinkable event plausible.
- **Updated Odds:** (1:19) * 4 = 4:19.
- **Updated Probability:** 4 / (4 + 19) = 4 / 23 ≈ 17.4%.

This update accounts for the main drivers increasing the risk. The specific evidence points (US deployments, Chinese statements) are largely reaffirmations of the long-standing structural deterrents, which are already baked into the low prior and the counter-arguments. The Iranian threats and naval activity are consistent with the heightened tensions of the war.

A causal model approach can refine this:
- **Path A: Deliberate closure attempt.** This would likely follow a major Israeli/US strike on Iran. Let's estimate P(Major Strike in next 2 months) = 20%. If a strike occurs, Iran might retaliate with a temporary closure, despite the risks. Let's say P(Closure | Strike) = 40%. This path's probability is 0.20 * 0.40 = 8%.
- **Path B: Major harassment incident.** Iran could seize multiple ships or stage a missile test near the shipping lane, causing a 24-hour pause in traffic. This is less risky than a formal closure. Given the tensions, let's assign a 7% probability to this path.
- **Path C: Accidental escalation/other.** A skirmish gets out of hand, or a non-military event (major accident, data error) triggers the criteria. Let's assign a 2% probability to these tails.

Summing these largely distinct paths: 8% + 7% + 2% = **17%**. This posterior probability seems to correctly balance the unprecedented risk from the active conflict against the powerful, enduring deterrents.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 17% is significantly higher than a simple historical base rate would suggest. Could this be too high? Yes, if I am overestimating the Iranian regime's risk tolerance. The economic and military consequences of even a temporary closure are immense, and these deterrents have held for decades. The threats could be pure bluff, and the "war" could be a series of contained, tit-for-tat actions that never reach the threshold for such a drastic response.

Could the forecast be too low? Yes. The Manifold market for a similar question is at 24%, though for a longer timeframe. My analysis assumes a degree of rationality from the Iranian regime. If the leadership feels its survival is existentially threatened by a military strike, it might lash out irrationally, viewing the closure as a final, defiant act. I may also be underestimating the probability of a major Israeli/US strike in the near term. The low resolution bar is a major vulnerability; a single, well-coordinated harassment operation or even a credible bluff could be enough to trigger a "Yes".

On balance, the 17% figure feels like a reasonable synthesis. It acknowledges that closure remains an unlikely event (odds of roughly 1 to 5 against), but the unique combination of an active war and a low resolution bar makes it a very real possibility in the short term.

### 6. Final Forecast
The final forecast is based on a synthesis of the historical base rate, the current geopolitical context, and an evaluation of the key drivers and deterrents. The active "Iran-Israel war" and the low resolution threshold (<10 tankers for one day) are the primary factors elevating the risk far above the historical norm. However, powerful military and economic deterrents, including pressure from China, still make a closure an unlikely event. A causal model considering different pathways (deliberate retaliation, harassment-induced pause, accident) leads to a cumulative probability in the mid-to-high teens.

Final: 17%
