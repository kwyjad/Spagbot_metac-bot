Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Resolution Criteria & Baseline Traffic:** What does "less than 10 tanker ships passing through... on a single day" mean in practice? What is the normal daily volume of tanker traffic? What could cause such a drop besides a deliberate military closure (e.g., accidents, weather, temporary security alerts)?
2.  **Historical Precedent (Base Rate):** Has the Strait of Hormuz ever been closed or severely disrupted to this degree before? What were the circumstances during past periods of high tension (e.g., Iran-Iraq War's "Tanker War," 2019 tanker seizures)?
3.  **Current Geopolitical Context (Recency):** What is the current state of the Iran-US-Israel conflict as of late 2025? How credible and immediate are the threats mentioned in the provided sources? What is the status of the "maximum pressure" campaign?
4.  **Causal Mechanisms (Drivers):** What are the primary triggers that would lead Iran to take such a drastic step? What are the main constraints preventing them? This involves analyzing the strategic calculus: economic costs vs. political gains, domestic pressures, and the perceived risk of retaliation.
5.  **Military & Technical Feasibility:** Can Iran physically enforce a closure for at least a day? What are the specific capabilities (mines, fast boats, missiles)? How quickly could the US and its allies counter such an action?
6.  **Key Actors & Their Stances:** What are the current positions of other relevant actors, particularly China (Iran's main oil customer), Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE? How would they react?

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Baseline Traffic:** Normal tanker traffic is substantial, typically 40-50 tankers per day. A drop to below 10 would represent a >75% reduction and would be an unambiguous, major disruption. It is highly unlikely to occur due to weather or a standard accident; it would require a state-level action or a catastrophic event.
*   **Historical Precedent:** The Strait has *never* been fully closed by Iran. Even during the 1980s Tanker War, when hundreds of ships were attacked, the flow of oil was never halted completely. There have been temporary seizures and harassment (e.g., 2019), but not a single-day traffic collapse to the level required by the resolution criteria. The base rate for this specific event is effectively zero.
*   **Current Context:** The provided (hypothetical) sources establish a high-tension environment for late 2025. A reinstated US "maximum pressure" campaign, combined with an ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, creates a plausible backdrop for escalation. Iranian threats are perennial but gain credibility when linked to specific, painful sanctions enforcement.
*   **Mechanisms:** Iran's primary motivation would be desperation—retaliation for a direct military strike (especially on its nuclear program) or a response to a US-led action that successfully cripples its oil exports and threatens regime stability. The main constraint is self-preservation; a closure is a *casus belli* for the US and would devastate Iran's own economy and alienate its primary customer, China. It is a "suicide vest" strategy.
*   **Military Feasibility:** Iran can likely achieve a short-term closure (<48 hours) using a combination of mines, swarming fast-attack craft, and anti-ship missiles. However, sustaining it against a determined US Navy response is not feasible. The US 5th Fleet and allied assets would likely reopen the strait within days to weeks, but at a high cost and with significant risk of regional war. A single-day disruption is therefore militarily plausible.

### **Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Deliberate State-Level Closure of a Major Maritime Chokepoint:** This class includes events like the Suez Crisis of 1956. The base rate is extremely low. In the 45+ year history of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Strait of Hormuz has never been deliberately closed. **Base Rate: <0.5% per year of high tension.**
2.  **Severe, State-Sponsored Disruption in the Strait of Hormuz:** This class includes events like the 2019 tanker seizures and harassment campaigns. These actions disrupted traffic and raised insurance rates but did not cause traffic to fall below the resolution threshold (<10 tankers/day). The base rate for a disruption of that magnitude is effectively zero, but near-misses suggest a non-zero tail risk. **Base Rate (for a single-day >75% traffic drop): <1% per year of high tension.**
3.  **Major Escalatory Military Incidents in the Persian Gulf:** This class includes events like Operation Praying Mantis (1988) or the downing of Iran Air 655. These events occur rarely, perhaps once every 5-10 years during periods of hostility. A closure could be a direct result of such an incident. **Base Rate: 10-20% chance per year of high tension.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-08** Iranian officials threaten Hormuz closure in response to US sanctions enforcement. (↑) — Standard rhetoric, but timing links it directly to the renewed "maximum pressure" campaign, increasing its salience.
*   **2025-07-09** Analysis highlights severe global economic costs of a potential closure. (↓) — Reinforces the powerful deterrents against closure, as it would alienate key customers like China and trigger a massive international response.
*   **2025-06-19** Reports detail Iran's asymmetric capabilities to enforce a blockade. (↑) — Affirms the military feasibility of a short-term closure, making the threat more credible than if it were a pure bluff.
*   **2025-06-16** EIA data shows oil flows remained stable through Q1 2025 despite regional conflict. (↓) — Demonstrates that the current "Iran-Israel war" has not yet spilled over into maritime transit, suggesting a degree of containment.
*   **2025-02-XX** US President Trump reinstates "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. (↑) — This is the primary background driver, creating the economic desperation and political pressure on Tehran that makes extreme actions more likely.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **US/Israeli Military Action:** A direct strike on Iran (especially its nuclear facilities) is the most likely trigger for a retaliatory closure. Iran would feel compelled to respond forcefully. (Large impact)
2.  **Economic Strangulation:** If the US "maximum pressure" campaign successfully reduces Iranian oil exports to near-zero, the regime may feel it has nothing left to lose, making the economic self-deterrent moot. (Large impact)
3.  **Miscalculation/Accidental Escalation:** A clash between IRGC and US naval vessels in the crowded Gulf could quickly spiral out of control, leading to a temporary "no-sail" zone or de facto closure. (Moderate impact)
4.  **Iranian Domestic Politics:** Hardliners in the IRGC may push for a confrontation to consolidate power or rally the public, viewing a limited closure as a show of strength. (Moderate impact)
5.  **Third-Party Restraint (China):** China, as Iran's primary economic lifeline and oil customer, has a powerful incentive to prevent a closure. Chinese diplomatic pressure is a significant, though not absolute, constraint. (Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **US Policy Posture:** The hypothetical reinstatement of a "maximum pressure"

To forecast the probability of the Strait of Hormuz being closed before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for Deliberate Closure:** Historically, the Strait of Hormuz has never been deliberately closed by Iran, even during periods of high tension like the Iran-Iraq War. The base rate for a deliberate closure is extremely low, less than 0.5% per year during high tension.
- **Base Rate for Severe Disruption:** While there have been disruptions, such as tanker seizures, these have not resulted in traffic falling below the threshold of fewer than 10 tankers per day. The base rate for such a severe disruption is effectively zero, but considering near-misses, a non-zero tail risk exists, estimated at less than 1% per year.
- **Base Rate for Major Escalatory Incidents:** These occur rarely, perhaps once every 5-10 years during periods of hostility, with a base rate of 10-20% per year of high tension.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current geopolitical context is similar to past periods of high tension, with ongoing conflicts and threats from Iran.
- **Difference:** The reinstatement of the US "maximum pressure" campaign and the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict create a more volatile environment, potentially increasing the likelihood of extreme actions by Iran.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Iranian Threats (↑):** Recent threats to close the Strait in response to US sanctions increase the probability, as they indicate a willingness to consider such actions.
- **Military Feasibility (↑):** Iran's asymmetric capabilities make a short-term closure militarily feasible, increasing the likelihood.
- **Economic Deterrents (↓):** The severe global economic costs and potential alienation of key partners like China act as strong deterrents, decreasing the probability.
- **Historical Stability (↓):** The stability of oil flows through the Strait despite regional conflicts suggests a degree of containment, decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Assume a base rate of 1% for a severe disruption leading to closure.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood of closure given the current context is higher than the base rate, but still constrained by significant deterrents.
- **Posterior Probability:** Adjusting the prior with the evidence, the probability of closure increases but remains low due to strong deterrents and historical stability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of miscalculation or accidental escalation leading to closure.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider scenarios where Iran's desperation or miscalculation leads to closure despite deterrents.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, slightly increase the probability to account for tail risks.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability of the Strait of Hormuz being closed before 2026 is estimated at 5%.

Final: 5%

# Will the Strait of Hormuz be closed before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, defined as fewer than 10 tanker ships passing through on a single day.

The most relevant reference class is "deliberate closures or severe disruptions of the Strait of Hormuz." Looking at historical data:
- The Strait has never been fully closed since the formation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979
- Even during the height of the Iran-Iraq "Tanker War" in the 1980s, when hundreds of ships were attacked, traffic never dropped below the threshold specified in this question
- Previous Iranian threats to close the strait (2008, 2012, 2019) never materialized into action

Given this historical record spanning over 40+ years, the annual base rate for such an event is extremely low, effectively 0%. However, since we're dealing with a rare event possibility, I'll use a conservative estimate of 0.5% per year during normal conditions.

The question asks about closure before 2026, which gives approximately 2 months from the current date (October 23, 2025). This translates to a prior probability of:
- 0.5% × (2/12) = 0.083% for normal conditions

However, we're clearly not in normal conditions given the background information about an ongoing Iran-Israel war and explicit Iranian threats. For periods of heightened tension, I'll use a more conservative base rate of 2% per year, which gives:
- 2% × (2/12) = 0.33% for the remaining period in 2025

**Prior probability: 0.33%** (or odds of 1:302)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran has historically used threats to close the strait as strategic signaling without following through
- The economic self-deterrent remains powerful (Iran would harm its own economy significantly)
- International opposition to closure would be overwhelming, including from Iran's allies

**Differences from base case:**
- The background describes an active "Iran-Israel war," which is a significant escalation from previous tensions
- Explicit Iranian threats specifically mentioning closure as a "legitimate right" if America enters the conflict
- The mention of a potential US "maximum pressure" campaign suggests severe economic pressure on Iran
- Iran has reportedly developed enhanced military capabilities including drone carriers and asymmetric warfare tactics

These differences suggest a significantly higher risk than the historical base rate, as the current situation represents one of the most severe escalations in the region's history.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Active Iran-Israel war**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - A closure would almost certainly occur during a major regional conflict
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.2) - Many regional conflicts don't lead to strait closure
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This significantly increases the probability of closure

**Evidence 2: Explicit Iranian threats about closing the strait**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Public threats would likely precede actual closure
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Iran has made similar threats in the past without action
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Enhanced Iranian military capabilities**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - Iran would need these capabilities to attempt closure
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Iran develops these capabilities regardless for deterrence
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: US Fifth Fleet presence in Bahrain**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Closure might still be attempted despite US presence
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - US naval presence is a strong deterrent
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.56
- This decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Economic self-harm to Iran**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Iran would only close the strait if desperate
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.95) - Economic self-preservation is a powerful restraint
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.32
- This significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:302 (0.33%), I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (Iran-Israel war):**
- Prior odds: 1:302
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5
- Posterior odds: 4.5:302 = 1:67
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+67) ≈ 1.47%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Explicit threats):**
- Prior odds: 1:67
- Likelihood ratio: 2.7
- Posterior odds: 2.7:67 = 1:24.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+24.8) ≈ 3.87%

**Update on Evidence 5 (Economic self-harm):**
- Prior odds: 1:24.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.32
- Posterior odds: 0.32:24.8 = 1:77.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+77.5) ≈ 1.27%

After incorporating the remaining evidence factors, I arrive at a posterior probability of approximately 2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the desperation of the Iranian regime if facing existential threats
- The short timeframe (2 months) might make me too dismissive of tail risks
- I might be overestimating the rationality of all actors involved

**Alternative scenarios:**
- An accidental escalation could occur (e.g., misidentification of vessels leading to exchanges of fire)
- A third party could conduct a false flag operation to provoke conflict
- A limited, symbolic one-day closure might be seen as a viable option by Iran to demonstrate resolve without triggering full-scale war

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more hawkish forecast might argue for 10-15% probability, citing:
- The unprecedented nature of the current Iran-Israel conflict
- Potential for miscalculation in a crowded maritime environment
- Iran's enhanced capabilities making a short-term closure more feasible
- The possibility that Iran might calculate a brief closure as worth the risk

**Rebuttal:**
While these concerns are valid, they don't overcome the fundamental strategic calculus that has prevented closure for decades:
- Iran knows closure would trigger overwhelming military response
- China (Iran's main oil customer) would strongly oppose such action
- Even in desperate circumstances, Iran has other retaliatory options that don't risk regime survival

However, I should adjust my estimate slightly upward to account for these tail risks.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence, historical precedents, and potential blind spots, I believe there is a small but non-negligible chance that the Strait of Hormuz could be closed before 2026. The combination of an active Iran-Israel war, explicit threats, and enhanced Iranian capabilities creates a situation with elevated risk compared to historical norms.

However, powerful deterrents remain in place: the presence of the US Fifth Fleet, the economic self-harm Iran would suffer, and international opposition (including from Iran's allies). These factors make closure unlikely even in the current tense environment.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Event Definition:** The event is a "closure" of the Strait of Hormuz, defined as fewer than 10 tanker ships passing through on any single day before the end of 2025. Normal daily traffic is around 40-50 tankers, so this represents a greater than 75% reduction in traffic.
*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is the history of the Strait of Hormuz since the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, a period of over 45 years marked by frequent hostility with the US and regional rivals.
*   **Base Rate Calculation:** In this 45+ year period, despite numerous crises including the Iran-Iraq War's "Tanker War," direct US-Iran naval clashes (Operation Praying Mantis, 1988), and the 2019-2020 "maximum pressure" campaign, the Strait has never been closed to this extent. The historical frequency is zero.
*   **Prior Selection:** A simple base rate of 0% is unhelpful. We must account for the fact that the question specifies a period of exceptionally high tension. Let's establish a base rate for a "year of crisis." Out of the last 45 years, perhaps 10 could be considered crisis years. With zero occurrences in 10 trials, a reasonable prior using a method like Laplace's rule would be low, but not zero. I will select a conservative prior probability of **2%** for this event occurring in the remaining ~2.2 months of 2025. This acknowledges the historical rarity while accounting for the prompt's high-stakes environment. In odds, this is 2:98 or 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation resembles past crises (e.g., 2019) where Iran faced severe US sanctions and responded with maritime harassment and threats to close the Strait. The rhetoric is familiar.
*   **Differences:** The hypothetical 2025 scenario is significantly more severe than historical precedents.
    1.  **Direct Iran-Israel War:** The prompt posits an ongoing, overt war between Iran and Israel. This is a major escalation from the historical norm of proxy conflicts and "shadow wars." A direct war creates immense pressure for unconventional and high-impact retaliation.
    2.  **Renewed "Maximum Pressure":** The context includes a reinstated and potentially more effective US "maximum pressure" campaign. If this campaign successfully cripples Iran's ability to export oil, it could push the regime into a corner where it feels it has little to lose by disrupting global supply.
    
These differences suggest the risk is substantially higher than in past crises.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that the Strait is closed, and ~H be the hypothesis that it is not.

*   **Evidence 1: Ongoing Iran-Israel War & Renewed US Maximum Pressure Campaign.**
    *   **P(E | H):** High. A closure is an extreme act of desperation or retaliation. It is far more likely to occur under the intense, combined military and economic pressure of a direct war and crippling sanctions than under normal circumstances. These conditions are the most plausible triggers for such an action.
    *   **P(E | ~H):** Moderate. Iran has weathered sanctions before and may keep the conflict with Israel contained to other domains (e.g., proxy fronts, cyber). The regime's primary goal is survival, and closing the Strait is a suicidal act that guarantees a massive US military response. Therefore, it's plausible these conditions exist and Iran still refrains from closing the Strait.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability of a closure.

*   **Evidence 2: Strong International Deterrents (Economic Self-Harm, Chinese Opposition).**
    *   **P(E | H):** Low. For Iran to close the Strait, it would have to ignore the certainty of devastating its own economy and alienating its most crucial economic partner, China. This would only happen in the most extreme, existential circumstances.
    *   **P(E | ~H):** Very High. The fact that the Strait remains open is best explained by these powerful deterrents. Iran's leadership, while aggressive, has historically stopped short of actions that would guarantee regime-ending consequences.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly less than 1. This is the most powerful evidence *against* a closure and is the primary reason the base rate is so low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:49 (2% probability).
2.  **Update for Escalatory Triggers:** The combination of a direct war with Israel and a new "maximum pressure" campaign makes this period uniquely dangerous. This is not a typical crisis. This evidence dramatically increases the likelihood of an extreme outcome. Let's apply a strong likelihood ratio of 4x to reflect this.
    *   *Intermediate Odds* = Prior Odds × LR = (1:49) × 4 = 4:49.
    *   *Intermediate Probability* = 4 / (4 + 49) = 4/53 ≈ 7.5%.
3.  **Consider the Deterrents:** The deterrents (self-harm, US response, China) are immense and are the reason this has never happened. However, our prior already reflects this historical reality. The key question is whether the new triggers are strong enough to *override* these deterrents. The 7.5% figure reflects the new tension, but it might not fully account for the possibility of accidental escalation.

My analysis suggests a probability of around 4-5% based on a deliberate decision. The Manifold market on a similar question with a longer time horizon implies a monthly risk rate that would yield about 4.3% for the period in question, corroborating this range.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis primarily focuses on a deliberate, strategic decision by Iran's leadership. I may be underestimating the probability of an **accidental or unintentional closure**.

*   **Alternative Scenario:** In a high-tension environment with an ongoing regional war, a naval skirmish between the IRGC and the US Navy could escalate rapidly. Such a clash could lead to a de-facto, temporary closure for a day or more as both sides establish exclusion zones and shipping companies halt traffic due to the immediate danger. This does not require a strategic decision from Tehran to "close the Strait" but would still meet the resolution criteria.
*   **Impact on Forecast:** This "accidental escalation" pathway is a significant additional source of risk. Given the specified context, the probability of such a naval clash escalating to a 24-hour traffic stoppage is non-trivial. I will add approximately 2 percentage points to my estimate to account for this pathway.
*   **Final Adjustment:** My initial estimate of ~4% (from deliberate action) plus ~2% (from accidental escalation) leads to a final forecast of 6%. This balances the unprecedented historical rarity of the event against the uniquely dangerous hypothetical conditions and the possibility of miscalculation.

### 6. Final Forecast

The probability is low, as the deterrents against a deliberate closure are enormous. However, the specified context of a direct Iran-Israel war and a renewed "maximum pressure" campaign creates a uniquely volatile environment where historical precedents are less reliable. The primary risks stem from either an act of desperation by a cornered Iranian regime or an accidental military escalation in the crowded Gulf that spirals out of control. The short time frame (until Dec 31, 2025) keeps the probability in the single digits.

Final: 6%
