### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Martial Law Declarations in the Philippines (Post-WWII):** There have been four declarations in the ~79 years since independence (1946): 1972 (nationwide, by Marcos Sr.), 2009 (in Maguindanao province), and 2017 (in Mindanao). This suggests a rough base rate of ~5% per year for a martial law declaration *somewhere* in the country. However, only one was nationwide, and the regional ones were responses to specific, localized events (a massacre and an ISIS-affiliated siege), not broad political rivalry.
2.  **Years with >1,000 Conflict-Related Deaths:** Using the provided Our World in Data chart (up to 2022), the Philippines has exceeded 1,000 conflict-related deaths in approximately 10 of the 34 years shown (1989-2022), a base rate of ~29%. However, these deaths are overwhelmingly from long-running insurgencies (Communist, Moro separatist) concentrated in the south, not from short-term, politically-driven civil unrest in response to a specific event like an arrest. The threshold has not been met in the last decade.
3.  **Years with >5,000 Politically-Motivated Arrests:** This is a difficult base rate to establish. The only clear historical analogue is the initial period of Marcos Sr.'s 1972 martial law, where tens of thousands were arrested over several years. This was a systematic, nationwide consolidation of power. Such an event has occurred once, suggesting a very low base rate (<2% per year).

**Combined Base Rate:** The base rate for any of these specific conditions being met in a given year is low, likely in the **5-10% range**. The triggers are rare, and the thresholds are high.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-24** ICC rejects jurisdiction challenge in Duterte case. — ↑ — This solidifies the legal threat to Duterte, removing off-ramps and making a trial almost certain. It forces the hands of his supporters and political allies, increasing pressure for extra-legal action.
*   **2025-06-02** VP Sara Duterte expresses "trust" in ICC but alleges witness tampering. — ↑ (small) — This is a dual message. While feigning respect for the process, she is simultaneously seeding doubt and delegitimizing it for her base, keeping tensions simmering without overtly calling for unrest.
*   **2025-05-12** Reports highlight the Marcos-Duterte rivalry ahead of 2025 midterms. — ↑ — Confirms the political schism is the central dynamic. The arrest of Rodrigo Duterte transforms this political rivalry into a potentially existential conflict for the Duterte dynasty, raising the stakes.
*   **2025-03-11** Former President Rodrigo Duterte is arrested and sent to the ICC. — ↑ (large) — This is the primary catalyst for the entire scenario, a direct and profound challenge to a popular and powerful political figure and his base, creating a strong potential for a backlash.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Duterte Loyalist Mobilization:** Rodrigo Duterte maintains a large, fervent base of support, particularly in his home region of Mindanao. His arrest is seen as a political persecution. Large-scale, sustained protests led by loyalists could escalate into violent clashes with security forces, potentially meeting the death or arrest thresholds. (Size: Large)
2.  **Marcos Government Overreaction/Preemption:** President Marcos, conscious of his father's playbook and facing a direct challenge to his authority, may use any significant protest as a pretext to declare martial law to consolidate power, neutralize the Duterte faction, and ensure stability ahead of the midterms. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Elite Factionalism & Military Loyalty:** The core of the issue is a struggle between two powerful political dynasties. A critical uncertainty is the loyalty of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP). If a significant faction sides with the Dutertes or is perceived to be wavering, it could embolden protesters or trigger a pre-emptive crackdown from Marcos. A split in the security sector is a classic path to civil conflict. (Size: Large)
4.  **Sara Duterte's Political Calculus:** As Vice President and Rodrigo's daughter, her actions are pivotal. She could either try to de-escalate the situation to preserve her own political future for the 2028 presidential election or use the "martyrdom" of her father to foment unrest and weaken Marcos, hoping to benefit from the chaos. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Trigger:** Unlike past martial law declarations triggered by insurgencies or massacres, the current situation is driven by the international prosecution of a popular former president. This is a novel and highly inflammatory catalyst.
*   **Rivalry at the Apex of Power:** The President and Vice President are now openly hostile rivals. This is a fundamentally unstable political structure not present during previous crises, creating a direct pathway for elite conflict to spill into the streets.
*   **Geographic Concentration of Loyalty:** The flashpoint is not a peripheral insurgency but the political heartland of a former president (Mindanao/Davao), creating a clear geographic and political fault line.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in less than two months. This dramatically compresses the timeline for events to unfold. A slow-burning crisis will resolve "No"; only a rapid, explosive escalation can resolve "Yes".

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior, perhaps 5-10%, reflecting the historical rarity of events meeting these high thresholds. The "equivalent n" is low, as the historical record contains few directly comparable events.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Duterte's arrest and the ICC's confirmation of its jurisdiction create a powerful, unprecedented grievance and a point of no return.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The confirmed collapse of the Marcos-Duterte "UniTeam" provides the political structure for elite conflict, turning a legal issue into a dynastic power struggle.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The very short time remaining until resolution (less than 2 months) works against a "Yes". Major unrest and martial law declarations often have a longer build-up. We have not yet seen reports of mass mobilization that would be a prerequisite.
    *   ↑ (Small): Sara Duterte's ambiguous rhetoric keeps the potential for escalation alive, signaling to her base that the fight is not over.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability up from the low base rate. The primary catalyst is exceptionally potent. However, the short timeline is a powerful constraint. The posterior should be significantly higher than the prior, but likely remains below 50% due to the high bar for resolution and the limited time for escalation.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Sustained, large-scale protests (tens of thousands) in Davao City or other parts of Mindanao.
    *   Calls for Mindanao secession from prominent Duterte-allied politicians.
    *   Reports of significant movements or defections within the AFP or PNP.
    *   VP Sara Duterte makes increasingly inflammatory speeches, directly accusing Marcos of political persecution.
    *   Any violent clashes between protesters and police resulting in multiple casualties.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Protests remain small, localized, and peaceful, or they dissipate.
    *   VP Sara Duterte pivots her messaging to focus on the 2028 election, framing the battle in purely political/electoral terms.
    *   Key military leaders issue strong, unified statements of support for the Marcos administration and the constitutional order.
    *   The government successfully de-escalates tensions through negotiation or by ignoring protests.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Thresholds are High:** The question requires 1,000 deaths or 5,000 arrests. The Philippines could experience significant, widely reported political turmoil that still falls short of these specific, high numerical bars.
*   **Information Lag/Fog of Crisis:** Reliable, verified reporting on casualty and arrest numbers during a rapidly unfolding crisis is notoriously difficult. Initial reports are often conflicting or exaggerated.
*   **Definition of "Martial Law":** While a formal declaration is clear, Marcos could implement martial law-like powers under a different name (e.g., "State of National Emergency"), which might create ambiguity in resolution.
*   **Unknown Military Loyalty:** The true allegiance of military and police commanders is a critical unknown. Public statements of loyalty may not reflect private intentions, creating a risk of a sudden, unexpected shift.
*   **Fictional Premise:** The analysis is based on the provided fictional background. Real-world dynamics could differ significantly.

**Final Research Summary:** The arrest of a popular former president has created a uniquely volatile situation, pitting two powerful political dynasties against each other. While the potential for explosive unrest is significantly higher than the historical base rate, the very high thresholds for resolution and the extremely short time horizon (<2 months) act as powerful constraints against a "Yes" resolution.

To forecast the probability of major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Martial Law Declarations:** Historically, martial law has been declared four times in the Philippines since 1946, suggesting a base rate of ~5% per year for some form of martial law declaration. However, only one was nationwide, and the others were localized.
- **Conflict-Related Deaths:** The Philippines has exceeded 1,000 conflict-related deaths in about 29% of the years from 1989 to 2022, but these were mostly due to long-standing insurgencies, not sudden political unrest.
- **Politically-Motivated Arrests:** The base rate for mass arrests similar to those during Marcos Sr.'s martial law is very low, likely <2% per year.
- **Combined Base Rate:** Given the rarity and high thresholds for these events, a combined base rate of 5-10% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves political tension and potential for unrest, similar to past periods of instability.
- **Differences:** The arrest of a former president by an international body is unprecedented, and the political rivalry at the highest levels is more pronounced than in past crises.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Duterte's Arrest and ICC Jurisdiction:** This is a significant catalyst, increasing the likelihood of unrest. The likelihood ratio is high because such an event is more probable if unrest is to occur.
- **Marcos-Duterte Rivalry:** The political schism increases the probability of unrest, as it creates a direct conflict between powerful factions.
- **Short Time Horizon:** The limited time until the question resolves decreases the likelihood of meeting the high thresholds for unrest or martial law.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** Start with a base rate of 5-10%.
- **Evidence Impact:** The arrest and political rivalry increase the probability, but the short timeline is a significant constraint.
- **Posterior Probability Calculation:** Given the strong evidence for unrest but the short time frame, the posterior probability should be higher than the prior but still below 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The high thresholds for resolution and short timeline suggest caution against overestimating the probability.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of de-escalation or a focus on future elections by key players, which could reduce the likelihood of unrest.
- **Adjustments:** Given these considerations, the probability should reflect the potential for unrest but acknowledge the constraints.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and constraints, the probability of major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025 is estimated to be 30%.

Final: 30%

# Will there be major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines. Looking at the historical record:

- Martial law has been declared 4 times in Philippine history (1944, 1972, 2009, 2017)
- Since independence in 1946 (79 years), this gives a rough annual probability of ~5% for martial law
- For major civil unrest with 1,000+ deaths, the data shows this threshold was met in approximately 10 of 34 years (1989-2022), or ~29%
- For mass arrests (5,000+), this has happened rarely, primarily during Marcos Sr.'s martial law period

Given the high thresholds in the resolution criteria and the specific political context, I'll set a base rate of 8% - slightly higher than the martial law frequency but recognizing the rarity of events meeting these specific thresholds.

**Prior probability: 8%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Philippines has a history of political instability and regional conflicts
- There are established fault lines between political dynasties (similar to historical power struggles)
- Mindanao remains a potential flashpoint for unrest

**Key differences:**
- The arrest of a former president by an international court is unprecedented
- The current situation features direct rivalry between the President and Vice President from opposing political dynasties
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than 2 months remain in 2025)
- The trigger is not a regional insurgency but a high-profile political arrest with national implications
- Duterte maintains strong support in Mindanao, creating a geographic concentration of potential resistance

These differences significantly increase the potential for unrest compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Arrest of Rodrigo Duterte (March 11, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If major unrest/martial law occurs, the arrest would almost certainly be the primary catalyst
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.2) - Even without major unrest, this arrest could still have occurred
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5
- This evidence substantially increases the probability

**Evidence 2: ICC rejection of jurisdiction challenge (October 24, 2025)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - This removes legal off-ramps and increases pressure for extra-legal action
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This could occur without triggering major unrest
- Likelihood ratio: ~2
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Short time remaining in 2025 (less than 2 months)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Major unrest meeting the thresholds typically requires more time to develop
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - The compressed timeline makes it more likely events won't reach the thresholds
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: VP Sara Duterte's ambiguous rhetoric**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Her messaging keeps tensions simmering
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This rhetoric could occur without major unrest
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4
- This slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 8:92 (0.08/(1-0.08) ≈ 0.087)

First update (Duterte's arrest):
- Posterior odds = 0.087 × 4.5 ≈ 0.39
- Posterior probability = 0.39/(1+0.39) ≈ 28%

Second update (ICC rejection):
- Posterior odds = 0.39 × 2 ≈ 0.78
- Posterior probability = 0.78/(1+0.78) ≈ 44%

Third update (Short timeline):
- Posterior odds = 0.78 × 0.375 ≈ 0.29
- Posterior probability = 0.29/(1+0.29) ≈ 23%

Fourth update (Sara Duterte's rhetoric):
- Posterior odds = 0.29 × 1.4 ≈ 0.41
- Posterior probability = 0.41/(1+0.41) ≈ 29%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating how quickly unrest can escalate in the Philippines given the right catalyst
- The loyalty of military and police forces is a critical unknown that could dramatically shift outcomes
- Social media could accelerate mobilization beyond historical patterns
- The resolution criteria are high thresholds, but the Duterte arrest is an unprecedented trigger

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view might place the probability at 40-50%, arguing that:
- The Duterte family commands intense loyalty, especially in Mindanao
- The ICC case creates a powerful narrative of foreign interference
- The Marcos-Duterte rivalry creates structural conditions for rapid escalation

**Rebuttal:**
- Despite the catalyst, organizing protests that reach the death/arrest thresholds requires time
- The Marcos administration has strong institutional control and international support
- Sara Duterte may calculate that her political future is better served by avoiding extreme unrest

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 31%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question resolves "Yes" if any of three conditions are met: martial law, 1,000+ conflict deaths, or 5,000+ conflict-related arrests in 2025. I will establish a base rate for any of these occurring in a typical year.

*   **Martial Law:** Since Philippine independence in 1946 (~79 years), there have been three distinct declarations of martial law (1972, 2009, 2017). This gives a historical frequency of 3/79, or approximately **3.8% per year**.
*   **1,000+ Deaths:** The provided data (1989-2022) shows this threshold was met in 10 of 34 years (~29%). However, this was driven by older, more intense phases of long-running insurgencies. In the last decade of available data (2013-2022), this threshold was never met. A base rate reflecting the more recent, less intense environment would be very low, perhaps **2-3%**.
*   **5,000+ Arrests:** This is characteristic of a major nationwide crackdown, with the primary precedent being the 1972 martial law period. This is a very rare event, with a base rate of **<2% per year**.

These events are correlated. A declaration of martial law is often accompanied by mass arrests. Therefore, we cannot simply add the probabilities. The most frequent trigger in the reference class is a martial law declaration. I will set a combined base rate for any of these events occurring in a given year at **5%**. This reflects the historical rarity of events meeting these high thresholds.

Prior Probability P(H) = 5%.
Prior Odds = 0.05 / 0.95 ≈ 1-to-19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The Philippines has a history of political volatility, powerful dynasties, and the use of emergency powers. The potential for conflict is an established feature of its political landscape.
*   **Differences:** The current situation is fundamentally different from the historical precedents for martial law or high casualty counts.
    1.  **The Trigger:** Past events were triggered by long-running insurgencies (Marawi siege) or a massacre by a local clan (Maguindanao). The current trigger is the arrest and international prosecution of a highly popular former president. This is an unprecedented and direct challenge to a massive political faction.
    2.  **Elite Conflict:** The crisis pits the sitting President (Marcos) against the sitting Vice President (Sara Duterte, the former president's daughter). This creates a schism at the highest level of government, making the state's response less predictable and increasing the risk of miscalculation.

These differences suggest the situation is far more volatile than a typical year, meaning the probability should be significantly higher than the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their impact on the initial 5% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The Arrest of Rodrigo Duterte and ICC Jurisdiction Confirmation.**
    *   This is the primary catalyst. It creates a powerful grievance for a large and fervent political base, particularly in Mindanao. It transforms a political rivalry into an existential struggle for the Duterte dynasty.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: This evidence is much more likely if major unrest is to occur (P(E|H) is high) than if it is not (P(E|~H) is lower). This is a highly potent trigger for instability. This evidence **strongly increases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The Passage of Time.**
    *   The forecast date is November 3, 2025. The arrest occurred in March, nearly eight months prior. The ICC confirmation was on October 24, over a week ago. Despite these major triggers, widespread unrest meeting the high resolution thresholds has not yet materialized.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: The fact that ~85% of the year has passed without the event is strong evidence that the system is more resilient or the response less violent than one might have feared. It is much more likely that 8 months would pass quietly if the event is *not* going to happen (P(E|~H) is high) than if it *is* going to happen (P(E|H) is low). This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability of the event occurring in the remaining <2 months.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's update our 5% prior (1-to-19 odds) with this conflicting evidence.

1.  **Initial Prior:** P(H) = 5% (Odds ≈ 0.053)
2.  **Update for Trigger:** The unprecedented nature of the trigger (arrest of a popular ex-president) makes this year far riskier than the base rate suggests. Let's estimate this increases the odds by a factor of 5.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.053 * 5 = 0.265
    *   Posterior Probability = 0.265 / 1.265 ≈ 21%.
    *   This 21% represents a reasonable forecast for the *entire year* as of March 2025.

3.  **Update for Time Decay:** Now, we must account for the fact that we are in November and the event has not happened. The initial shock has passed. The risk is now concentrated in the final two months. This lack of an earlier explosion is strong evidence against the hypothesis that the trigger was sufficient to cause one. This should significantly reduce the odds. Let's apply a likelihood ratio of 1/3 (i.e., this quiet passage of time is 3 times more likely if no major event is going to happen this year).
    *   Final Odds = 0.265 / 3 ≈ 0.088
    *   **Final Probability** = 0.088 / 1.088 ≈ **8.1%**

This calculation suggests that the strong downward pressure from the passage of time has largely counteracted the initial upward pressure from the potent trigger, bringing the probability for the remainder of the year back near the initial annual base rate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of ~8% might be too low. I could be over-weighting the "time decay" evidence and underestimating the "long fuse" scenario.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The Duterte camp could be planning a coordinated disruption closer to the 2025 midterms. Or, President Marcos could use the ongoing tension as a pretext to declare martial law pre-emptively to consolidate power, a decision that could be made suddenly without a long build-up of street violence. The most plausible path to a "Yes" is a sudden political declaration of martial law, not a slow escalation of protests crossing the 1,000-death threshold.
*   **Critique:** The risk of a sudden political move by Marcos is real and perhaps not fully captured by my update. The core of the crisis—the elite power struggle—remains unresolved. The potential energy is still very high.
*   **Adjustment:** To account for this tail risk of a sudden political decision, I will nudge my forecast upward from the calculated 8%. A probability in the low double-digits seems more appropriate to capture this specific risk path. I will adjust my final forecast to reflect this uncertainty.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such an event is low, around 5%. The arrest of former President Duterte is an unprecedented and highly inflammatory trigger, which significantly increases the probability. However, the fact that nearly the entire year has passed without the situation escalating to meet the high resolution thresholds is strong evidence for stability. The remaining risk is concentrated in the final two months and is most likely to manifest as a sudden political decision (a declaration of martial law) rather than a slow-burning protest movement crossing the casualty thresholds. Balancing these powerful but opposing factors, the probability is higher than the base rate but remains low.

Final: 12%
