### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States that relinquished nuclear weapons:** This is the tightest reference class. Four states have done so: South Africa, and the post-Soviet states of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Of these four, zero have subsequently launched a new nuclear weapons program. **Base rate: 0% (0/4).**
    *   *Reasoning:* These states made a strategic choice to integrate into the international community and rely on other security arrangements. Reversing this decision has proven to be politically and technically prohibitive.
2.  **States attempting to proliferate under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime (post-1970):** Numerous states have been suspected of pursuing or have pursued nuclear weapons since the NPT came into force. Only a few have succeeded (e.g., North Korea, Pakistan, India). Many others have failed or been stopped (e.g., Libya, Iraq, Syria). The success rate is low, perhaps 10-15% of attempts over several decades.
    *   *Reasoning:* Proliferation faces immense international pressure, sanctions, technical difficulty, and the risk of pre-emptive military action. This class captures the general difficulty of the task.
3.  **States under existential threat from a nuclear-armed power:** This class includes states like Taiwan, South Korea, and Iran. While some have explored or are suspected of exploring a nuclear option, none have openly declared or been confirmed to have a weapons program in a short (sub-2-year) timeframe.
    *   *Reasoning:* The security incentive is high, but the deterrents—primarily the reaction of allies (especially the US) and the international community—are also extremely high. The base rate of a program being *launched and credibly reported* within a two-year window is very low, <5%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-24** Zelenskyy says Budapest Memorandum failed, urges new security framework — ↓ — Reaffirms Ukraine's strategy is to secure legally binding guarantees *from partners*, not to pursue an independent deterrent. This is a continuation of existing policy, not a pivot to nuclearization.
*   **2024-12-05** Declassified documents highlight early Russian complaints about NATO expansion overshadowing the Budapest Memorandum — ↔ — Historical context that reinforces Ukraine's long-standing security concerns but does not change the current strategic calculus.
*   **2023-12-31** Zelenskyy's New Year address focuses on resilience and EU accession — ↓ — Emphasizes integration with Europe as the strategic path forward. A nuclear program would be fundamentally incompatible with this goal and would alienate key EU partners.
*   **2023-09-19** Zelenskyy at UNGA slams Russia for war crimes and "weaponization" — ↔ — Maintains high international pressure on Russia and reinforces the moral justification for Western support, but does not signal a change in military strategy towards WMD.
*   **2023-04-21** IAEA Director General expresses ongoing concern about Zaporizhzhya NPP safety — ↓ — Highlights the intense and continuous international monitoring of all Ukrainian nuclear sites, making a clandestine weapons program exceptionally difficult to hide.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Security Imperative (Large ↑):** The failure of the Budapest Memorandum and ongoing Russian aggression create the strongest possible motivation for an independent nuclear deterrent. Russian nuclear threats amplify this driver significantly.
2.  **Western Alliance Dependence (Large ↓):** Ukraine is existentially dependent on financial and military aid from the US and Europe. These partners are staunchly committed to non-proliferation. Any credible evidence of a Ukrainian nuclear program would likely sever this lifeline, leading to a swift military defeat. This is the single most powerful constraint.
3.  **Technical & Financial Hurdles (Large ↓):** While Ukraine has a civilian nuclear industry and Soviet-era missile expertise, it lacks the specific, highly complex facilities for uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing. Building these would take many years, billions of dollars, and would be easily detected by international inspectors and intelligence agencies. This is not feasible by 2026, especially during a major war.
4.  **Risk of Russian Escalation (Moderate ↓):** A confirmed Ukrainian nuclear program would provide Russia with a powerful pretext to escalate the conflict dramatically, potentially including the use of its own tactical nuclear weapons to destroy the nascent program, framed as a pre-emptive counter-proliferation strike.
5.  **Diplomatic Leverage (Small ↑ for rhetoric, ↓ for action):** Ukrainian officials use the *threat* of reconsidering their non-nuclear status as a tool to press allies for stronger, more concrete security guarantees (like NATO membership). Actually starting a program would destroy this leverage and replace it with international isolation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Motivation:** Unlike past cases of relinquishment (e.g., South Africa post-apartheid), Ukraine is the first state to have given up nuclear weapons and subsequently face a full-scale invasion aimed at its destruction by the very power that guaranteed its security.
*   **Extreme Alliance Dependency:** Unlike successful proliferators like North Korea (isolated) or Pakistan (had a complex relationship with the US), Ukraine's survival is 100% contingent on the daily support of a Western coalition that would not tolerate proliferation.
*   **Intense International Scrutiny:** Ukraine's nuclear facilities are under constant IAEA monitoring due to the war. This level of on-the-ground international presence is far higher than in historical cases of clandestine programs.
*   **Active Conventional War:** Attempting to launch a massive, secret industrial project like a nuclear weapons program during a devastating war that strains all national resources is practically impossible. Resources are focused on immediate survival.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in just over a month (from Nov 2025). The technical and political lead times for a nuclear program are measured in years, if not decades. A credible program cannot be "launched" in this timeframe.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 1-2%) based on the reference class of zero states restarting a relinquished nuclear program, and the general difficulty of proliferation. Equivalent n is high, given the strong historical precedent.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Extreme security threat from Russia provides powerful motivation. (small magnitude, as motivation doesn't equal capability/action)
    *   (↓↓↓) Total dependence on Western non-proliferationist allies is a near-insurmountable constraint. (large magnitude)
    *   (↓↓) Technical/financial infeasibility within the timeframe and during wartime. (large magnitude)
    *   (↓) Continued official strategy of seeking Western integration (EU/NATO), not strategic independence. (moderate magnitude)
    *   (↓) Intense IAEA monitoring of nuclear sites. (moderate magnitude)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the low prior. The posterior should remain very low, likely <1%. The constraints far outweigh the motivation.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A collapse of Western support for Ukraine, creating a "nothing left to lose" scenario.
    *   Expulsion of IAEA inspectors from any Ukrainian nuclear facility.
    *   Credible intelligence reports (e.g., from US/UK) of undeclared construction at nuclear-related sites.
    *   Official statements from the Ukrainian parliament (Rada) formally revoking NPT commitments.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Signing of a bilateral security treaty with the United States or another major power.
    *   A clear and irreversible pathway to NATO membership being established.
    *   Continued "all clear" reports from IAEA inspections.
    *   A ceasefire or peace agreement with Russia.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Program":** The resolution criteria hinges on "credible reports." A low-level research initiative might exist, but it may not be significant enough to be considered a "weapons program" or be reported as such.
*   **Disinformation Risk:** Russia has previously made baseless claims about Ukraine pursuing nuclear or radiological weapons. A similar claim could be made and amplified, potentially triggering a confusing resolution scenario if a major media outlet reports it, even if it's later debunked.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** A sudden, catastrophic collapse of the Ukrainian state or military could trigger a desperate, last-minute decision that defies conventional strategic logic (a "Samson Option" scenario), though this is a tail risk.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Reality:** It is crucial to distinguish between Ukrainian officials using the *idea* of nuclear weapons for diplomatic leverage and the actual allocation of resources to a secret program. The former is common; the latter is the subject of the question.

**Final Research Summary:**
Ukraine has a powerful motive to pursue nuclear weapons, but the constraints—total dependence on Western aid, insurmountable technical hurdles within the timeframe, and the risk of immediate escalation—make it exceedingly unlikely a program will be launched and credibly reported before 2026.

To forecast the probability of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is states that have relinquished nuclear weapons. Among the four states (South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan), none have restarted a nuclear weapons program. Therefore, the base rate is 0% (0/4).
- **Reasoning:** These states have historically chosen to integrate into the international community and rely on other security arrangements. Reversing this decision is politically and technically prohibitive.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Ukraine, like the other states in the reference class, has previously relinquished nuclear weapons and is under international scrutiny.
- **Differences:** Ukraine is under existential threat from Russia, which is a unique and significant motivator compared to the other cases. However, Ukraine's dependence on Western support and the technical challenges of developing a nuclear program within the timeframe are significant constraints.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Security Imperative (Large ↑):** The ongoing Russian aggression provides a strong motivation for Ukraine to consider nuclear weapons. However, motivation does not equate to capability or action.
- **Western Alliance Dependence (Large ↓):** Ukraine's reliance on Western aid, which is contingent on non-proliferation, is a major deterrent against pursuing nuclear weapons.
- **Technical & Financial Hurdles (Large ↓):** Developing a nuclear program requires significant resources and time, which are not feasible within the given timeframe, especially during an ongoing war.
- **Intense International Scrutiny (Moderate ↓):** Ukraine's nuclear facilities are under constant monitoring, making clandestine development highly unlikely.
- **Official Strategy (Moderate ↓):** Ukraine's strategy focuses on integration with Western institutions, which is incompatible with pursuing nuclear weapons.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** Start with a very low prior, around 1-2%, based on the historical precedent of zero states restarting a relinquished nuclear program.
- **Evidence Impact:** The evidence overwhelmingly supports maintaining a low probability. The constraints (Western dependence, technical hurdles, international scrutiny) far outweigh the motivation.
- **Posterior Probability:** Given the strong constraints and the low prior, the posterior probability remains very low, likely less than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a "black swan" event, such as a sudden collapse of Western support or a desperate strategic shift by Ukraine. However, these remain unlikely within the timeframe.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where Ukraine begins a low-level research initiative might exist, but it would not constitute a full-fledged weapons program.
- **Adjustment:** Given the constraints and the timeframe, the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability that Ukraine will launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will Ukraine launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **States that relinquished nuclear weapons and later restarted programs**: Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and South Africa all gave up nuclear weapons. None have restarted programs. Base rate: 0% (0/4)

2. **States attempting nuclear proliferation under the NPT regime (post-1970)**: Only a few states have successfully developed nuclear weapons while under the NPT (North Korea being the primary example). The success rate is approximately 10-15% over decades.

3. **States under existential threat from nuclear powers**: Countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Iran have faced nuclear threats but have not openly declared weapons programs in short timeframes, despite having technical capabilities. Base rate: <5%

Given these reference classes, I'll use a prior of 2%. This reflects the extremely rare nature of restarting abandoned nuclear programs, while acknowledging Ukraine's unique security situation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Ukraine formally committed to non-proliferation by signing the NPT
- Ukraine is integrated into international monitoring systems (IAEA inspections)
- Ukraine depends heavily on Western support, which strongly opposes proliferation

**Key differences:**
- Ukraine faces an existential threat from the very power (Russia) that guaranteed its security
- Ukraine previously possessed nuclear weapons and has some technical expertise
- Ukraine is in an active conventional war, straining all resources
- The timeframe is extremely short (resolution by January 2026)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Ukrainian officials' statements about reconsidering nuclear status**
- P(E|H): 90% - If Ukraine were planning a nuclear program, such statements would be expected
- P(E|~H): 70% - These statements serve as diplomatic leverage even without actual plans
- Likelihood ratio: 1.29 (small increase in probability)
- These statements appear to be primarily diplomatic tools to pressure allies for stronger security guarantees

**Evidence 2: Ukraine's complete dependence on Western aid**
- P(E|H): 5% - A country planning nuclear weapons would likely secure more independent resources
- P(E|~H): 95% - Dependence on anti-proliferation allies is consistent with no nuclear program
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05 (strong decrease in probability)
- Western allies would likely cut support if Ukraine pursued nuclear weapons, leading to military defeat

**Evidence 3: Technical and resource constraints during wartime**
- P(E|H): 10% - A successful program would require massive resources Ukraine doesn't have
- P(E|~H): 90% - Ukraine's focus on conventional defense is consistent with no nuclear program
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11 (strong decrease in probability)
- Building enrichment facilities would take years, billions of dollars, and would be easily detected

**Evidence 4: Intense IAEA monitoring of Ukrainian nuclear facilities**
- P(E|H): 20% - A clandestine program would be extremely difficult under such scrutiny
- P(E|~H): 95% - Continued monitoring is consistent with compliance
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21 (strong decrease in probability)
- The war has increased international attention on Ukraine's nuclear facilities

**Evidence 5: Zelenskyy's consistent focus on EU integration and NATO membership**
- P(E|H): 30% - A nuclear program would be fundamentally incompatible with these goals
- P(E|~H): 90% - This strategic direction aligns with non-proliferation
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33 (moderate decrease in probability)
- Recent statements continue to emphasize Western integration, not strategic independence

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability P(H) = 2% (0.02)
Prior odds = 0.02/0.98 = 0.0204

Applying the combined likelihood ratio:
LR = 1.29 × 0.05 × 0.11 × 0.21 × 0.33 ≈ 0.00049

Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 0.00049 ≈ 0.00001

Posterior probability = 0.00001/(1 + 0.00001) ≈ 0.00001 or 0.001%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming constraints against Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may underestimate Ukraine's desperation if Western support falters significantly
- There could be undisclosed technical capabilities or secret facilities unknown to international monitors
- The definition of "launching a program" might be interpreted more broadly than I've considered

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Ukraine might conduct preliminary research without a full weapons program
- A false report might emerge from Russian disinformation that meets the resolution criteria
- A sudden catastrophic military defeat could trigger a desperate "Samson Option" decision

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should increase my estimate slightly to account for definitional ambiguity and low-probability scenarios. However, the fundamental constraints remain overwhelming.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, we can consider several reference classes:

1.  **States that relinquished nuclear weapons:** This is the most specific reference class. Four states have done so: South Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Of these, zero have subsequently launched a new nuclear weapons program. A simple frequency-based base rate would be 0/4, or 0%. A more robust Bayesian estimate (e.g., Rule of Succession) would suggest a low but non-zero probability, but the historical precedent is clear: reversing this decision is exceptionally rare.
2.  **States attempting to proliferate under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT):** Since the NPT entered into force in 1970, very few states have successfully developed nuclear weapons (e.g., India, Pakistan, North Korea). Many others have tried and failed or been stopped (e.g., Iraq, Libya, Syria). The annual probability of any given NPT signatory with latent capabilities launching a program is very low.
3.  **States under existential threat from a nuclear power:** This class includes countries like Taiwan and South Korea. While they have the technical capacity and a strong security motive, none have launched an overt weapons program, largely due to the constraints imposed by their security alliances (primarily with the US).

Combining these, a reasonable prior for a state like Ukraine launching a nuclear program within a short ~1.5-year window is very low. I will set the initial prior at **2%**. This acknowledges that it is a rare event but not impossible under extreme circumstances.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like other potential proliferators, Ukraine is an NPT signatory, faces immense technical and financial hurdles, and would be subject to intense international pressure and sanctions if it pursued a nuclear option.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Motivation (Increases Probability):** Ukraine's situation is unique and extreme. It is the only country to have relinquished nuclear weapons and subsequently been invaded by the very power that guaranteed its security (Russia). Ongoing Russian nuclear threats provide the strongest possible motivation for an independent deterrent. This factor significantly increases the likelihood compared to any historical base case.
    *   **Constraints (Decreases Probability):** Ukraine's survival in the current war is entirely dependent on a continuous flow of military and financial aid from the United States and Europe. These partners are staunchly committed to non-proliferation. Any credible move by Ukraine to launch a nuclear program would almost certainly sever this aid lifeline, which would be strategically suicidal. This constraint is far stronger than for past proliferators like North Korea or Pakistan.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "Ukraine will launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Extreme Security Threat & Russian Aggression.**
    *   This evidence is the primary *reason* for H to occur. P(E|H) is high. However, it is also the reason Ukraine receives massive Western support, which is contingent on it remaining non-nuclear. So P(E|~H) is also high. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is therefore only slightly greater than 1. This evidence raises the possibility from the base rate but is not decisive on its own.
*   **Evidence 2: Existential Dependence on Western Aid.**
    *   P(E|H) is extremely low. It is almost inconceivable that Ukraine would launch a program while being so dependent on aid from anti-proliferationist states.
    *   P(E|~H) is very high. Ukraine's current strategy of forgoing nuclear weapons is a precondition for receiving this aid.
    *   The likelihood ratio is strongly less than 1 (<<1). This evidence powerfully decreases the probability of H.
*   **Evidence 3: Technical, Financial, and Time Constraints.**
    *   Ukraine has a civilian nuclear industry but lacks the specific enrichment or reprocessing facilities needed for a weapons program. Building these would take years and billions of dollars, resources it cannot spare during a total war. The question's deadline of January 1, 2026 (less than two months from the forecast date of Nov 9, 2025) makes launching a meaningful physical program impossible.
    *   The likelihood ratio for this evidence is also strongly less than 1 (<<1).
*   **Evidence 4: Official Ukrainian Strategy.**
    *   Ukrainian officials consistently frame their future security in terms of integration with the West (NATO/EU) and legally binding security guarantees from allies. This path is mutually exclusive with a domestic nuclear program. This evidence decreases the probability of H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Prior Odds:** 2% probability corresponds to odds of 1:49.
*   **Updating with Motivation:** The extreme motivation might make the "unthinkable" more plausible, perhaps doubling the odds to 1:24.5 (approx. 4% probability).
*   **Updating with Constraints:** The combination of existential dependence on Western aid and the sheer impossibility of launching a program in the given timeframe acts as an overwhelming counterweight. The likelihood ratio for these combined constraints is extremely small (e.g., 1/100 or less).
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR(Motivation) × LR(Constraints)
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:49) × (2) × (1/100) = 2:4900 = 1:2450
*   This calculation, though illustrative, pushes the probability of an *actual* program to well below 1%. The posterior probability is extremely low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis concludes that a *real* nuclear program is nearly impossible. However, the question resolves based on "credible reports," which introduces other possibilities:

1.  **Resolution via Political Declaration:** In a "nothing left to lose" scenario (e.g., a sudden collapse of Western support), the Ukrainian government might *announce* the start of a program as a desperate political signal, even without any technical capability to back it up. A statement from a minister would satisfy the resolution criteria. This is a tail risk, but it is the most plausible path to a "Yes."
2.  **Resolution via Disinformation:** Russia has a strong incentive to claim Ukraine is developing nuclear weapons. A sophisticated Russian disinformation campaign could potentially lead to a report in a major media outlet that is treated as credible, at least for the one-month period required for resolution.

These scenarios are not about a physical program but about events that could trigger the resolution criteria. The extremely short timeframe (less than two months until resolution) makes a physical program impossible but could increase the chance of a last-ditch political declaration if the strategic situation changes dramatically. These tail risks prevent the probability from being zero, but they remain low-probability events.

### 6. Final Forecast

The motivation for Ukraine to develop nuclear weapons is at an all-time high. However, the constraints are overwhelming. Ukraine's survival depends on Western support, which is contingent on its non-nuclear status. Furthermore, launching a technically and financially demanding program during a major war and within the specified short timeframe is practically impossible.

The primary risk of a "Yes" resolution comes not from a genuine program, but from a political declaration made in desperation or a successful disinformation campaign. Given the stability of Ukraine's strategic posture and the high bar for "credible reports," these remain tail risks. The probability is therefore very low.

Final: 1%
