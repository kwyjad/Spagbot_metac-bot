### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major U.S. Presidential Initiatives:** Programs like PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) or the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), launched with significant presidential backing and bipartisan support. These are exceptionally durable. In the ~20 years since their creation, none have been terminated. This suggests a base rate of termination or consolidation-out-of-existence of **<5% over a 5-year period**, or <1% annually in a stable political environment.
2.  **Specific U.S. Foreign Aid Programs:** Individual programs within USAID or the State Department. These are more susceptible to shifting priorities, budget cuts, or being merged/rebranded. A rough estimate might be a **5-10% chance per 4-year presidential term** of a given program ceasing to exist, heavily dependent on the program's profile and political support.
3.  **U.S. Government Programs Targeted by a Hostile Administration:** Programs explicitly targeted for elimination or radical restructuring by an incoming administration. The base rate here is much higher, as political will is a primary driver. Success is not guaranteed due to congressional or bureaucratic resistance, but the probability of termination/consolidation could be in the **25-50% range within the first two years of that administration.**

Given the current context, Class 3 is the most relevant, but PMI's high-profile, bipartisan history (Class 1) provides significant counter-pressure. A blended starting point might be a 15-20% probability.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The question resolves in just over one month. The recency window emphasizes the last six months.

*   **2025-10-16** KFF fact sheet confirms the administration's new 'America First Global Health Strategy' and continued funding for malaria commodities/workers through FY26, but under a new structure post-USAID dissolution. — **↑** — This confirms the mechanism for PMI's dissolution: its functions will be absorbed into a new bilateral strategy, meaning it will cease to exist as a *distinct* organization.
*   **2025-09-19** The 'America First Global Health Strategy' is formally unveiled, planning to fund malaria activities via time-limited, bilateral deals, explicitly replacing the existing aid structure. — **↑** — This is the clearest evidence of a plan to replace, not just cut, PMI. It directly addresses the "consolidation" clause of the resolution criteria.
*   **2025-06-01** The administration's FY26 budget request proposes a 47% cut to PMI. — **↑** — While not a full elimination of funding, it signals a clear and hostile intent toward the program, making its continuation in its current form highly improbable.
*   **2025-05-13** A KFF fact sheet notes the ongoing dissolution of USAID, the agency that operates PMI. — **↑** — This is a structural death blow. A program cannot easily maintain its distinct identity when its parent/implementing agency is being eliminated.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Executive Branch Restructuring (Large ↑):** The President has significant authority to reorganize executive agencies. The dissolution of USAID, PMI's primary implementing agency, is the single most powerful driver. It forces a change in how PMI's functions are carried out, making its continuation as a "distinct organization" nearly impossible.
2.  **"America First" Foreign Policy Ideology (Large ↑):** The administration's stated preference for bilateral agreements over established, multilateral-style initiatives directly targets the operational model of programs like PMI. The new strategy is a direct implementation of this ideology.
3.  **Congressional Appropriations (Moderate ↓):** Congress holds the power of the purse and could, in theory, pass a budget that explicitly funds PMI as a distinct entity. However, the executive branch retains significant discretion in how funds are implemented. Even if funded, the administration could execute the funds through its new bilateral structure, effectively still terminating PMI as a distinct program.
4.  **Bipartisan Legacy & Inertia (Small ↓):** PMI was a signature initiative of a Republican president (G.W. Bush) and has enjoyed two decades of bipartisan support and documented success. This creates political friction against its termination but has proven insufficient to stop the administration's broader restructuring of foreign aid.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Parent Agency Dissolution:** Unlike typical cases of program termination or budget cuts, PMI's parent agency (USAID) is being dismantled. This is a rare and extreme structural change that makes the base rates from stable periods less applicable.
*   **Explicit Replacement Strategy:** The administration is not simply defunding malaria efforts. It has articulated a specific replacement strategy ('America First Global Health Strategy') that will continue some functions (funding commodities/workers) under a new framework. This makes a "YES" resolution via the "consolidation" clause highly likely.
*   **Speed and Determination:** The administration has moved exceptionally fast since January 2025, with an executive order, mass layoffs, and a new strategic framework unveiled within nine months, signaling a high degree of determination that overcomes typical bureaucratic inertia.
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The question resolves "Yes" not just on termination or defunding, but also if PMI is consolidated and "no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization." The administration's actions appear tailored to meet this specific criterion.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior of ~20% (equivalent n≈10), blending the low base rate for major initiatives with the higher rate for programs targeted by a hostile administration.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The dissolution of USAID, PMI's parent agency, makes its continued existence structurally untenable.
    *   (↑ Large) The formal announcement of the 'America First Global Health Strategy' explicitly replaces PMI's operational model with a new one, ensuring it will not continue as a "distinct organization."
    *   (↑ Moderate) The severe (47%) proposed budget cut in the FY26 request demonstrates clear hostile intent.
    *   (↓ Small) The program's bipartisan history and success have failed to prevent these existential threats, showing this factor's limited power in the current environment.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelming and mutually reinforcing. The structural and strategic changes already underway point directly to a "YES" resolution via the consolidation clause. The posterior should move very strongly upwards, likely into the >85% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official White House or State Department press release announcing the formal transition of malaria programs to the new bilateral structure.
    *   Language in a Continuing Resolution or the final FY26 appropriations bill that re-brands or re-authorizes malaria funding under a new program name.
    *   Removal of the "President's Malaria Initiative" branding from all new government reports and communications.
    *   Statements from former PMI leadership confirming the program's functions have been absorbed elsewhere.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A successful court injunction halting the dissolution of USAID (highly unlikely).
    *   Congress passing specific, restrictive language in a must-pass spending bill that explicitly preserves PMI as a distinct operational entity and prohibits the administration from consolidating it.
    *   The administration granting PMI a specific waiver to continue operations, similar to the one PEPFAR received (no indication of this is forthcoming).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The primary risk is ambiguity in "ceasing to operate as a distinct organization." If the administration creates an "Office of Bilateral Malaria Partnerships" that is effectively PMI with a new name, it could be a borderline case. However, the shift from a coordinated initiative to a series of bilateral deals seems fundamental enough to count.
*   **Zombie Program:** PMI could be technically "on the books" but functionally dead (no staff, no new funding streams), which would satisfy the resolution criteria. The public information may lag behind this reality.
*   **Congressional Intervention:** While unlikely to reverse the course, a last-minute congressional rider in a spending bill before Jan 1, 2026, could theoretically preserve the PMI name and structure, though the administration would likely fight its implementation.
*   **Information Control:** The administration may not issue a clear "PMI is terminated" press release, instead framing it as an "evolution" or "strengthening" of malaria efforts. Resolution will depend on interpreting the substance of the changes, not just the rhetoric.

**Final Research Summary:** The administration's dissolution of USAID and its replacement of existing aid structures with the 'America First Global Health Strategy' make it nearly certain that the President's Malaria Initiative will cease to exist as a distinct organization before 2026, resolving this question "Yes." The path is not total defunding, but consolidation and rebranding.

To forecast whether the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) will cease to exist before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is from Class 3: U.S. Government Programs Targeted by a Hostile Administration. Given the current political context and the explicit targeting of PMI by the administration, the base rate for termination or consolidation is in the 25-50% range within the first two years of the administration. However, considering PMI's high-profile and bipartisan support, a blended starting point of 15-20% is reasonable.

**Initial Prior Probability:** 20%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** PMI is targeted by a hostile administration, similar to other programs that have faced restructuring or termination.
- **Differences:** PMI has a strong bipartisan legacy and documented success, which typically provides some resistance against termination. However, the dissolution of USAID and the introduction of the 'America First Global Health Strategy' are significant deviations from the norm, indicating a higher likelihood of PMI ceasing to exist as a distinct entity.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Dissolution of USAID (Large ↑):** The dismantling of PMI's parent agency makes its continued existence as a distinct organization highly unlikely.
- **'America First Global Health Strategy' (Large ↑):** This strategy explicitly replaces PMI's operational model, indicating a consolidation.
- **FY26 Budget Cut (Moderate ↑):** A 47% budget cut signals hostile intent, reducing the likelihood of PMI's continuation.
- **Bipartisan Support (Small ↓):** While historically significant, it has not prevented the current restructuring efforts.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 0.20 / (1 - 0.20) = 0.25
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the overwhelming evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1. For simplicity, assume a combined likelihood ratio of 4 (reflecting the strong evidence for consolidation).
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.25 × 4 = 1.0
- **Posterior Probability:** 1.0 / (1 + 1.0) = 0.50

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The evidence strongly supports a "Yes" resolution, but we must consider potential congressional intervention or legal challenges that could preserve PMI.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A last-minute congressional rider or court injunction could theoretically preserve PMI, though these are unlikely given the current trajectory.
- **Adjustment:** Given the strong evidence and low likelihood of successful intervention, the probability should be adjusted upwards.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the overwhelming evidence of structural changes and strategic shifts, the probability that PMI will cease to exist as a distinct organization before January 1, 2026, is high.

Final: 90%

# Will the President's Malaria Initiative program cease to exist before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider the base rate of major U.S. foreign aid programs being terminated or consolidated within a specific timeframe. The most relevant reference class is "U.S. Government Programs Targeted by a Hostile Administration" since:

- PMI is explicitly targeted by the Trump administration's Executive Order 14169
- USAID, which operates PMI, is being dismantled
- The administration has proposed a 47% budget cut to PMI

Historical data suggests that when programs are explicitly targeted by an incoming administration, there's approximately a 25-50% chance of termination or major restructuring within the first two years. However, PMI has bipartisan support and a strong legacy as a successful initiative created under Republican President George W. Bush.

Given these considerations, I'll start with a prior probability of 35% that PMI will cease to exist before January 1, 2026.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- PMI is a foreign aid program subject to executive branch authority
- It operates within USAID, which is under direct executive control
- It requires congressional appropriations to continue functioning

**Key differences:**
- PMI has unusually strong bipartisan support as a successful legacy program
- The timeline is extremely compressed (just over one month from today)
- The parent agency (USAID) is being actively dismantled, which is rare
- The administration has already announced a replacement strategy ("America First Global Health Strategy")
- The resolution criteria include "consolidation" where PMI no longer operates as a distinct organization

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: USAID Dissolution**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If PMI ceases to exist, the dissolution of its parent agency would be a primary mechanism
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.05) - It's extremely unlikely PMI would continue as a distinct organization if USAID is dismantled
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of PMI ceasing to exist
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: America First Global Health Strategy**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A replacement strategy is exactly what we'd expect if PMI is being consolidated
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.10) - It's unlikely a new bilateral strategy would be announced while preserving PMI as distinct
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.5:1 in favor of PMI ceasing to exist
- This strongly increases the probability

**Evidence 3: 47% Budget Cut in FY26 Request**
- P(E|H): High (~0.80) - Severe budget cuts often precede program termination
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.30) - Programs can survive with reduced budgets
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7:1 in favor of PMI ceasing to exist
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: No Waiver Granted (unlike PEPFAR)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.85) - Programs targeted for elimination typically don't receive waivers
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.20) - If PMI were to continue, we'd expect a waiver similar to PEPFAR
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.25:1 in favor of PMI ceasing to exist
- This moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 35% (odds of 0.35/0.65 = 0.538:1)

First update (USAID Dissolution):
- Prior odds: 0.538:1
- Likelihood ratio: 19:1
- Posterior odds: 0.538 × 19 = 10.22:1
- Posterior probability: 10.22/(1+10.22) = 91.1%

Second update (America First Strategy):
- Prior odds: 10.22:1
- Likelihood ratio: 9.5:1
- Posterior odds: 10.22 × 9.5 = 97.09:1
- Posterior probability: 97.09/(1+97.09) = 99.0%

The remaining evidence further strengthens this conclusion, but the probability is already very high. The combined evidence strongly suggests that PMI will cease to exist as a distinct organization before January 1, 2026, primarily through consolidation into the new bilateral strategy framework.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Definition ambiguity**: The resolution criteria require PMI to "no longer continue to operate as a distinct organization." If the administration merely rebrands PMI while keeping its core functions intact, this could be a borderline case.

2. **Congressional intervention**: Congress could theoretically pass legislation explicitly preserving PMI's distinct status, though this seems unlikely given the timeline and current political dynamics.

3. **Information lag**: Official announcements about PMI's status might not be made until after January 1, 2026, creating uncertainty about its actual status at the resolution date.

4. **Overconfidence in administrative efficiency**: Government reorganizations often take longer than planned. The administration might intend to consolidate PMI but fail to complete the process before January 1.

After considering these factors, I should adjust my probability slightly downward to account for implementation uncertainties and potential definitional edge cases.

## 6. Final Forecast

The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that PMI will cease to exist as a distinct organization before January 1, 2026. The dissolution of USAID, the explicit replacement strategy, and the severe budget cuts all point to consolidation rather than continuation. While there are some uncertainties about implementation timelines and definitional boundaries, these are insufficient to significantly alter the conclusion.

Final: 95%

Answering the question: **Will the President’s Malaria Initiative program cease to exist before January 1, 2026?**

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "U.S. government programs explicitly targeted for elimination by a hostile administration." While the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) has a strong bipartisan history (which would suggest a low base rate of termination, <1% annually), the current political context is the dominant factor. For programs targeted by a new, ideologically-driven administration, the probability of being terminated or radically restructured within the first two years is significant. A reasonable prior, set at the beginning of 2025, would be in the 25-50% range. I will select a prior of **30%**, acknowledging the hostile intent but giving some weight to the program's established success and bipartisan origins.
*   Prior Odds: 30 / 70 ≈ 0.43

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is more extreme than a typical case of a program being targeted for elimination.
*   **Similarity:** An ideologically motivated administration is using executive and budgetary power to reshape government.
*   **Difference:** The administration is not just targeting PMI; it is dissolving PMI's entire parent/implementing agency, USAID. This is a rare and powerful structural attack that makes it exceptionally difficult for subsidiary programs to survive in their current form.
*   **Difference:** The administration has also articulated an explicit replacement strategy (the 'America First Global Health Strategy'). This isn't just about cutting; it's about replacing the existing model, which makes a "consolidation" outcome highly probable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence presented, all from within the last year, points overwhelmingly in one direction.
*   **Evidence:** The dissolution of USAID, PMI's parent agency.
    *   P(E | H: PMI ceases to exist): Very high. A program cannot easily exist without its parent agency.
    *   P(E | ~H: PMI continues): Very low. It is structurally almost impossible for PMI to continue as a "distinct organization" if its implementing agency is gone.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large, strongly increasing the probability of "Yes".
*   **Evidence:** The formal announcement of the 'America First Global Health Strategy' to replace existing aid structures with bilateral deals.
    *   P(E | H): Extremely high. This provides the precise mechanism for PMI to be consolidated and cease to be a distinct organization, directly fulfilling a resolution criterion.
    *   P(E | ~H): Extremely low. An explicit replacement strategy is fundamentally incompatible with the continuation of the original program.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Extremely large, providing another massive update towards "Yes".
*   **Evidence:** The proposed 47% budget cut to PMI.
    *   P(E | H): High. This is a clear signal of hostile intent and a method to cripple the program, paving the way for its termination.
    *   P(E | ~H): Low. Such a drastic cut is not consistent with the program's continuation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Large, further increasing the probability of "Yes".

The initial counter-evidence—PMI's bipartisan history and success—has proven to be an insufficient defense against the administration's determined and rapid actions in 2025.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 30% (odds of 0.43), we update with the overwhelming evidence.
1.  **Initial Actions (Targeting/dissolving USAID):** This evidence is extremely strong. A conservative likelihood ratio of 10 would move the odds from 0.43 to 4.3, which corresponds to a probability of 4.3 / 5.3 ≈ 81%.
2.  **Explicit Replacement Strategy:** This is the final, decisive piece of evidence, as it directly addresses the "consolidation" clause of the resolution criteria. It confirms that PMI's functions will be absorbed into a new structure, meaning it will cease to be a "distinct organization." This warrants another very large likelihood ratio (e.g., >10).
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds (81%) × Likelihood Ratio (>10) = 4.3 × 10 = 43
    *   Posterior Probability = 43 / 44 ≈ 97.7%

The cumulative evidence strongly suggests the outcome is nearly certain.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "No" resolution is not that the administration will fail, but that the bureaucratic process will be delayed. Could PMI technically still exist on the books on January 1, 2026, even if it's a hollowed-out shell? This is possible, but the evidence of mass layoffs and the dissolution of its parent agency suggests a de facto termination has already occurred. Another possibility is a last-minute congressional intervention in a must-pass spending bill. Given the short time frame (the forecast is made in late November 2025, with 5 weeks to go) and the administration's clear agenda, a successful legislative block is highly improbable. The resolution criteria, which include consolidation where PMI is "no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization," are very likely to be met by the administration's announced replacement strategy. The risk of a "No" resolution is therefore very small.

### 6. Final Forecast
The chain of events in 2025—from the executive order targeting USAID, to the agency's dissolution, to the announcement of an explicit replacement strategy—creates a clear and direct path to a "Yes" resolution. The question is not whether this will happen, but whether the process will be formally completed before January 1, 2026. Given the speed and determination shown by the administration, and the fact that the new strategy has already been unveiled, it is almost certain that PMI will have ceased to exist as a distinct organization by the deadline.

Final: 98%
