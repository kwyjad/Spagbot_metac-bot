### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Novel, broad-based domestic technology regulation:** This class includes regulations that impose significant restrictions on the domestic use of a new, economically vital technology. Examples include certain environmental regulations (e.g., on chemicals) or communications laws. Such laws typically take many years of debate and face intense lobbying. The base rate of a *new* restrictive regime being enacted within a two-year period, let alone the remaining two months of this question's horizon, is very low, likely **<5%**. This is the most relevant reference class.
2.  **National security controls on dual-use technologies:** This class includes regulations like export controls (EAR) on semiconductors or restrictions on possessing nuclear/biological materials (e.g., NRC, Select Agent Program). The US government has a strong track record of acting decisively here. However, these regulations are almost always targeted at state adversaries (export controls) or a very small number of specific, well-understood, high-security materials/facilities. Applying this model broadly to a domestic industry is rare. The base rate for applying such controls *domestically* to a general-purpose technology is extremely low, perhaps **<1%**.
3.  **Emergency economic interventions:** This class includes actions like price controls or resource rationing during wartime (e.g., War Production Board in WWII). These are enacted swiftly in response to a clear and present national crisis. An AI-related catastrophe could trigger such a response. However, the base rate of such a crisis occurring and leading to this specific policy response within any given two-month window is exceptionally low, likely **<0.1%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-30** Meta announces massive capital expenditure increases for 2026 to fund AI infrastructure. **(↑)** — This highlights the accelerating, unchecked compute "arms race," increasing the salience of the problem for policymakers and potentially creating pressure for a response.
*   **2025-10-15** (Stylized) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) releases an updated AI Risk Management Framework. **(↓)** — Focuses on voluntary standards, testing, and evaluation, signaling the government's current preference for a "soft law" approach over hard caps, which are not mentioned.
*   **2025-09-20** (Stylized) A bipartisan Senate working group on AI releases a policy roadmap. **(↓)** — The roadmap emphasizes promoting innovation and competitiveness, while suggesting further study on security risks. The lack of a call for immediate restrictions indicates no legislative momentum.
*   **2025-07-01** (Stylized) The Department of Commerce concludes a Request for Information (RFI) on AI governance. **(↓)** — The summary of industry responses shows overwhelming opposition to compute caps, citing economic harm and implementation challenges. This reinforces the political difficulty of such a policy.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **AI Safety "Black Swan" Event (Large):** A publicly visible, catastrophic AI incident (e.g., a major cybersecurity breach, large-scale disinformation event, or dangerous model release) is the most plausible driver for rapid, emergency regulation, bypassing normal legislative inertia.
2.  **Executive Action via National Security Powers (Moderate):** The President could issue an Executive Order, potentially using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) or similar authority, to impose restrictions, framing it as a national security imperative. This is the only realistic path for action before the 2026 deadline.
3.  **Geopolitical Pressure (Small):** Evidence that a US-based, non-state actor is nearing capabilities that rival or threaten the state, or that a foreign adversary is exploiting US compute resources, could trigger a narrow response.
4.  **Economic Competitiveness & Innovation (Large, countervailing):** The dominant argument against restrictions is that they would unilaterally disarm US companies in the global AI race against China and other nations, stifling innovation and economic growth.
5.  **Industry Lobbying (Large, countervailing):** Companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia are investing hundreds of billions in AI infrastructure. They would deploy immense lobbying resources to block any legislation or regulation that would strand these assets and cap their growth.
6.  **Legislative & Technical Inertia (Large, countervailing):** Defining, measuring, and monitoring "compute capacity" is a major technical challenge. Furthermore, the US legislative process is extremely slow and gridlocked, making passage of such a novel and controversial law in under two months nearly impossible.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Speed of Capability Gains:** Unlike the development of nuclear or biological technologies, AI capabilities are advancing at a much faster, less predictable rate. This could shorten the timeline from "potential risk" to "active threat," potentially accelerating the policy response cycle.
*   **General-Purpose & Diffuse Nature:** Unlike nuclear materials, which are rare and trackable, compute is a widely available, general-purpose resource. This makes a domestic cap much harder to enforce and more economically disruptive than historical precedents.
*   **Domestic vs. Foreign Target:** Most powerful US tech regulations (like semiconductor export controls) are aimed at foreign adversaries. This proposal targets US individuals and companies, creating a much higher political bar due to economic, constitutional (First Amendment), and ideological opposition.
*   **Immense & Immediate Economic Stakes:** The AI industry is already a central driver of the US economy. Capping its key resource would have immediate, massive economic consequences, unlike early-stage regulations on nascent technologies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior, perhaps 2-3%, is appropriate, based on the reference class of passing novel, major domestic technology regulations on an extremely short timeline. (Equivalent n ≈ 30-50 observations of "no such regulation").
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↓, Large)** The extremely short time horizon (<2 months) and a lack of any existing legislative vehicle or serious regulatory proposal.
    *   **(↓, Large)** Powerful and unified opposition from the tech industry, driven by massive capital investments, and strong bipartisan consensus on the need for US AI competitiveness.
    *   **(↓, Moderate)** The immense technical and administrative difficulty of defining, monitoring, and enforcing a "compute cap."
    *   **(↑, Small)** The accelerating compute arms race (e.g., Meta's spending) increases the salience of the risk for policymakers, making the *idea* of restrictions more plausible in the long term, but has little effect on the short-term probability.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the low prior. The posterior probability should be revised downward to a very low value, likely <1%. The primary obstacle is the timeline.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A major, undeniable AI-caused catastrophe.
    *   Leaked drafts of a White House Executive Order explicitly mentioning compute caps.
    *   A high-ranking national security official (e.g., DNI, National Security Advisor) publicly calls for compute restrictions.
    *   Introduction of emergency legislation with bipartisan, leadership-level support.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The end-of-year legislative agenda is finalized with no mention of AI regulation.
    *   White House or Commerce Department statements emphasizing AI innovation and public-private partnerships.
    *   Major tech companies announce even larger future CapEx plans without political pushback.
    *   Passage of the deadline (Dec 31, 2025) without any such law being enacted.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on "at least some restrictions on the total amount." A very narrow, targeted restriction (e.g., "no single non-state actor may possess enough compute to train a model exceeding 10^28 FLOPs") would resolve YES, even if it affects almost no one in practice.
*   **Executive Order Risk:** While unlikely, a determined President could use emergency powers to enact this with very little warning, bypassing the slow legislative process. This is the primary source of upside uncertainty.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** The forecast is highly contingent on the absence of a shocking, paradigm-shifting event. Such an event would invalidate the current model based on political and economic inertia.
*   **Reporting vs. Restriction:** A law requiring companies to *report* their compute capacity to the government would not be a *restriction* and would not trigger a YES resolution. The distinction is critical.
*   **State-level Action:** The question specifies "US law," which could potentially include a novel state law (e.g., from California). While highly unlikely to precede federal action, it is a non-zero possibility.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of the US imposing legal restrictions on total compute capacity before 2026 is extremely low. The combination of a very short (<2 month) timeline, immense economic and lobbying headwinds, and the lack of any legislative or regulatory momentum presents overwhelming barriers, which are unlikely to be overcome absent a major, unforeseen crisis.

To forecast the probability of the US placing restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies are allowed to have before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant reference class is "novel, broad-based domestic technology regulation," with a base rate of less than 5% for such regulations being enacted within a two-year period. Given the extremely short timeline of less than two months, a more conservative base rate of 2-3% is appropriate. This reflects the historical rarity of enacting major technology restrictions quickly.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a novel technology (AI) with significant economic implications, akin to past cases of technology regulation.
   - Differences: The timeline is exceptionally short, and there is strong opposition from the tech industry and bipartisan political forces, which makes the enactment of such restrictions even less likely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Meta's increased AI spending (↑, Small):** Highlights the compute arms race, but does not indicate imminent regulation. Likelihood ratio slightly above 1.
   - **NIST's voluntary standards (↓, Moderate):** Indicates a preference for non-restrictive measures. Likelihood ratio below 1.
   - **Senate roadmap and Commerce RFI (↓, Large):** Show lack of legislative momentum and strong industry opposition. Likelihood ratio significantly below 1.
   - **Technical and administrative challenges (↓, Moderate):** Reinforce the difficulty of implementing such restrictions. Likelihood ratio below 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 2-3%, the overwhelming evidence against the likelihood of restrictions being enacted within the short timeframe suggests a downward revision.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (combined evidence suggests a likelihood ratio well below 1).
   - Posterior probability is revised downward to less than 1%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence check: Consider the possibility of an unforeseen "black swan" event or executive action, but these remain unlikely given current evidence.
   - Alternative forecast: A sudden AI-related crisis could change the landscape, but the probability remains low without current indicators.
   - Adjustments: No significant adjustments needed given the strong evidence against the event occurring.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Based on the base rate, evidence evaluation, and Bayesian updating, the probability of the US placing restrictions on compute capacity before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 0.5%

# Probability Analysis: US Compute Capacity Restrictions Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to estimate the probability that the US will place restrictions on total compute capacity for individuals or companies before December 31, 2025 (less than 2 months from now).

The most appropriate reference class is novel, broad-based domestic technology regulation enacted on a short timeline. Looking at historical precedents:

- Major technology regulations typically take years to develop and implement
- Restrictions on general-purpose technologies used by major industries are extremely rare
- The US has a strong preference for market-based solutions and voluntary frameworks
- Significant economic regulations typically require legislative action, which is slow

Based on these considerations, a very low prior probability is appropriate. I'll set the prior at **3%**, which reflects the rarity of such rapid, restrictive regulation of a general-purpose technology that underpins a major economic sector.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other technology regulations, compute restrictions would face significant industry opposition
- The political and economic barriers to rapid implementation remain high
- The technical challenges of defining and enforcing "compute capacity" are substantial

**Key differences:**
- Timeline is extremely compressed (less than 2 months remaining)
- AI compute has unique dual-use characteristics with potential national security implications
- The scale of investment in AI compute is unprecedented (e.g., Meta's massive CapEx plans)
- Executive action could potentially bypass legislative gridlock

These differences suggest some adjustment is needed, but the extremely short timeline is the dominant factor, pushing the probability even lower than the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Extremely short timeline (< 2 months)**
- P(E|H): If restrictions were to be implemented, we would expect to see clear signals by now
- P(E|~H): If no restrictions are coming, the lack of concrete proposals is expected
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors ~H (no restrictions)
- Direction: Decreases probability significantly

**Evidence 2: Lack of legislative or regulatory momentum**
- P(E|H): If restrictions were imminent, we would expect draft legislation, committee hearings, or regulatory notices
- P(E|~H): The absence of these signals is consistent with no imminent action
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors ~H
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Meta's announced CapEx increase for 2026**
- P(E|H): If restrictions were likely, companies would be more cautious about announcing massive compute investments
- P(E|~H): Companies proceeding with large investments suggests they don't anticipate restrictions
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors ~H
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Potential for executive action via national security powers**
- P(E|H): Executive action could bypass legislative timeline constraints
- P(E|~H): Such dramatic executive action without prior signaling is rare
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors H
- Direction: Increases probability slightly

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability of 3% (odds of 3:97 or approximately 1:32).

First update on the extremely short timeline:
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:10 (strongly favors no restrictions)
- Posterior odds = 1:32 × 1:10 = 1:320
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.3%

Second update on lack of legislative/regulatory momentum:
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:5 (strongly favors no restrictions)
- Posterior odds = 1:320 × 1:5 = 1:1600
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.06%

Third update on Meta's investment plans:
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:2 (moderately favors no restrictions)
- Posterior odds = 1:1600 × 1:2 = 1:3200
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.03%

Fourth update on potential executive action:
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 (slightly favors restrictions)
- Posterior odds = 1:3200 × 2:1 = 1:1600
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.06%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence against restrictions being implemented in the next two months.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a "black swan" AI safety event that could trigger emergency action
- Executive powers could be used more aggressively than historical precedent suggests
- The definition of "restrictions" could be interpreted broadly, including very narrow or symbolic measures
- State-level action (e.g., California) could qualify as "US law"

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A targeted restriction affecting only the very largest compute clusters might be more feasible
- National security concerns about foreign access to US compute resources could trigger narrow restrictions
- A "reporting requirement" could evolve into de facto restrictions through regulatory interpretation

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability upward slightly to account for these tail risks and definitional ambiguities. However, the adjustment should be modest given the overwhelming evidence against restrictions in the timeframe.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I estimate a 0.5% probability that the US will place restrictions on total compute capacity before 2026. This reflects:

1. The extremely short timeline (less than 2 months)
2. Absence of any concrete regulatory or legislative proposals
3. Strong economic and political headwinds against such restrictions
4. Technical challenges of defining and implementing compute caps
5. A small allowance for tail risk scenarios like emergency executive action

This forecast aligns with the Manifold market's community forecast of 1.5%, though I assess an even lower probability due to the extremely compressed timeline and lack of any concrete proposals.

Final: 0.5%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the frequency of the US government enacting novel, economically significant, and technically complex domestic regulations on a very short timeline. The reference class is not just any regulation, but one that imposes hard caps on a key input for a major, strategic industry.

*   **Reference Class:** Major, novel domestic technology regulations (e.g., akin to the Clean Air Act or major telecommunications reform).
*   **Reasoning:** Such laws typically involve years of public debate, intense lobbying, and complex legislative processes. The base rate for such a law being conceived of and passed within a two-year period is very low, likely under 5%. The probability of this happening in the less-than-two-month window remaining before 2026 is exceptionally small.
*   **Initial Prior:** A generous prior probability for such an event occurring in the next two months would be around **1%**. This acknowledges that the perceived risks of AI could accelerate policymaking compared to historical examples, but still reflects the immense inertia of the US political system. The prior odds are approximately 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The proposed regulation would face powerful industry opposition, involve significant technical complexity, and run into ideological headwinds concerning free markets, similar to other major regulations.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Timeline (Decreases Probability):** The most critical factor is the extremely short timeline of less than two months. The US legislative process is not designed for such speed on a novel, controversial issue.
    *   **Plausible Mechanism (Changes the Analysis):** Due to the timeline, legislation is virtually impossible. The only plausible path is through an Executive Order (EO), likely citing national security powers (e.g., IEEPA). This shifts the analysis from legislative probability to the probability of a President taking drastic executive action.
    *   **Speed of AI Development (Slightly Increases Probability):** AI capabilities are advancing at an unprecedented rate. This creates a higher potential for a sudden "black swan" event or intelligence finding that could trigger a rapid, non-legislative response, making the situation more volatile than typical regulatory base cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event "US places compute restrictions before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: No existing legislative or serious regulatory proposal.** The research report notes that recent government roadmaps (from a stylized Senate group and NIST) and industry feedback focus on voluntary standards and promoting innovation, not hard caps.
    *   P(E | H) is extremely low. If a restriction were imminent, we would expect to see public proposals, draft EOs, or at least high-level officials advocating for it.
    *   P(E | ~H) is very high. This is the expected state of affairs if no such policy is planned.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This evidence significantly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Immense and unified industry opposition.** Major tech companies are investing hundreds of billions in compute infrastructure (e.g., Meta's announced CapEx increases). They would use their considerable lobbying power to oppose any such restrictions.
    *   P(E | H) is low. For restrictions to be imposed, this opposition would have to be overcome, likely only in a crisis.
    *   P(E | ~H) is high. Industry opposition is a powerful force for maintaining the status quo.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Extremely short timeline (< 2 months).**
    *   P(E | H) is very low. Enacting such a policy requires overcoming immense inertia, which is nearly impossible in this timeframe.
    *   P(E | ~H) is very high. The default outcome of any policy proposal is failure or delay, and a short timeline makes this almost certain.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This is the most powerful piece of evidence against the event occurring.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a 1% prior, the evidence overwhelmingly pushes the probability down. The combination of a short timeline and a complete lack of political or regulatory groundwork is dispositive for any legislative path.

The analysis must focus on the only remaining possibility: a sudden Executive Order. We can estimate its probability by modeling its triggers:
1.  **Reactive EO:** A major, public AI-related catastrophe occurs. Let's estimate the probability of such a crisis in the next two months as low (e.g., 1%), and the probability that the specific response is a compute cap (as opposed to other regulations) as moderate (e.g., 20%). This path yields a probability of 1% * 20% = 0.2%.
2.  **Proactive EO:** The administration acts on secret intelligence about an imminent threat. This is a "known unknown." The probability of a secret plan existing and being executed in the next two months without any prior public signaling is very low, perhaps 0.8%.

Combining these disjoint, low-probability paths gives a posterior probability of approximately 0.2% + 0.8% = 1.0%. This posterior reflects that while the base rate and public evidence suggest a near-zero chance, there is a small, non-zero risk of a sudden executive action.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast is very low (1%), indicating high confidence in a "NO" resolution. Could I be underestimating the probability? The main risk is the "secret national security plan" scenario. A decision could have already been made internally to act before year-end, and the lack of public evidence would be intentional. This is the strongest argument for a higher probability.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** The Manifold market is at 1.5%. This could be due to anchoring from when the question had a longer time horizon, or it could reflect a higher perceived probability of a "black swan" event or secret executive action. While I believe 1.5% is too high given the timeline decay, it serves as a valuable external check against my own model.
*   **Definitional Nuance:** The resolution criteria specify "at least some restrictions." A government could enact a very high, symbolic cap that affects no current actors but still resolves the question as YES. This type of politically palatable but practically weak action is more plausible than a truly restrictive cap, and is factored into my estimate of the probability of an EO.

Considering these points, my estimate of 1% seems like a reasonable balance. It is extremely low, reflecting the immense barriers, but it is not zero, acknowledging the tail risk of a sudden executive action, which is the only plausible path to a "YES" resolution.

### Final Forecast
The final forecast is based on the extremely low prior probability of such a regulation passing in a short timeframe, which is further suppressed by the overwhelming evidence showing a lack of political momentum. The only viable path is an emergency Executive Order, the probability of which is very small but non-zero.

Final: 1%
