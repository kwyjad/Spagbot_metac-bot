### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Q4 Biweekly Returns (2010-2024):** The most direct reference class is the performance difference between CL and ES futures in all biweekly periods during the fourth quarter of the last 15 years. Historically, this period is characterized by high volatility. The mean difference (CL return - ES return) is approximately **-0.5 pp**, with a standard deviation of ~6.0 pp. This suggests a slight historical edge for equities in Q4, but with a very wide range of outcomes.
2.  **December Biweekly Returns (2010-2024):** A narrower reference class focusing only on December. This period often includes the "Santa Claus Rally" for equities, a seasonal tendency for stocks to rise at the end of the year. The base rate for this period is slightly more negative for the spread, around **-1.0 pp**, reflecting the S&P 500's typical year-end strength. Oil returns are driven more by winter demand expectations and OPEC+ decisions, which are less consistently seasonal.
3.  **Returns in a Monetary Easing / Paused Environment:** A reference class based on macroeconomic conditions. Assuming the Federal Reserve has paused or begun cutting rates by late 2025, we can look at similar historical periods. In these environments, risk assets like equities tend to perform well as financial conditions loosen, often outperforming commodities unless the easing is a response to a severe recession. The base rate here is difficult to quantify precisely but suggests a headwind for the CL-ES spread, likely in the **-1.0 to -2.0 pp** range.

*Reasoning:* The Q4 base rate is the broadest and most reliable starting point. The December-specific rate incorporates known seasonality in equity markets. The macro environment class provides a crucial overlay, as monetary policy is a dominant driver. The high standard deviation across all classes is a key limitation, indicating that short-term returns are very noisy and sensitive to specific news flow.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-14** EIA raises 2025 US oil production forecast. (↓) — Matters because higher-than-expected non-OPEC supply adds to a global glut, putting downward pressure on crude prices.
*   **2025-10-05** OPEC+ meeting concludes with no change to production policy. (↔/↓) — Matters because holding production steady in an oversupplied market is implicitly bearish for prices. A cut was needed to be bullish.
*   **2025-09-15** US inflation data for August comes in cooler than expected. (↓) — Matters because it reinforces the "soft landing" narrative, boosting equities (ES) more than oil, thus widening the negative spread.
*   **2025-09-01** EIA report highlights Permian basin as key driver of strong 2025 US output. (↓) — Matters because it confirms the structural nature of high US production, limiting upside for oil prices.
*   **2025-07-10** Earlier EIA report notes a slowdown in drilling activity. (↑) — Matters because it was an early signal of potential supply tightening, but has since been superseded by upward revisions to production forecasts.
*   **2025-05-16** J.P. Morgan reiterates bearish 2025 oil forecast ($66 Brent). (↓) — Matters because it reflects a strong institutional consensus around weak demand and oversupply, weighing on market sentiment for crude.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Global Oil Supply/Demand Balance:** The primary driver for CL prices. Consensus forecasts (EIA, JPM, World Bank) point to a significant supply glut in 2025 due to strong non-OPEC production and tepid demand growth. *Impact: Large*
2.  **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** The primary driver for ES prices. By late 2025, the market will be highly sensitive to the Fed's stance. A dovish pivot or rate cuts would likely boost equities significantly. A hawkish surprise would hurt them. *Impact: Large*
3.  **US Economic Health (Growth & Inflation):** A "soft landing" scenario (slowing inflation, resilient growth) is bullish for ES but only moderately supportive for CL (as global, not just US, demand matters). A recession would be bearish for both, but likely more so for oil due to its high sensitivity to industrial activity. *Impact: Moderate*
4.  **Geopolitical Events:** Unforeseen supply disruptions (e.g., conflict escalation in the Middle East, major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico) could cause a sharp, sudden spike in oil prices, overriding other factors. *Impact: Large (but low probability)*
5.  **Market Sentiment & Seasonality:** Year-end portfolio rebalancing and the "Santa Claus Rally" phenomenon typically provide a tailwind for the S&P 500 in December. This is a seasonal headwind for the CL-ES spread. *Impact: Small to Moderate*

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Consensus Oil Oversupply:** Unlike a typical year with a balanced market, 2025 is widely expected to feature a historic oil glut. The provided sources from the World Bank, EIA, and J.P. Morgan are unanimous on this point, creating a strong structural headwind for crude prices not present in the average year of the reference class.
*   **Post-Hike Monetary Environment:** The market is in a specific, late-cycle phase. Whereas the base rate averages across hiking, pausing, and cutting cycles, the late 2025 environment is almost certainly post-peak rates. This specific context is historically more favorable for equities than commodities.
*   **Record US Oil Production:** The role of the US as a marginal producer is more significant than in much of the historical reference period. EIA forecasts of 13.5M+ bpd act as a powerful cap on global prices, reducing the pricing power of OPEC+.
*   **Tepid Global Demand:** Forecasts from the IEA and others point to slowing demand growth, particularly from China and Europe. This contrasts with periods in the reference class characterized by synchronized global expansion.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the historical December base rate of **-1.0 pp** seems appropriate, with low confidence (equivalent n≈10) to reflect the high historical volatility. The distribution should be wide and heavy-tailed.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Overwhelming consensus from multiple sources (EIA, JPM, World Bank) on a significant oil supply glut in 2025.
    *   (↓ Moderate) A likely dovish/paused Fed stance in late 2025, which typically provides a stronger tailwind for equities than for oil.
    *   (↓ Small) Known equity market seasonality ("Santa Claus Rally") in late December provides a headwind for this spread.
    *   (↔/↓ Small) Geopolitical risk premium for oil appears low, with markets pricing in existing conflicts and the supply glut seen as a buffer against disruptions.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests oil will underperform the S&P 500. The posterior mean should be shifted significantly lower (more negative) than the prior, perhaps into the -2.0 to -4.0 pp range, while acknowledging the high variance.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (CL > ES):**
    *   Surprise coordinated production cut announcement from the next OPEC+ meeting.
    *   Major unplanned supply outage in a key producing region (e.g., Middle East, Russia, US Gulf Coast).
    *   Stronger-than-expected PMI data from China and Europe, signaling a rebound in industrial demand.
    *   Hawkish Fed commentary, suggesting rates will stay higher for longer, which could damage equities more than oil.
*   **DOWN indicators (CL < ES):**
    *   Weekly EIA reports showing larger-than-expected builds in US crude inventories.
    *   Downward revisions to global GDP or oil demand growth forecasts from major agencies (IEA, IMF).
    *   Weaker-than-expected US corporate earnings guidance for Q1 2026.
    *   A de-escalation of geopolitical tensions currently supporting a risk premium in oil.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Extreme Volatility:** Two-week returns for both assets are highly volatile. The outcome can be dominated by a single day's news, making the signal-to-noise ratio very low.
*   **Geopolitical Black Swans:** The forecast is based on the current geopolitical landscape. A sudden escalation of conflict in the Middle East could render all fundamental supply/demand analysis moot and cause oil to spike dramatically.
*   **Forecasts are not Fate:** The entire bearish case for oil relies on forecasts of oversupply and weak demand. If these prove incorrect (e.g., demand recovers faster than expected), the outcome could be reversed.
*   **Timing of Seasonality:** The "Santa Claus Rally" is a tendency, not a certainty. Its timing can vary, and it might not materialize at all in a given year. The Dec 8-19 period is slightly ahead of the traditional rally window (last 5 days of Dec).

**Final Research Summary:**
The consensus outlook for late 2025 points to a significant oil supply glut and tepid global demand, creating a strong headwind for crude prices. Combined with a likely favorable monetary policy environment and positive seasonality for the S&P 500, crude oil is positioned to significantly underperform equities during this period.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the difference in returns between Crude Oil Futures and S&P 500 Futures for the period of December 8 to December 19, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate for this forecast is the historical difference in returns between Crude Oil Futures (CL) and S&P 500 Futures (ES) during the fourth quarter, specifically focusing on December. Historically, the mean difference for December is around **-1.0 pp**, with a standard deviation of approximately 6.0 pp. This base rate reflects the typical year-end strength of equities due to the "Santa Claus Rally" and the less consistent seasonality in oil prices.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the seasonal tendency for equities to outperform in December. However, it differs significantly due to the anticipated oil supply glut in 2025, which is not typical for the historical reference period. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment, with a likely dovish Federal Reserve stance, favors equities more than commodities.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Oil Supply Glut (↓ Large):** The consensus on a significant oil supply glut in 2025 strongly suggests lower crude prices, making higher outcomes for the CL-ES spread less likely.
- **Dovish Fed Stance (↓ Moderate):** A dovish monetary policy environment typically boosts equities, further supporting a negative spread.
- **Seasonality (↓ Small):** The "Santa Claus Rally" provides a small additional headwind for the CL-ES spread.
- **Geopolitical Risks (↔/↓ Small):** Current geopolitical risks appear low, with the supply glut acting as a buffer against potential disruptions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered on **-1.0 pp**, the overwhelming evidence of an oil supply glut and favorable conditions for equities shifts the posterior mean lower. Given the evidence, the posterior distribution is adjusted to reflect a more negative mean, likely in the range of **-2.0 to -4.0 pp**, while maintaining a high variance due to inherent volatility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Considering potential blind spots, such as unexpected geopolitical events or a stronger-than-expected rebound in global demand, the forecast should account for tail risks. However, the current evidence strongly supports a negative spread. An alternative forecast might consider a less severe oil glut or a weaker equity rally, but the consensus and current indicators do not support this scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the forecast are:

P10: -8.0  
P20: -6.0  
P40: -3.5  
P60: -2.0  
P80: 0.0  
P90: 2.0

# Forecasting Crude Oil Futures vs S&P 500 Futures Returns (Dec 8-19, 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the December biweekly returns reference class as my primary base rate, which shows a historical mean difference (CL return - ES return) of approximately -1.0 percentage points with a standard deviation of about 6.0 percentage points. This means that, on average, S&P 500 futures outperform crude oil futures by about 1 percentage point during December biweekly periods.

This base rate is appropriate because:
- It captures the specific seasonal dynamics of December trading
- It includes the "Santa Claus Rally" effect for equities
- It reflects typical winter demand patterns for oil
- It has sufficient historical data (15 years of December biweekly periods)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're looking at the same calendar period (December)
- Both assets remain subject to similar market mechanics and trading patterns
- Year-end portfolio rebalancing effects are likely similar

**Differences from base rate:**
- 2025 features an unusually strong consensus about oil oversupply (multiple sources indicate a "historic oil glut")
- Record US oil production (13.5M+ bpd) is creating a structural ceiling on prices
- The monetary policy environment is likely post-peak rates, which historically favors equities
- Global oil demand growth appears weaker than historical averages, particularly from China and Europe

These differences collectively suggest a more negative spread (greater S&P outperformance) than the historical average.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring more negative spread (CL < ES):**
- Multiple authoritative sources (EIA, JPM, World Bank) forecast significant oil oversupply in 2025 (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring more negative spread)
- Recent EIA upward revision to US production forecast (Oct 14, 2025) reinforces the supply glut narrative (likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- OPEC+ maintaining production levels despite oversupply (Oct 5, 2025) suggests limited price support (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)
- Cooler-than-expected US inflation data (Sept 15, 2025) supports the "soft landing" narrative, which typically benefits equities more than commodities (likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- December seasonality typically favors equities ("Santa Claus Rally") (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)

**Evidence favoring less negative or positive spread (CL > ES):**
- Some earlier signals of drilling activity slowdown (July 10, 2025), though this has been superseded by more recent data (likelihood ratio ~1:1.2 against more negative spread)
- Potential geopolitical premium for oil, though this appears low given the supply buffer (likelihood ratio ~1:1.1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior distribution centered at -1.0 pp with a standard deviation of 6.0 pp, I'll update based on the evidence:

Combined likelihood ratio favoring more negative spread: ~3 × 2 × 1.5 × 2 × 1.5 ÷ (1.2 × 1.1) ≈ 12:1

This strong evidence shifts my posterior distribution significantly:
- Posterior mean moves from -1.0 pp to approximately -3.0 pp
- The variance remains high due to the inherent volatility of biweekly returns
- The distribution becomes slightly more skewed, with a longer left tail (possibility of extreme underperformance of oil)

This update reflects that the evidence collectively points to oil significantly underperforming the S&P 500 during this period, beyond what we'd expect from historical seasonality alone.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent consensus forecasts, which could be wrong if unexpected demand materializes
- Geopolitical risks are inherently unpredictable and could cause sudden oil price spikes
- The timing of the "Santa Claus Rally" varies year to year and might not align with Dec 8-19
- Two-week returns are extremely noisy, and single news events can dominate fundamentals

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 0 pp or even slightly positive, based on:
- Potential for a surprise OPEC+ production cut announcement
- Possible geopolitical escalation in the Middle East
- Market might have already priced in the bearish oil outlook, limiting further downside
- Potential for disappointing economic data hurting equities more than oil

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The weight of evidence from multiple sources on the oil supply glut is unusually strong, and the monetary policy environment is likely to favor equities. However, I should widen my distribution to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: -9.5
P20: -6.5
P40: -3.5
P60: -2.0
P80: 1.0
P90: 4.0

Answering the question: How much will Crude Oil Futures total price returns exceed S&P 500 Futures's in these biweekly periods of Q4 2025? (Dec 8 - Dec 19)
Units: pp

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the historical performance difference between Crude Oil futures (CL) and S&P 500 futures (ES) during similar periods. I will use the December biweekly returns from 2010-2024 as my primary prior.
- **Reference Class:** CL return - ES return, biweekly periods in December (2010-2024).
- **Reasoning:** This period captures specific seasonal effects, most notably the "Santa Claus Rally" which tends to benefit equities, providing a more accurate starting point than a general all-year or Q4 base rate.
- **Prior Distribution:** The research report indicates a mean for this period of approximately **-1.0 percentage points (pp)**. The historical standard deviation for biweekly returns is very high, around **6.0 pp**. My prior is therefore a wide distribution centered at -1.0 pp, reflecting a slight historical edge for equities but with high uncertainty. `Prior ~ N(μ = -1.0, σ = 6.0)`.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The forecast period is a biweekly window in December, so the seasonal dynamics present in the base rate are applicable. The high intrinsic volatility of short-term returns for both assets is a constant feature.
- **Differences:**
    1.  **Oil Market Fundamentals:** Unlike an average year in the reference period, the consensus forecast for 2025 is for a significant, potentially historic, oil supply glut. This is driven by record non-OPEC (especially U.S.) production and forecasts of tepid global demand growth. This creates a strong structural headwind for crude oil prices not present in the historical average.
    2.  **Monetary Policy Environment:** The base rate averages across various monetary cycles. Late 2025 is distinctly a post-hiking cycle environment, with markets anticipating or experiencing Federal Reserve rate cuts. This is historically a strong tailwind for equities (ES) as financial conditions loosen, more so than for commodities like oil.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **(↓ Large) Consensus on Oil Oversupply:** The research report compiles evidence from the EIA, J.P. Morgan, and the World Bank, all pointing to a major supply glut in 2025. This is the most powerful piece of evidence and makes lower (more negative) outcomes for the `CL - ES` spread much more likely.
- **(↓ Moderate) Favorable Macro for Equities:** A paused or cutting Fed in late 2025 is a significant tailwind for the S&P 500. This boosts the denominator in the `CL - ES` calculation, pushing the spread downward.
- **(↓ Small) Equity Seasonality:** The "Santa Claus Rally" phenomenon, already reflected in the prior's negative mean, is reinforced by the positive macro backdrop. This provides a small, additional downward pressure.
- **(↔/↓ Small) Geopolitical Risk Premium:** The supply glut is seen as a buffer against potential geopolitical disruptions, likely reducing the risk premium priced into oil compared to other times in the historical period. This removes a potential source of upside for CL.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihoods
- **Step 1: Incorporate Oil Fundamentals.** Starting with the prior mean of -1.0 pp, the overwhelming evidence of an oil glut is a major downward update. This shifts my central estimate significantly lower, to roughly -3.5 pp.
- **Step 2: Incorporate Macro Environment.** The pro-equity monetary policy backdrop provides a further downward push. This boosts ES performance relative to CL, shifting the mean further down by another 1.0 pp to approximately -4.5 pp.
- **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution is now centered at **-4.5 pp**. The variance remains very high (σ ≈ 6.0 pp) because the forecast is for a short, two-week period where random news can dominate. The evidence suggests a distribution that is strongly shifted into negative territory compared to the historical average.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible alternative is that the bearish oil fundamentals and bullish equity macro view are already fully priced in by the market. In this efficient market view, the expected outperformance would be near zero, and the result would be random noise around that center.
- **Rebuttal:** While markets are forward-looking, persistent fundamental pressures (like a year-long supply glut) and seasonal flows are not always perfectly priced in. The sheer weight of the one-sided consensus suggests a real headwind for oil remains.
- **Tail Risks:** The biggest risk to this forecast is a "black swan" geopolitical event (e.g., a major conflict escalation in the Middle East) that causes a sudden oil price spike. This would cause a large positive outcome. This suggests the distribution should have a fatter right tail than a normal distribution would imply (right-skewed). I will adjust my percentiles to reflect this, making the upside (P90) further from the median than the downside (P10).

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is centered at a median of -4.5 pp, reflecting the strong fundamental headwinds for crude oil relative to the S&P 500. The distribution is wide to account for high volatility and slightly right-skewed to account for the asymmetric risk of a geopolitical oil price spike.

P10: -12.0
P20: -9.5
P40: -6.0
P60: -3.0
P80: 1.0
P90: 4.0
