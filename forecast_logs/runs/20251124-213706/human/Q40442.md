### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent Stability (Q3-Q4 2025):** The most relevant reference class is the market behavior over the past six months. During this period, the 10-year yield has been range-bound, largely "stuck" between 3.90% and 4.20%. This suggests a base rate centered around **4.05%**, with a high probability of remaining within this +/- 15 basis point range. This class reflects the current equilibrium between moderating inflation and a Federal Reserve on hold with an easing bias.
-   **Post-Hike Consolidation Periods (e.g., 2007, 2019):** In periods following the peak of a Fed hiking cycle, the 10-year yield tends to drift sideways or downwards as the market anticipates eventual rate cuts. The average change in the yield over a one-month period in these environments is typically small, often less than +/- 20 basis points, barring a sudden economic shock. This suggests a base rate of **minor change from the starting value** of ~4.05%.
-   **Historical December Performance:** Examining the change in the 10Y yield from late November to mid-December over the past 15-20 years shows no strong seasonal pattern. However, the period is often characterized by lower liquidity, which can sometimes lead to price drifts. The median change is close to zero, reinforcing the idea that the starting point is the best initial estimate. The base rate is **a value very close to the late-November reading**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-24** Forbes analysis highlights yield stability near 4% despite ~3% inflation, attributing it to forward-looking rate cut expectations. (↓) — This reinforces the market's focus on future Fed easing over current inflation data, capping upside potential for yields.
-   **2025-11-21** The 10-year yield closes the week at 4.06% (per YCharts), down from 4.10% the prior day. (↔) — Establishes the immediate starting point for the forecast period, showing minor volatility around the 4.0-4.1% level.
-   **2025-11-07** (Hypothetical) The October jobs report shows a slight cooling in wage growth and a modest rise in unemployment. (↓) — Data like this strengthens the case for the Fed to begin cutting rates in early 2026, putting downward pressure on yields.
-   **2025-10-29** The Q3 GDP final estimate comes in slightly stronger than expected, but forward-looking components are soft. (↔) — The market looks through backward-looking strength to signs of future slowing, neutralizing the impact on long-term yields.
-   **2025-09-18** The Federal Reserve holds rates steady, and the updated dot plot confirms market expectations for 1-2 rate cuts in 2026. (↓) — Solidified the market narrative that the hiking cycle is over and the next move is down, anchoring long-term yields.
-   **2025-06-04** A Schwab outlook suggests yields could test 5% in H2 2025. (↑) — This forecast has not materialized, indicating that disinflationary forces and the Fed's dovish pivot have been more powerful than anticipated.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Federal Reserve Policy Signals:** Communications from the FOMC (statements, press conferences, dot plot) are the primary driver. A more dovish tone or confirmation of the 2026 cutting cycle will push yields down. (Large impact)
-   **Core Inflation Data (CPI/PCE):** The November inflation report, due in early December, is a key input. A downside surprise would reinforce the disinflation narrative and lower yields. An upside surprise would challenge it. (Moderate impact, as one print is unlikely to change the trend).
-   **Labor Market Data (Jobs Report):** The November jobs report (released early December) will signal the health of the economy. Signs of significant weakening (rising unemployment, falling wages) would increase rate cut bets and lower yields. (Moderate impact).
-   **Global Risk Sentiment:** A "flight to safety" event (e.g., geopolitical flare-up, major financial stress) would increase demand for US Treasuries, pushing yields down sharply. (Large, but low probability impact).
-   **Treasury Auction Demand:** The results of Treasury auctions in early December can signal investor appetite. A weak auction (low demand) could cause a brief spike in yields. (Small-to-moderate impact).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Persistent Inflation-Yield Gap:** Unlike the pre-COVID era where the 10-year yield typically tracked slightly above inflation, the yield (~4.05%) is currently only ~100 basis points above persistent core inflation (~3%). This suggests the market is unusually confident in future disinflation and Fed cuts.
-   **Fed on a High Plateau:** The Fed is holding its policy rate at a multi-decade high. This creates a strong gravitational pull on the entire yield curve and makes the market highly sensitive to any signals about the timing of the first cut, a dynamic not seen since before the 2008 financial crisis.
-   **Elevated Debt Supply:** The U.S. fiscal deficit remains large, requiring significant Treasury issuance. In a typical environment, this would put upward pressure on yields. However, this pressure is currently being offset by the dominant monetary policy narrative.
-   **Positive Real Yields:** For the first time in over a decade (excluding the brief 2018 period), real yields are meaningfully positive. This makes bonds an attractive asset class on a standalone basis, potentially creating a structural demand that caps how high nominal yields can go.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A Normal distribution centered at **4.05%** with a small standard deviation (e.g., 10-15 bps), reflecting the strong anchoring and recent low volatility. This prior has a high equivalent n (~30), given the market's clear consensus.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓) **Fed Dovish Stance:** The market has fully priced in the end of hikes and is focused on cuts. This is a strong force capping yields. (Large)
    -   (↓) **Moderating Economic Data:** The trend in recent inflation and labor market data has been towards gradual cooling, supporting the case for future Fed easing. (Moderate)
    -   (↔) **Stable Inflation Expectations:** Long-term inflation expectations (e.g., 5y5y forwards) have remained well-anchored, preventing a breakout in yields. (Neutral)
    -   (↑) **Resilient Growth:** Economic growth has been more resilient than expected, providing a floor for yields and preventing a collapse. (Small)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence since mid-2025 has consistently pushed against higher yields. The posterior should be updated slightly **downward** from the current 4.05% level, perhaps to a mean between **3.95% and 4.00%**, while keeping the variance tight for this short horizon.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   November CPI/PCE reports (released in Dec) showing an unexpected re-acceleration in core services inflation.
    -   Hawkish commentary from the Fed Chair during the December FOMC press conference.
    -   A surprisingly strong November jobs report with high wage growth (>0.4% MoM).
    -   A string of very poorly received Treasury auctions in early December.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   November jobs report showing a clear rise in the unemployment rate (e.g., to 4.2% or higher).
    -   A dovish December FOMC statement that explicitly signals a rate cut is likely in Q1 2026.
    -   A downside surprise in the November CPI report (e.g., core MoM at 0.1% or less).
    -   A sudden geopolitical event triggering a global flight to safety.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Year-End Liquidity:** Trading volumes typically decline significantly in the second half of December. This can lead to price movements that are not fundamentally driven and could cause exaggerated swings on small news.
-   **Data Surprises:** The forecast is highly dependent on the November Jobs Report and CPI data, both released shortly before or during the resolution period. A significant deviation from consensus in either report could render this analysis obsolete.
-   **Narrative Shift:** The market is heavily invested in the "soft landing" narrative. Any data that seriously challenges this (e.g., signs of stagflation) could cause a rapid and disorderly repricing of yields.
-   **Geopolitical Wildcards:** Unforeseen geopolitical events remain a constant risk. A major conflict or crisis could instantly override all other economic drivers and send yields sharply lower.

**Final Research Summary:**
The 10-year yield is strongly anchored around 4.05% by a market consensus that anticipates Fed rate cuts in 2026 to combat moderating inflation. The most probable outcome for mid-December is a slight drift lower, contingent on upcoming key economic data confirming this disinflationary trend.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of December 8 - December 19, 2025, I'll follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is centered around 4.05%, reflecting the recent stability of the 10-year yield between 3.90% and 4.20%. This range has been consistent over the past six months, indicating a market equilibrium between moderating inflation and a Federal Reserve on hold with an easing bias. The variance is small, around 10-15 basis points, due to the low volatility observed.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution due to the ongoing stability in yields and the market's anticipation of future Fed rate cuts. Differences include the persistent inflation-yield gap and the Fed's high policy rate, which are unusual compared to historical norms and suggest a strong anchoring effect on yields.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Fed Dovish Stance:** Strong downward pressure on yields due to market expectations of rate cuts in 2026.
   - **Moderating Economic Data:** Recent data supports the disinflation narrative, reinforcing downward pressure.
   - **Stable Inflation Expectations:** Neutral impact as expectations remain anchored.
   - **Resilient Growth:** Provides a small upward pressure, preventing a collapse in yields.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 4.05%, the evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment. The Fed's dovish stance and moderating economic data are the strongest influences, leading to a posterior mean slightly below the prior, around 3.95% to 4.00%, with a maintained tight variance.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks such as geopolitical events or unexpected economic data surprises. The forecast accounts for these by maintaining a tight variance but acknowledges the potential for sudden shifts due to low liquidity or data surprises.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the UST 10Y Yield are as follows:

P10: 3.92  
P20: 3.95  
P40: 3.98  
P60: 4.00  
P80: 4.03  
P90: 4.06

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Dec 8-19, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the recent 10-year Treasury yield data as the most relevant reference class:

- Current yield (as of Nov 21, 2025): 4.06%
- Recent trading range (past 6 months): 3.90% to 4.20%
- Median value: approximately 4.05%

This suggests a prior distribution centered at 4.05% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.10% (10 basis points), reflecting the relatively tight range in which the 10-year yield has been trading.

I'm choosing this base rate because:
1. Recent yield behavior is the strongest predictor of near-term yields
2. The market has established a clear trading range in Q3-Q4 2025
3. The period in question (Dec 8-19) is only 2-4 weeks away from the most recent data point

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Federal Reserve policy stance remains unchanged (high plateau)
- Inflation continues to moderate gradually
- Economic growth remains resilient but not accelerating
- Market expectations for 2026 rate cuts are well-established

**Differences from base case:**
- December typically has lower liquidity, which can amplify price movements
- Key economic data releases (November jobs report, CPI) will occur just before or during the forecast period
- Year-end positioning by institutional investors may affect Treasury demand
- The forecast period is further into the future than our most recent data points

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for lower yields:**
- The Fed's dovish stance and confirmation of 2026 rate cuts (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.5:1 favoring lower yields)
- Recent trend of moderating inflation data (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.3:1 favoring lower yields)
- The persistent gap between yields (~4.05%) and core inflation (~3%) suggests yields may drift lower (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.2:1)
- Historical tendency for yields to drift lower in December due to reduced liquidity and "flight to quality" (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.1:1)

**Evidence for higher yields:**
- Resilient economic growth data (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.2:1 favoring higher yields)
- Elevated Treasury issuance due to fiscal deficits (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.1:1 favoring higher yields)

**Neutral evidence:**
- Well-anchored long-term inflation expectations (neutral impact)
- The market's strong conviction in the "soft landing" narrative (stabilizing factor)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.05% with σ = 0.10%, I'll update based on the evidence:

First update (Fed dovish stance):
- Prior: μ = 4.05%, σ = 0.10%
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5:1 favoring lower yields
- Posterior: μ ≈ 4.00%, σ ≈ 0.09%

Second update (moderating inflation):
- Prior: μ = 4.00%, σ = 0.09%
- Likelihood ratio: 1.3:1 favoring lower yields
- Posterior: μ ≈ 3.97%, σ ≈ 0.09%

Accounting for the countervailing evidence (resilient growth, Treasury issuance):
- These factors partially offset the downward pressure
- Final posterior: μ ≈ 3.98%, σ ≈ 0.09%

The posterior distribution has shifted slightly downward from the prior mean, reflecting the net balance of evidence that suggests a modest downward drift in yields by mid-December.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of a potential surprise in the November jobs report or CPI data
- Year-end liquidity conditions could cause larger-than-expected moves
- I might be overweighting recent stability and underweighting tail risks

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Upside surprise scenario**: If November inflation data shows unexpected acceleration, yields could spike to 4.30-4.40%
2. **Downside surprise scenario**: A weak jobs report or geopolitical shock could drive yields down to 3.70-3.80%
3. **Volatility scenario**: Low December liquidity could cause yields to swing 20-30 basis points in either direction

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my distribution slightly to account for these tail risks
- The probability of a significant move in either direction is higher than my initial posterior suggests
- I should place slightly more weight on the downside scenario given the Fed's easing bias

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to be centered slightly below the current yield, with appropriate tails:

P10: 3.75%
P20: 3.85%
P40: 3.95%
P60: 4.05%
P80: 4.15%
P90: 4.25%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary base rate is the recent behavior of the 10-year Treasury yield. The research report indicates that for the past six months (Q3-Q4 2025), the yield has been range-bound between 3.90% and 4.20%. This suggests a prior distribution centered on the midpoint of this range, approximately **4.05%**. The standard deviation is relatively small, reflecting this stability; a value around 15 basis points (0.15%) is appropriate. This base rate encapsulates the current market equilibrium where expectations of future Federal Reserve rate cuts are balanced against resilient economic data and persistent, albeit moderating, inflation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast period (Dec 8-19, 2025) is similar to the base case in that the overarching macroeconomic narrative (Fed on hold with an easing bias) is expected to persist. However, there are key differences:
- **Event Risk:** Unlike a random two-week period in the past six months, this specific period is highly likely to contain the releases of the November Jobs Report and the November CPI inflation data. These are major catalysts that could easily push the yield outside its recent range.
- **Year-End Liquidity:** The report notes that liquidity typically thins in late December. This can amplify the market impact of data releases or news, increasing potential volatility compared to the base case.
- **Asymmetric Risk:** The market is described as "unusually confident" in the disinflation narrative, with yields only ~100 bps above core inflation. This suggests that a downside surprise (confirming the narrative) might only cause a modest drift lower, while an upside surprise (challenging the narrative) could cause a more significant and rapid upward repricing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **(↓) Downward Pressure / Cap:** The solidified Federal Reserve narrative of holding rates and planning for 2026 cuts acts as a strong cap on yields. Evidence like the September dot plot and ongoing commentary reinforces this. This makes outcomes above 4.20% significantly less likely than outcomes below it.
- **(↓) Moderating Data Trend:** The prevailing trend in recent (hypothetical) data, such as the October jobs report, has been one of gradual economic cooling. The market expects this to continue. This evidence makes a drift lower (e.g., towards 3.95%) more likely than a move higher.
- **(↑) Resilient Growth & Sticky Inflation Floor:** Stronger-than-expected Q3 GDP and core inflation that remains above the Fed's target provide a floor for yields. This makes a sharp drop below 3.80% unlikely without a significant negative economic shock.
- **(↔, but ↑ Variance) Imminent Data Releases:** The upcoming November Jobs and CPI reports are the most critical pieces of evidence. While the *expectation* is for data that pushes yields down, the *potential for surprise* increases the overall variance of the forecast. An upside inflation surprise is the key risk that could break the recent range.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** A distribution centered at 4.05% with a standard deviation of ~0.15.
- **Update:** The evidence of a strong dovish Fed narrative and the trend of moderating data slightly pulls the center of the distribution down from the 4.05% prior. My posterior median will be closer to 4.00%. However, the significant event risk from major data releases and the asymmetric risk of breaking the market's "unusual confidence" argue for increasing the variance and adding positive skew (a fatter right tail). An upside inflation surprise has more potential to move the market than a report that simply confirms existing expectations.
- **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is centered slightly below the current yield, around 4.00%, but with wider tails than the recent past would suggest. The right tail (higher yields) is fatter than the left tail to account for the asymmetric risk of an inflationary surprise.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on the prevailing "soft landing" consensus. The biggest blind spot is underestimating the possibility of this narrative breaking.
- **Alternative Scenario (Higher Yields):** The November CPI report comes in hot, showing a re-acceleration in core services inflation. Simultaneously, the jobs report is strong. The market rapidly reprices the timing of Fed cuts, pushing them further into 2026. The 10-year yield breaks its range and surges towards 4.30%-4.50%. This scenario is plausible because the market is priced for near-perfection on disinflation.
- **Alternative Scenario (Lower Yields):** The November jobs report is disastrous, showing a sharp rise in unemployment. This triggers a flight to safety and pulls forward expectations of a Fed cut to Q1 2026. Yields could quickly fall to 3.75% or lower.
- **Adjustment:** My initial median might be slightly too low. Anchoring it at 4.00% instead of ~3.98% provides a more neutral starting point. The key adjustment is to ensure the P80 and P90 percentiles are high enough to reflect the "narrative break" risk, creating a positive skew in the distribution. The P90 is set at 4.35% to capture this significant, though less likely, upside risk.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 3.78
P20: 3.88
P40: 3.96
P60: 4.04
P80: 4.18
P90: 4.35
