### **Research Plan**

1.  **Core Questions:**
    *   What is the legal and constitutional basis for extending martial law in Ukraine? What conditions must be met?
    *   What is the current status of the Russo-Ukrainian war, and what is the near-term prognosis for its cessation before November 5, 2025?
    *   What is the political calculus for President Zelenskyy and the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) regarding another extension? What are the incentives and disincentives?
    *   What is the historical pattern of martial law extensions since February 2022?
    *   Is there any significant domestic or international pressure to end martial law?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `"Ukraine constitution" "martial law" extension process`
    *   `"Russo-Ukrainian War" current status OR "frontline update" October 2025`
    *   `prospects for Ukraine peace talks 2025`
    *   `Zelenskyy approval rating trend 2025`
    *   `Verkhovna Rada votes on martial law extension history`
    *   `US policy Ukraine Trump administration elections`
    *   `EU position Ukrainian martial law elections`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The legal mechanism for extension is well-established: the President proposes, and the Rada approves. This has happened 16 times without fail.
    *   The primary condition for martial law is the ongoing state of war and threat to Ukrainian sovereignty. Sources confirm Russia still occupies ~20% of Ukraine and the conflict is active as of late 2025. There is no indication of a peace settlement before the November 5 deadline.
    *   Politically, extending martial law is the path of least resistance. It is essential for mobilization and wartime governance. Ending it would trigger a constitutional requirement to hold elections, which is logistically impossible and politically destabilizing during an existential war.
    *   The historical pattern is one of perfect, routine renewal every 90 days. There has been no deviation.
    *   International pressure is focused on the war's outcome and anti-corruption measures, not on ending martial law prematurely. Domestic dissent exists (e.g., on corruption) but does not target the necessity of martial law itself.

4.  **Drafting the Brief:** The synthesized findings will be structured into the required format below.

***

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Ukraine's Own Martial Law Extensions (2022-2025):** This is the most specific and relevant reference class. Since the shift to 90-day extensions in May 2022, the Verkhovna Rada has approved every single presidential request for extension. There have been 16 extensions in total.
    *   **Base Rate:** 16 out of 16 extensions have been approved, yielding a historical base rate of **100%**. This is an "inside view" but reflects an extremely strong and unbroken precedent under the specific conditions of this war.
2.  **States of Emergency During Major Interstate Wars:** This class includes nations that have invoked emergency powers during large-scale, existential conflicts (e.g., UK in WWII). In such cases, emergency powers are almost never rescinded while major hostilities are ongoing.
    *   **Base Rate:** The probability of a nation voluntarily ending wartime emergency powers *before* the cessation of major hostilities is extremely low, estimated at **<5%**. The primary driver for lifting such measures is the end of the war itself.
3.  **Post-Soviet States' Use of Martial Law:** This class is broader and less applicable. It often involves internal conflicts, coups, or suppression of dissent, rather than a full-scale defensive war against a foreign invader. The drivers and legitimacy differ significantly.
    *   **Base Rate:** Highly variable and not a useful prior for this specific question. This case's context (defensive war, democratic oversight) makes it a poor fit.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-15** CFR report notes Russia still occupies ~20% of Ukraine and the war is ongoing. — **↑** — The fundamental justification for martial law—the state of war—remains unchanged and intense.
*   **2025-08-07** Gallup poll shows Zelenskyy's approval rating has stabilized at 67%. — **↑** — While down from its peak, this represents a strong majority, indicating sufficient political capital to continue essential wartime policies like martial law.
*   **2025-08-07** AP reports on anti-corruption protests, showing limits to public deference. — **↓ (small)** — Indicates civil society is active and can pressure the government, but protests targeted specific policies, not the overarching necessity of martial law for the war effort.
*   **2025-02-25** Ukraine's parliament unanimously passes a resolution affirming Zelenskyy's legitimacy. — **↑ (large)** — Demonstrates overwhelming institutional consensus on the constitutionality of postponing elections under martial law, removing a key potential avenue for political challenge.
*   **2025-01-03** Zelenskyy signals a focus on working with the Trump administration to end the war. — **↑** — Shows the strategic focus is on war termination and security guarantees, not on altering the domestic legal framework (martial law) needed to prosecute the war.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **State of the War (Large ↑):** This is the primary driver. As long as Ukraine is in a state of active, large-scale war with a foreign power occupying its territory, the functional need for martial law (e.g., for mobilization, curfews, resource allocation) is non-negotiable.
2.  **Legal & Political Path Dependency (Large ↑):** The procedure for extension is routine and has been executed 16 times. Deviating from this pattern would be a major political and legal disruption. The default action is extension.
3.  **Requirement to Hold Elections (Large ↑):** The Ukrainian constitution requires elections to be held shortly after martial law is lifted. Holding national elections during the war is considered logistically impossible and politically perilous. This creates a powerful incentive to maintain martial law until hostilities cease.
4.  **Domestic Political Consensus (Moderate ↑):** Despite some internal friction on issues like corruption or mobilization specifics, there is a broad consensus among the political elite and the public on the necessity of martial law to confront the invasion. The unanimous parliamentary vote on legitimacy underscores this.
5.  **International Pressure (Neutral/Small ↑):** Key allies (US, EU) are focused on Ukraine's military effectiveness and stability. While they support Ukraine's democracy long-term, there is no significant pressure to lift martial law and hold elections *during* the war. Stability is prioritized.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Defensive War Context:** Unlike many cases of martial law used for internal power consolidation, Ukraine's is a response to a full-scale foreign invasion. This provides it with high domestic and international legitimacy.
*   **Democratic Oversight:** The extensions are not indefinite; they are for fixed 90-day periods and require repeated parliamentary approval, maintaining a key feature of democratic accountability.
*   **Unbroken Precedent:** The sheer number of consecutive, uncontroversial extensions (16) creates an exceptionally strong precedent that is rare in the broader reference class of emergency powers.
*   **Lack of Viable Alternative:** There is no proposed alternative legal framework that would allow the state to function effectively in wartime. Ending martial law is functionally equivalent to a declaration that the war is over, which is factually incorrect.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own history, suggesting a prior near 99%. The strength of this prior is high (equivalent n > 20) due to the perfect and unbroken sequence of 16 prior extensions under nearly identical circumstances.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The war, the primary justification, continues unabated.
    *   (↑ Large) The legal and political process is routine, creating powerful inertia.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The alternative (lifting martial law and triggering elections) is universally seen as untenable.
    *   (↑ Small) Domestic political support for leadership is stable and sufficient.
    *   (↓ Tiny) Minor domestic friction on other issues exists but does not challenge the core consensus on martial law.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly and uniformly reinforces the high prior. The posterior probability should be extremely high, approaching certainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official statements from the President's office or Rada leadership framing the extension as a necessary, routine step.
    *   Any major Russian offensive, reinforcing the existential threat.
    *   Continued high-intensity fighting along the front lines.
    *   Statements from key international partners focusing on military aid, implying acceptance of the wartime status quo.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a credible, comprehensive ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia.
    *   A major, unexpected political crisis or fracture within the Verkhovna Rada's ruling coalition specifically over the extension.
    *   Widespread, large-scale public protests explicitly demanding an end to martial law (not just on other issues).
    *   A public, high-level demand from the US or EU for Ukraine to lift martial law and hold elections immediately.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Event:** The analysis assumes no sudden, transformative event before Nov 5, such as the death of a key leader, a sudden military collapse on either side, or a completely unexpected diplomatic breakthrough. The short timeline makes this highly unlikely.
*   **Definitional Change:** There is a remote possibility that Ukraine could replace "martial law" with a new "state of emergency" that is functionally identical. This would technically resolve the question as "No" but is improbable as it offers no benefit and creates legal ambiguity.
*   **Information Lag:** We are relying on sources from up to several months ago. However, the core driver—the state of war—is a slow-moving variable, and there is no public information to suggest its fundamental nature has changed.
*   **Political Signaling:** All public signals from Ukrainian officials will favor extension. Any internal dissent is unlikely to be made public before the vote, making it difficult to detect a surprising shift in sentiment.

### Final Research Summary
The extension of martial law is a procedural necessity driven by the unabated state of war

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own history of martial law extensions since February 2022. There have been 16 extensions, all approved without fail. This gives a historical base rate of 100% for extensions under the current conditions of war. This is a strong prior due to the consistent pattern and specific context of the ongoing conflict.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors past extensions, with the war ongoing and no peace settlement in sight. The legal and political mechanisms for extension remain unchanged, and the need for martial law persists due to the war.
   - Differences: There are no significant differences that would suggest a deviation from the established pattern. The political and military context remains consistent with past extensions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **State of War**: The war continues with Russia occupying ~20% of Ukraine. The likelihood of martial law being extended given this evidence is very high (P(E | H) ≈ 1), while the likelihood of it not being extended is very low (P(E | ~H) ≈ 0). This evidence strongly increases the probability of extension.
   - **Political Stability**: Zelenskyy's approval rating is stable, and there is political consensus on the necessity of martial law. This evidence also increases the probability of extension.
   - **International Pressure**: There is no significant pressure to lift martial law, focusing instead on military aid and stability. This evidence slightly increases the probability of extension.
   - **Domestic Dissent**: While there are protests on other issues, they do not target martial law itself. This evidence has a negligible effect on the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 99% (based on historical base rate)
   - Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors extension due to ongoing war and political consensus.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = Very high
   - Posterior probability: Approaches certainty, given the overwhelming evidence supporting extension.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: The analysis assumes no major changes in the war or political landscape before November 5, 2025. A sudden diplomatic breakthrough or internal political crisis could alter the situation, but these are unlikely given current evidence.
   - Alternative Scenario: A ceasefire agreement could lead to a different outcome, but there is no indication of such developments.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence and lack of credible alternatives, the probability remains very high.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final forecast reflects the strong historical precedent, ongoing war, and political consensus supporting the extension of martial law.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate for this question is Ukraine's own history of martial law extensions since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. According to the background information:
- Martial law has been extended 16 times since its initial declaration
- Extensions shifted from 30-day to 90-day periods in May 2022
- Every single extension request has been approved (16 out of 16)

This gives us a historical base rate of 100% for extensions. However, using exactly 100% would be overconfident, so I'll use a slightly adjusted prior of 95% to account for uncertainty.

**Prior probability: 95%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental reason for martial law (active war with Russia) remains unchanged
- Russia still occupies approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory
- The legal mechanism for extension is well-established and routinized
- The political consensus on the necessity of martial law appears stable

**Differences from base case:**
- The war has been ongoing for over 3.5 years, which could potentially increase war fatigue
- There have been some anti-corruption protests, indicating limits to public deference
- The Trump administration is now involved in U.S. policy toward Ukraine, which could affect the strategic landscape

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Ongoing state of war**
- P(Ongoing war | Extension): ~100% (Extension would be virtually certain if war continues)
- P(Ongoing war | No Extension): ~5% (It's highly unlikely martial law would end while active war continues)
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 2: Legal and political path dependency**
- The extension process has become routine with 16 consecutive approvals
- Deviating would require a major political and legal disruption
- Likelihood ratio: ~10:1 in favor of extension
- This significantly increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 3: Constitutional requirement to hold elections after martial law ends**
- Ending martial law would trigger a requirement to hold elections
- Holding elections during wartime is considered logistically impossible and politically perilous
- Likelihood ratio: ~15:1 in favor of extension
- This strongly increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 4: Domestic political consensus**
- Parliament unanimously passed a resolution affirming Zelenskyy's legitimacy in February 2025
- Zelenskyy's approval rating has stabilized at 67% (August 2025)
- Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 in favor of extension
- This moderately increases the probability of extension

**Evidence 5: Anti-corruption protests**
- Shows civil society is active and can pressure the government
- However, protests targeted specific policies, not martial law itself
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1 (neutral)
- This has minimal impact on the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 95:5 (or 19:1), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on ongoing state of war:**
- Prior odds: 19:1
- Likelihood ratio: 20:1
- Posterior odds: 19 × 20 = 380:1
- Posterior probability: 380/(380+1) ≈ 99.7%

**Update on constitutional requirement for elections:**
- Prior odds: 380:1
- Likelihood ratio: 15:1
- Posterior odds: 380 × 15 = 5,700:1
- Posterior probability: 5,700/(5,700+1) ≈ 99.98%

This posterior probability is unrealistically high due to multiplicative effects of likelihood ratios. Let me recalibrate to a more reasonable level, considering that no prediction can be 100% certain.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the historical pattern and underestimating the possibility of change
- The research doesn't mention any peace negotiations that might be occurring behind the scenes
- There could be internal political dynamics not visible in public reporting

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Peace agreement scenario:** A sudden breakthrough in peace negotiations could eliminate the need for martial law (though this seems highly unlikely given the current state of the conflict)
2. **Political calculation scenario:** Zelenskyy might decide that ending martial law and holding elections would strengthen his legitimacy internationally
3. **Technical redefinition scenario:** Ukraine could replace "martial law" with a functionally identical "state of emergency" that would technically resolve the question as "No"

**Adjustments needed:**
Given the short timeline (less than a month until November 5, 2025) and the absence of any signals pointing to these alternative scenarios, I should maintain a high probability but avoid extreme certainty. The evidence overwhelmingly points to extension, but I should account for unknown unknowns.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I assess that Ukraine will almost certainly extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025. The ongoing war, the established pattern of extensions, the political consensus, and the impracticality of holding elections during wartime all strongly support this conclusion.

Final: 97%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is Ukraine's own history of extending martial law during the current conflict. Since the invasion began in February 2022, martial law has been extended 16 consecutive times without failure. This creates an extremely strong "inside view" base rate. A simple frequentist approach would suggest 16/16 = 100%.

A more robust prior, accounting for the possibility of change, can be derived from a broader reference class: the behavior of states engaged in major, existential interstate wars. Historically, nations in such conflicts almost never rescind emergency powers while major hostilities are ongoing. The primary condition for lifting such measures is the cessation of the war itself. This suggests a base rate for *continuation* of emergency powers during wartime is very high.

I will set a conservative prior at **P(H) = 95%**, where H is the event "Ukraine extends martial law." This reflects the strong precedent from both the specific and general reference classes but avoids the absolutism of 100%. This corresponds to prior odds of 19 to 1 in favor of extension.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in October 2025, as described in the research report, is fundamentally identical to the circumstances preceding the previous 16 extensions.
- **Similarities:** A large-scale, high-intensity war is ongoing. Russia continues to occupy a significant portion of Ukrainian territory (~20%). The legal framework and political leadership responsible for the extension remain the same. The core justification for martial law—the existential threat to the state—is unchanged.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the sheer duration of the war. One might hypothesize that war fatigue could create political pressure to change course. However, the evidence provided does not suggest this fatigue has translated into a challenge against the necessity of martial law itself. The timeline is also very short (less than one month to the deadline), making significant changes to the strategic situation highly improbable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H = Martial law is extended. Let ~H = Martial law is not extended.

- **Evidence 1: The war continues with high intensity (CFR report, Sep 2025).**
  - P(E | H): Very high (≈1.0). The continuation of the war is the primary reason for the extension.
  - P(E | ~H): Very low (≈0.01). It is almost inconceivable that Ukraine would cease martial law while the war rages. This would only happen in an extraordinary political crisis, which is a tail risk.
  - **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** > 100. This is extremely strong evidence favoring extension.

- **Evidence 2: Unanimous parliamentary resolution affirming Zelenskyy's legitimacy and postponing elections under martial law (Feb 2025).**
  - P(E | H): High. This act demonstrates a strong, unified political consensus on the current wartime governance structure, making a routine extension highly likely.
  - P(E | ~H): Low. If a significant political faction intended to block the extension, it is highly unlikely they would have joined a unanimous resolution reinforcing the status quo earlier in the year.
  - **LR:** > 5. This is strong evidence favoring extension.

- **Evidence 3: Lifting martial law constitutionally triggers elections, which are deemed impossible.**
  - This is a powerful causal driver. The alternative to extension is holding elections, which is logistically unfeasible and politically destabilizing during the war. This creates a powerful incentive to maintain the status quo. This fact makes the extension (H) far more likely than the alternative (~H).
  - **LR:** Very high.

- **Evidence 4: Minor anti-corruption protests (Aug 2025).**
  - P(E | H): Moderately likely. Domestic dissent on specific issues can coexist with broad consensus on the necessity of martial law.
  - P(E | ~H): Also moderately likely. Such protests could be a symptom of broader instability that might lead to a political crisis.
  - **LR:** ≈ 1. The evidence is neutral to very slightly negative. The report specifies the protests did not target martial law itself, so its impact is minimal.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 19 to 1 (from 95% probability).
- **Update with Evidence:** The evidence overwhelmingly supports the prior. The continuation of the war (LR > 100) is the most critical factor. The political consensus (LR > 5) and the powerful disincentive of triggering elections further strengthen the case.
- **Conceptual Update:**
  Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR(War) × LR(Politics) × ...
  Posterior Odds ≈ 19 × 100 × 5 = 9500 to 1.
- **Posterior Probability:**
  P = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 9500 / 9501 ≈ 99.99%.

This calculation points toward near-certainty. The logical chain is simple and robust: martial law is necessary for the war effort; the war continues; therefore, martial law will be extended.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a probability approaching 100%. Is this overconfident? The primary ways this forecast could fail are:
1.  **Sudden End to the War:** A comprehensive peace treaty or ceasefire is signed before November 5, 2025. Given the date is October 13, 2025, this is extremely unlikely in the next three weeks.
2.  **Sudden Internal Political Collapse:** A completely unforeseen crisis within the Ukrainian government leads to a failure to pass the extension. While possible in any political system, the evidence of recent unity on this specific issue makes it a remote tail risk.
3.  **Definitional Trickery:** The question resolves "No" because martial law is replaced by a functionally identical "State of War" law. This is possible but unlikely, as it creates legal confusion for no clear benefit.

The overwhelming logic holds, but to account for these "unknown unknowns" or black swan events, it is prudent to pull back from >99.9%. A forecast of 99% acknowledges the possibility of a major, unforeseen disruption while still reflecting the extremely high likelihood of the event based on all available information.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate is extremely high due to the perfect precedent of 16 prior extensions under similar conditions. All current evidence, especially the unabated state of the war and the strong political consensus, reinforces this high prior. The causal mechanisms, particularly the need to avoid wartime elections, make extension the only viable political and legal path. The risks of this forecast failing are confined to low-probability, high-impact events (black swans) which are unlikely to materialize in the short, sub-one-month timeframe.

Final: 99%
