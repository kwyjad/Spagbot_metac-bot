### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Human H5N1 Cases (Pre-Cattle Outbreak, 2003-2023):** This class represents the historical baseline for the US before the virus became established in a widespread mammalian population.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~0 cases per year. The US reported only one human case (in 2022) in the two decades prior to 2024.
    *   **Reasoning:** This reflects a regime where human exposure was limited to rare, direct contact with infected poultry or wild birds.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is likely obsolete due to the fundamental shift in transmission dynamics caused by the widespread outbreak in dairy cattle, which created a novel and much larger human-animal interface.

2.  **Global Sporadic Human H5N1 Cases (2016-2023):** This class captures the global rate of sporadic spillovers from avian sources in the modern era of the 2.3.4.4b clade, which is currently circulating.
    *   **Base Rate:** 2-15 cases per year globally. The WHO reported a handful of cases annually during this period, primarily in Southeast Asia, linked to close contact with infected poultry.
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides a better, though still imperfect, proxy for the "background rate" of zoonotic spillover for the current viral clade, absent a major mammalian reservoir.
    *   **Limitations:** It doesn't account for the unique scale of the US dairy industry or the specific public health infrastructure and surveillance intensity in the United States.

3.  **US Human H5N1 Cases (Post-Cattle Outbreak, March-December 2024):** This is the most relevant reference class, representing the new endemic reality.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~3-4 cases per month. The CDC reported 27 cases between roughly March and October 2024, establishing a new baseline rate of spillover from an established mammalian reservoir.
    *   **Reasoning:** This period captures the initial wave of infections following the virus's jump to dairy cattle. It reflects the current virus, host population, exposure pathways (farm work), and surveillance level.
    *   **Limitations:** This rate may be front-loaded due to a lack of initial awareness and PPE use. The rate could decrease as biosecurity improves or increase if the virus adapts further.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-29** KFF brief highlights ongoing global outbreaks, including avian flu, and potential challenges for US global health security capacity. (↑) — Reinforces that the global environment remains conducive to zoonotic threats, keeping pressure on domestic systems.
*   **2025-09-15** CDC reports a small cluster of 3 human cases on a large dairy farm in Idaho, the first cases in the state. (↑) — Indicates geographic spread of risk and potential for localized transmission events, even if not sustained H2H.
*   **2025-08-20** USDA announces a voluntary pilot program for an H5N1 cattle vaccine shows promising initial results in reducing viral shedding. (↓) — A viable vaccine, even with limited uptake, provides a potential long-term tool for reducing the size of the animal reservoir.
*   **2025-07-10** A peer-reviewed study finds H5N1 prevalence in bulk milk tank samples has declined since a peak in spring 2025. (↓) — Suggests that the combination of culling, biosecurity measures, and natural herd immunity may be reducing the overall viral load in the cattle population.
*   **2025-05-02** WHO confirms no significant new mutations associated with increased human-to-human transmissibility have been detected in any human cases globally in 2025. (↓) — The virus has had many "shots on goal" in humans without making the key evolutionary leap, reducing the immediate probability of a pandemic scenario.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Viral Adaptation to Mammals:** Any mutation that enhances replication in mammalian cells or, critically, enables airborne transmission between mammals (and thus humans). This is the primary driver of tail risk. **Impact: Large.**
2.  **Prevalence in Dairy Cattle:** The size and geographic spread of the virus in the cattle reservoir directly determines the number of opportunities for human exposure. **Impact: Moderate.**
3.  **Farm Biosecurity & PPE Adoption:** The level of compliance among farm workers with recommended personal protective equipment (e.g., masks, gloves, goggles) is a key lever in preventing spillover. **Impact: Moderate.**
4.  **Surveillance and Testing Intensity:** The number of reported cases is a function of how actively public health officials are looking for them. Increased testing of symptomatic farm workers will increase the reported count. **Impact: Moderate (on reported numbers).**
5.  **Spillover to Other Mammalian Species:** Spread to species that are better "mixing vessels" for influenza, such as swine, could accelerate adaptation to humans. An outbreak in US swine would be a major warning sign. **Impact: Large.**
6.  **Seasonality:** Influenza viruses typically circulate more actively in cooler, drier months. A winter 2025-2026 surge in cattle could lead to more human cases. **Impact: Small.**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Novel Transmission Vector:** The primary base rate (pre-2024 US) involved avian-to-human transmission. The current situation is dominated by a novel, sustained mammal-to-human pathway via dairy cattle.
*   **Scale of Reservoir:** The animal reservoir is now millions of cattle across dozens of states, a vastly larger and more geographically distributed reservoir than isolated infected poultry flocks.
*   **Nature of Human Exposure:** Exposure is now occupational, involving daily, prolonged contact for thousands of farm workers, a different risk profile than culling a single infected flock.
*   **Heightened Surveillance:** Post-COVID and post-2024 outbreak, surveillance, awareness, and testing capacity for novel influenza in the US are significantly higher than in any previous period, leading to better case ascertainment.
*   **Viral Clade Behavior:** The circulating 2.3.4.4b clade is highly pathogenic in birds but has so far resulted in predominantly mild, self-limiting illness in humans, a key difference from earlier, more lethal H5N1 clades.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2024 outbreak data would be a Negative Binomial distribution. It should be centered on a continuation of the 2024 rate (~30-40 cases/year), implying a total of 60-80 cases for 2024-2025, but with a very fat tail to account for the small but catastrophic risk of H2H transmission. Equivalent n should be low, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The continued absence of confirmed H2H transmission through late 2025 is strong evidence against the virus having made the leap, significantly reducing the probability of the high-end tail scenarios (>1000 cases).
    *   (↓ Moderate) Evidence of declining prevalence in cattle and progress on a vaccine suggests the primary driver of spillover may be weakening.
    *   (↑ Small) Continued sporadic cases and small clusters in 2025 confirm that the new baseline established in 2024 is persistent and not a one-off event.
    *   (↔) The general environment of pandemic risk (per KFF, etc.) supports keeping the tail risk non-zero but doesn't specifically update the H5N1 case count forecast away from the baseline trend.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior distribution should be revised downwards from a more alarmist prior set in mid-2024. The central tendency should move towards a final total of 40-60 cases, reflecting the initial 2024 burst followed by a lower, more controlled rate in 2025. The extreme right tail of the distribution should be substantially trimmed.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any confirmed case of human-to-human transmission.
    *   A cluster of cases among people with no direct livestock contact (e.g., in a city).
    *   Detection of H5N1 in US swine herds.
    *   CDC reports of mutations in human isolates known to be associated with mammalian adaptation (e.g., PB2-E627K).
    *   A sharp, sustained increase in the number of affected dairy herds reported by the USDA.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Two consecutive months (Nov-Dec 2025) with zero new human cases reported.
    *   USDA reports a significant (>50%) drop in affected herds nationwide.
    *   Widespread, mandatory adoption of a cattle vaccine.
    *   Peer-reviewed studies showing high effectiveness of PPE in real-world farm settings.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Case Ascertainment Bias:** The true number of infections is almost certainly higher than the reported number.

To forecast the total number of human cases of H5 bird flu reported by the CDC in the United States for 2024 and 2025, we will apply a Bayesian approach using the information provided.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is the US Human H5N1 Cases (Post-Cattle Outbreak, March-December 2024), with a base rate of ~3-4 cases per month. This translates to approximately 36-48 cases per year.
- **Reasoning:** This base rate reflects the new endemic reality following the virus's jump to dairy cattle, which has created a novel and larger human-animal interface.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation continues to involve occupational exposure to infected cattle, similar to the conditions observed in 2024.
- **Differences:** There are signs of declining prevalence in cattle and progress on a vaccine, which could reduce the spillover rate. However, sporadic cases and small clusters continue to occur, indicating persistent risk.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Declining Prevalence in Cattle (↓ Moderate):** Suggests a reduction in the primary driver of spillover.
- **Absence of H2H Transmission (↓ Large):** Strong evidence against high-end tail scenarios.
- **Continued Sporadic Cases (↑ Small):** Confirms the persistence of the new baseline.
- **Potential Vaccine Development (↓ Moderate):** Could further reduce the reservoir size.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Assume a Negative Binomial distribution centered on 60-80 cases for 2024-2025.
- **Update:** The absence of H2H transmission and declining cattle prevalence suggest a downward revision. The posterior distribution should reflect a central tendency of 40-60 cases, with a reduced right tail.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risks:** The forecast should account for the potential of unobserved mutations or changes in transmission dynamics.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a winter surge or new mammalian reservoirs.
- **Adjustment:** Ensure the forecast accommodates these tail risks by maintaining a non-zero probability for higher case counts.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the total number of human cases of H5 bird flu in the US for 2024 and 2025 are:

P10: 35  
P20: 40  
P40: 50  
P60: 55  
P80: 60  
P90: 70

# Forecasting Human H5 Bird Flu Cases in the US for 2024-2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the most recent and relevant reference class: the 2024 US H5N1 outbreak data.

- As of October 18, 2024, CDC reported 27 human cases in the US for 2024 (approximately 10 months)
- This gives a rate of approximately 2.7 cases per month
- Extrapolating this rate would suggest approximately 32-33 cases for full-year 2024
- For the combined 2024-2025 period (24 months), a simple linear extrapolation would suggest 64-65 cases

However, this base rate needs adjustment because:
- The outbreak is relatively new, with dynamics that may change
- There's uncertainty about how the virus will evolve
- Seasonal patterns may affect transmission
- Countermeasures may reduce case rates over time

For my prior distribution, I'll use a negative binomial with a mean of 65 cases and a relatively high variance to account for the significant uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The same H5N1 virus strain (2.3.4.4b clade) continues to circulate
- The primary transmission pathways remain animal-to-human (cattle and poultry)
- The US public health infrastructure and surveillance systems remain consistent
- The size of the at-risk population (farm workers) is relatively stable

**Differences from base case:**
- The 2024 rate may have been front-loaded due to initial lack of awareness and protective measures
- Improved biosecurity and PPE adoption on farms may reduce the 2025 rate
- Progress on cattle vaccines could reduce the animal reservoir
- Declining prevalence in bulk milk samples suggests the cattle outbreak may be moderating
- Seasonal effects may cause fluctuations in transmission rates
- The virus has had more time to potentially adapt to mammals, though no significant H2H mutations have been detected

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher case counts:**
- Geographic spread to new states (Idaho cluster) suggests the virus is continuing to reach new populations (likelihood ratio ~1.2x for higher counts)
- The KFF brief highlighting ongoing global outbreaks suggests the broader environment remains conducive to zoonotic threats (likelihood ratio ~1.1x for higher counts)
- The fat-tailed nature of pandemic distributions (Cirillo & Taleb) suggests we should maintain some probability mass on extreme outcomes (affects tail more than central tendency)

**Evidence supporting lower case counts:**
- No significant mutations for human-to-human transmissibility detected through 2025 is strong evidence against a major outbreak (likelihood ratio ~0.5x for very high counts)
- Declining prevalence in bulk milk tank samples suggests the animal reservoir may be shrinking (likelihood ratio ~0.8x for moderate-to-high counts)
- Progress on a cattle vaccine provides a mechanism for further reducing the reservoir (likelihood ratio ~0.9x for moderate counts)
- Improved biosecurity measures and PPE adoption following the initial cases likely reduce the per-exposure risk (likelihood ratio ~0.8x for moderate counts)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 65 cases, I'll update based on the key evidence:

1. **Update on lack of H2H transmission mutations:**
   - Prior: Mean = 65, with significant right tail extending to several hundred cases
   - Likelihood: Evidence strongly disfavors scenarios with >100 cases (0.5x likelihood ratio)
   - Posterior: Mean shifts down to ~55, with the right tail substantially reduced

2. **Update on declining prevalence in cattle:**
   - Prior: Mean = 55 after first update
   - Likelihood: Evidence moderately disfavors scenarios with >80 cases (0.8x likelihood ratio)
   - Posterior: Mean shifts further down to ~50, with reduced probability in the 80-100 range

3. **Update on geographic spread to new states:**
   - Prior: Mean = 50 after second update
   - Likelihood: Evidence slightly favors scenarios with >40 cases (1.2x likelihood ratio)
   - Posterior: Mean remains around 50, but with slightly more weight in the 40-60 range

The resulting posterior distribution has:
- A central tendency around 45-55 total cases for 2024-2025
- A left tail extending down to ~30 cases (if control measures are highly effective)
- A right tail extending to ~100 cases (if spread continues at current rates)
- A very thin but non-zero extreme right tail for pandemic scenarios

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for viral adaptation. H5N1 now has an unprecedented mammalian reservoir, giving it many opportunities to evolve.
- I might be overestimating the effectiveness of control measures. Farm worker compliance with PPE recommendations may be lower than assumed.
- The case ascertainment rate is unknown. Many mild cases may go undetected, meaning official counts could significantly underestimate true infections.
- I may be underestimating seasonal effects. A winter 2025-2026 surge could accelerate cases in late 2025.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast would center on 70-80 total cases, arguing that:
1. The 2024 rate will continue largely unchanged through 2025
2. Geographic spread will offset any gains from improved biosecurity
3. Surveillance will intensify, detecting more cases

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While plausible, this alternative doesn't adequately account for:
1. The declining prevalence in cattle observed in mid-2025
2. The cumulative effect of improved biosecurity measures
3. The absence of H2H transmission despite many opportunities

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty
- I'll maintain a slightly heavier right tail to account for adaptation potential
- I'll adjust my P10 upward slightly to account for the established baseline of cases already reported

Here is my probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is derived from the current outbreak in the United States, which began in early 2024 after H5N1 established itself in dairy cattle. Pre-2024 data (with only one historical US case) is irrelevant due to the fundamental change in transmission dynamics from a rare avian spillover to a sustained mammalian reservoir.

*   **Reference Class:** US Human H5N1 Cases, Post-Cattle Outbreak (April-October 2024).
*   **Base Rate Calculation:** The CDC reported 27 cases between roughly early April and mid-October 2024, a period of about 6.5 months. This establishes a rate of approximately **4.15 cases per month**.
*   **Prior Distribution:** Extrapolating this rate over the entire 2-year period (2024-2025) would be a starting point. However, the first cases appeared in April 2024, so the relevant period is roughly 21 months (April '24 - Dec '25). A simple extrapolation would be 21 months * 4.15 cases/month ≈ 87 cases. My prior distribution is centered on this value, using a Negative Binomial distribution to reflect high uncertainty and a significant right-skewed tail to account for the low-probability, high-impact risk of adaptation and human-to-human (H2H) transmission, as suggested by the fat-tailed nature of pandemics. The median of this prior is around 85, with a P90 potentially in the hundreds.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The base case assumes the spillover rate of ~4 cases/month observed in mid-2024 continues unabated through the end of 2025.

*   **Similarities:** The virus remains endemic in the large cattle reservoir, and the primary exposure pathway (occupational contact on dairy farms) persists.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(↓) Behavioral/Biosecurity Changes:** Awareness of the risk, adoption of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and improved farm biosecurity are likely much higher now than during the initial phase of the outbreak. This should reduce the rate of spillover.
    *   **(↓) Countermeasures:** The development of a cattle vaccine, even in pilot stages, introduces a powerful tool that could significantly reduce the animal reservoir size in 2025.
    *   **(↓) Herd Immunity:** Natural immunity in cattle herds that have already experienced outbreaks, combined with culling, may reduce the overall viral prevalence.
    *   **(↑↑) Viral Adaptation:** This is the primary driver of upside risk. Every new human case is an opportunity for the virus to adapt better to mammalian hosts. Any mutation enabling even limited H2H transmission would dramatically increase the case count.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The research report provides hypothetical evidence from late 2024 and 2025, which I use to update my prior.

*   **(↓↓ Large) No H2H mutations & Declining Milk Prevalence:** The WHO's confirmation (as of May 2025) that no key H2H-enabling mutations have emerged is extremely strong evidence against the fat-tail pandemic scenario. This drastically reduces the likelihood of outcomes in the hundreds or thousands. Similarly, evidence of declining viral prevalence in cattle directly undermines the "constant rate" assumption of the prior. This evidence makes a final total below 80 far more likely than a total above 80.
*   **(↓ Moderate) Promising Cattle Vaccine:** A successful vaccine pilot (August 2025) provides a clear mechanism for controlling the outbreak in the medium term. While it may not be widely deployed by the end of 2025, it reinforces the downward trend and caps the potential for an uncontrolled explosion of cases in the latter half of the forecast period.
*   **(↑ Small) Continued Sporadic Clusters:** The report of a small 3-person cluster in Idaho (September 2025) is crucial counter-evidence. It confirms that spillovers will not cease entirely and that the risk remains geographically widespread. This evidence makes it unlikely the final count will be very low (e.g., <40) and supports the idea of a persistent, low-level stream of cases.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   My prior was centered around ~85 cases with a very fat right tail.
*   The overwhelming weight of the new evidence (no H2H adaptation, declining prevalence, vaccine progress) forces a major update. The extreme right tail of the distribution is severely truncated. The likelihood of thousands, or even hundreds, of cases is now very low.
*   The central tendency of the distribution is pulled significantly downward. The initial high rate in 2024 is now viewed more as an initial wave, which is expected to subside to a lower, more manageable rate in 2025.
*   My updated central estimate is composed of two parts:
    1.  **2024 Total:** 27 cases to date + ~8-12 more in the remaining months = **~35-39 cases**.
    2.  **2025 Total:** A significantly reduced rate. If the 2024 rate was ~4/month, the 2025 rate might average 1.5-2/month. This gives 12 * (1.5 to 2) = **18-24 cases**.
*   **Posterior Median:** The sum of these two parts places the new median around (37 + 21) = **58 cases**. The distribution remains right-skewed, but far less dramatically than the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence:** Am I too confident in the effectiveness of countermeasures and the virus's inability to adapt? The Idaho cluster is a reminder that the virus is persistent. A scenario where the 2024 rate of ~4 cases/month does *not* decline is plausible and should be represented in the upper percentiles. A simple continuation (27 cases + 14.5 months * 4 cases/month) would yield ~85 cases. This should fall around my P80.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher):** A new variant emerges in cattle that is more transmissible to humans, or a breakdown in biosecurity occurs during the winter flu season, leading to several larger clusters (5-15 people). This could push the total toward 100-120. My P90 should account for this.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower):** The problem is contained more effectively than I expect. The cattle vaccine is deployed rapidly in early 2025, and biosecurity measures nearly halt transmission. In this case, after ~37 cases in 2024, we might only see 5-10 more in all of 2025, for a total of 42-47. This should be reflected in my lower percentiles.
*   **Conclusion:** My median of ~58 seems robust, balancing the initial outbreak against the strong evidence of mitigation. The distribution needs to be wide enough to capture both the "problem continues" scenario (~85 cases) and the "problem contained" scenario (~45 cases).
