### Reference class & base rates
- **Previous Years of the COVID-19 Pandemic (2021-2024):** This is the most direct reference class. The trend shows a rapid and consistent decline in reported deaths since the peak.
    - **2021:** ~3.6 million
    - **2022:** ~1.2 million
    - **2023:** ~200,000
    - **2024 (projected/preliminary):** ~90,000 - 110,000
    - **Reasoning:** This class establishes a strong decelerating trend as the pandemic transitions to an endemic phase, driven by rising population immunity and viral evolution towards lower severity. The base rate suggested by simple extrapolation is a number significantly below 100,000 for 2025.
    - **Limitations:** Extrapolating an exponential decay can be misleading; the decline may flatten into a more stable endemic "floor."

- **Severe Seasonal Influenza (Global Annual Deaths):** This class represents a potential long-term endemic state for a respiratory virus.
    - **Base Rate:** 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually (WHO estimate).
    - **Reasoning:** COVID-19 is settling into a seasonal pattern similar to influenza. This class provides a benchmark for a globally significant, but managed, respiratory virus. Reported COVID-19 deaths in 2023 and 2024 have already fallen well below this range.
    - **Limitations:** SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses differ in their transmission dynamics, severity profiles, and the effectiveness/uptake of available vaccines and treatments.

- **Other Modern Pandemics (Post-Peak Phase):** This class includes pandemics like the 2009 H1N1 influenza.
    - **Base Rate:** H1N1 caused an estimated 150,000-575,000 deaths in its first year. In subsequent years, its impact merged into the overall seasonal flu burden, without distinct, large-scale annual death tolls attributed specifically to it.
    - **Reasoning:** This supports a model where a novel virus causes a high initial death toll, followed by a rapid decline as it becomes one of several co-circulating seasonal pathogens.
    - **Limitations:** The scale, global response, and biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were vastly different from H1N1.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-11-10:** Year-to-date reported global deaths stand at approximately 68,000. (↓) — This provides a very strong anchor. Extrapolating linearly for the full year (~75k) suggests a total well below the 2024 figure, even before accounting for seasonality.
- **2025-10-15:** A new Omicron subvariant, "KX.2," becomes dominant in Europe and North America. (↔) — While highly transmissible, initial data from public health agencies shows no significant increase in hospitalization or death rates compared to prior JN.1-descended variants.
- **2025-09-01:** Northern Hemisphere countries begin to see the expected seasonal rise in cases. (↑) — The increase is consistent with prior years' seasonality, but the absolute peak of hospitalizations is lower than the 2024-2025 winter, suggesting blunted severity.
- **2025-07-20:** Several major countries in Southeast Asia announce further scaling back of public COVID-19 dashboards and reporting frequency. (↓) — This continues the global trend of degrading surveillance infrastructure, which directly suppresses the count of *reported* deaths, irrespective of the true burden.
- **2025-06-05:** WHO reports that updated vaccine booster uptake for the 2025-2026 season is below 15% in most high-income countries. (↑) — Low booster uptake among vulnerable populations could lead to a slightly higher death toll during the winter wave than would otherwise be expected.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Viral Evolution:** The emergence of new variants is the primary driver of new waves of infection. To date, evolution has favored immune evasion over increased intrinsic severity. A variant shift towards higher virulence is a low-probability, high-impact risk. **Typical size: Moderate (up/down).**
- **Population Immunity:** The global "immunity wall" from vaccination and repeated infections is high, particularly against severe disease. However, this immunity wanes over time, creating a persistent pool of susceptible individuals, especially the elderly and immunocompromised. **Typical size: Moderate (down).**
- **Reporting and Surveillance Infrastructure:** This is a key driver for the *reported* number. As countries dismantle testing sites, reduce data collection, and change reporting criteria, the official count of deaths decreases. This effect is largely independent of the virus's actual toll. **Typical size: Large (down).**
- **Seasonality:** SARS-CoV-2 has settled into a predictable seasonal pattern, with peaks in winter months corresponding to indoor gatherings. This creates regular, cyclical increases in transmission and deaths. **Typical size: Small-to-Moderate (cyclical up/down).**
- **Availability/Uptake of Mitigations:** The use of antivirals (e.g., Paxlovid) in high-risk patients and updated vaccines can blunt the impact of infection waves. However, public fatigue and low booster uptake limit their overall effect. **Typical size: Small (down).**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **High Pre-existing Immunity:** Unlike the early pandemic years (the primary reference class), the global population is no longer immunologically naive. This fundamentally lowers the infection fatality rate.
- **Systematic De-escalation of Surveillance:** In contrast to 2020-2022, the official policy and public health posture in most nations is to treat COVID-19 as one of several endemic respiratory viruses. This has led to a deliberate and sustained reduction in reporting, making direct comparison of raw numbers to earlier years problematic.
- **Decoupling of Cases and Deaths:** High immunity and less virulent strains mean that even large waves of infection (as measured by wastewater, for example) no longer translate to the massive waves of death seen in 2020-2021.
- **Advanced Medical Countermeasures:** Unlike the start of the pandemic, effective antivirals and established clinical protocols for treating severe COVID-19 are widely available in many parts of the world, further reducing mortality.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Based on the 2023 (~200k) and 2024 (~100k) data, a prior centered on a continued halving trend seems plausible. A log-normal distribution centered around 70,000 deaths, with an equivalent n of ~10, would reflect confidence in the downward trend but allow for significant uncertainty.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **YTD data (~68k by Nov 10):** This is extremely strong evidence. A simple extrapolation points to a final number in the 75k-80k range, accounting for a mild winter bump. (↓, large, as it anchors the forecast firmly below 100k).
    - **No evidence of more severe variants:** The latest variants (KX-lineage) continue the trend of high transmissibility but not increased severity. (↓, moderate).
    - **Continued decay of reporting:** The trend of countries reducing surveillance has not reversed, ensuring the reported number will understate the true burden more than ever. (↓, moderate).
    - **Low booster uptake:** This provides a slight upward pressure, suggesting the winter wave might be slightly worse than it could have been, but not enough to reverse the overall trend. (↑, small).
- **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the year-to-date data, strongly pulls the estimate downwards from the 2024 baseline. The posterior should be tightened considerably and centered in the 75,000 to 85,000 range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - Hospitalization and ICU admission rates in Northern Hemisphere countries rising faster than case rates in Nov-Dec.
    - WHO or major public health bodies issuing alerts about a new variant with concerning mutations related to virulence.
    - A sudden, large, and unexplained spike in all-cause excess mortality in a major country.
    - Reversal of reporting de-escalation in any major country (unlikely).
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Wastewater surveillance data in major population centers peaking and declining before mid-December.
    - Official year-end reports from large countries (e.g., US, Germany, Japan) showing a continued decline in the case-fatality rate.
    - The final weeks of 2025 passing with no significant new variant of concern emerging.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Resolution Source vs. Reality:** The question resolves on *reported* deaths (via WHO), which are a significant and growing undercount of the true number of deaths caused by COVID-19. The forecast is about a reporting artifact, not the true state of the world.
- **Data Lags and Revisions:** The WHO data for 2025 will not be finalized until

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the trend of reported COVID-19 deaths from 2021 to 2024, showing a rapid decline. The projected/preliminary number for 2024 is between 90,000 and 110,000 deaths. This suggests a strong downward trend as the pandemic transitions to an endemic phase.
   - **Reasoning:** This base rate is chosen because it reflects the most recent and relevant data, capturing the ongoing decline in deaths due to increased immunity and less severe viral evolution.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** A log-normal distribution centered around 70,000 deaths with a moderate variance to account for uncertainty.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation continues the trend of declining deaths due to high population immunity and less severe variants.
   - **Differences:** The systematic reduction in reporting and surveillance infrastructure means that reported deaths may increasingly undercount the true number of deaths.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Year-to-date data (~68k deaths by Nov 10):** Strong evidence supporting a lower total for 2025, suggesting a final number in the 75k-80k range.
   - **No evidence of more severe variants:** Supports the continuation of the trend towards lower deaths.
   - **Continued decay of reporting:** Suggests reported deaths will be lower than actual deaths.
   - **Low booster uptake:** Provides slight upward pressure, but not enough to reverse the overall trend.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Start with a prior centered around 70,000 deaths. The strong evidence from year-to-date data (68k by Nov 10) shifts the posterior downwards, tightening the distribution around 75,000 to 85,000 deaths.
   - **Shift in Posterior:** The mean shifts downwards, and the variance is reduced due to the strong anchoring evidence from the year-to-date data.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of an unexpected variant or reporting changes that could increase reported deaths.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where a new variant increases deaths significantly, but this is deemed low probability given current evidence.
   - **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for potential tail risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - **Calibrated Percentiles:** Reflect the updated posterior distribution, considering all evidence and potential risks.

# Forecasting Global COVID-19 Deaths in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class: Recent COVID-19 death trends**
- 2021: ~3.6 million deaths
- 2022: ~1.2 million deaths (67% decrease)
- 2023: ~200,000 deaths (83% decrease)
- 2024 (projected): ~100,000 deaths (50% decrease)

This shows a clear exponential decay pattern, suggesting continued decline. A naive extrapolation would predict ~50,000 deaths for 2025, but the rate of decline is likely slowing as we approach an endemic floor.

**Secondary reference class: Endemic respiratory viruses**
- Seasonal influenza: 290,000-650,000 annual deaths globally
- This provides a ceiling for what a "normalized" respiratory virus might cause

Based on these reference classes, I'll use a prior centered around 70,000 deaths, with a relatively wide variance to account for uncertainty in the continued decline rate.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- COVID-19 has established seasonal patterns similar to other respiratory viruses
- Population immunity remains high from vaccination and prior infections
- The virus continues to evolve toward higher transmissibility but not increased severity

**Key differences:**
- Surveillance and reporting systems continue to be dismantled globally, reducing reported deaths
- The year-to-date data (68,000 deaths by November 10, 2025) provides a strong anchor point
- Booster uptake is lower than in previous years (below 15% in most high-income countries)
- New variants continue to emerge but without significant changes in virulence

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Year-to-date data (68,000 deaths by November 10):**
- This is the strongest piece of evidence, covering ~85% of the year
- Simple extrapolation suggests 75,000-80,000 for the full year
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors outcomes below 90,000 (10:1)

**New KX.2 variant dominance:**
- No significant increase in hospitalization or death rates
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors the status quo (1:1)

**Expected seasonal rise in Northern Hemisphere:**
- Consistent with prior years but with lower peak hospitalizations
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors lower outcomes than 2024 (2:1)

**Reduced reporting in Southeast Asia:**
- Continues the global trend of degrading surveillance
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors lower reported deaths (3:1)

**Low vaccine booster uptake:**
- Could lead to slightly higher death toll in winter
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors higher outcomes (1:2)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 70,000 deaths:

**Update based on YTD data:**
- Prior: ~70,000 deaths (wide variance)
- Evidence: 68,000 deaths by November 10
- Posterior: Shifts to ~78,000 deaths with narrower variance
- Reasoning: With 85% of the year complete, we have high confidence in the final range, allowing for a slight winter increase

**Update based on reporting changes:**
- Prior: ~78,000 deaths
- Evidence: Continued reduction in surveillance
- Posterior: Shifts slightly downward to ~76,000 deaths
- Reasoning: Fewer countries actively tracking and reporting COVID deaths

**Update based on low booster uptake:**
- Prior: ~76,000 deaths
- Evidence: <15% booster uptake in high-income countries
- Posterior: Shifts slightly upward to ~77,000 deaths
- Reasoning: Slightly higher vulnerability in elderly populations

The final posterior distribution is centered around 77,000 deaths, with a narrower variance than my initial prior due to the strong anchor of year-to-date data.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of winter seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere
- A late-year variant with increased severity could emerge
- Data reporting lags might lead to significant retrospective additions

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Higher scenario (~120,000):** A more severe winter wave combined with a new variant could drive deaths higher than expected
- **Lower scenario (~60,000):** Continued reporting reductions could artificially suppress the count further

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my upper tail to account for the possibility of a more severe winter wave
- I'll maintain a relatively tight central range due to the strong anchor of YTD data

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 65,000
P20: 70,000
P40: 75,000
P60: 80,000
P80: 90,000
P90: 105,000

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the trend observed in reported global COVID-19 deaths in the immediately preceding years.
- **2021:** ~3.6 million
- **2022:** ~1.2 million
- **2023:** ~200,000
- **2024 (projected):** ~100,000

This establishes a strong decelerating trend. The year-over-year reduction factor has been between 0.3x and 0.5x. Applying this to the 2024 figure would suggest a prior for 2025 in the range of 30,000 to 50,000 deaths. However, this base rate is of limited use because the forecast is being made late in the forecast period (November 2025), with substantial data already available for the year in question. The primary "prior" is therefore the data from the first 10 months of 2025, and the forecast becomes an extrapolation for the remaining period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in late 2025 is broadly similar to 2023-2024 in that COVID-19 has settled into an endemic, seasonal pattern. Key differences that are critical for this forecast include:
- **Time of Forecast:** We are on November 11, 2025. This means over 85% of the year's data is already "in". The forecast is not for a full year, but for the final 51 days, to be added to the known total.
- **Continued Decay of Surveillance:** The research report explicitly notes the continued scaling back of public reporting. This creates a strong downward pressure on the *reported* number, meaning that even if the true burden of disease is stable, the reported count will likely fall. This effect will temper the size of any reported winter wave.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence overwhelmingly centers on the year-to-date (YTD) data provided in the research report.

- **Primary Evidence: YTD Deaths.** As of November 10, 2025, there have been approximately **68,000** reported deaths. This figure forms a hard floor for the forecast. The core task is to estimate the number of deaths in the remaining 51 days of the year.
    - The average daily death rate for the first 314 days is 68,000 / 314 ≈ 216.5 deaths/day.
    - A simple linear extrapolation for the remaining 51 days would add 51 * 216.5 ≈ 11,000 deaths, for a total of **79,000**.

- **Upward-pushing Evidence: Seasonality.** The remaining 51 days (Nov 11 - Dec 31) represent the peak winter season for the Northern Hemisphere. We should expect the daily death rate to be higher than the annual average. The report notes the seasonal rise is occurring but that the peak is expected to be lower than the previous winter. This suggests a multiplier on the daily rate (e.g., 1.2x to 1.8x) is appropriate.
    - A 1.5x multiplier on the daily rate (216.5 * 1.5 ≈ 325/day) would add ~16,600 deaths, for a total of **~84,600**.

- **Downward-pushing Evidence: Reporting Decay.** The report notes that surveillance is being scaled back. This will blunt the reporting of the seasonal wave. Even as true cases and deaths rise, the reported figures may not rise proportionally, counteracting some of the seasonality effect and pulling the estimate closer to the linear extrapolation.

- **Neutral Evidence: Viral Evolution.** The dominant KX.2 variant shows no signs of increased severity. This reduces the likelihood of a sudden, unexpected spike in mortality and supports modeling the rest of the year based on established seasonal patterns.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
The prior derived from 2021-2024 data is completely superseded by the high-certainty YTD data for 2025. The update process is effectively an informed extrapolation.

- **Anchor:** 68,000 deaths as of Nov 10.
- **Central Estimate:** The upward pressure of seasonality and the downward pressure of reporting decay are the key uncertainties. I estimate they will result in a winter wave that is noticeable but muted in the official data. A daily death rate for the final 51 days of around 1.3x the YTD average seems plausible.
    - Remaining deaths = 51 days * (216.5 deaths/day * 1.3) ≈ 14,300.
    - **Posterior Median ≈ 68,000 + 14,300 = 82,300.** I will center my distribution around **82,000**.

- **Distribution Shape:** The distribution will be right-skewed. The downside is limited (it's unlikely the death rate will fall significantly during winter), while the upside contains tail risks from a stronger-than-expected wave or, more significantly, large retrospective data dumps from one or more countries being added to the 2025 total.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Main Risk: Data Revisions.** The biggest source of uncertainty is not the virus itself in the next 51 days, but the reporting methodology. A single large country could submit a backlog of data covering many months, which could be attributed to 2025, causing a sudden jump of thousands of deaths. This is the primary justification for a fat right tail.
- **Alternative Downside Scenario:** The decay in reporting could accelerate dramatically into the holiday season, with public health agencies de-prioritizing data updates. This could lead to a final number much closer to the simple linear extrapolation of ~79,000, or even lower.
- **Confidence Check:** My proposed distribution needs to be wide enough to account for these data quality issues, not just epidemiological uncertainty. A P10-P90 range of ~18,000 deaths (from ~76k to ~94k) seems appropriate to capture these risks, representing about 22% of the median value.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is anchored at 68,000 deaths YTD, with a median estimate of ~82,000. The distribution is skewed to the right to account for the possibility of a strong winter wave and/or significant retrospective data reporting. The lower bound is constrained by a linear extrapolation, while the upper bound allows for a significant increase in the daily death rate.
