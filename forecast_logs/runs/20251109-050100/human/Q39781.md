### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador (2015-2025):** Ecuador has frequently used SoEs to respond to crises, including security issues (gang violence, prison riots), political protests, and natural disasters. Declarations can be localized to specific provinces or nationwide (24 provinces). A 60-day duration is common and constitutionally permitted, with possible extensions. The base rate of *any* province being under an SoE on a random day is moderately high, perhaps 20-30%. However, these events are clustered. When an SoE is active, it often covers multiple provinces. The distribution is bimodal: the number of provinces is often 0, or a high number (5-24), and rarely a low number (1-4).
2.  **SoEs Triggered by Indigenous-led Protests:** Major protests led by groups like CONAIE (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador) have historically prompted large-scale SoEs (e.g., 2019, 2022). These are less frequent than security-related SoEs but tend to be geographically widespread, affecting the central Sierra and Amazonian provinces. The current event fits this class. The base rate for this specific trigger is lower, but when it occurs, it implies a high number of provinces will be affected.
3.  **SoEs Active in Late December:** Historically, there might be a slight downward pressure on maintaining disruptive security measures during the Christmas holiday period to facilitate commerce and travel. However, this is a weak prior, as a severe crisis would override economic considerations. This reference class is of limited utility due to the small sample size and weak causal link.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-06** 16 provinces placed under a 60-day SoE. — ↑ — Establishes the high starting point. The 60-day clock started, set to expire around December 5, just 20 days before the resolution date.
*   **2025-10-05** (approx.) President Noboa attributes protests to the Tren de Aragua cartel. — ↑ — This rhetoric frames the conflict as a national security threat, not a political dispute, justifying a prolonged security response over negotiation.
*   **2025-10-05** (approx.) Five arrested for an "attempted assassination" on President Noboa. — ↑ — A severe escalation that provides the government with a powerful justification to extend or renew the SoE for reasons of presidential and state security.
*   **2025-09-16** SoE declared in Carchi and Imbabura. — ↑ — Shows a pre-existing security focus on northern provinces, which was then subsumed into the larger SoE, indicating the government's willingness to use this tool.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Protest Intensity & Persistence:** Continued or escalating roadblocks, violence, and disruptions by protest groups would strongly pressure the government to extend the SoE. A decline in protest activity would remove the primary justification. (Large impact)
2.  **Government's Security-First Strategy:** President Noboa's administration has consistently prioritized a hardline security response to both crime and protest. The framing of protests as "terrorism" linked to cartels suggests a low appetite for compromise and a high likelihood of extending security measures. (Large impact)
3.  **Legal Framework for SoE:** The standard duration is 60 days. An extension requires a new decree and justification. While politically feasible given the context, it is a discrete action that must be taken and could face legal challenges, creating a potential (though small) off-ramp. (Small impact, downward)
4.  **Negotiation Dynamics:** The possibility of successful talks between the government and indigenous leaders is the primary path to de-escalation. If talks begin and show progress, the SoE may be allowed to expire. If they stall or never begin, extension is more likely. (Large impact)
5.  **Underlying Gang Violence:** The parallel crisis of organized crime provides a constant, alternative justification for an SoE. The government could extend the SoE by shifting the official reason from protests back to gang activity, especially if a high-profile violent event occurs. (Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Conflation of Protest and Organized Crime:** Unlike previous protest-driven SoEs (e.g., 2019), the Noboa government is explicitly and aggressively linking indigenous protesters to a transnational criminal organization. This is a significant rhetorical escalation that poisons the well for negotiation and normalizes a military/police response.
*   **"Attempted Assassination" Claim:** This is an exceptionally rare and severe event in the context of Ecuadorian protests. It provides the executive with a uniquely powerful and personal justification for maintaining extraordinary security measures, far beyond typical protest dynamics.
*   **High Baseline of Insecurity:** The protests are occurring against the backdrop of an unprecedented national security crisis (as seen in the Jan 2024 nationwide SoE). This makes the government and parts of the public more tolerant of sustained emergency measures than they might have been in a more stable era.
*   **Political Context:** President Noboa's political identity is heavily tied to his "Plan Fénix" security strategy. Backing down or lifting the SoE without a clear "win" could be perceived as a major political defeat, disincentivizing de-escalation.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior would be a bimodal distribution centered on 0 and a higher number (~10-15), with most of the mass on 0. This reflects that an SoE is an exceptional state, but when it happens, it's often widespread. Equivalent n: ~5, a weak prior reflecting high volatility.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) A 16-province SoE is currently active and expires only 20 days before resolution. The status quo is "high number of provinces."
    *   (↑ Large) The "attempted assassination" claim provides a compelling and urgent reason for the state to maintain emergency powers.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The government's strategy of linking protesters to cartels strongly signals an intent to handle this as a security, not political, issue, favoring extension.
    *   (↓ Small) The 60-day legal limit creates a decision point; the SoE doesn't continue automatically and requires a new political act to be extended.
    *   (↓ Small) Potential for de-escalation ahead of the Christmas holidays to foster economic activity and a sense of normalcy.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points upward. The posterior should shift dramatically away from 0. The central tendency of the forecast should be a high number of provinces, likely very close to the current 16, with a small probability of it dropping to 0 if a sudden, unexpected political deal is reached.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official statements from the President or Interior Minister about the ongoing threat or the necessity of maintaining order.
    *   Any significant violent clash between protesters and security forces.
    *   Failure to establish or the public collapse of any negotiation dialogue.
    *   A new, major act of violence attributed to gangs (e.g., prison riot, assassination), providing a dual justification.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Joint announcements of a formal dialogue or negotiation table between the government and CONAIE.
    *   A significant, observable decrease in roadblocks and protest actions nationwide.
    *   Statements from business or church leaders calling for de-escalation and a return to normalcy before the holidays.
    *   A ruling from the Constitutional Court limiting the government's ability to extend the SoE.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fictional Scenario:** This analysis is based on a fictionalized background and timeline set in the near future. It must not be confused with the real-world situation in Ecuador.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The "attempted assassination" is a government claim. Its veracity could be contested, but the government's belief in it (or its utility as a pretext) is what drives decision-making.
*   **Sudden De-escalation:** Political situations in Ecuador can be volatile. A back-channel deal or a sudden concession from either side could rapidly change the outlook and lead to the SoE being lifted.
*   **Definitional Nuance:** The resolution depends on the official status on Dec 25. An SoE could be lifted on Dec 24 or re-imposed on Dec 26. The exact timing of decrees is a source of uncertainty.
*   **Partial Extension:** The government could choose to extend the SoE in a smaller number of "hotspot" provinces rather than all 16, leading to a resolution somewhere in the middle.

**Final Research Summary:**
The current 16-province state of emergency is set to expire just 20 days before the resolution date. Given the government's hardline security-focused strategy and severe escalations like the alleged assassination attempt, an extension of the SoE in most or all of these provinces is highly probable.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning as outlined in the steps provided.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The historical use of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador, particularly in response to security threats and protests, provides a base rate. The distribution is bimodal: often 0 or a high number (5-24 provinces). Given the current situation, a reasonable prior is centered around 0 and 10-15 provinces.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean of the prior could be around 8 provinces, with a high variance due to the bimodal nature.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation aligns with past instances where large-scale protests and security threats led to widespread SoEs.
   - **Difference:** The explicit linking of protests to organized crime and the alleged assassination attempt are unique escalations that suggest a higher likelihood of maintaining or extending the SoE.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Current 16-province SoE:** Strong evidence for maintaining a high number of provinces under SoE. (Likelihood ratio: ↑ Large)
   - **Assassination Attempt:** Provides a strong justification for continued emergency measures. (Likelihood ratio: ↑ Large)
   - **Government's Security Strategy:** Indicates a preference for extending SoEs. (Likelihood ratio: ↑ Moderate)
   - **Legal Framework and Holidays:** Potential for a slight reduction due to legal and economic considerations. (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Small)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered around 8 provinces, the strong evidence for maintaining the SoE shifts the distribution significantly upward.
   - **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The posterior mean shifts closer to the current 16 provinces, with a slightly reduced variance due to the strong evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden political resolution or legal challenge reducing the number of provinces under SoE.
   - **Tail Risks:** A complete resolution or a shift to a smaller number of provinces is possible but unlikely given the current evidence.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where negotiations succeed, leading to a reduction to 0-5 provinces, is plausible but less likely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted distribution is skewed towards a high number of provinces under SoE, with a small chance of a significant reduction.

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use historical patterns of states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador:

- Ecuador has 24 provinces total
- SoEs are typically declared for 60 days (the constitutional maximum without extension)
- They tend to follow a bimodal distribution: either 0 provinces or many provinces (5+)
- Current situation: 16 provinces under SoE as of October 6, 2025, set to expire around December 5

The prior distribution should be bimodal with peaks at 0 and around 10-16 provinces. Given the frequency of SoEs in Ecuador's recent history, I'll assign roughly 40% probability to 0 provinces and 60% to a range of provinces centered around 12-14.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The current SoE follows the typical pattern of covering multiple provinces (16 of 24)
- The 60-day duration is standard
- The triggers (protests, security concerns) are common justifications

**Key differences:**
- The current SoE is unusually severe, with the government linking indigenous protests to organized crime
- The "attempted assassination" claim against President Noboa represents a significant escalation
- The timing is critical: the current SoE expires around December 5, just 20 days before our resolution date

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher number of provinces:**
- Current SoE covers 16 provinces and expires only 20 days before resolution date (+strong)
- Government rhetoric framing protests as terrorism/cartel-linked (+strong)
- "Attempted assassination" claim provides powerful justification for extension (+strong)
- Noboa's political identity is tied to security-first approach (+moderate)

**Evidence for lower number of provinces:**
- 60-day constitutional limit creates a decision point; extension isn't automatic (-weak)
- Potential economic pressure to normalize before Christmas holidays (-weak)
- Possibility of negotiated settlement with indigenous leaders (-moderate)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my bimodal prior, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

1. **Update on timing and expiration**: The current 16-province SoE expires around December 5. This creates a strong likelihood that either all 16 provinces will still be under a renewed SoE on December 25, or none will be. This shifts probability mass toward either 0 or 16.

2. **Update on government rhetoric**: The framing of protests as terrorism and linking to cartels significantly increases the likelihood of extension. This shifts probability mass away from 0 and toward 16.

3. **Update on assassination attempt**: This exceptional escalation provides strong justification for maintaining emergency measures. This further shifts probability mass toward 16.

After these updates, my posterior distribution is heavily weighted toward 16 provinces (approximately 70%), with some probability of 0 provinces (approximately 20%), and a small probability of partial extension (1-15 provinces, approximately 10%).

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a negotiated settlement
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of a partial extension (fewer provinces)
- The Christmas holiday timing might have a stronger effect than I've credited

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be to place more weight on a partial extension scenario. The government might strategically reduce the scope to only the most troubled provinces (perhaps 5-8) as a compromise gesture while maintaining control. This would suggest a more even distribution across the range.

**Rebuttal:**
The evidence suggests Noboa's administration is taking a hardline approach with little appetite for compromise. The "attempted assassination" claim in particular makes a face-saving partial reduction unlikely.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 14
P60: 16
P80: 16
P90: 16

Here is a full probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate is the historical frequency and scope of States of Emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador. This is a volatile reference class, but some patterns emerge:
*   SoEs are common tools for Ecuadorian governments, used for security crises, protests, and natural disasters.
*   The distribution of the number of provinces under an SoE on any random day is strongly bimodal. The most common state is 0 provinces. However, when an SoE is declared, it often covers multiple provinces (5-10) or is nationwide (24). A small number (1-4) is rare.
*   Therefore, a reasonable prior distribution for a random day would have a high probability mass (e.g., 80%) at 0, with the remaining 20% spread across higher values, centered around 10-15 provinces. This reflects that an SoE is an exceptional, but not rare, state of affairs.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs significantly from a randomly selected day, which requires a major update to the prior.

*   **Similarity:** The trigger—large-scale indigenous-led protests against economic policy—is a classic scenario that has historically led to widespread SoEs in Ecuador (e.g., 2019, 2022).
*   **Key Differences:**
    1.  **Proximity:** The resolution date (Dec 25) is only 20 days after the scheduled expiration of the current 16-province SoE (around Dec 5). This is not a "cold start"; we are forecasting the continuation of an existing crisis, not the emergence of a new one. This dramatically increases the probability of a non-zero outcome.
    2.  **Rhetorical Escalation:** The government's explicit linking of protesters to a transnational cartel ("Tren de Aragua") and threats of terrorism charges is a severe departure from treating this as a political dispute. This framing justifies a prolonged, hardline security response and makes a negotiated de-escalation less likely.
    3.  **Extreme Justification:** The alleged "attempted assassination" of the President is a powerful and personalizing event. It provides the executive with an exceptionally strong justification to extend emergency powers for reasons of state and personal security, overriding typical political or economic pressures to de-escalate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Each piece of evidence updates the prior probability of the SoE being extended versus being allowed to lapse.

*   **Current 16-province SoE expiring Dec 5:** (Strongly favors a high number). The status quo is a high number of provinces. Inertia is a powerful force; extending an existing measure is politically easier than starting from scratch. This evidence makes an outcome near 16 far more likely than an outcome near 0.
*   **"Attempted Assassination" Claim:** (Overwhelmingly favors a high number). This is the most significant factor. It provides a compelling, urgent reason for the state to maintain emergency powers. It makes lifting the SoE politically risky for the President, as it could be framed as capitulating to those who allegedly tried to kill him. This makes an extension highly probable.
*   **Government's "Terrorist" Rhetoric:** (Strongly favors a high number). This rhetoric poisons the well for negotiations, the primary off-ramp for the SoE. By framing the opposition as an illegitimate national security threat, the government signals its intent to seek a security-based solution rather than a political one.
*   **Constitutional 60-day Limit:** (Weakly favors a low number/0). This is the primary mechanism for a zero-province outcome. The SoE does not continue automatically; it requires a new decree. This creates a formal decision point where the SoE could be allowed to lapse. However, given the other factors, this appears to be a low procedural hurdle rather than a substantive barrier.
*   **Christmas Holiday Period:** (Very weakly favors a low number/0). There may be some pressure from the business community to restore normalcy for the economically important holiday season. However, this pressure is likely to be completely overshadowed by the severe security justifications.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** High probability (~80%) on 0 provinces, low probability (~20%) on 5-24 provinces.
*   **Update:** The evidence overwhelmingly points toward an extension of the SoE. The proximity of the expiration date to the resolution date fundamentally changes the problem from "will an SoE happen?" to "will this SoE be extended?". The severe nature of the government's justification (assassination attempt, terrorism) makes extension the most likely path.
*   The initial 80% probability of 0 provinces is drastically reduced. A back-of-the-envelope update suggests the probability of the SoE lapsing (resolving to 0) is now low, perhaps 10-15%.
*   The posterior distribution should therefore be heavily concentrated on a high number of provinces. The most likely single outcome is a direct extension, meaning 16 provinces. The distribution should have its primary mode at 16.
*   The variance should account for two other possibilities: a partial extension to a smaller number of "hotspot" provinces (e.g., 5-14) or a further escalation to a nationwide SoE (24 provinces) if the crisis worsens.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Blind Spot:** Overlooking the possibility of a sudden, unexpected political settlement. Ecuadorian politics can be volatile. A powerful mediator (e.g., the Catholic Church) could broker a deal, or the "assassination" claim could be discredited, forcing the government to back down. My lower tail (P10=0) is meant to account for this low-probability, high-impact scenario.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered on 0. This would assume that the 60-day limit is a hard stop and that political pressure for a holiday truce would be decisive. This seems implausible because it ignores the severity of the government's claims. The political cost to President Noboa of backing down after an alleged assassination attempt appears far higher than the cost of extending the SoE.
*   **Partial vs. Full Extension:** Am I too focused on 16? The government could make a token gesture of de-escalation by reducing the number of provinces from 16 to, say, 12. This is a plausible middle-ground scenario. My P20 and P40 values reflect this possibility.
*   **Escalation Risk:** The "terrorist" rhetoric and potential for more violence create a real risk of escalation to a nationwide (24 province) SoE. My upper tail (P90=20) reflects this, acknowledging a non-trivial chance of the situation worsening.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered on the status quo (16 provinces) being extended, reflecting the strong evidence provided. It includes a small probability of the SoE being lifted entirely (lower tail), a moderate probability of a partial de-escalation, and a significant probability of further escalation (upper tail).

P10: 0
