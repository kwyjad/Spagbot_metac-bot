### Reference class & base rates
1.  **DRC Ebola Outbreaks (Post-Vaccine Era, 2018-Present):** This is the most relevant class, as it reflects current response capabilities, including the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. Since 2018, the DRC has had six outbreaks prior to the current one. The death tolls were: ~2,287 (Kivu, 2018-20), 55 (Equateur, 2020), 6 (North Kivu, 2021), 5 (Equateur, 2022), 1 (North Kivu, 2022).
    *   **Base Rate:** The distribution is extremely skewed. The median number of deaths is 5.5. Excluding the Kivu outlier, the mean is ~12. Including the Kivu outlier, the mean is ~393. This suggests a bimodal reality: outbreaks are either contained quickly (<60 deaths) or, under specific catastrophic conditions (e.g., intense conflict), become very large.
2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present):** This class provides a broader historical perspective but is less relevant due to major advances in treatment and prevention. The DRC has had 15 outbreaks before this one.
    *   **Base Rate:** Sizes range from a single case to thousands. Prior to 2018, notable outbreaks resulted in 280 deaths (Yambuku, 1976), 264 (Kikwit, 1995), and 43 (Kasai, 2007). The median is significantly higher than the post-vaccine median, but still well under 100. The primary value is showing that outbreaks in the hundreds of deaths were possible even before the Kivu outlier.
3.  **Global Ebola Outbreaks with >25 Cases (Post-Vaccine Era, 2018-Present):** This class includes the DRC outbreaks plus others, like the 2022 Uganda outbreak (Sudan ebolavirus, 55 deaths).
    *   **Base Rate:** This reinforces the pattern that non-Kivu outbreaks have been contained with fewer than 60 deaths. It also highlights that even when a vaccine is not available for a specific strain (as in Uganda 2022), modern response mechanisms can still achieve containment relatively quickly.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-04** Outbreak declared in Kasaï Province. — (↑) — The declaration itself is neutral, but the location is new for a modern outbreak, implying less local experience.
*   **2025-09-07** Report of 32 cases and 15 deaths. — (↑) — A relatively high number of deaths this early suggests the virus was spreading undetected for some time before the official declaration.
*   **2025-09-15** WHO and MSF teams, with mobile labs, are fully operational in the two affected health zones. — (↓) — Rapid deployment of experienced international partners is a key factor for successful containment.
*   **2025-09-20** Ring vaccination campaign begins, targeting contacts and contacts-of-contacts of the initial 32 cases. — (↓) — The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective; its deployment is the single most important tool for limiting spread.
*   **2025-10-08** A confirmed case is identified in a health worker at a regional clinic outside the initial outbreak zones. — (↑) — Nosocomial (healthcare-setting) transmission is a major amplifier; spread to a new zone indicates contact tracing may have gaps.
*   **2025-10-25** Weekly case incidence drops for the second consecutive week, though transmission continues within known clusters. — (↓) — A falling rate of new cases is the strongest sign that containment measures are taking effect.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed and Efficacy of Response (Large):** The time from first infection to detection, and then to implementation of contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination, is the most critical driver. Delays allow for geometric expansion.
2.  **Vaccine Availability and Uptake (Large):** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine provides powerful protection. The ability to deploy it quickly via a "ring" strategy (vaccinating contacts of cases) can rapidly halt transmission chains. Hesitancy or logistical failure would be a major problem.
3.  **Conflict and Security (Large):** This was the primary reason the 2018-20 Kivu outbreak became so large. Insecurity prevents health workers from accessing affected areas, halts vaccination, and fosters community mistrust. The security situation in Kasaï is a pivotal variable.
4.  **Geographic and Social Context (Moderate):** An outbreak in a dense, highly-connected urban center (like Goma in 2019) is far more dangerous than one in a remote, rural area. Kasaï province has urban centers, and this is its first major outbreak in the modern era, suggesting lower local preparedness.
5.  **Community Engagement and Trust (Moderate):** Mistrust of responders can lead to hidden cases, attacks on health workers, and refusal of safe burial practices, all of which fuel transmission.
6.  **Healthcare Infrastructure (Small-to-Moderate):** The capacity of local clinics to implement Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures is crucial. Poor IPC can lead to healthcare workers becoming infected, amplifying the outbreak.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Location (Kasaï Province):** Unlike North Kivu or Equateur, which have built institutional memory from recent outbreaks, Kasaï has not faced Ebola on this scale since 2008. This implies potentially weaker local response infrastructure and population awareness.
*   **Initial Detection Lag:** The 15 deaths reported just three days after the declaration suggests significant pre-detection spread. Many recent, smaller outbreaks were caught much earlier in their lifecycle (e.g., after just one or two deaths).
*   **Security Context:** The Kivu (2018-20) outbreak occurred in an active warzone with multiple armed groups. While Kasaï has a history of conflict (e.g., the 2016-19 insurgency), the current security situation is not comparable to the intense, systemic violence that crippled the Kivu response. This makes a Kivu-scale repeat highly unlikely.
*   **Mature Response System:** Compared to the pre-2014 era, the global and Congolese systems for Ebola response are vastly more experienced and better equipped. The playbook of rapid deployment, mobile labs, and ring vaccination is now standard operating procedure, a major difference from the historical base rate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the post-vaccine DRC reference class. This suggests a distribution heavily skewed towards a low outcome (<60 deaths), but with a very long tail to account for the Kivu-type black swan event. An equivalent n of ~6 (the number of recent outbreaks) seems appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Initial size (15 deaths by day 3) and location in an inexperienced province strongly suggest this will not be a minimal (<10 death) outbreak.
    *   (↓ Large) The existence of a mature, vaccine-centric response system, and a security situation better than the Kivu worst-case, provides a strong cap on the potential scale.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The infection of a health worker in a new zone confirms that containment is not yet fully established and some chains of transmission were missed.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The recent decline in weekly case incidence is a strong signal that the response is gaining control.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence pushes the posterior significantly away from the median of recent small outbreaks (5-10 deaths). However, the powerful downward pressures from modern response capabilities make the Kivu outlier (2,287 deaths) an extremely improbable scenario. The posterior should center on a value in the low-to-mid hundreds (e.g., 75-250), much higher than a typical small outbreak but an order of magnitude lower than a catastrophic one.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases in a major provincial city (e.g., Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi).
    *   A sustained increase in the proportion of new cases not on a known contact list.
    *   Any security incident that forces a suspension of response activities for >48 hours.
    *   Confirmed cross-border spread into Angola or neighboring provinces.
    *   Multiple, independent super-spreader events (e.g., funerals, healthcare facilities).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A full 21-day period (one maximum incubation period) with zero new cases reported.
    *   The last active case is discharged from a treatment center.
    *   Weekly case incidence falls to zero and stays there.
    *   High (>90%) vaccination coverage achieved in all identified rings.
    *   No new health zones reporting cases for over two weeks.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting Lags:** The resolution source is the DRC Ministry of Health. Data, especially from remote areas, can be subject to significant delays and revisions. Deaths occurring before Jan 1, 2026 may not be officially reported until after that date.
*   **Case Definition:** The distinction between "confirmed" and "probable" deaths can be blurry. The resolution criteria will depend on how the Ministry classifies cases, which may not always be consistent.
*   **Political Instability:** The security situation in Kasaï, while better than Kivu, is not guaranteed to remain stable. A sudden flare-up of local conflict could dramatically alter the forecast.
*   **Resolution Timeline:** The Jan 1, 2026 cutoff is arbitrary. The outbreak will likely be declared over later. The question only counts deaths *before* this date, so a long, low-level tail of the outbreak could see deaths in early 2026 that do not count.
*   **Concurrent Health Crises:** The response capacity could be strained if another major health emergency (e.g., measles, cholera) occurs simultaneously in the same region.

**Final Research Summary:** The outbreak's initial undetected spread and location in an inexperienced province make it significantly more severe than a typical, quickly-contained flare-up. However, a robust and vaccine-led response in a security environment better than the 2018 Kivu catastrophe should prevent a large-scale disaster, pointing to a final death toll in the low-to-mid hundreds.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province, DRC, before January 1, 2026, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the distribution of deaths from post-vaccine era Ebola outbreaks in the DRC (2018-present). This reflects the current capabilities for outbreak response, including the use of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. The median number of deaths in these outbreaks is 5.5, excluding the Kivu outlier, with a mean of ~12. Including the Kivu outlier, the mean is ~393. This suggests a bimodal distribution: most outbreaks are contained quickly (<60 deaths), but under certain conditions, they can become very large.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that it is a post-vaccine era outbreak in the DRC. However, it differs in several key aspects:
- **Location:** Kasaï Province has not faced a major outbreak recently, suggesting potentially weaker local response infrastructure.
- **Initial Detection Lag:** The high number of deaths reported early indicates significant pre-detection spread.
- **Security Context:** The security situation is better than during the Kivu outbreak, reducing the likelihood of a large-scale event.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Initial Size and Location (↑):** The early high death toll and inexperienced location suggest a more severe outbreak than typical small ones.
- **Mature Response System (↓):** The presence of a robust response system and effective vaccine deployment are strong factors for containment.
- **Healthcare Worker Infection (↑):** Indicates gaps in containment and potential for further spread.
- **Decline in Weekly Cases (↓):** Suggests that containment measures are starting to take effect.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered on a low outcome (<60 deaths) but allowing for a long tail, the evidence suggests shifting the distribution towards higher values. The initial high death toll and healthcare worker infection push the forecast up, while the mature response system and declining case incidence push it down. The posterior distribution centers on a value in the low-to-mid hundreds (e.g., 75-250), reflecting a more severe outbreak than typical but far from catastrophic.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Consideration of tail risks and alternative scenarios suggests that while a large-scale outbreak is unlikely, the potential for further spread due to undetected transmission chains and healthcare worker infections should not be ignored. The best alternative forecast might assume a higher death toll if containment fails or if there are significant security disruptions. However, the current evidence supports a forecast in the low-to-mid hundreds.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the calibrated percentiles for the forecast are as follows:

P10: 30  
P20: 50  
P40: 80  
P60: 120  
P80: 180  
P90: 250

# Forecasting Ebola Deaths in the DRC Outbreak (2025-2026)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the post-vaccine era DRC Ebola outbreaks (2018-present) as my primary reference class, with some consideration of broader historical patterns.

**Post-vaccine DRC outbreaks (2018-present):**
- Kivu (2018-20): ~2,287 deaths
- Equateur (2020): 55 deaths
- North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
- Equateur (2022): 5 deaths
- North Kivu (2022): 1 death

This distribution is highly skewed with a median of 5.5 deaths. Excluding the Kivu outlier, the mean is ~12 deaths. Including Kivu, the mean jumps to ~393 deaths.

The prior distribution appears bimodal: most outbreaks are contained quickly (<60 deaths), but under specific adverse conditions (like conflict zones), they can become catastrophic (thousands of deaths).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure challenges
- Same disease (Ebola) with known transmission patterns
- Availability of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine
- Established international response protocols

**Key differences:**
- Location in Kasaï Province, which hasn't experienced a major Ebola outbreak since 2007-2008
- Early indicators suggest significant pre-detection spread (15 deaths reported just 3 days after declaration)
- Security situation is better than during the Kivu outbreak (2018-20)
- 32 cases and 15 deaths already reported by September 7, indicating this won't be a minimal outbreak

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast higher:**
- Initial size (32 cases, 15 deaths by day 3): This suggests the outbreak was spreading undetected for some time before official declaration. This makes it ~3x more likely to exceed 50 deaths compared to recent small outbreaks.
- Location in Kasaï Province: Less experienced with Ebola response than North Kivu or Equateur, suggesting ~1.5x higher risk of larger spread.
- Health worker infection in a new zone (Oct 8): Indicates containment gaps and nosocomial transmission, a key amplifier in past outbreaks. This makes it ~2x more likely to exceed 100 deaths.

**Evidence pushing forecast lower:**
- Rapid deployment of WHO and MSF teams (Sept 15): Experienced international response is crucial for containment, reducing the probability of a catastrophic outcome by ~3x.
- Ring vaccination campaign beginning (Sept 20): The vaccine is highly effective at breaking transmission chains, reducing the probability of exceeding 500 deaths by ~5x.
- Declining weekly case incidence (Oct 25): Two consecutive weeks of declining cases strongly suggests containment measures are working, reducing the probability of exceeding 300 deaths by ~2x.
- Better security situation than Kivu: The absence of intense armed conflict makes a Kivu-scale catastrophe (~10x) less likely.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the bimodal prior distribution centered around a median of 5.5 deaths but with a long tail:
- P10: ~1 death
- P50: ~5.5 deaths
- P90: ~100 deaths (heavily influenced by the Kivu outlier)

First update based on initial outbreak size (32 cases, 15 deaths already):
- This immediately rules out the lower end of the distribution
- The likelihood ratio strongly favors outcomes above the median
- Updated distribution shifts upward: P50 moves from ~5.5 to ~75 deaths

Second update based on response factors (vaccination, WHO/MSF deployment):
- These factors cap the extreme upper tail
- Likelihood ratio strongly disfavors Kivu-scale outcomes (thousands)
- P90 shifts down from potential thousands to ~400 deaths

Third update based on recent case decline:
- Two consecutive weeks of declining cases is a strong signal of containment
- This further compresses the upper tail
- P50 shifts slightly downward to ~60-70 deaths

The posterior distribution is now centered much higher than the typical small outbreak (5-10 deaths) but far below the catastrophic Kivu scenario (2,287 deaths). The most likely outcome is in the low hundreds.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk of security deterioration in Kasaï
- The health worker infection could indicate more widespread nosocomial transmission than currently known
- The decline in cases could be due to reporting issues rather than actual containment
- I might be overestimating the effectiveness of the vaccine in this specific context

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Security breakdown scenario**: If conflict erupts in Kasaï, response efforts could be severely hampered, potentially pushing deaths into the 500-1000 range.
2. **Urban spread scenario**: If cases reach major cities like Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi and establish sustained transmission, deaths could exceed 300-400.
3. **Super-rapid containment**: The recent case decline could accelerate, leading to containment by early 2026 with a total under 50 deaths.

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my uncertainty bands to account for these scenarios
- The upper tail needs more weight given the potential for security breakdown
- The distribution should reflect that we're already at 15 deaths with more certain to follow

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 35
P20: 45

P60: 90
P80: 150

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is **Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) during the post-vaccine era (2018-present)**. This period is most relevant because the introduction and systematic use of the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine fundamentally changed outbreak response and containment potential.

This reference class includes seven outbreaks with the following death tolls: 1, 5, 5, 6, 33, 55, and 2,287.

This distribution is extremely right-skewed:
*   **Median:** 6 deaths.
*   **Mean:** ~342 deaths.
*   **Key feature:** The distribution is effectively bimodal. Most outbreaks are contained very quickly with fewer than 60 deaths. However, there is a small but significant probability of a catastrophic containment failure, as seen in the 2018-2020 Kivu outbreak, which was driven by intense armed conflict.

My prior distribution, therefore, has a high concentration of probability mass at low values (<60) but includes a very long tail to account for the possibility of a "black swan" event.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The outbreak is in the DRC, leveraging the world's most experienced national and international Ebola response systems.
*   The standard, effective playbook of contact tracing, isolation, safe burials, and ring vaccination is being implemented.

**Differences:**
*   **Location (Kasaï Province):** This is a critical difference. Unlike North Kivu and Equateur, which have recent experience, Kasaï has not faced a major Ebola outbreak in the modern era. This suggests lower local preparedness, institutional memory, and community awareness, which is a significant risk factor.
*   **Initial Undetected Spread:** With 15 deaths reported just three days after the official declaration, it's clear the virus was spreading for a considerable time before being detected. This is a strong negative indicator, as it means the outbreak began with significant momentum and multiple transmission chains. This feature makes it highly dissimilar to the quickly contained outbreaks in the reference class (which had 1-6 deaths).
*   **Security Context:** The primary driver of the catastrophic Kivu outbreak (2,287 deaths) was severe, persistent armed conflict that crippled the response. The research report indicates that while Kasaï has a history of instability, the current security situation is not comparable. This makes a Kivu-scale repeat highly unlikely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior based on the key pieces of evidence provided:

*   **Evidence (↑↑): 15 deaths by Sep 7 in an inexperienced province.** This evidence makes outcomes below 30 extremely unlikely. It strongly shifts the probability mass away from the prior's median of 6 and towards the higher end of the "contained outbreak" scale (e.g., 50-100 deaths) or beyond. It suggests the final toll will be, at a minimum, comparable to the larger non-Kivu outbreaks (33 and 55 deaths).

*   **Evidence (↓↓): Rapid response with vaccination initiated (Sep 15-20).** This is the most powerful tool for containment and the reason most modern outbreaks are small. Its deployment provides a strong cap against the worst-case scenarios. This evidence significantly reduces the likelihood of the extreme tail (1000+ deaths), countering the negative implications of the initial spread.

*   **Evidence (↑): Confirmed case in a health worker in a new zone (Oct 8).** This indicates that the initial containment ring was not perfect and the outbreak has achieved geographic spread. It suggests the outbreak will be more prolonged and larger than one contained within a single area, pushing the likely final total higher.

*   **Evidence (↓): Weekly case incidence dropping for two consecutive weeks (Oct 25).** This is the strongest signal that the response is succeeding and the outbreak's growth has been arrested (R < 1). While deaths will continue to accrue from those already infected, this indicates the outbreak is on a path to being extinguished. This evidence pulls the upper percentiles of the forecast down significantly.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   My prior was heavily weighted towards <60 deaths, with a long tail.
*   The initial size and location evidence effectively eliminates the high probability of a very small (<30) outbreak and shifts the entire distribution to the right. The median moves from ~6 into the high dozens or low hundreds.
*   The evidence of a modern, vaccine-led response acts as a strong brake on the tail risk, making a Kivu-scale event very improbable.
*   The spread to a new zone confirms the outbreak is complex and will not be resolved trivially, keeping the median elevated.
*   Finally, the falling case incidence is a powerful signal that the peak has passed. This allows me to confidently place the upper bounds of my forecast well below the catastrophic Kivu outcome.

The posterior distribution is therefore centered on a value significantly higher than the typical small outbreak (5-55 deaths) but an order of magnitude lower than the Kivu catastrophe. The final toll will likely be in the low-to-mid hundreds.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher):** The drop in cases could be a temporary lull or a reporting artifact. An undetected cluster in an urban center could cause a new surge. While the security situation is better than Kivu, a sudden deterioration could still hamper the response. This justifies keeping a reasonably high P90 (e.g., >300).
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower):** The response, despite the slow start, could be exceptionally effective from this point forward, leading to a rapid end to all transmission chains. In this case, the final toll might be closer to the upper end of the small-outbreak range, perhaps 60-80 deaths. This justifies a P10 that is not excessively high.
*   **Conclusion:** My central estimate seems sound. The distribution should be wide and right-skewed to reflect these competing possibilities. The initial conditions make a low outcome (<50) very unlikely, and the effective modern response makes a catastrophic outcome (>1000) also very unlikely. The uncertainty lies in the "messy middle," which my percentiles aim to capture.
