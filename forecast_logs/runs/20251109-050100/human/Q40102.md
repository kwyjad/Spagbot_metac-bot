### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Initial Phase of New UK Resettlement Schemes:** New government programs involving international transfers and vetting of vulnerable people tend to start very slowly. For example, the first year of the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) for Syrians saw only 166 people resettled in the first seven months (Mar-Sep 2014). This suggests a base rate of a few dozen to low-hundreds in the first 4-5 months of operation.
2.  **Current Program's Observed Rate:** The program admitted its first person on Sep 24, 2025, and reached 23 people by Oct 24, 2025. This is a 30-day period. This provides a highly specific but short-term reference class.
    *   Rate from Sep 24 to Oct 9 (15 days): (18-3)/15 = 1.0 person/day.
    *   Rate from Oct 9 to Oct 24 (15 days): (23-18)/15 = 0.33 people/day.
    *   The average rate over the first month is ~0.77 people/day, but it appears to be decelerating. Extrapolating this rate from Nov 9 to Dec 31 (52 days) would add ~17-40 people.
3.  **Pilot Program Rollouts:** The scheme is explicitly a "pilot" until June 2026. Pilot programs are often deliberately small-scale to test procedures, identify problems, and manage political risk. A base rate for such pilots would be in the low dozens to hundreds over their initial phase, not thousands.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-06] UK-France Agreement signed — (Neutral) — Establishes the legal framework for the "one-in, one-out" returns and admissions program.
*   [2025-09-18] First return to France under the agreement occurs — (↑) — Unlocks the "out" component, which is a prerequisite for the "in" component (admissions).
*   [2025-09-24] First family of three admitted to the UK — (↑) — Confirms the program is operational and has begun processing individuals.
*   [2025-10-09] Total admissions reach 18 people — (↑) — Shows continued operation beyond the initial token transfer, establishing an early rate of ~1 person/day.
*   [2025-10-24] Total admissions reach 23 people; RFI reports criticism is mounting — (↓) — The rate of admissions slowed significantly to ~0.33/day, suggesting bottlenecks or a loss of momentum. Criticism implies political risk.
*   [2025-11-07] Home Office describes crossings as 'shameful' — (↓) — Statement focuses on the failure of deterrence, not the success of the new legal pathway, suggesting the program is not a political priority or success story to be scaled rapidly.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Number of Successful Returns to France:** This is the primary driver and a hard ceiling on admissions due to the "one-in, one-out" mechanism. Returns are logistically complex and vulnerable to legal challenges. (Large effect)
2.  **UK Administrative Capacity:** The ability of the Home Office to vet online applicants, issue visas, and arrange transport and accommodation. Bureaucratic friction is a significant constraint in new schemes. (Moderate effect)
3.  **French Operational Cooperation:** The willingness and capacity of French authorities to accept returned individuals. Any friction or disagreement will directly halt the "out" flow, thereby halting the "in" flow. (Moderate effect)
4.  **Political Will & Media Cycle:** With the policy's deterrent effect in question, the UK government may choose to either (a) accelerate the scheme to demonstrate success or (b) quietly de-emphasize it to avoid highlighting its low numbers. The latter seems more likely. (Moderate effect)
5.  **Legal Challenges:** Any successful legal challenge in the UK or France against the returns process could pause the entire scheme, freezing admissions at their current level. (Large effect)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct Linkage to Returns:** Unlike standard resettlement schemes (e.g., VPRS), this program's intake is not independently determined but is strictly conditional on the number of returns. This creates a unique and powerful bottleneck.
*   **Pilot Status:** The program is explicitly a pilot. This contrasts with fully-fledged schemes designed for scale from the outset, suggesting a cautious and potentially low-volume approach is intended.
*   **High Political Scrutiny:** The scheme is a direct, high-profile response to the ongoing small boats crisis. Its success or failure is judged in real-time, creating pressure that could either accelerate or kill it quickly, unlike more stable humanitarian programs.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves at the end of 2025, leaving less than two months. This is too short a period for a slow-starting bureaucracy to ramp up to a significant operational tempo.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, based on similar new resettlement schemes, might be a negative binomial or Poisson distribution centered around 100-200 people for the first ~4 months, with high variance (equivalent n of ~2-3).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The "one-in, one-out" mechanism is a severe constraint, and the number of returns is likely to be very low and difficult to scale.
    *   (↓ Large) The observed rate of admissions has already decelerated sharply in its first month, from 1.0/day to 0.33/day.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The political narrative is focused on the failure of deterrence, not the success of the legal pathway, reducing the incentive to accelerate the program for PR purposes.
    *   (↑ Small) The program is demonstrably operational, having processed 23 individuals, proving it is not just a paper agreement.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to a low-volume outcome. The posterior distribution should be revised significantly downwards, with its mass concentrated in the low-to-mid double digits (e.g., 35-70). The initial prior was too optimistic.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official government announcements quantifying the number of returns to France.
    *   A minister publicly championing the scheme and promising to "speed up" the process.
    *   Reports of a new, large batch of arrivals under the scheme (e.g., >15 people at once).
    *   French government statements praising the cooperation and smooth operation of returns.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Media reports of legal challenges being filed to block returns to France.
    *   A significant gap (e.g., >3 weeks) with no new reported admissions.
    *   Continued high numbers of Channel crossings, leading to political attacks that the deal is a failure.
    *   Leaked reports of administrative backlogs or French frustration with the process.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Lumpy Data:** Admissions may not be a smooth stream but may occur in discrete, irregular batches. A single flight could significantly alter the final number.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria is "visas issued." This may not perfectly correlate with public announcements of "people admitted/arrived." There could be a lag, or visas could be issued for people who have not yet travelled.
*   **Year-End Political Maneuvering:** The government might orchestrate a larger-than-usual transfer in late December to be able to claim a "successful" start to the program in year-end reports.
*   **Reporting Lags:** The most recent public figure is from Oct 24. The true number as of today (Nov 9) is unknown. Media may not report every small increase.
*   **Program Failure:** The pilot could be paused or collapse entirely before year-end due to legal or political challenges, freezing the number at its current level.

**Final Research Summary:** The program's "one-in, one-out" design, tied to the difficult and legally fraught process of returns, is a powerful brake on its expansion. The initially slow rate of admissions has already decelerated, suggesting the final number by year-end will be in the low-to-mid double digits rather than the hundreds.

To forecast the number of people who will be admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is informed by the initial phase of new UK resettlement schemes, such as the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) for Syrians, which saw 166 people resettled in the first seven months. Given the current program's pilot status and the "one-in, one-out" mechanism, a base rate of 100-200 people for the first four months is reasonable, with high variance due to the pilot nature.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both the current program and past resettlement schemes start slowly and face bureaucratic and logistical challenges.
   - Differences: The "one-in, one-out" mechanism is a unique constraint, directly linking admissions to returns, which is not present in typical resettlement programs.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The observed rate of admissions has decelerated from 1.0 person/day to 0.33 person/day, suggesting bottlenecks.
   - Political focus is on the failure of deterrence rather than the success of the legal pathway, reducing the likelihood of rapid scaling.
   - The program is operational, having admitted 23 people, but criticism and logistical challenges suggest a low-volume outcome.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Negative binomial distribution centered around 100-200 people.
   - Likelihood: Evidence of deceleration and political challenges suggests a downward adjustment.
   - Posterior: The distribution shifts downward, concentrating mass in the low-to-mid double digits (e.g., 35-70).

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for a late-year political push to increase numbers.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden increase in returns could lead to a higher admission rate, but this is unlikely given current evidence.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a late-year batch increase, but maintain a conservative estimate due to current trends.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles are as follows:

P10: 30  
P20: 40  
P40: 50  
P60: 60  
P80: 70  
P90: 80

# Forecast: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use two reference classes:
1. **Early-phase migration pilot programs**: New UK resettlement schemes typically start very slowly. The Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme for Syrians saw only 166 people resettled in the first 7 months.
2. **This specific program's observed rate**: From Sep 24 to Oct 24, 2025 (30 days), the program admitted 23 people, with a decelerating trend:
   - First 15 days: 1.0 person/day
   - Second 15 days: 0.33 person/day
   - Average: ~0.77 people/day

Given these base rates and the program's "pilot" status, I'll use a prior centered around 50-70 people by end of 2025, with significant uncertainty (standard deviation of ~30).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Like other pilot programs, this scheme involves complex international coordination
- It requires administrative processing, security checks, and transportation logistics
- It faces political scrutiny and potential implementation challenges

**Key differences:**
- The "one-in, one-out" mechanism creates a hard ceiling on admissions based on successful returns to France
- The program has only ~52 days left until year-end 2025 (from latest data point)
- The scheme is explicitly tied to the politically contentious small boats crisis
- The observed deceleration in admission rate is concerning for future volume

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing numbers higher:**
- The program is operational and has successfully processed 23 people (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring at least moderate success)
- The UK-France agreement creates a formal framework for transfers (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 for continued operation)

**Evidence pushing numbers lower:**
- Deceleration from 1.0 to 0.33 people/day suggests implementation difficulties (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring continued slow pace)
- RFI reports mounting criticism and failure to deter crossings (likelihood ratio ~2:1 for political deprioritization)
- The "one-in, one-out" mechanism means returns must happen first, creating a bottleneck (likelihood ratio ~4:1 for severe volume constraints)
- Home Office's recent focus on "shameful" crossings suggests the program isn't being highlighted as a success (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 for low political will)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at ~60 people by year-end, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on deceleration and bottleneck constraints:**
- Prior: ~60 people (SD ~30)
- Evidence: Deceleration and "one-in, one-out" bottleneck (combined likelihood ratio ~7:1 favoring lower numbers)
- Posterior: Shifts downward to ~40 people (SD ~20)

**Update on political factors:**
- Prior: ~40 people (SD ~20)
- Evidence: Criticism mounting and lack of political championing (combined likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower numbers)
- Posterior: Shifts further downward to ~35 people (SD ~15)

The posterior distribution is now centered around 35 people, with most of the probability mass between 20-50 people.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the UK government's ability to accelerate the program for year-end political wins
- There could be unreported batches of admissions since Oct 24 that aren't yet public
- The program might process people in larger groups rather than steadily, creating "lumpy" data

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be higher numbers (70-100) if:
1. The UK government decides to prioritize the program to demonstrate success
2. Legal and administrative barriers to returns are overcome
3. A large batch of returns enables a corresponding surge in admissions

However, the observed deceleration and political context make this scenario less likely. I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 20
P20: 25
P40: 32
P60: 38
P80: 45
P90: 55

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the observed performance of similar new, small-scale UK government resettlement or asylum schemes. For example, the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) for Syrians resettled 166 people in its first seven months (an average of ~0.8 people/day). A secondary, more specific base rate is the program's own performance in its first month. Between September 24 and October 24, 2025, 20 people were admitted (an average of ~0.67 people/day).

The forecast period is the 68 days from October 25 to December 31, 2025. Applying a rate of 0.7 people/day to this period would suggest ~48 additional people. Adding this to the current total of 23 gives a prior median of around 71. Given the novelty and volatility of such programs, the prior distribution should be wide, perhaps with a standard deviation of 30-40.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** Like other new government schemes, this program is subject to initial bureaucratic friction, the need to establish new procedures with an international partner (France), and a slow start-up phase.

**Differences:**
*   **Structural Constraint:** The most significant difference is the "one-in, one-out" mechanism. The number of admissions is strictly capped by the number of successful returns to France. Returns are logistically complex and highly vulnerable to legal challenges, creating a powerful bottleneck not present in standard resettlement schemes. This is a strong reason to expect a lower rate than the VPRS base rate.
*   **Pilot Status:** The program is explicitly a "pilot" until mid-2026. This signals an intention to test the process on a small scale rather than to process large numbers immediately.
*   **Political Context:** The program is under intense political scrutiny as a response to the ongoing Channel crossings crisis. Its perceived failure to act as a deterrent could lead to it being de-emphasized to avoid political embarrassment, rather than scaled up.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Observed Deceleration (Strong Downward Pressure):** The rate of admissions dropped sharply in the first month. From Sep 24 to Oct 9 (15 days), the rate was 1.0 person/day. From Oct 9 to Oct 24 (15 days), it fell to 0.33 people/day. This is strong evidence that the initial, higher rate was not sustainable and that the system is already hitting constraints. This observation is much more likely if the true sustainable rate is low (<0.5/day).
*   **Negative Political Narrative (Moderate Downward Pressure):** The RFI report notes that the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting. This reduces the political incentive for the government to champion the program and dedicate resources to accelerate it, as doing so might draw more attention to its limited impact on the overall problem.
*   **Program is Operational (Floor/Support):** The fact that 23 people have been successfully processed proves the mechanism works and is not just a paper agreement. This makes a final outcome of exactly 23 (i.e., a complete and immediate halt) less likely than a continued slow trickle.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior distribution was centered around 71, based on an average rate of ~0.7 people/day. The evidence, particularly the sharp deceleration to 0.33 people/day, compels a significant downward update. This new, lower rate is a much better predictor for the near future than the month-long average.

*   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior(centered at ~71) × Likelihood(favors low rate << 1.0/day)
*   **Explicit Update:** I will update my expected rate for the remaining 68 days from ~0.7/day to something closer to the most recent observed rate of 0.33/day. Let's use a slightly more optimistic rate of 0.37/day to account for potential learning effects.
    *   Expected additional people: 68 days * 0.37 people/day ≈ 25 people.
    *   New median estimate: 23 (current) + 25 = 48.
*   **Posterior Shape:** My posterior distribution is now centered around 48. It remains wide to reflect uncertainty and is skewed to the right. The downside is constrained (it's unlikely to be much lower than 30), while the upside has a small but non-zero chance of a large batch being processed for political reasons before year-end.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Higher Forecast:** A key vulnerability in my forecast is the possibility of lumpy, batch-based admissions. The government, facing criticism, might arrange a charter flight with 50-100 people in December to create a "good news" story and claim the program is a success. This would push the total towards 75-125. While possible, the logistical and bureaucratic hurdles make this a low-probability tail event.
*   **Alternative Lower Forecast:** The program could stall completely due to a successful legal challenge against returns, or a political disagreement with France. In this scenario, admissions would cease, and the final number could be stuck in the high 20s. This risk is significant and justifies keeping the lower percentiles close to the current number.
*   **Conclusion:** The "continued slow trickle" scenario, anchored by the most recent data, remains the most plausible. My median of 48 reflects this. The percentiles must account for the competing risks of a complete stall (downside) and a large political batch (upside). The right-skewed distribution I've constructed (P10-P50 gap of 18 vs P50-P90 gap of 37) appropriately models this asymmetry.
