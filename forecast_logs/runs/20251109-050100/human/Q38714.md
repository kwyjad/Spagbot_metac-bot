### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the current official WCA world record for the 3x3x3 average?** This is the primary anchor for any forecast.
*   **Q2: What is the historical trend of the world record progression?** Understanding the rate of improvement (and its deceleration) is crucial for projecting future performance.
*   **Q3: Who are the current top contenders?** Identify the individuals most likely to set a new record (e.g., Yiheng Wang, Tymon Kolasiński, Max Park, Ruihang Xu).
*   **Q4: What were the results of the most recent major competitions?** The provided sources point to the 2025 World Championship in July. This result provides a strong, recent signal of performance under pressure.
*   **Q5: What are the primary drivers of improvement in speedcubing?** This involves looking at technology (cube hardware), methodology (solving techniques), and human factors (training, reaction time).
*   **Q6: What is the likelihood of a world record being broken in any given month?** This addresses the specific constraint of the question ("during November 2025").

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `WCA world records 3x3x3 average`, `World Cube Association official rankings 333 average`
*   **Q2:** `history of 3x3x3 average world record`, `graph of Rubik's Cube world record progression average`
*   **Q3:** `top 3x3x3 speedcubers 2025`, `Yiheng Wang WCA profile`, `Tymon Kolasiński WCA results`
*   **Q4:** `WCA World Championship 2025 3x3x3 average results` (Partially answered by sources)
*   **Q5:** `latest speedcube hardware 2025`, `new speedcubing methods CFOP`, `advances in cubing look-ahead`
*   **Q6:** `WCA competitions calendar November 2025`, `frequency of 3x3x3 average world records`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   The current 3x3x3 average world record (WR) stands at **4.03 seconds**, set by Yiheng Wang in September 2023.
*   The historical trend shows a classic curve of diminishing returns. Improvements have slowed from multiple seconds to tenths, and now hundredths, of a second. The leap from the previous record (4.48s) to 4.03s was significant, but such large jumps are becoming rarer.
*   The top contenders remain a small, elite group, primarily Yiheng Wang and Tymon Kolasiński, who consistently produce sub-4.5 second averages in competition.
*   The 2025 World Championship in July is a key recent data point. Yiheng Wang won with a **4.23-second average**. This is an elite time but is notably slower than his own WR, highlighting the difficulty of achieving peak performance, even for the best.
*   Mechanisms for improvement are now incremental. Hardware (magnetic cores, coatings) is highly optimized. Methods (CFOP variants) are mature. The main frontier is human performance: look-ahead, turning speed, and consistency under pressure.
*   The resolution requires a record to be set *during* November 2025. Records are not broken every month. An analysis of the WR history shows that the average time between new 3x3x3 average records has been lengthening. The current record has stood for over two years. Therefore, the probability of a new WR in any specific 30-day window is low. The fastest time in November 2025 is more likely to be a "very good" winning time at a competition rather than a new absolute WR.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **World Record Progression:** The history of the 3x3x3 average world record. The current record is 4.03 seconds. The rate of improvement has slowed dramatically, with recent records shaving off tenths of a second over multi-year periods. A new record would likely fall in the **3.85-4.02 second** range.
*   **Major Championship Winning Times:** The winning averages at World and Continental Championships. The 2025 World Championship was won with a 4.23-second average. This class suggests that elite, high-pressure performances cluster in the **4.20-4.60 second** range.
*   **Fastest Monthly Time (Non-WR):** The fastest average time set globally in a typical month where no world record is broken. This is often a winning time at a significant regional competition. This base rate would be in the **4.30-4.80 second** range, faster than a typical local winner but slower than the absolute world record.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-06** Yiheng Wang wins the WCA World Championship with a 4.23s average. ↓ — Confirms the top cuber is in excellent form, but also shows that even in a major event, a new WR is not guaranteed. The performance ceiling is in the low 4s.
*   **2025-01-01** A source notes a (likely single solve) 3.05s WR by Xuanyi Geng. ↓ — While likely not an average time, it signals that the absolute physical speed of top cubers is still increasing, making a faster average more plausible over the long term.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Human Performance Optimization (Large):** The primary driver. Includes look-ahead ability, turning speed (TPS), and nerve management. Incremental gains here are the most likely source of a new record.
*   **Competition Frequency & Prestige (Moderate):** More competitions provide more opportunities ("shots on goal") for a record. High-prestige events with top competitors gathered together increase the likelihood of a record attempt.
*   **Hardware Evolution (Small):** Cube technology (magnets, tensioning, coatings) is mature. While minor improvements occur, a paradigm-shifting hardware change that significantly lowers times is unlikely.
*   **Methodological Refinements (Small):** The dominant CFOP method is highly optimized. New algorithm sets (e.g., ZBLL) offer marginal gains but require immense practice and are situational.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Era of Diminishing Returns:** Unlike the rapid progress of 2005-2015, we are in a period where shaving off 0.1 seconds from the WR is a monumental achievement. The base rate of historical improvement is less predictive now.
*   **Concentrated Elite Talent:** The potential to break the WR is concentrated in 2-3 individuals, primarily Yiheng Wang and Tymon Kolasiński. The outcome is highly dependent on their participation and performance in November.
*   **Specific Monthly Window:** The question is not "what will the next WR be?" but "what will be the fastest time in November 2025?". This is a crucial distinction. The base rate for a WR being broken in a *specific month* is very low. The most probable outcome is that the fastest time will be a non-WR performance.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered near the current World Record of 4.03 seconds, but with significant probability mass extending to slower times (e.g., up to 4.50s). The prior should be strong (high equivalent n), reflecting the stability of the record.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) **Diminishing returns:** The difficulty of improving at this elite level is immense. (Large)
    *   (↑) **Specific month constraint:** The probability of a WR occurring in this 30-day window is low. The fastest time is likely to be a strong, but not record, performance. (Large)
    *   (↓) **Recent World's result (4.23s):** Confirms top cubers are actively competing and performing at an extremely high level, making a time near the WR plausible. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) **High competition frequency:** The modern cubing circuit provides numerous monthly opportunities for a record to be attempted. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the posterior *up* (slower) from a potential new WR. The forecast should be centered slightly above the current 4.03s WR, reflecting the high likelihood that no new record is set in this specific month. A median around **4.15-4.35 seconds** seems appropriate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (slower time):**
    *   A sparse WCA competition schedule for November 2025.
    *   Top contenders (Wang, Kolasiński) not registered for any November events.
    *   Recent competition results in Oct 2025 showing winning times in the mid-to-high 4s.
*   **DOWN indicators (faster time):**
    *   Announcement of a major, high-stakes competition in November 2025.
    *   Multiple top-5 cubers registering for the same November competition.
    *   A new WR is set in September or October 2025, indicating the 4.

To forecast the fastest average solving time of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube during November 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is centered around the current world record of 4.03 seconds, set by Yiheng Wang in September 2023. Historical trends show diminishing returns in record improvements, with recent records improving by tenths or hundredths of a second over multi-year periods. The variance is small, reflecting the stability of top performances.
   - Mean/Median: 4.03 seconds; Variance: Low (reflecting tight clustering around top performances).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The current situation is similar to the base case in that the top competitors remain the same, and the technology and methods are mature.
   - Difference: The specific constraint of November 2025 and the recent performance at the 2025 World Championship (4.23 seconds) suggest that while top competitors are active, achieving a new WR in this month is unlikely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent World Championship result (4.23s) suggests high-level performance but not a new WR: Likelihood of a time slightly slower than 4.03s is higher.
   - Diminishing returns in record improvements: Increases likelihood of times clustering around 4.20-4.50 seconds.
   - Specific month constraint: Lowers likelihood of a new WR, increasing probability of a time in the 4.20-4.50 second range.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered at 4.03 seconds with low variance.
   - Evidence (recent competition results, diminishing returns) shifts the distribution slightly upward, centering around 4.20-4.35 seconds.
   - Posterior mean: Approximately 4.25 seconds; Variance: Slightly increased to account for competition variability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The forecast should account for potential outliers or unexpected performances.
   - Tail risks: A new WR could occur if conditions align perfectly, but this is unlikely given historical trends.
   - Alternative forecast: A time closer to 4.10 seconds if a major competition occurs with all top competitors present.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the most likely outcomes, considering the evidence and potential variability.

P10: 4.15  
P20: 4.20  
P40: 4.25  
P60: 4.30  
P80: 4.35  
P90: 4.40

# Forecast: Fastest Average 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube Solving Time in November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference distributions:

**Primary Base Rate**: The current world record progression for 3x3x3 average times
- Current WR: 4.03 seconds (Yiheng Wang, September 2023)
- Previous WR: 4.48 seconds (Max Park, June 2023)
- The progression shows diminishing returns as we approach physical limits

**Secondary Base Rate**: Recent major competition winning times
- 2025 World Championship: 4.23 seconds (Yiheng Wang)
- Typical elite competition winning averages: 4.20-4.60 seconds

**Tertiary Base Rate**: Fastest monthly times when no WR is broken
- Range: 4.30-4.80 seconds

I'll center my prior around 4.25 seconds with a standard deviation of approximately 0.25 seconds, reflecting that the fastest time in a given month is typically above the world record but still elite.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- The physical limits of human dexterity and cube mechanics remain consistent
- The dominant solving method (CFOP) is mature and optimized
- The elite competitive field remains small (2-3 individuals capable of near-WR times)

**Differences from base rate**:
- The question asks about a specific month (November 2025), not when the next record will be broken
- The probability of a world record in any given month is low
- November may not feature major international competitions (these tend to cluster in summer)
- We're forecasting ~2 years after the current record was set, allowing time for incremental improvement

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for faster times (pushing distribution down)**:
- The 2025 World Championship result (4.23s) shows top cubers are performing at near-record levels consistently
- The current WR (4.03s) has stood for over 2 years, suggesting we may be due for a breakthrough
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes times below 4.20s about 1.2× more likely

**Evidence for slower times (pushing distribution up)**:
- The specific month constraint (November 2025) means we're not asking for the next WR, but rather the fastest time in that month
- Historical data shows WRs are rare events; most months don't see records broken
- November is not traditionally when major international competitions occur
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes times above 4.20s about 2× more likely

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.25s (σ=0.25s), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update based on recent competition results**:
- The 4.23s at World Championship 2025 suggests elite performances are consistently possible
- This shifts my distribution slightly downward (faster times)
- Updated mean: ~4.20s

**Update based on month-specific constraints**:
- The specific month constraint significantly reduces the probability of a WR-breaking performance
- This shifts the distribution upward (slower times)
- Final posterior mean: ~4.30s with σ≈0.22s

The posterior distribution is slightly narrower than the prior, with more probability mass in the 4.15-4.45s range, reflecting increased confidence that the fastest November 2025 time will be a strong but not record-breaking performance.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the rate of improvement in the elite cubing community
- I haven't accounted for potential hardware innovations that could emerge by late 2025
- The competition calendar for November 2025 is unknown; a major competition could attract all top cubers

**Alternative forecast**:
A reasonable alternative would center around 4.10s, arguing that:
- The 2-year gap since the last WR increases the probability of a breakthrough
- Top cubers may be targeting sub-4 second averages by late 2025
- Rebuttal: The physical limits are becoming increasingly hard to overcome, and the specific month constraint remains significant

**Tail risks**:
- Low probability of a dramatic breakthrough (sub-3.9s)
- Also low probability of unusually slow times (>4.6s) given the consistent elite performances

After this consideration, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for these uncertainties, particularly on the faster (lower) end.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 4.02
P20: 4.10
P40: 4.22
P60: 4.32
P80: 4.45
P90: 4.58

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary reference class for this forecast is the distribution of "fastest 3x3x3 average times set globally per month." This is a more appropriate base rate than simply looking at the world record (WR) progression, as a new WR is a rare event and not guaranteed to happen in any specific month.

*   **Anchor 1: Current World Record.** The WR is **4.03 seconds**, set by Yiheng Wang in September 2023. This serves as a soft lower bound for the forecast; any time faster than this would be a historic achievement.
*   **Anchor 2: Major Championship Winning Times.** The 2025 World Championship was won with a **4.23-second average**. This is a crucial data point, representing a winning time under maximum pressure among the world's best. This suggests the central tendency for a "very good month" is likely in the 4.2s-4.4s range.
*   **Anchor 3: General Elite Performance.** The top 10 official averages in the world are all below 4.70 seconds. This indicates that in a month with any significant competition, the fastest time is highly likely to be within this range.

My prior distribution is therefore centered around a typical, high-level winning time, not the absolute WR. I'll set the initial median around **4.30 seconds**, with a skew towards faster times, acknowledging the possibility of a record but the higher probability of a non-record winning time.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation in November 2025 is very similar to the base case of any other month in the modern speedcubing era. The same elite cubers (Yiheng Wang, Tymon Kolasiński, etc.) are active, using highly optimized hardware and methods (CFOP). The structure of WCA competitions is stable.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is the **specific, narrow time window**. We are not forecasting the *next WR*, but the fastest time in a single 30-day period. This makes the outcome highly dependent on two uncertain factors:
    1.  The schedule of competitions in November 2025.
    2.  The attendance and performance of the handful of cubers capable of setting a world-class time.
    This "luck of the draw" for the month increases the uncertainty and pushes the median away from the absolute WR.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: The WR of 4.03s has stood for over two years.** This is strong evidence for the "law of diminishing returns." Breaking the 4-second barrier is proving to be exceptionally difficult. This significantly lowers the likelihood of a sub-4.03s time and pushes the forecast *up* (slower).
*   **Evidence 2: The 2025 World Championship winning time was 4.23s.** This is a powerful anchor. It shows that even the best cuber in the world, at the most important event, performed at a level ~0.2 seconds slower than his own WR. This makes outcomes in the 4.2s-4.4s range much more likely than outcomes near 4.0s. This pushes the forecast *up*, centering it near this 4.23s mark.
*   **Evidence 3: The "specific month" constraint.** The history of WRs shows they are not set every month. The probability of a WR in any given 30-day window is low. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the fastest time in November 2025 will be a strong, but not record-breaking, performance. This is another strong factor pushing the forecast *up*.
*   **Evidence 4: Continued general improvement.** While progress at the very top has slowed, the overall field continues to improve. The physical speed of top cubers is still increasing (as hinted by single solve times). This provides a small, persistent *downward* pressure on the forecast, making a time of 4.20s in late 2025 more plausible than it was in 2024.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 4.30s, with a tail reaching below the WR of 4.03s.
*   **Update:** The evidence from the long-standing WR and the 4.23s World's result are very strong. They suggest my prior median of 4.30s is reasonable, perhaps even a little too slow. The World's result is a very strong signal for a plausible high-end outcome. I will adjust my median downwards slightly to be closer to that 4.23s mark.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution will be centered just above the World's winning time, reflecting that not every month has a competition as stacked as the World Championship. Let's set the median at **4.25 seconds**. The distribution will have a small, thin tail extending below 4.03s (the WR chance) and a fatter tail extending to slower times (the "quiet month" chance). The mode of the distribution is likely around 4.2-4.4 seconds.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **What if I'm wrong?** The main way I could be wrong is by underestimating the chance of a breakthrough. Yiheng Wang's jump to 4.03s was substantial. What if he, or another prodigy, has a similar leap? This is a tail risk on the low end. To account for this, my P10 must be clearly in new-WR territory (i.e., sub-4.00s).
*   **Alternative Scenario:** What if November 2025 has no major competitions? The fastest time could be set at a regional event, resulting in a much slower time, perhaps 4.7s or 4.8s. My upper percentiles (P80, P90) must be high enough to reflect this very plausible scenario.
*   **Final Adjustment:** My proposed distribution gives roughly a 20% chance of a new world record (a time below 4.03s). This feels appropriate—it's a low-probability event, but not impossible over a month-long window with multiple competitions worldwide. The median at 4.25s is anchored to a real, recent, elite performance. The upper tail above 4.7s accounts for the "quiet month" possibility. The forecast seems robust to these alternative scenarios.
