### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Second Attempt at Propulsive Landing for a New Orbital Booster:** This is the most specific and relevant class. The primary analogue is SpaceX's Falcon 9 program. SpaceX experienced multiple failures and hard landings on their drone ship before their first success in April 2016 (after a land-based success in Dec 2015). Their success rate on the *second* sea-landing attempt was 0%. It took them five dedicated sea-landing attempts to succeed.
    *   **Base Rate:** 10-20%. This is a low-confidence estimate, reflecting that success on the second try is historically unprecedented and extremely difficult.
    *   **Limitations:** This class has a sample size of one (n=1), which is SpaceX. Blue Origin may have learned from SpaceX's public failures, potentially increasing their chances relative to a true "first-ever" attempt.

2.  **Maiden Flight Program Success:** A broader class is the success of a new orbital rocket's test flight program. Historically, about 60% of maiden orbital launches fail. New Glenn already succeeded in reaching orbit on its first try, placing it in the top 40% of new rockets. This question is about a secondary objective (landing) on a second flight. The base rate for achieving a key secondary objective on a second flight after a partial success on the first is difficult to establish but is likely below 50%.
    *   **Base Rate:** 30-50%.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is too broad as it doesn't specifically address the extreme technical challenge of propulsive landing, which is significantly harder than just reaching orbit.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-06-09] Ars Technica reports the second launch has slipped to the fall and notes departures from program leadership. — ↓ — Indicates potential technical and/or management issues that could delay the program and reduce confidence in a successful outcome.
*   [2025-11-09] The rocket is reportedly on the launch pad for a scheduled attempt today (per Wikipedia and Rocketlaunch.org sources). — ↑ — A very strong positive signal. It implies that the technical issues causing the first landing failure and the subsequent delays have been sufficiently addressed to proceed with a launch attempt, a major hurdle.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Technical Execution of Landing Sequence:** The complex, automated sequence of engine relight, guidance, grid fin/fin actuation, and landing leg deployment is the primary driver. A single failure in this chain leads to mission failure. (Size: Large)
2.  **Root Cause Analysis & Correction:** The probability of success is heavily dependent on whether Blue Origin correctly identified the cause of the first landing failure and implemented an effective fix. Their secretive nature makes this difficult to assess externally. (Size: Large)
3.  **Corporate Philosophy ("Gradatim Ferociter"):** Blue Origin's "step by step, ferociously" motto implies a cautious, methodical approach. This could increase the chance of success by ensuring thorough testing, but it also slows iteration and learning from real-world flight data compared to SpaceX's model. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Launch Cadence & Schedule Pressure:** With only ~7 weeks left in 2025 after today's scheduled launch, any significant delay (weather, technical scrub) could push the attempt into 2026, causing the question to resolve as "No" even if the eventual landing is successful. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Financial Resources:** With deep backing from Jeff Bezos, the program is not resource-constrained. They can afford top talent and extensive ground testing, which should positively influence the outcome. (Size: Small, as it's an enabling factor, not a direct cause of success on the day).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Learning from Predecessors:** Unlike SpaceX, who were pioneers, Blue Origin has over a decade of public Falcon 9 landing data and videos to learn from. This should significantly de-risk their attempt compared to the base rate derived from SpaceX's early attempts.
*   **Successful First Ascent:** The maiden flight successfully delivered its payload to orbit. This proves the fundamental rocketry of the first stage works, allowing the team to focus specifically on the landing problem. Early Falcon 9 attempts sometimes failed during ascent, preventing a landing attempt altogether.
*   **Engine Heritage:** The BE-4 engines are new to orbital flight, but the smaller BE-3 engine has a perfect flight record on suborbital New Shepard landings, giving Blue Origin extensive institutional experience with propulsive landing, albeit at a smaller scale.
*   **Lack of Iteration:** The long gap between the first and second flights (~10 months) contrasts sharply with SpaceX's early, rapid-fire attempts. This could mean a more robust fix was developed, or it could mean the team is less practiced and has less empirical data to work with.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around 20% seems appropriate, anchored to the "Second Attempt" reference class (n≈5-10), acknowledging the extreme difficulty of the task.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The first flight successfully reached orbit, proving the vehicle's core systems and allowing focused work on the landing failure.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Blue Origin can learn from SpaceX's public data, which was not available to the reference class actor (SpaceX itself).
    *   (↑ Moderate) The company has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The reported program leadership departures and launch slips in mid-2025 suggest significant internal challenges that may not be fully resolved.
    *   (↑ Large) The rocket is on the pad for an attempt today. This is the most recent and heavily weighted evidence, suggesting the team has high confidence they have solved the previous issues.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision. The combination of a successful first ascent and the readiness for a second attempt significantly mitigates the low base rate and earlier negative reports. The posterior should move substantially higher than the prior, perhaps into the 40-60% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Successful completion of the countdown with no holds.
    *   Favorable weather reports from the 45th Weather Squadron.
    *   Confirmation of FAA launch license issuance.
    *   Smooth lift-off and stage separation.
    *   Positive commentary from Blue Origin's official webcast during the flight.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any launch scrub, pushing the attempt later into the year and risking a slip to 2026.
    *   A hold in the terminal countdown for technical reasons.
    *   Anomalous data reported during the ascent phase.
    *   Loss of telemetry from the booster after stage separation.
    *   Visible issues with the booster during its descent (e.g., uncontrolled tumble).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously secretive. The true cause of the first failure and the nature of the fixes are unknown to the public, creating significant model uncertainty.
*   **Launch Day Volatility:** The question resolves "No" if the launch is delayed into 2026 for any reason, including weather or minor technical glitches. The probability of a successful landing is conditional on a launch occurring in 2025.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity of "Landing":** While the criteria seem clear, a "hard landing" where the booster remains upright but is heavily damaged could be a gray area. However, the general industry consensus typically requires the vehicle to be recoverable.
*   **Fictionalized Scenario:** The provided background and sources describe a fictional timeline. This analysis is based on treating that information as fact, but it does not reflect the real-world status of the New Glenn program.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for a second-attempt booster landing is extremely low. However, Blue Origin's partial success on its first flight and its ability to learn from SpaceX's history provide strong reasons to be more optimistic, and the fact that the rocket is on the pad today suggests the company is confident, warranting a significant upward update from the prior.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the success rate of second attempts at propulsive landings for new orbital boosters. The historical base rate for this is approximately 10-20%, based on SpaceX's early attempts with the Falcon 9. This is a low-confidence estimate due to the small sample size (n=1, SpaceX).
   - Initial prior: 15% probability of success.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are attempting sea-based landings of reusable boosters, which is a complex and challenging task.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has the advantage of learning from SpaceX's public failures and successes, potentially increasing their chances. Additionally, Blue Origin's cautious approach may lead to more thorough testing and preparation.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Successful first orbital launch: Increases probability. P(E | H) > P(E | ~H) because a successful first launch indicates a solid foundation for the vehicle's systems.
   - Learning from SpaceX: Increases probability. P(E | H) > P(E | ~H) as Blue Origin can apply lessons learned from SpaceX's experiences.
   - Leadership departures and delays: Decreases probability. P(E | H) < P(E | ~H) as these suggest potential internal issues.
   - Rocket on the pad for launch: Strongly increases probability. P(E | H) > P(E | ~H) as it indicates readiness and confidence in resolving previous issues.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 15% probability = 0.1765 odds.
   - Evidence likelihoods suggest a significant upward revision. The successful first launch and current readiness are strong positive indicators.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (qualitatively assessed as >1 due to strong positive evidence).
   - Posterior probability: Adjusting for the evidence, the probability is revised upward to approximately 50%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The probability might be overestimated due to optimism bias from recent positive developments.
   - Alternative scenario: Delays or technical issues could still arise, pushing the launch into 2026.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of unforeseen technical challenges or weather delays.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering all evidence and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is set at 45%, reflecting both the base rate and the impact of the evidence.

Final: 45%

# Probability Analysis: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate base rate for a second attempt at propulsive landing of a new orbital booster.

The most relevant reference class is SpaceX's early Falcon 9 landing attempts, as they pioneered this technology:
- SpaceX failed on their first several sea-landing attempts before succeeding
- Their success rate on the second sea-landing attempt was 0%
- It took them five dedicated sea-landing attempts to achieve success

Given this historical precedent, a reasonable base rate would be 10-20% for success on a second attempt.

However, Blue Origin has some advantages over early SpaceX:
- They can learn from SpaceX's public failures and successes
- They have experience with suborbital landings via New Shepard
- Their first New Glenn flight successfully reached orbit

These factors suggest we should adjust the base rate upward somewhat.

**Prior probability: 25%** (expressed as 1:3 odds against success)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Both involve recovering a first-stage orbital booster via propulsive landing
- Both involve sea-based landing platforms
- Both represent early attempts in a new program's landing capability

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has the benefit of SpaceX's decade of public landing data
- Blue Origin's first flight successfully reached orbit but failed landing
- Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard
- Blue Origin has a much slower iteration cycle (10 months between flights vs. SpaceX's rapid cadence)
- Blue Origin's corporate philosophy is more cautious ("Gradatim Ferociter")
- The timeline is constrained (only ~7 weeks left in 2025)

These differences generally favor Blue Origin's chances compared to SpaceX's early attempts, except for the slower iteration cycle and time constraint.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Successful first orbital flight**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful landing would almost certainly be preceded by a successful orbital insertion
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with a failed landing, orbital success was still reasonably likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 2: First landing attempt failure**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even with eventual success, early failures are common
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Continued failure is more likely after an initial failure
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Program leadership departures and launch slips to fall 2025**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Such disruptions are less likely in a program heading for success
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - More likely in a troubled program
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Rocket is on the launch pad today (Nov 9, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Being ready for launch is necessary for success
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even failed attempts typically reach the pad
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- Direction: Significantly increases probability

**Evidence 5: Limited time remaining in 2025**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Success requires launching within this window
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Delays pushing into 2026 would cause failure by definition
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.625
- Direction: Decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1:3 (25% probability), I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior odds: 1:3 = 0.33

Update with Evidence 1 (successful first orbital flight):
0.33 × 1.9 = 0.627

Update with Evidence 2 (first landing failure):
0.627 × 0.67 = 0.42

Update with Evidence 3 (leadership departures and delays):
0.42 × 0.5 = 0.21

Update with Evidence 4 (rocket on pad today):
0.21 × 2.25 = 0.4725

Update with Evidence 5 (limited time remaining):
0.4725 × 0.625 = 0.295

Posterior odds: 0.295
Posterior probability: 0.295/(1+0.295) ≈ 0.23 or 23%

However, I need to reconsider this calculation. The fact that the rocket is on the pad today (Nov 9) is extremely significant and more recent than the earlier negative signals. This suggests the team has resolved the issues that caused the earlier delays and has high confidence in their fixes.

Recalculating with more weight on the most recent evidence:
- Prior: 25%
- Successful first orbital flight: +10% (to 35%)
- First landing failure: -5% (to 30%)
- Leadership departures and delays: -5% (to 25%)
- Rocket on pad today: +20% (to 45%)
- Limited time remaining: -5% (to 40%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Overconfidence in the significance of being on the pad**: Just because the rocket is on the pad doesn't guarantee launch will occur today. Weather or technical issues could still cause delays.

2. **Underestimating Blue Origin's learning curve**: I may be too anchored to SpaceX's experience. Blue Origin might have learned more from SpaceX's public failures than I'm giving credit for.

3. **Ignoring weather risks**: November-December weather at Cape Canaveral can be unpredictable, increasing the risk of delays that push the launch into 2026.

4. **Overlooking definition of "successful landing"**: The criteria for a successful landing might be ambiguous if the booster lands but sustains damage.

5. **Neglecting the conditional nature**: The question requires both a launch before 2026 AND a successful landing. I need to account for both probabilities.

Alternative forecast: A more optimistic view might put the probability at 60%, arguing that Blue Origin's cautious approach means they wouldn't attempt the landing unless they were highly confident in success, and the rocket being on the pad indicates they've solved the previous issues.

Rebuttal: While their caution might increase confidence in eventual success, it doesn't account for the time constraint or the inherent difficulty of the task, which has historically required multiple attempts.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the dual conditions and time constraint.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" both launching before 2026 and successfully landing is approximately 38%.

This reflects:
- The historical difficulty of achieving propulsive landings on early attempts
- Blue Origin's advantages from learning from SpaceX and their own suborbital experience
- The positive signal of having the rocket on the pad today
- The significant time constraint with only 7 weeks remaining in 2025
- The conditional nature requiring both launch before 2026 AND successful landing

Final: 38%

```md

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is the success rate of a *second attempt* at a propulsive sea landing for a new orbital-class booster. The only available data point for this class is SpaceX's Falcon 9 program.

*   **Reference Class:** SpaceX's first five sea-landing attempts for the Falcon 9 booster all failed. Their success rate on the second attempt was 0%.
*   **Reasoning:** While the sample size is just one (n=1), it highlights the extreme difficulty of the task. A new company attempting this is facing a challenge that has historically required multiple failures to solve. A raw base rate of 0% is too extreme from a single data point, so a wider prior is needed. Acknowledging the difficulty, but allowing for the possibility of success, a low prior is appropriate.
*   **Initial Prior (P(H)):** I will set the prior probability at **15%**. This reflects that success on a second attempt is historically unprecedented and very unlikely, but not impossible. In odds form, this is 15:85, or approximately 1:5.7.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation with Blue Origin's New Glenn has several key differences from the base case of SpaceX's early Falcon 9 attempts.

*   **Similarities:** The core challenge is the same: propulsively landing a large, liquid-fueled first stage on a moving drone ship after its first flight failed to do so.
*   **Differences (and why they matter):**
    *   **Learning from a Predecessor:** Blue Origin has over a decade of public data, videos, and analysis of Falcon 9 landings. SpaceX was pioneering this technology from scratch. This access to a "solved" problem should significantly increase Blue Origin's chances compared to the base case.
    *   **Suborbital Experience:** Blue Origin has extensive, perfect-record experience with propulsive landings via its suborbital New Shepard program. While smaller and a different flight profile, this provides invaluable institutional knowledge in guidance, control, and engine relight sequences.
    *   **Successful First Ascent:** The first New Glenn flight successfully reached orbit, proving the rocket's fundamental systems work. This allows the team to focus exclusively on the landing problem, a luxury SpaceX did not always have in its early days.
    *   **Corporate Philosophy:** Blue Origin's cautious "Gradatim Ferociter" approach likely means they have conducted more extensive ground testing and simulation before this second attempt compared to SpaceX's rapid-iteration model. This could increase the probability of success for this specific flight.

These differences are substantial and all point towards Blue Origin having a significantly higher chance of success than the base rate would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to update the prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Structural Advantages (Learning from SpaceX, New Shepard experience, successful first ascent).**
    *   This evidence package strongly differentiates Blue Origin from the base case.
    *   P(E | H): Very high. If Blue Origin succeeds, it is almost certain that these advantages played a crucial role.
    *   P(E | ~H): Lower. It's possible to fail despite these advantages, but the advantages make failure less likely than it would be otherwise.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability from the 15% prior.

*   **Evidence 2: Mid-2025 Program Turmoil (Leadership departures, slips).**
    *   This is a negative indicator, suggesting underlying technical or managerial problems.
    *   P(E | H): Low. A smooth program is more likely to lead to success.
    *   P(E | ~H): Higher. Program turmoil is a common symptom of deep-seated issues that can lead to failure.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The rocket is on the launch pad for a Nov 9, 2025 attempt.**
    *   This is the most recent and heavily weighted piece of evidence. It has two implications:
        1.  **Confidence Signal:** A cautious company like Blue Origin would not proceed to a launch attempt unless they had high internal confidence that the issues from the first flight and the mid-year turmoil were resolved. This is a strong positive signal that largely negates the negative signal from the turmoil.
        2.  **Timeline Risk:** The launch is scheduled with only ~7.5 weeks left in 2025. This introduces a risk that even if the landing would be successful, a series of technical or weather-related scrubs could push the launch into 2026, causing the question to resolve as "No".

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's walk through the updates conceptually.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 15%.
2.  **Apply Structural Advantages:** The ability to learn from SpaceX and the company's own suborbital experience are massive advantages. This is not a small nudge; it's a fundamental change from the reference class. This evidence alone likely more than doubles the odds, pushing the probability to the **30-35%** range.
3.  **Apply Recent Events:** The mid-year turmoil was a negative sign, but the very strong positive signal of being "on the pad" indicates high internal confidence and suggests those problems are solved. The net effect of these recent events is positive. An update from ~35% to ~40% for the probability of the landing *itself* being successful seems warranted. Let's set P(Successful Landing | Launch occurs) = **40%**.
4.  **Factor in Timeline Risk:** The question requires the launch and landing to occur *before 2026*. With a Nov 9 launch date, there is a real chance of delays. The probability of a major issue or a series of minor scrubs pushing the attempt past Dec 31 is non-trivial. I estimate a 15% chance of this happening. Therefore, the probability of the launch occurring in 2025 is P(Launch in 2025) = **85%**.
5.  **Final Calculation:** The final probability is the product of the conditional probability of success and the probability of the event happening in the correct timeframe.
    *   Posterior P(H) = P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025) × P(Launch in 2025)
    *   Posterior P(H) = 40% × 85% = **34%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence:** Am I overweighting the "on the pad" signal? A company's confidence is not a guarantee of success; the history of engineering is filled with confident failures. This is why the probability remains well below 50%.
*   **Unknown Unknowns:** The first landing failed for one reason. This second attempt could fail for a completely different reason, as was common in SpaceX's early attempts. The 60% chance of landing failure (100% - 40%) accounts for this significant risk.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Higher):** One could argue that a cautious, well-funded company with access to a decade of competitor data should have a >50% chance of success. A forecast of 50% would imply P(Landing Success) of ~59% * P(Launch in 2025) of 85%. This seems too high for a second-ever attempt at such a difficult task.
*   **Alternative Forecast (Lower):** One could argue the base rate is dominant and the task is just too hard. A forecast of 20% would heavily discount the learning effects and internal confidence signals. This seems too low, as it ignores the very real advantages Blue Origin possesses.
*   **Conclusion:** The 34% forecast strikes a balance, acknowledging Blue Origin's significant advantages over the historical base case while still respecting the immense, demonstrated difficulty of the task and the inherent risks of a test flight program.

### 6. Final Forecast

My final probability is derived by starting with a low base rate (15%) due to the extreme difficulty of the task, updating significantly upwards based on Blue Origin's major advantages over the reference class (learning from SpaceX, suborbital experience), and then applying a final discount for the non-trivial risk that the launch slips into 2026.

Final: 34%
