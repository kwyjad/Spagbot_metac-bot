### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested Bids for UN Conference Hosting:** Major UN conferences occasionally have contested bids. In most cases, one candidate withdraws before a formal, divisive vote, often in exchange for support for a future bid or another position. However, the COP hosting process relies on consensus within the regional group, not a vote. A single nation can block a decision.
    *   *Base Rate:* In a typical contested bid scenario (non-consensus), the candidate with broader, more public support (like Australia) wins >80% of the time. The consensus rule fundamentally alters this.
2.  **WEOG Host Selection for COPs:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is diverse, including Western Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Turkey. Selections are usually arranged quietly behind the scenes. A public, persistent deadlock is highly unusual.
    *   *Base Rate:* A consensus candidate is agreed upon in >95% of cases without public deadlock. The default to Bonn due to a political impasse within WEOG is believed to be unprecedented, making its base rate extremely low (<1%).
3.  **Resolution of Diplomatic Deadlocks:** When a consensus-based decision is deadlocked by one or two parties, the outcome often depends on whether the holdout's objective is the prize itself or leverage for an unrelated issue. If it's for leverage, a concession in another domain can break the deadlock. If it's for the prize, the deadlock persists until one side concedes or a deadline forces a default.
    *   *Base Rate:* These deadlocks are often resolved through compromise (~60%), one party withdrawing (~30%), or failure/default (~10%).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-11-07]** A coalition of Australian industry and finance groups voices strong support for the bid. **(↑ Australia)** — Demonstrates strong domestic, non-governmental momentum and perceived economic benefits, strengthening the bid's credibility.
*   **[2025-11-04]** Questions raised in media about Australian PM's potential absence from COP30. **(↓ Australia)** — A perceived lack of top-level commitment could weaken diplomatic efforts needed to break the deadlock.
*   **[2025-09-26]** Australian Government releases its comprehensive Net Zero Plan. **(↑ Australia)** — Bolsters Australia's climate credentials, addressing a key potential criticism and strengthening its case within WEOG.
*   **[2025-09-08]** Australian government re-affirms its commitment to the bid, highlighting the Pacific partnership. **(↑ Australia)** — Signals continued high-level political will and reinforces the bid's unique and compelling narrative.
*   **[2024-11-26]** Report confirms the decision was deferred due to a deadlock created by Turkey's competing bid. **(↓ Australia, ↑ Turkey/Germany)** — The most significant recent event. It confirms that Australia's broad support is insufficient and Turkey's veto is effective, elevating the chances of both a Turkish win or a default.
*   **[2024-10-02]** Op-ed from Carbon Market Institute highlights the opportunity for Australia. **(↑ Australia)** — Indicates sustained support from key civil society and industry actors, adding to the domestic pressure to succeed.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** (Large) The single most important driver. It grants Turkey an absolute veto over Australia's bid, transforming the contest from a popularity contest into a bilateral negotiation. Turkey's single objection is as powerful as the support of the other 27 members.
2.  **Geopolitical Bargaining:** (Moderate-Large) Turkey may be using the COP31 bid as a bargaining chip for leverage on unrelated issues with key WEOG members (e.g., the EU or US), such as trade, security, or human rights criticism. The outcome may be decided by factors entirely external to climate policy.
3.  **Diplomatic Pressure to Avoid Failure:** (Moderate) A default to Bonn would be a significant embarrassment for WEOG, signaling disunity and dysfunction. This creates pressure on *both* Australia and Turkey from other members (especially major EU states) to find a compromise.
4.  **Narrative and Reputational Strength:** (Moderate) The Australia-Pacific partnership has a powerful, climate-justice-oriented narrative. This garners significant goodwill and makes it diplomatically costly for Turkey to be seen as the sole spoiler of a Pacific-focused COP.
5.  **Domestic Political Will:** (Small-Moderate) The commitment of the Australian and Turkish governments to expend political and diplomatic capital is crucial. A change in government or shifting domestic priorities in either country could lead to a withdrawal.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Absolute Veto Power:** Unlike most international votes, the consensus rule gives the minority bidder (Turkey) equal power to the majority-supported bidder (Australia). This invalidates base rates based on majority support.
*   **Credible Default Option:** The existence of Bonn as an automatic default host is a key feature. It's not a "do-over" but a specific failure outcome, which focuses diplomatic pressure on the deadline.
*   **Atypical WEOG Division:** WEOG typically presents a united front. A public and prolonged deadlock between two members, particularly on an issue of global prestige, is a significant departure from the norm.
*   **Co-Host Narrative:** The Australia-Pacific co-hosting model is a relatively novel and compelling approach for a developed nation, framing the bid around climate justice and amplifying the voices of vulnerable states. This adds a unique moral and diplomatic weight.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, based on the reference class of contested bids but accounting for the consensus rule, might be P(Australia)=0.60, P(Turkey)=0.30, P(Germany/Other)=0.10, with a low "equivalent n" of 5, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↓ Large)** The confirmed deadlock and deferral of the decision is the strongest piece of evidence. It proves Turkey's veto is real and they are willing to use it, significantly reducing Australia's probability and increasing Turkey's and Germany's.
    *   **(↑ Moderate)** Australia's sustained domestic support and new climate plan strengthen its position for a negotiated outcome, providing it with credible talking points and demonstrating commitment.
    *   **(↔ Small)** The diplomatic pressure to avoid the embarrassment of a Bonn default likely pushes both sides toward a deal, but it's unclear which side it benefits more. It may slightly lower the probability of the Germany outcome relative to a negotiated settlement.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of a persistent, effective veto by Turkey should significantly lower the probability for Australia from the initial prior. The posterior should move towards a near-even split between Australia and Turkey, with a slightly elevated (but still low) probability for Germany. The update is a large shift away from "Australia is the clear favorite."

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia winning):**
    *   High-level diplomatic meetings announced between Australian and Turkish foreign ministers.
    *   Statements of support for the Australian bid from major WEOG players not yet on the record (e.g., a direct US endorsement).
    *   Rumors or reports of Turkey being offered support for a future bid (e.g., COP33 or another UN event).
    *   Turkey withdraws its bid.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia winning):**
    *   Public statements from Turkey re-affirming its "unwavering" commitment to its own bid.
    *   Reports of other WEOG members expressing frustration with the deadlock and calling for a "neutral" solution (i.e., Bonn).
    *   Any wavering of support from Pacific Island nations for the Australian bid.
    *   The decision is deferred again beyond the next informal deadline (e.g., mid-2026).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Negotiations:** The final decision will be made in closed-door WEOG meetings. Public statements may be posturing, and the true state of negotiations is unknown.
*   **Concession Packages:** The deadlock could be broken by

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the historical context of contested bids and the strong domestic and regional support for Australia's bid, a reasonable base rate might be around 60%. This reflects Australia's broad support within WEOG and the compelling narrative of co-hosting with Pacific nations.
  
- **Turkey**: Turkey's bid is significant due to its veto power and the geopolitical leverage it might seek. A base rate of 30% is reasonable, acknowledging Turkey's ability to block consensus and its strategic interests.

- **Germany (Bonn)**: The default option of Bonn hosting due to a deadlock is unprecedented but possible. A base rate of 10% reflects the low likelihood but non-zero possibility of a deadlock.

- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is unlikely given the current bids and the structure of the WEOG hosting rotation. A base rate of 0% is appropriate.

- **Other**: Similarly, other countries outside the current bids or WEOG are unlikely to host. A base rate of 0% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The situation is similar to the base case due to Australia's strong support and narrative. However, the deadlock with Turkey is a significant deviation, reducing the likelihood compared to the base rate.

- **Turkey**: The base case assumes Turkey's bid is primarily for leverage, not hosting. The deadlock suggests Turkey is serious about its bid, increasing its likelihood.

- **Germany**: The unprecedented nature of a default to Bonn makes it less likely than the base rate suggests, but the deadlock increases its plausibility.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**:
  - Strong domestic support and climate plan (↑ Moderate): Increases likelihood.
  - Deadlock due to Turkey's bid (↓ Large): Decreases likelihood significantly.
  - Lack of PM's presence at COP30 (↓ Small): Slightly decreases likelihood.

- **Turkey**:
  - Effective veto and deadlock (↑ Large): Increases likelihood significantly.
  - Potential for geopolitical bargaining (↑ Moderate): Increases likelihood.

- **Germany**:
  - Deadlock and potential default (↑ Moderate): Increases likelihood.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Starting with a prior of 60%, the deadlock significantly reduces this. The posterior might be around 40% after considering the deadlock and other evidence.

- **Turkey**: Starting with a prior of 30%, the deadlock and Turkey's strategic position increase this to around 40%.

- **Germany**: Starting with a prior of 10%, the deadlock increases this to around 20%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: The deadlock suggests high uncertainty. The probabilities for Australia and Turkey should be closer, reflecting this uncertainty.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: Consider the possibility of a breakthrough in negotiations or a geopolitical deal that changes the dynamics.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the updated likelihoods.

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 40%  
Turkey: 40%  
Germany: 20%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 0%  
Other: 0%  

This distribution reflects the current deadlock and the potential for either Australia or Turkey to host, with a non-negligible chance of defaulting to Bonn.

# Analysis: Which country will host COP 31 in 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option based on the WEOG hosting rotation and the specific circumstances:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia has a formal bid with significant backing from other WEOG members and Pacific partners
- The co-hosting model with Pacific nations creates a compelling narrative around climate justice
- Australia has demonstrated commitment through funding, feasibility studies, and a comprehensive Net Zero Plan

**Turkey**: 35% 
- Rationale: Turkey has an official bid and has created a deadlock by not withdrawing
- The consensus rule gives Turkey effective veto power over Australia's bid
- Turkey's persistence suggests they are serious about hosting or using the bid as leverage

**Germany**: 15%
- Rationale: Bonn is the default host city if consensus cannot be reached
- The UNFCCC secretariat is headquartered there, making it a logical fallback
- Historical precedent suggests deadlocks are rarely allowed to reach the default option (~10%), but this situation appears unusually contentious

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 3%
- Rationale: While Pacific nations are part of Australia's bid as co-hosts, they are not in the WEOG regional group
- The rotation system makes it highly unlikely for a non-WEOG country to be the primary host
- However, a compromise could potentially elevate a Pacific partner's role

**Other**: 2%
- Rationale: This covers other WEOG members stepping in as compromise candidates
- Also includes the small possibility of a change to the rotation system or other unforeseen outcomes

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to typical WEOG hosting decisions:**
- The rotation system is functioning as expected with WEOG's turn to host
- Multiple countries within the group have expressed interest
- There is a formal process for selection with a deadline (before COP 30)

**Key differences:**
- The public, persistent deadlock between Australia and Turkey is unusual for WEOG
- The consensus rule creates a situation where Turkey's single objection carries as much weight as Australia's broader support
- Australia's co-hosting model with Pacific nations introduces a novel element
- The confirmed deferral of the decision indicates an unusually contentious process

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence: Confirmed deadlock and deferral (2024-11-26)**
- P(E|Australia wins): Moderate (~40%) - This indicates Australia hasn't secured consensus despite broad support
- P(E|Turkey wins): High (~70%) - Shows Turkey's veto is effective and they're willing to use it
- P(E|Germany hosts): High (~70%) - Increases likelihood of default option if deadlock persists
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors Turkey and Germany over Australia

**Evidence: Australia's comprehensive Net Zero Plan (2025-09-26)**
- P(E|Australia wins): High (~80%) - Strengthens Australia's climate credentials
- P(E|Turkey wins): Moderate (~50%) - Makes Turkey's opposition look more obstructionist
- P(E|Germany hosts): Low (~30%) - Reduces justification for defaulting to Bonn
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors Australia

**Evidence: Australian PM's potential absence from COP30 (2025-11-04)**
- P(E|Australia wins): Moderate (~50%) - Suggests possible wavering commitment
- P(E|Turkey wins): Moderate-High (~60%) - Could be interpreted as Australia losing interest
- P(E|Germany hosts): Moderate (~50%) - Neutral impact
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors Turkey

**Evidence: Strong domestic support from Australian industry (2025-11-07)**
- P(E|Australia wins): High (~70%) - Demonstrates economic backing and commitment
- P(E|Turkey wins): Moderate (~50%) - Limited impact on international negotiations
- P(E|Germany hosts): Moderate (~50%) - Limited impact on breaking deadlock
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors Australia

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's perform an explicit update based on the most significant evidence: the confirmed deadlock and deferral.

**Prior odds:**
- Australia: 45/55 = 0.82
- Turkey: 35/65 = 0.54
- Germany: 15/85 = 0.18

**Likelihood ratios (approximate):**
- Australia: 0.4/0.6 = 0.67 (evidence less likely if Australia wins)
- Turkey: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33 (evidence more likely if Turkey wins)
- Germany: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33 (evidence more likely if Germany hosts)

**Posterior odds:**
- Australia: 0.82 × 0.67 = 0.55
- Turkey: 0.54 × 2.33 = 1.26
- Germany: 0.18 × 2.33 = 0.42

**Converting to probabilities:**
- Australia: 0.55/(1+0.55) = 35.5%
- Turkey: 1.26/(1+1.26) = 55.8%
- Germany: 0.42/(1+0.42) = 29.6%

These need normalization, but the direction is clear: Australia's chances decrease while Turkey's and Germany's increase.

Incorporating the other evidence qualitatively:
- Australia's climate plan and domestic support partially recover its position
- The PM's potential absence slightly weakens Australia's position
- The diplomatic pressure to avoid a default to Bonn likely reduces Germany's probability

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the importance of public information versus private diplomatic negotiations
- The consensus rule might be more flexible in practice than in theory
- Turkey's motivations remain unclear - they could be using this as leverage for unrelated concessions
- I might be underestimating the likelihood of a compromise candidate emerging

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A joint hosting arrangement between Australia and Turkey could emerge as a compromise
- A major geopolitical event could shift priorities and lead to unexpected withdrawals
- The WEOG could modify its consensus rule under pressure to avoid embarrassment

**Best alternative forecast:**
- Turkey has a much stronger position than I initially assessed due to the consensus rule
- The deadlock evidence suggests Turkey is not backing down, which should significantly increase its probability
- A plausible alternative would be Turkey: 50%, Australia: 30%, Germany: 15%, Other: 5%

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I'll adjust and normalize my probabilities:

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 42% 
Germany: 15%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 2%

## 7. Output Format

Australia: 38%
Turkey: 42%
Germany: 15%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 3%
Other: 2%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider the general case of a contested bid for a major international event where the decision is made by consensus within a group, and there are two main contenders plus a default option.

*   **Option A (Stronger Bid - Australia):** In most situations, the bid with broader public support, a more compelling narrative (the Pacific partnership), and backing from more group members would be the clear favorite. Let's set a prior of **P(Australia) = 60%**.
*   **Option B (Challenger with Veto - Turkey):** The challenger's primary strength is not its own support but its ability to block the favorite. This gives it significant leverage, far more than in a simple majority vote. I'll assign a prior of **P(Turkey) = 30%**.
*   **Option C (Default/Failure - Germany):** A consensus-based group like WEOG failing to reach a decision is rare and seen as an institutional embarrassment. The base rate for this is very low. I'll set a prior of **P(Germany) = 9%**.
*   **Other Options:** The emergence of a completely new bid (Another Pacific Island Nation alone, or another WEOG country) is highly unlikely at this stage. I'll assign **P(Another Pacific Island Nation) = 0.5%** and **P(Other) = 0.5%**.

This prior (Australia 60%, Turkey 30%, Germany 9%, Others 1%) reflects a world where Australia is the favorite but faces a serious challenge with a non-trivial risk of complete deadlock.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process involves standard diplomatic negotiations, where countries trade support and leverage geopolitical influence.
*   **Differences:** The key difference from a typical vote is the **consensus rule**. This rule elevates Turkey from a minor challenger to an equal negotiating partner with Australia, as its single objection can derail the entire process. The existence of a specific, automatic default host (Bonn, Germany) is also a crucial feature, as it creates a clear failure state and a deadline for the negotiators. The public nature of this WEOG deadlock is also unusual, suggesting positions are more entrenched than normal.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence:** The decision was deferred due to a confirmed deadlock created by Turkey's competing bid [2024-11-26].
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is the single most important piece of information. A confirmed, persistent deadlock is much more likely if the outcome is uncertain (i.e., if Turkey or Germany will win) than if Australia was on a clear path to victory. P(Deadlock | Australia wins) is low, while P(Deadlock | Turkey wins) and P(Deadlock | Germany wins) are high. This evidence has a **strong negative likelihood ratio for Australia** and a **strong positive likelihood ratio for both Turkey and Germany**.

*   **Evidence:** Australia's sustained domestic support, new Net Zero Plan, and re-affirmation of the bid.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This shows Australia is committed and strengthening its negotiating position. It is highly likely we would see this evidence if Australia were to eventually win. It is less likely (though still possible as a negotiating tactic) if they were planning to concede. This evidence has a **moderate positive likelihood ratio for Australia**.

*   **Evidence:** Questions about the Australian PM's potential absence from COP30.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is weak evidence. While it could signal wavering commitment, it could also be due to unrelated scheduling conflicts. It has a **very weak negative likelihood ratio for Australia**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will start with the prior odds and update them with the most significant evidence: the confirmed deadlock.

*   **Prior Odds (Australia vs. The Field):** P(Aus) / P(~Aus) = 60 / 40 = 1.5.
*   **Likelihood Ratio of Deadlock:** The deadlock makes it significantly less likely that Australia is the prohibitive favorite. I'll estimate that this evidence is about 3 times more likely if Australia does *not* win than if it does. Likelihood Ratio (for ~Aus) = P(Deadlock | ~Aus) / P(Deadlock | Aus) ≈ 3.0.
*   **Posterior Odds (Australia):** Prior Odds × (1 / Likelihood Ratio) = 1.5 × (1/3) = 0.5.
*   **New P(Australia):** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 0.5 / 1.5 = **~33%**.

This is a massive drop from 60%, which is appropriate given how the deadlock fundamentally changes the nature of the contest. The ~27% probability lost by Australia must be redistributed to the other options, primarily Turkey and Germany, as the deadlock is the pathway to their success.

*   **Redistribution:** The deadlock makes a Turkish victory or a German default much more plausible. I will reapportion the probability based on this new reality. The contest is now a tense negotiation. Australia still has the advantage of broader support and a stronger narrative, but Turkey has the hard power of the veto. This suggests a close race. I'll set the new probabilities as:
    *   **Australia: 45%** (Still the slight favorite due to soft power and broader support)
    *   **Turkey: 38%** (A very close second, reflecting the power of the veto)
    *   **Germany: 15%** (The chance of failure is now significant and credible)
*   The other, weaker evidence (Australia's domestic support vs. PM's travel) largely cancels out, providing small nudges but not fundamentally altering this post-deadlock distribution.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast hinges on the idea that Australia's diplomatic weight and stronger narrative give it a slight edge in the negotiation to break the deadlock. A key vulnerability in this forecast is underestimating Turkey's resolve or its geopolitical leverage on other WEOG members (especially in the EU). Turkey may be using the COP bid as a bargaining chip for a much larger issue, and European nations might pressure Australia to concede to appease Turkey. This alternative scenario would make Turkey the favorite. To account for this, I have kept the probabilities for Australia and Turkey very close (a 7-point gap). I have also assigned a substantial 15% to Germany, as a complete failure to compromise is a very real outcome when two nations' prestige is on the line and their positions are public.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed as follows:

*   **Australia:** 45%
*   **Turkey:** 38%
*   **Germany:** 15%
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** 1% (Covers the tail risk of the bid being restructured as "Pacific-led")
*   **Other:** 1% (Covers the tail risk of a new compromise candidate emerging)

The sum is 45 + 38 + 15 + 1 + 1 = 100%. The distribution reflects that this is now a very close contest between the two bidders, with a significant chance of institutional failure.

Australia: 45%
Turkey: 38%
Germany: 15%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 1%
