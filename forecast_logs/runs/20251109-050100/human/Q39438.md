### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Foreign Affairs/National Security Powers:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases like *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936) and *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), the Court upheld broad executive actions. A base rate derived from this class would suggest a high probability (perhaps 70-80%) of the President's actions being deemed lawful. However, this class is broad and may not capture the specific legal questions at issue.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Questions of Statutory Interpretation:** In recent years, the Court has increasingly invoked the "major questions doctrine," which holds that Congress must speak clearly if it wishes to delegate decisions of vast "economic and political significance" to the executive branch. In cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), the executive branch's broad interpretation of its authority was rejected. This reference class suggests a higher probability (perhaps 60-70%) of the President's actions being ruled unlawful, as imposing sweeping tariffs is arguably a major question of economic policy.
3.  **Supreme Court Affirmance Rate After Unanimous Lower Court Losses for the Government:** The government lost in the Court of International Trade, the D.C. District Court, and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. When the government loses in a circuit court, and particularly when lower courts are in agreement, the Supreme Court's decision to grant review is often to reverse. However, the strong consensus below, combined with the expedited review, suggests the Court may be acting to definitively settle a clear legal error. A rough base rate for affirmance in such situations might be around 60-70% (i.e., the tariffs are ruled unlawful).

**Synthesis:** The tension between Class 1 (deference) and Classes 2 & 3 (skepticism of executive overreach) is the core of the forecast. Given the current Court's composition and jurisprudential trends, Classes 2 and 3 appear more relevant. A blended base rate would favor "Tariffs unlawful" at roughly 65%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held at the Supreme Court. Reports indicate justices across the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism about the administration's broad interpretation of IEEPA. ↓ (decreases probability of "Tariffs lawful"). This is the most significant recent event, providing direct insight into the justices' thinking and suggesting a majority is inclined to rule against the government.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court agrees to consolidate and review both cases on an expedited schedule. ↑ (increases probability of a 2025 ruling, decreasing "No 2025 ruling"). This signals the Court views the issue as urgent and of national importance, making a merits decision before year-end more likely.
*   **2025-08-29** The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the lower court ruling in *V.O.S. Selections*, finding the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority. ↓ (decreases probability of "Tariffs lawful"). This created a strong appellate-level precedent against the government's position, reinforcing the legal consensus against the tariffs.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's conservative majority has consistently used this doctrine to rein in executive authority. The imposition of trillions of dollars in tariffs based on a broad interpretation of a 1977 statute is a textbook candidate for this doctrine's application. (Large driver toward "Tariffs unlawful").
2.  **Textualism:** A textualist reading of IEEPA focuses on the President's power to "regulate" international transactions. Challengers argue this does not include the power to "tax" (i.e., impose tariffs), a power the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress. This argument is likely to be persuasive to several justices. (Large driver toward "Tariffs unlawful").
3.  **Foreign Affairs Deference:** The government's strongest argument rests on historical precedent of judicial deference to the President on matters of national security and foreign commerce. Some justices may be wary of constraining the executive's tools to respond to perceived emergencies. (Moderate driver toward "Tariffs lawful").
4.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court could differentiate between the "trafficking tariffs" and the "reciprocal tariffs." The former are tied to a more traditional national security threat (drug cartels), while the latter are based on a novel "trade deficit emergency." This could lead the Court to strike down the reciprocal tariffs but uphold the trafficking ones. (Moderate driver toward "Mixed ruling").
5.  **Lower Court Consensus:** The fact that three separate federal courts (CIT, DDC, Fed. Cir.) have ruled against the government creates judicial momentum. While the Supreme Court is not bound by these rulings, a strong and reasoned consensus is influential. (Moderate driver toward "Tariffs unlawful").
6.  **Expedited Schedule:** The decision to hear and decide the case quickly increases the likelihood of a definitive ruling in 2025, making "No 2025 ruling" less probable. It also suggests the Court sees a clear and urgent legal issue to resolve, which often correlates with reversing or striking down the contested action. (Small driver away from "No 2025 ruling").

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Novel Application of IEEPA:** Unlike past IEEPA cases (e.g., *Dames & Moore*), which involved sanctions like asset freezes in response to specific foreign crises, this case involves using the act to set broad, economy-wide tariff policy, a function traditionally reserved for Congress.
*   **The Nature of the "Emergency":** The declaration of a national emergency based on a "trade deficit" is legally and economically novel and far more abstract than emergencies like hostage crises or terrorist threats that have underpinned past IEEPA uses. This makes the government's justification appear weaker.
*   **Current Court's Jurisprudence:** The Roberts Court, particularly its 6-3 conservative majority, is significantly more skeptical of broad delegations of authority and executive overreach than the Burger Court that decided *Dames & Moore*. The major questions doctrine was not a prominent tool then as it is now.
*   **Separation of Powers Focus:** The legal challenge is not just about foreign policy but cuts to the core of the separation of powers, specifically Congress's constitutional power of the purse and to regulate commerce. This framing makes simple deference less likely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on "Tariffs unlawful" at ~65% seems reasonable, reflecting the tension between foreign policy deference and the modern Court's skepticism of executive power, with an equivalent n of ~10.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Oral argument reports of "cross-ideological skepticism": ↑ P(Unlawful) (Large). This is the strongest piece of new evidence.
    *   Consensus of three lower courts against the government: ↑ P(Unlawful) (Moderate).
    *   Clear applicability of the Major Questions Doctrine: ↑ P(Unlawful) (Large).
    *   Plausibility of distinguishing between tariff types: ↑ P(Mixed ruling) (Small).
    *   Expedited review schedule: ↓ P(No 2025 ruling) (Moderate).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior for "Tariffs unlawful" should move significantly upward, likely into the 80-90% range. The probability for "Mixed ruling" remains a small but non-trivial possibility, while "Tariffs lawful" becomes highly improbable.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling"):**
    *   Leaks from the Court (rare but possible) indicating a majority opinion is being drafted by a conservative justice known for skepticism of executive power (e.g., Gorsuch, Thomas, Roberts).
    *   Op-eds or articles from conservative legal commentators (e.g., in the Wall Street Journal or National Review) arguing against the tariffs on separation-of-powers grounds.
    *   Administration officials beginning to publicly discuss "Plan B" trade policies, suggesting they anticipate a loss.
*   **DOWN indicators (against "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling"):**
    *   Leaks suggesting the justices are deeply divided or struggling to form a majority, potentially pointing to a plurality or procedural "Other ruling."
    *   Unusual delays in the Court's opinion releases in December, which could push the decision into 2026 ("No 2025 ruling").
    *   The administration announcing a withdrawal or significant modification of the tariffs, which could be an attempt to make the case moot ("Other ruling").

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Oral arguments are not dispositive:** While strong indicators, justices' questions can be devil's advocacy, and their final votes can differ from their apparent stance during arguments.
*   **The "Mixed ruling" possibility:** The forecast aggregates two distinct tariff policies. The Court could easily sever them, upholding the more narrowly tailored trafficking tariffs while striking down the broad reciprocal ones. This would resolve as "Mixed ruling" and is the most likely alternative to a complete "unlawful" decision.
*   **Procedural Off-Ramps:** The Court could still devise a procedural exit, such as dismissing the writ as improvidently granted or issuing a GVR (grant, vacate, remand) on narrow grounds, which would resolve as "Other ruling." This is unlikely given the expedited review but not impossible.
*   **Tight Timeline:** The resolution deadline is December 31, 2025. While an expedited schedule makes a 2025 decision likely, any delay could push the ruling into January 2026, triggering a "No 2025 ruling" resolution.
*   **Definition of "Merits Holding":** The resolution criteria for "Other

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to the given options:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful:** Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential powers in foreign affairs and national security, suggesting a base rate of around 20-30% for this option.
- **Tariffs unlawful:** Given the recent trend of the Court invoking the major questions doctrine and the unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs, a base rate of around 50-60% seems appropriate.
- **Mixed ruling:** The possibility of the Court distinguishing between different types of tariffs suggests a base rate of around 10-15%.
- **Other ruling:** Procedural outcomes are less common but possible, suggesting a base rate of around 5-10%.
- **No 2025 ruling:** Given the expedited schedule, this is unlikely, suggesting a base rate of around 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves presidential powers in foreign affairs, similar to past cases where the Court has shown deference.
- **Differences:** The novel application of IEEPA for economic policy and the strong lower court consensus against the tariffs are significant departures from typical cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Oral arguments:** Reports of skepticism across ideological lines decrease the likelihood of "Tariffs lawful" and increase "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Lower court consensus:** Reinforces the likelihood of "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Major Questions Doctrine:** Strongly supports "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Expedited review:** Decreases the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs unlawful:** Prior odds of 60% increase significantly due to strong evidence from oral arguments and lower court rulings. Posterior probability likely in the 80-90% range.
- **Tariffs lawful:** Prior odds of 20-30% decrease due to skepticism in oral arguments and lower court consensus. Posterior probability likely in the 5-10% range.
- **Mixed ruling:** Prior odds of 10-15% slightly increase due to the possibility of distinguishing between tariff types. Posterior probability around 10-15%.
- **Other ruling:** Prior odds of 5-10% remain stable, as no strong evidence suggests this outcome.
- **No 2025 ruling:** Prior odds of 5% decrease due to expedited schedule. Posterior probability around 1-2%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence:** The strong evidence for "Tariffs unlawful" could lead to overconfidence. Consider the possibility of a mixed ruling or procedural outcome.
- **Alternative scenarios:** A mixed ruling is plausible if the Court distinguishes between tariff types.
- **Adjustments:** Slightly increase the probability for "Mixed ruling" to account for this possibility.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure the probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- **Tariffs unlawful:** 85%
- **Tariffs lawful:** 5%
- **Mixed ruling:** 8%
- **Other ruling:** 2%
- **No 2025 ruling:** 0%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 85%  
Mixed ruling: 8%  
Other ruling: 2%  
No 2025 ruling: 0%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant reference classes:

**For "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Supreme Court rulings on executive overreach in statutory interpretation: In cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), the Court has increasingly limited executive authority through the major questions doctrine. When the executive branch makes sweeping policy decisions of vast economic significance without clear congressional authorization, the Court has ruled against the executive ~70% of the time.
- Cases with unanimous lower court rulings against the government: When multiple lower courts (here, CIT, DC District, and Federal Circuit) rule consistently against the government, the Supreme Court affirms these rulings ~65% of the time.

**For "Tariffs lawful":**
- Presidential foreign affairs/national security powers: Historically, the Court has granted significant deference to the President in foreign affairs and national security, upholding executive actions in cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981) ~70% of the time.

**For "Mixed ruling":**
- Complex cases with multiple distinct legal issues: When cases involve separable legal questions (here, trafficking tariffs vs. reciprocal tariffs), the Court issues split decisions ~15-20% of the time.

**For "Other ruling":**
- Procedural off-ramps: The Court avoids merits decisions through procedural rulings in ~5-10% of cases.

**For "No 2025 ruling":**
- Given the expedited schedule with arguments in November 2025, the probability of no ruling by December 31, 2025 is very low, ~3-5%.

**Synthesized prior probabilities:**
- Tariffs unlawful: 65%
- Tariffs lawful: 15% 
- Mixed ruling: 15%
- Other ruling: 3%
- No 2025 ruling: 2%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other major questions cases, this involves an executive branch interpretation of statutory authority with enormous economic consequences.
- Like other foreign affairs cases, it involves presidential actions justified by national security concerns.
- The expedited review schedule is typical for cases of urgent national importance.

**Key differences:**
- The novel application of IEEPA to impose broad tariffs rather than targeted sanctions represents a significant expansion beyond historical precedent.
- The "trade deficit emergency" justification is particularly attenuated compared to traditional national security emergencies.
- The current Court's composition (6-3 conservative majority) is more skeptical of executive power than courts that decided earlier foreign affairs cases.
- The unanimous lower court rulings against the government create unusually strong judicial momentum.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Oral arguments with cross-ideological skepticism**
- P(Skeptical questioning | Tariffs unlawful) = ~90% (Very likely)
- P(Skeptical questioning | Tariffs lawful) = ~20% (Unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 2: Unanimous lower court rulings against the government**
- P(Unanimous lower courts | Tariffs unlawful) = ~80% (Likely)
- P(Unanimous lower courts | Tariffs lawful) = ~15% (Unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~5.3:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 3: Applicability of Major Questions Doctrine**
- P(MQD applies | Tariffs unlawful) = ~85% (Very likely)
- P(MQD applies | Tariffs lawful) = ~30% (Somewhat unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.8:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 4: Distinction between tariff types**
- P(Distinct tariff types | Mixed ruling) = ~90% (Very likely)
- P(Distinct tariff types | Uniform ruling) = ~40% (Somewhat unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25:1 favoring "Mixed ruling" over uniform rulings

**Evidence 5: Expedited review schedule**
- P(Expedited schedule | 2025 ruling) = ~95% (Very likely)
- P(Expedited schedule | No 2025 ruling) = ~20% (Unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75:1 favoring a 2025 ruling

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the strongest piece of evidence first: the oral argument reports showing cross-ideological skepticism.

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 65%
- Prior odds: 65/35 ≈ 1.86:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4.5:1
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 4.5 ≈ 8.37:1
- Posterior probability: 8.37/(1+8.37) ≈ 89.3%

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 15%
- The skeptical questioning significantly reduces this probability.
- Adjusting based on the likelihood ratio and considering the other evidence, this drops to approximately 5%.

For "Mixed ruling":
- Prior probability: 15%
- The distinction between tariff types provides some support for this outcome.
- However, the overall skepticism suggests even the trafficking tariffs face significant legal challenges.
- Adjusting based on the evidence, this remains around 4%.

For "Other ruling":
- Prior probability: 3%
- No strong evidence has emerged suggesting procedural off-ramps.
- This remains at approximately 1%.

For "No 2025 ruling":
- Prior probability: 2%
- The expedited schedule makes this highly unlikely.
- This drops to approximately 0.7%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of oral arguments. Justices sometimes play devil's advocate or ask tough questions of the side they ultimately support.
- The Court might be more concerned about limiting executive power in foreign affairs than I've accounted for, especially given the economic magnitude of these tariffs.
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a narrow, technical ruling that avoids the broader constitutional questions.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would give more weight to "Mixed ruling" (perhaps 15-20%) by reasoning that the Court might distinguish between the trafficking tariffs (more plausibly tied to national security) and the reciprocal tariffs (more clearly economic policy). This would reduce "Tariffs unlawful" to around 75-80%.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The oral argument reports suggest skepticism about the fundamental statutory authority under IEEPA to impose any tariffs, not just about the connection between specific tariffs and emergencies. This undermines the likelihood of a mixed ruling.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red team thinking, my final probabilities are:

Tariffs unlawful: 89%
Tariffs lawful: 5%
Mixed ruling: 4%
Other ruling: 1%
No 2025 ruling: 1%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 89%
Tariffs lawful: 5%
Mixed ruling: 4%
Other ruling: 1%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes:

1.  **Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs and national security (e.g., *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.*). This class would suggest a high probability for "Tariffs lawful," perhaps around 70%.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The current Supreme Court is highly skeptical of executive agencies asserting broad authority over matters of major economic and political significance without clear congressional authorization (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*). Imposing sweeping tariffs arguably falls into this category. This class suggests a high probability for "Tariffs unlawful," perhaps 60-70%.
3.  **SCOTUS Review of Unanimous Lower Court Losses for the Government:** The government lost in three separate federal courts. While the Supreme Court often takes cases to reverse the lower court, a strong, cross-court consensus against the government's position is a powerful signal. This class would also favor an affirmance of the lower courts, suggesting a 60-70% chance of "Tariffs unlawful."

**Synthesized Prior:** The jurisprudence of the current Court (Reference Class 2) and the specific posture of this case (Reference Class 3) appear more relevant than the older, more general deference precedents (Reference Class 1). The novel application of the IEEPA to broad tariff policy strengthens this view. Therefore, I will establish a prior centered on the tariffs being struck down.

*   **P(Tariffs unlawful):** 60%
*   **P(Tariffs lawful):** 20%
*   **P(Mixed ruling):** 10%
*   **P(Other ruling):** 5%
*   **P(No 2025 ruling):** 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case differs from historical base cases of presidential power in several key ways:

*   **Nature of the Power:** The case concerns the power to tax (impose tariffs), a power the Constitution explicitly grants to Congress, rather than more traditional executive foreign policy tools like asset freezes or sanctions.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** The declaration of a national emergency based on "trade deficits" is a legally novel and expansive interpretation of IEEPA, making it more vulnerable to challenge than emergencies based on specific, hostile foreign acts.
*   **Judicial Philosophy:** The current Court's 6-3 conservative majority has a well-established record of enforcing separation of powers and limiting executive overreach via doctrines like major questions and textualism, a significant shift from the courts that decided earlier deference cases.

These differences all suggest that the base rate favoring deference to the President is inappropriate, and the case is more likely to be decided on grounds of statutory limits and separation of powers, strengthening the prior favoring an "unlawful" ruling.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the background and research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Unanimous Rulings Against the Tariffs in Three Lower Courts.**
    *   This evidence is highly likely if the government's legal position is weak (P(E | Tariffs unlawful) is high).
    *   It is very unlikely if the government's position is strong (P(E | Tariffs lawful) is very low).
    *   This strongly supports the "Tariffs unlawful" hypothesis.

*   **Evidence 2: The Supreme Court Granted Expedited Review.**
    *   This signals the Court sees an urgent issue of national importance that requires a swift, definitive resolution.
    *   This makes a merits ruling in 2025 highly probable, thus significantly lowering the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling." (P(E | No 2025 ruling) is very low).
    *   It slightly favors a ruling against the government, as such urgency often accompanies a desire to halt a legally dubious and disruptive executive action.

*   **Evidence 3: Oral Arguments Showed "Skepticism Across the Ideological Spectrum."**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. Reports of cross-ideological agreement or skepticism at oral argument are a strong predictor of the final outcome.
    *   P(E | Tariffs unlawful) is very high. This is precisely what one would expect to hear if a broad majority is preparing to strike down the tariffs.
    *   P(E | Tariffs lawful) is extremely low. It would be shocking for the Court to uphold the tariffs after such a display of skepticism.
    *   P(E | Mixed ruling) is moderate. The skepticism could be directed at the government's broadest claims (the reciprocal tariffs) while leaving room to uphold the narrower ones (trafficking tariffs).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will conceptually update my priors based on the evidence.

1.  **Initial Prior:** P(Tariffs unlawful) = 60%, P(Tariffs lawful) = 20%. Prior odds (Unlawful / Lawful) = 3 to 1.
2.  **Update on Oral Arguments:** The "cross-ideological skepticism" is a very strong signal. Let's estimate the likelihood ratio P(E|Unlawful) / P(E|Lawful) is very high, perhaps 20-to-1.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds (Unlawful / Lawful) ≈ 3 × 20 = 60 to 1.
    *   This update crushes the probability of "Tariffs lawful," pushing it into the low single digits.
3.  **Considering "Mixed ruling":** The oral argument evidence also makes "Unlawful" more likely than "Mixed," but the possibility of the Court splitting the difference remains the most plausible alternative. The trafficking tariffs have a more traditional national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs, providing a potential line for the Court to draw. Therefore, "Mixed ruling" deserves a significant portion of the remaining probability.
4.  **Considering "No 2025 ruling":** The expedited schedule makes this very unlikely. The Court took the case to decide it quickly. A delay into January 2026 is possible but improbable.
5.  **Final Adjustment:** The evidence overwhelmingly points toward a loss for the government. The main uncertainty is between a total loss ("unlawful") and a partial one ("mixed"). The "lawful" option is now a tail risk.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis is heavily weighted by the oral argument reports, which, while powerful, are not infallible. Justices can play devil's advocate, and their final opinions can shift. The strongest alternative scenario is a "Mixed ruling." The Court might be reluctant to completely strip the President of this tool, especially concerning the drug trafficking rationale, which sounds more like a traditional national security threat. A ruling that strikes down the economically-motivated "reciprocal tariffs" but upholds the security-motivated "trafficking tariffs" would be a classic judicial compromise, reining in executive overreach without eliminating the power entirely. I have increased the probability of "Mixed ruling" from my initial prior to reflect this, as it is the most credible alternative to a complete rebuke of the tariffs. The chance of a "lawful" ruling is minimal and would require the oral argument reports to be fundamentally misleading.

### 6. Final Normalization

After updating on the evidence and considering alternative scenarios, I have adjusted the probabilities. They are internally consistent and sum to 100%.

*   **Tariffs unlawful:** The most likely outcome, supported by the current Court's jurisprudence, lower court consensus, and strong signals from oral arguments.
*   **Mixed ruling:** The most plausible alternative, allowing the Court to curb the most expansive use of IEEPA while preserving some executive authority.
*   **Tariffs lawful:** Now a very low probability tail risk.
*   **No 2025 ruling / Other ruling:** Small probabilities reflecting the unlikelihood of delay or a procedural dodge given the expedited review.

Tariffs lawful: 2%
Tariffs unlawful: 78%
Mixed ruling: 17%
Other ruling: 1%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
