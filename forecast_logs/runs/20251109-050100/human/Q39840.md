### Reference class & base rates
-   **Primary: Peak Daily Anomaly in Recent La Niña Winters (Nov-Dec 2020, 2021, 2022).** This is the most direct comparison, as it controls for the ENSO state. During the "triple-dip" La Niña, peak daily anomalies in Nov-Dec were lower than in El Niño or neutral years.
    -   *Base Rate Range:* Peak daily anomalies likely fell in the **1.15°C to 1.40°C** range (vs. 1991-2020 baseline).
    -   *Reasoning:* This is derived from observing monthly average anomalies during those periods (which were ~0.3-0.5°C) and adding a typical premium for daily peak volatility (~0.2-0.4°C) and accounting for the strong underlying warming trend that makes later years in the period warmer.
-   **Secondary: Peak Daily Anomaly in All Recent Winters (Nov-Dec 2020-2023).** This class captures the full range of recent variability, including the extreme heat of the 2023 El Niño.
    -   *Base Rate Range:* **1.15°C to 1.90°C** (vs. 1991-2020 baseline).
    -   *Reasoning:* This range is anchored by the cooler La Niña years at the bottom and the record-shattering Nov-Dec 2023 period at the top, which saw daily anomalies peak near 1.9°C. It reflects the powerful influence of the ENSO cycle on top of background warming.
-   *Limitations:* Both reference classes are small. The climate is non-stationary due to rapid warming, making historical analogues less reliable. The specific timing and strength of the current La Niña relative to the reference cases is a key uncertainty.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-03** CPC confirms La Niña is present and favored to persist through winter. ↓ — The primary short-term cooling mechanism for global temperatures is officially active and expected to influence the forecast period.
-   **2025-10-09** NOAA officially announces the emergence of La Niña conditions. ↓ — Confirms the transition away from the warmer ENSO-neutral/El Niño states that dominated late 2023 through early 2025.
-   **2025-09-30** (Implied by background chart) 2025 year-to-date temperature rank slips from 2nd to 3rd warmest. ↓ — Demonstrates that the cooling influence of the developing La Niña is already manifesting in global data, pulling 2025's trajectory below 2024's.
-   **2025-05-01 to 2025-09-01** (General trend) Global temperatures remain exceptionally high but do not set new all-time monthly records, unlike the 2023-2024 period. ↔/↓ — The extreme record-breaking heat streak fueled by El Niño has ended, indicating a shift in the planet's short-term energy balance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **ENSO State (La Niña):** The presence of La Niña is the dominant driver. It involves cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, which reduces the amount of heat transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere. (Size: **Large** ↓)
-   **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The accumulation of greenhouse gases creates a powerful, non-negotiable warming background. Each year has a higher thermal baseline than the last, making it harder for La Niña to produce record-cold anomalies. (Size: **Large** ↑)
-   **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The 2023-2024 El Niño transferred immense heat into the global oceans, which are at record-high temperatures. This stored heat is released slowly, acting as a powerful thermal buffer that counteracts some of La Niña's atmospheric cooling. (Size: **Moderate** ↑)
-   **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) Water Vapor:** The January 2022 eruption injected a massive plume of water vapor (a potent greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. This is still thought to be exerting a small but persistent net warming effect on the planet. (Size: **Small** ↑)
-   **Short-term Weather Variability:** The final peak daily temperature will be determined by synoptic-scale weather patterns. A specific configuration of jet streams and high-pressure systems could produce a short-lived global spike, independent of the broader climate state. (Size: **Small** ↑/↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Higher Thermal Baseline:** The planet is significantly warmer now than during the 2020-2022 La Niña period. The inexorable long-term warming trend means a "cool" La Niña in 2025 will be substantially warmer than one just a few years prior.
-   **Preceded by a Record El Niño:** This La Niña follows one of the strongest El Niño events on record. The thermal inertia from record-high ocean heat content will likely dampen La Niña's cooling effect more than in the 2020-2022 period, which began from a more neutral state.
-   **Persistent HTHH Eruption Effects:** Unlike the 2020-2022 La Niñas, the current event is occurring while the stratospheric warming effect from the HTHH water vapor plume is still active, adding a small positive term to the global temperature anomaly.
-   **Potentially Weaker La Niña:** Forecasts in late 2024 (leading up to this event) consistently called for a weak and potentially short-lived La Niña. If this holds true for the Nov-Dec 2025 period, its cooling influence will be less potent than the moderate events of 2020-2022.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Based on the primary reference class (peak daily anomalies in Nov-Dec of recent La Niña years), a prior centered around **1.30°C** (vs. 1991-2020) is plausible, with moderate confidence (equivalent n≈10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑ (Large): The underlying baseline temperature is substantially higher in 2025 than in the 2020-2022 reference period due to the secular warming trend.
    -   ↑ (Moderate): Residual heat in the climate system, particularly the oceans, from the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño will counteract La Niña's cooling.
    -   ↑ (Small): The current La Niña may be weaker than the events in the reference class, providing less of a cooling impulse.
    -   ↑ (Small): Lingering stratospheric water vapor from the HTHH eruption provides a minor warming boost not present in the reference class.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the specific conditions of 2025 will make this La Niña winter significantly warmer than the 2020-2022 La Niña winters. The posterior should move **substantially upward** from the prior, likely into the 1.45°C to 1.65°C range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) or other ENSO indicators showing a rapid weakening of La Niña (values moving from -0.8°C back toward -0.5°C).
    -   Persistent positive anomalies in global sea surface temperatures outside the equatorial Pacific.
    -   Unusually low Arctic or Antarctic sea ice extent for the season.
    -   Development of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which can contribute to global warmth.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Strengthening of La Niña conditions (ONI values dropping below -1.0°C).
    -   Development of large, persistent negative sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic.
    -   Higher-than-average global snow cover extent.
    -   A major tropical volcanic eruption that injects cooling sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere (low probability).

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Average:** The question resolves on the single highest daily anomaly, which is subject to short-term weather "noise" and is harder to predict than the monthly average. The final value could be a brief spike.
-   **Baseline Ambiguity:** Anomaly values are baseline-dependent. This brief assumes the standard Copernicus 1991-2020 baseline. A value of 1.5°C vs. 1991-2020 is approximately 2.0°C vs

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we'll follow a Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Primary Reference Class:** Peak daily anomalies during recent La Niña winters (Nov-Dec 2020, 2021, 2022), with a base rate range of 1.15°C to 1.40°C. This is chosen because it directly controls for the ENSO state, which is a significant factor in temperature anomalies.
   - **Secondary Reference Class:** Peak daily anomalies in all recent winters (Nov-Dec 2020-2023), with a base rate range of 1.15°C to 1.90°C. This captures the full range of recent variability, including the extreme heat of the 2023 El Niño.
   - **Base Rate Mean/Median:** Approximately 1.30°C for the primary reference class.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The presence of La Niña conditions, which historically correlate with lower temperature anomalies.
   - **Differences:** The current La Niña is potentially weaker, and the planet's thermal baseline is higher due to long-term warming trends and residual heat from the recent El Niño.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **ENSO State (La Niña):** Large cooling effect, making lower anomalies more likely.
   - **Long-term Warming Trend:** Large warming effect, making higher anomalies more likely.
   - **Ocean Heat Content:** Moderate warming effect, counteracting La Niña's cooling.
   - **HTHH Eruption Effects:** Small warming effect.
   - **Short-term Weather Variability:** Small effect, could push anomalies either way.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 1.30°C.
   - **Evidence:** The warming effects (long-term trend, ocean heat, HTHH) outweigh the cooling effect of La Niña, suggesting an upward shift.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Likely in the range of 1.45°C to 1.65°C, reflecting the net warming influence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the potential for unexpected weather patterns or a stronger-than-expected La Niña.
   - **Tail Risks:** A sudden volcanic eruption or other unforeseen events could skew the distribution.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where La Niña strengthens unexpectedly, pulling the anomaly closer to the lower end of the base rate range.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to account for the dominant warming influences and the potential for short-term variability.

P10: 1.35  
P20: 1.40  
P40: 1.50  
P60: 1.55  
P80: 1.60  
P90: 1.65

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary Reference Class**: Peak daily temperature anomalies during November-December in recent La Niña years (2020-2022)
- During these La Niña periods, peak daily anomalies typically ranged from 1.15°C to 1.40°C (relative to 1991-2020 baseline)
- The mean of this distribution is approximately 1.30°C
- This reference class is most relevant because it matches the ENSO state (La Niña) expected for Nov-Dec 2025

**Secondary Reference Class**: Peak daily anomalies for all recent Nov-Dec periods (2020-2023)
- This broader class includes the extreme El Niño-influenced 2023, with anomalies ranging from 1.15°C to 1.90°C
- This provides context for the full range of recent variability

I'll primarily use the La Niña-specific reference class (1.15°C to 1.40°C, centered at 1.30°C) as my prior, as it better matches the expected ENSO conditions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- La Niña conditions are present and expected to persist through the forecast period
- The seasonal timing (Nov-Dec) matches our reference class
- The measurement methodology (Copernicus) remains consistent

**Key differences**:
- Background warming trend: 2025 is 3-5 years later than our reference period, with continued accumulation of greenhouse gases
- Ocean heat content: The 2023-2024 El Niño was exceptionally strong, leaving residual heat in the ocean system
- La Niña strength: Current forecasts suggest this may be a weaker La Niña than those in 2020-2022
- Hunga Tonga eruption effects: Lingering stratospheric water vapor from the 2022 eruption provides a small warming influence not present in earlier La Niñas

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates higher**:
1. **Background warming trend** (Strong ↑): Global temperatures have been increasing at approximately 0.2-0.3°C per decade. Even with just 3-5 years since our reference period, this adds ~0.06-0.15°C to expected values.
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values ~2x more likely than in the reference period

2. **Record ocean heat content** (Moderate ↑): The 2023-2024 El Niño pushed ocean heat content to record levels. This stored heat continues to influence atmospheric temperatures even during La Niña.
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values ~1.5x more likely

3. **Potentially weaker La Niña** (Moderate ↑): NOAA announcements suggest this La Niña may be weaker than those in 2020-2022, providing less cooling influence.
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values ~1.3x more likely

4. **Hunga Tonga water vapor** (Weak ↑): The stratospheric water vapor from the 2022 eruption provides a small but persistent warming effect.
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes higher values ~1.1x more likely

**Evidence pushing estimates lower**:
1. **Confirmed La Niña conditions** (Strong ↓): The primary cooling mechanism is officially active and expected to persist through the forecast period.
   - This is already incorporated in our La Niña-specific prior

2. **Declining 2025 temperature rank** (Weak ↓): The background notes that 2025 has slipped from 2nd to 3rd warmest, suggesting the La Niña cooling effect is already manifesting.
   - Likelihood ratio: Makes lower values ~1.1x more likely

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior centered at 1.30°C (from La Niña years), I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - Background warming trend**:
- Prior mean: 1.30°C
- Update: +0.10°C (midpoint of 0.06-0.15°C from warming trend)
- Posterior mean: 1.40°C

**Second update - Record ocean heat content**:
- Prior mean: 1.40°C
- Update: +0.05°C (moderate effect from residual ocean heat)
- Posterior mean: 1.45°C

**Third update - Weaker La Niña**:
- Prior mean: 1.45°C
- Update: +0.05°C (less cooling from a weaker La Niña)
- Posterior mean: 1.50°C

**Fourth update - Other factors**:
- Prior mean: 1.50°C
- Update: +0.02°C (small effects from Hunga Tonga, partially offset by already-observed cooling)
- Posterior mean: 1.52°C

The posterior distribution is shifted significantly upward from our La Niña reference class, with a mean around 1.52°C and a wider spread to account for uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence issues**:
- I may be underestimating La Niña's cooling power. If this La Niña strengthens unexpectedly, temperatures could be lower than forecast.
- The background warming trend might not be as linear as assumed, especially over short time periods.
- Daily peak anomalies are subject to weather noise and could be significantly higher or lower than monthly averages.

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Lower-than-expected scenario**: A strong La Niña develops, ocean heat dissipates faster than expected, and no significant weather anomalies occur. This could push the peak anomaly down to ~1.30°C.
- **Higher-than-expected scenario**: La Niña weakens rapidly, ocean heat persists, and a significant weather pattern creates a short-term spike, pushing anomalies toward 1.80°C.

**Tail risks**:
- On the high end: A brief but extreme weather pattern during an already warm period could create an anomalous spike.
- On the low end: A sudden stratospheric warming event or other atmospheric pattern could temporarily enhance La Niña's cooling effect.

After considering these factors, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly to account for the inherent unpredictability of daily peak values.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the **peak daily global surface air temperature anomaly during the Nov-Dec periods of recent La Niña years (2020, 2021, 2022)**. This class is chosen because it controls for the dominant short-term climate driver, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) state, which is confirmed to be La Niña for the forecast period.

Based on the research report and general climate data, the monthly anomalies during these years were cooler than in neutral or El Niño years. The report estimates the peak *daily* anomalies in this period fell within a range of **1.15°C to 1.40°C** relative to the 1991-2020 baseline. I will adopt this as my prior distribution, with a median (P50) around **1.28°C**. This prior reflects a "typical" modern La Niña winter.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in Nov-Dec 2025 has one key similarity and several crucial differences compared to the 2020-2022 base case.
*   **Similarity**: The presence of La Niña conditions provides a global cooling pressure relative to neutral or El Niño states.
*   **Differences**:
    1.  **Higher Thermal Baseline**: The inexorable long-term warming trend (approx. +0.2°C/decade) means the planet's baseline temperature is roughly 0.06-0.10°C warmer in 2025 than the average of the 2020-2022 period.
    2.  **Preceding Record El Niño**: The 2025 La Niña follows the exceptionally strong 2023-2024 El Niño, which left global ocean heat content at record highs. This immense thermal inertia will act as a buffer, counteracting La Niña's cooling effect and making this period warmer than the 2020-2022 La Niñas, which were not preceded by such an extreme event.
    3.  **La Niña Strength**: Forecasts suggest the current La Niña will be weak, providing less cooling impulse than the more persistent "triple-dip" La Niña of 2020-2022.
    4.  **Other Factors**: The lingering warming effect from the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption's stratospheric water vapor injection is still present, adding a small positive forcing not fully active during the base rate period.

All significant differences point towards the 2025 Nov-Dec period being substantially warmer than the 2020-2022 base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Long-term Warming Trend**: This is a high-confidence factor that pushes the entire distribution up. Likelihood: **Strong upward pressure (+0.08°C)**.
*   **Residual Ocean Heat & Weak La Niña**: This is the most significant factor differentiating 2025 from the base case. The combination of record ocean heat and a weak La Niña strongly suggests a much warmer outcome than a typical La Niña winter. Likelihood: **Very strong upward pressure (+0.15°C to +0.25°C)**.
*   **Recent Data (Chart)**: The provided chart shows that the 2025 temperature anomaly (dark red line) has already dipped below the 2024 anomaly (orange line) as of September. This is crucial evidence that the cooling effect of La Niña is taking hold and is strong enough to counteract some of the warming pressures. This makes it less likely that the 2025 peak will exceed the 2024 peak (approx. 1.6°C). Likelihood: **Moderate downward pressure relative to a simple "warming trend" extrapolation, capping the likely upper range.**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior Median**: ~1.28°C (from 2020-2022 La Niñas).
*   **Update Step 1 (Warming Factors)**: I first update the prior with the strong evidence that 2025 will be warmer than the base case. Adding the warming trend (~+0.08°C) and the effect of residual heat/weak La Niña (~+0.20°C) pushes the median up significantly, from 1.28°C to approximately 1.56°C.
*   **Update Step 2 (Cooling Factors/Caps)**: I then incorporate the evidence from the chart showing 2025 tracking below 2024. This suggests that the cooling from the established La Niña is significant and the final peak is unlikely to be much higher than the 2024 peak (~1.6°C). This tempers the upward update from Step 1.
*   **Posterior**: The final posterior distribution balances these forces. It must be significantly warmer than the 1.28°C prior but likely cooler than the 1.6°C peak seen in the 2024 transition year. I therefore center my posterior distribution with a median (P50) of **1.50°C**. The variance of the posterior remains high due to the unprecedented conditions.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if:
1.  **The La Niña fizzles out completely**: If it reverts to neutral conditions by November, the cooling pressure would vanish, and the peak could easily challenge or exceed the 2024 peak of 1.6°C. This suggests the upper tail of my distribution should be reasonably high.
2.  **The La Niña strengthens unexpectedly**: If it intensifies into a moderate or strong event, the cooling could be much more effective, pushing the peak down towards the upper end of the 2020-2022 base case (around 1.40°C or even lower). This suggests the lower tail should not be too high.
3.  **Daily Volatility is Extreme**: The question is about a single day's peak, not a monthly average. A short-lived, large-scale weather pattern could cause a spike that is unrepresentative of the overall climate state.

To account for these possibilities, especially the tail risks, I will use a relatively wide distribution. A P10 of 1.30°C accounts for a stronger-than-expected La Niña, while a P90 of 1.70°C accounts for a fizzling La Niña and the dominance of background warming. This P10-P90 range of 0.40°C reflects the significant uncertainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 1.30
P20: 1.38
P40: 1.46
P60: 1.54
P80: 1.62
P90: 1.70
