### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Prime Ministers in the French Fifth Republic (1958-Present):** There have been 26 prime ministers. The median tenure is approximately 2.5 years. Only two (Barnier, Cresson) have served less than one year. This reference class suggests a high degree of stability, with a PM from a specific party typically remaining in office for an extended period. However, this class largely reflects periods of majority rule and is a poor fit for the current crisis.
2.  **Prime Ministers during "Cohabitation" (1986-88, 1993-95, 1997-2002):** In these three instances, the President and Prime Minister came from opposing political parties that held a clear majority in the National Assembly. These governments were stable and served out their terms. This class is also a poor fit, as the current situation is a hung parliament with no stable majority, not a cohabitation with a clear opposition majority.
3.  **Governments in a Hung Parliament (2022-Present):** This is the most relevant reference class. Since the 2022 legislative elections, France has had five governments (Borne, Attal, Barnier, Bayrou, and the current post-Bayrou situation). The average tenure has been extremely short (under 9 months). In this period, the PM has come from the President's coalition (Borne, Attal) or a "compromise" party (LR's Barnier, MoDem's Bayrou). The base rate for any single government surviving a year is very low (<25%). The base rate for the PM being from a party outside the NFP or RN blocs is 100% so far, but the base rate for them being toppled is also extremely high.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The horizon is ~2 months, so the last 6 months are most relevant. The provided background creates a fictionalized but plausible timeline.
*   **2025-09-08 (Implied):** ↓↓↓ (for The Democrats) — PM François Bayrou's government is presumed to have lost its scheduled confidence vote, triggering another government collapse and the current political vacuum.
*   **2025-08 (Late):** ↓↓ (for The Democrats) — Bayrou's decision to call a confidence vote on a contentious budget, knowing the opposition was united against it, was a high-risk gamble that initiated the current crisis.
*   **2024-12-23:** ↑ (for The Democrats) — The appointment of François Bayrou as PM put his party, The Democrats (MoDem), in the top position, making it the incumbent party for this question.
*   **2024-12-04:** ↑ (for Republican Right) / ↓ (for stability) — The ousting of Michel Barnier (Republican Right) in a no-confidence vote demonstrated the power of the LFI-RN "unholy alliance" and reset the PM selection process, creating the opening for Bayrou.
*   **2024-09-05:** ↑ (for Republican Right) — President Macron's appointment of Michel Barnier established a precedent of seeking a PM from the center-right LR to break the deadlock, a strategy that could be repeated.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Appointment Power:** President Macron retains the sole authority to nominate the Prime Minister. His strategic calculations, personal preferences, and refusal to appoint from NFP or RN are the single most important driver. (Large)
2.  **Parliamentary Veto Power:** The fragmented National Assembly, particularly the ability of the far-left (LFI) and far-right (RN) to unite in opposition, can bring down any government that does not command a majority. This creates a powerful negative check on Macron's choice. (Large)
3.  **Threat of Dissolution:** Since July 2025, Macron has regained the constitutional right to dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections. This threat can be used to force a compromise, or it can be enacted, which would almost certainly lead to a caretaker government ("No Prime Minister") through the resolution date. (Large)
4.  **Budgetary Deadline:** The constitutional and economic necessity of passing a 2026 budget creates a powerful forcing function. This pressure may compel warring parties to accept a technocratic PM ("Other") or a government of national unity as a last resort. (Moderate)
5.  **Internal Party Cohesion:** The internal splits within the Republican Right (LR) and the ideological diversity of the New Popular Front (NFP) make stable cross-party agreements extremely difficult. A potential PM's ability to manage these fractures is key. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Unprecedented Instability:** The fall of two governments (Barnier, Bayrou) via no-confidence votes or the threat thereof in less than a year is without modern precedent. The base rate of PM stability from the Fifth Republic is irrelevant.
2.  **Tri-polar Political Landscape:** Unlike past hung parliaments or cohabitations, the Assembly is split into three irreconcilable blocs (NFP, Ensemble, RN), making any stable majority coalition mathematically and politically almost impossible.
3.  **Weaponized No-Confidence Vote:** The successful vote against Barnier was the first since 1962. This has broken a political taboo and made the motion of no confidence a routine tool of opposition, fundamentally altering government survival calculus.
4.  **President's Regained Dissolution Power:** For the period from July 2024 to July 2025, Macron could not dissolve parliament. He now can, which adds a powerful and unpredictable new element to the strategic game.
5.  **Extreme Fiscal Pressure:** France's significant debt and deficit issues, as highlighted in the background, make the upcoming budget negotiations more contentious than usual, raising the stakes and making compromise harder.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the 2022-2025 reference class: a PM is most likely to come from a centrist or center-right party acceptable to Macron (e.g., Ensemble, LR, Democrats), but the government is fragile. Assign a low equivalent "n" due to the novelty of the situation.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The rapid, successive collapses of both the Barnier (LR) and Bayrou (Democrats) governments demonstrate that this "compromise" model is currently unworkable.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The proven ability of the LFI-RN pincer movement to topple any government it opposes makes the survival of any new party-affiliated PM highly improbable.
    *   **↑ (Large) for "No Prime Minister":** Macron's regained power to dissolve parliament makes calling new elections a highly plausible escape route from the deadlock, which would install a caretaker government over the resolution date.
    *   **↑ (Moderate) for "Other":** The extreme difficulty in finding a political figure who can survive a confidence vote increases the likelihood of Macron appointing a non-partisan technocrat as a last-ditch effort to pass a budget.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly refutes the initial prior that a

To forecast which grouping the Prime Minister of France will belong to on December 31, 2025, we need to consider the current political landscape, historical precedents, and recent developments. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **The Democrats (MoDem)**: Historically, the party of the incumbent PM has a higher chance of retaining the position. However, given the recent political instability and the likelihood of Bayrou's government falling, the base rate should be low.
- **Together for the Republic (Ensemble)**: Macron's coalition has historically been a strong contender for the PM position, but recent instability and lack of majority reduce its likelihood.
- **Horizons**: A smaller party with limited historical influence on the PM position, thus a low base rate.
- **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: Despite its opposition strength, it is unlikely Macron would appoint a PM from this party, so a low base rate.
- **Socialists and affiliated**: Historically significant but currently less influential, so a moderate base rate.
- **Republican Right (LR)**: Given Barnier's recent appointment and subsequent fall, a moderate base rate is appropriate.
- **National Rally (RN)**: Unlikely due to Macron's opposition, so a low base rate.
- **Other**: Given the political instability, the appointment of a technocrat or non-partisan figure is plausible, so a moderate base rate.
- **No Prime Minister**: With Macron's power to dissolve parliament, this scenario is plausible, so a moderate base rate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is unprecedented in terms of instability, with rapid government changes and a hung parliament. This differs from historical periods of stability and majority rule, making traditional base rates less applicable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **The Democrats**: The likelihood of Bayrou's government surviving is low given the upcoming confidence vote.
- **Together for the Republic**: Macron's coalition lacks a majority, reducing its likelihood.
- **Horizons**: No significant evidence suggests an increase in likelihood.
- **La France Insoumise**: The opposition's strength is high, but Macron's appointment is unlikely.
- **Socialists and affiliated**: No significant evidence suggests an increase in likelihood.
- **Republican Right**: Previous appointment of Barnier suggests some likelihood, but recent fall reduces it.
- **National Rally**: Strong opposition presence but unlikely PM appointment.
- **Other**: High likelihood due to potential for a technocratic appointment amidst instability.
- **No Prime Minister**: High likelihood due to potential dissolution of parliament and caretaker government.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **The Democrats**: Prior low, evidence negative, posterior very low.
- **Together for the Republic**: Prior moderate, evidence negative, posterior low.
- **Horizons**: Prior low, no evidence change, posterior low.
- **La France Insoumise**: Prior low, evidence negative, posterior very low.
- **Socialists and affiliated**: Prior moderate, no evidence change, posterior moderate.
- **Republican Right**: Prior moderate, evidence negative, posterior low.
- **National Rally**: Prior low, evidence negative, posterior very low.
- **Other**: Prior moderate, evidence positive, posterior high.
- **No Prime Minister**: Prior moderate, evidence positive, posterior high.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

Consider the possibility of unexpected political alliances or shifts that could alter the landscape. The dissolution of parliament and a caretaker government is a significant risk. The appointment of a technocrat is plausible given the deadlock.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

The Democrats: 5%  
Together for the Republic: 10%  
Horizons: 5%  
La France Insoumise: 5%  
Socialists and affiliated: 10%  
Republican Right: 10%  
National Rally: 5%  
Other: 25%  
No Prime Minister: 25%  

These probabilities reflect the high likelihood of either a technocratic appointment or a caretaker government due to the current political instability and Macron's strategic options.

# Analysis of Future French Prime Minister by December 31, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish priors based on the most relevant reference class: the current hung parliament period (2022-present).

**Party distribution of PMs since 2022:**
- Ensemble coalition (Borne, Attal): 2 PMs
- Republican Right (Barnier): 1 PM
- The Democrats (Bayrou): 1 PM
- Other parties: 0 PMs
- No PM/caretaker: periods between governments

Given the current political crisis and the fact that we're forecasting for December 31, 2025 (about 2 months from now), I'll set these initial priors:

- The Democrats: 15% (incumbent party, but just lost confidence vote)
- Together for the Republic: 15% (Macron's core party, previously held PM position)
- Horizons: 5% (part of Macron's coalition but smaller)
- La France Insoumise: 5% (largest party in NFP but Macron has refused to appoint from NFP)
- Socialists and affiliated: 5% (part of NFP but more moderate than LFI)
- Republican Right: 15% (Barnier's party, previously acceptable to Macron)
- National Rally: 5% (largest vote-getter but politically isolated)
- Other: 15% (technocrat/compromise candidate becoming more likely)
- No Prime Minister: 20% (caretaker government or dissolution of parliament)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The parliament remains hung with the same three irreconcilable blocs
- Macron remains President with the same appointment powers and preferences
- The budget pressure remains a forcing function for compromise

**Key differences:**
- Two successive governments have now fallen via no-confidence votes, unprecedented in modern France
- Macron now has the power to dissolve parliament (regained in July 2025)
- The budget situation is more urgent with each passing month
- The "compromise PM" strategy has now failed twice (Barnier, Bayrou)
- The LFI-RN tactical alliance to topple governments has proven effective

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Bayrou's government has just fallen**
- P(E|The Democrats): Very high (~90%) - this directly reduces their chances
- P(E|~The Democrats): Low (~10%) - this slightly increases chances for alternatives

**Evidence 2: Macron's refusal to appoint from NFP despite their plurality**
- P(E|LFI or Socialists): Very high (~95%) - this strongly reduces their chances
- P(E|~LFI or Socialists): Low (~5%) - this increases chances for other options

**Evidence 3: The proven LFI-RN ability to topple governments**
- P(E|Any partisan PM): High (~80%) - reduces chances for all party-affiliated options
- P(E|Technocrat/"Other" or No PM): Low (~20%) - increases these options

**Evidence 4: Macron's regained dissolution power**
- P(E|No Prime Minister): Moderate (~60%) - increases likelihood of dissolution and caretaker
- P(E|~No Prime Minister): Moderate (~40%) - slightly reduces other options

**Evidence 5: Urgent budget situation requiring resolution**
- P(E|Technocrat/"Other"): Moderate (~60%) - increases likelihood of compromise solution
- P(E|~Technocrat/"Other"): Moderate (~40%) - slightly reduces partisan options

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the most significant evidence: Bayrou's government falling.

For The Democrats:
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 90/10 = 9
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 9 = 1.584
- Posterior probability: 1.584/(1+1.584) = 61.3%

This seems far too high given the context. The calculation error stems from misinterpreting the likelihood ratio. Let me recalculate:

For The Democrats:
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 10/90 = 0.111 (since the evidence makes Democrats less likely)
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.111 = 0.0195
- Posterior probability: 0.0195/(1+0.0195) ≈ 1.9%

This significant drop reflects that Bayrou's government falling makes it very unlikely that another Democrat would be appointed.

For "No Prime Minister":
- Prior probability: 20%
- Prior odds: 20/80 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 80/20 = 4 (since the evidence makes No PM more likely)
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 4 = 1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+1) = 50%

This seems too high as well. Let me adjust the likelihood ratio to 2:
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2 = 0.5
- Posterior probability: 0.5/(1+0.5) ≈ 33.3%

For "Other" (technocrat):
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 70/30 = 2.33 (since the evidence makes a technocrat more likely)
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 2.33 = 0.41
- Posterior probability: 0.41/(1+0.41) ≈ 29%

Continuing with qualitative updates for other evidence:
- Macron's refusal to appoint from NFP further reduces LFI and Socialists to ~2% each
- The proven ability to topple governments reduces Republican Right to ~10%
- Together for the Republic remains somewhat viable at ~12%
- Horizons slightly reduced to ~4%
- National Rally remains low at ~4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the likelihood of "No Prime Minister" - France has strong institutional pressures to have a functioning government
- I might be underestimating the Republican Right's chances - Macron might try this approach again with a different figure
- The budget crisis might force unprecedented compromise from parties that have been intransigent

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Macron could make a dramatic reversal and appoint someone from NFP (perhaps a moderate Socialist)
- A national unity government could form under extreme pressure, with a PM from an unexpected party
- A complete breakdown could lead to constitutional crisis beyond just "No PM"

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce "No Prime Minister" slightly to account for institutional pressure
- Increase Republican Right slightly as they remain Macron's most likely compromise
- Increase "Other" to reflect growing likelihood of a technocratic solution

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and adjustments:

- The Democrats: 2%
- Together for the Republic: 12%
- Horizons: 4%
- La France Insoumise: 2%
- Socialists and affiliated: 3%
- Republican Right: 12%
- National Rally: 4%
- Other: 31%
- No Prime Minister: 30%

## 7. Final Forecast

The Democrats: 2%
Together for the Republic: 12%
Horizons: 4%
La France Insoumise: 2%
Socialists and affiliated: 3%
Republican Right: 12%
National Rally: 4%
Other: 31%
No Prime Minister: 30%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate comes from the period of the hung parliament in France since the June 2024 snap elections. The long history of the Fifth Republic, characterized by stable majority governments, is not a relevant reference class for this unprecedented period of instability.

*   **Reference Class:** French governments from July 2024 to September 2025.
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Two governments appointed (Barnier, Bayrou).
    *   Both came from parties outside the largest opposition blocs (NFP, RN) but acceptable to President Macron (Republican Right, The Democrats).
    *   Both governments were extremely short-lived, failing to command a stable majority and being brought down by a "pincer" opposition from the far-left (LFI) and far-right (RN).
    *   The average tenure of a government in this period is just a few months.

*   **Initial Prior Distribution:** Based on this, a new Prime Minister is highly likely before December 31, 2025. The prior probability favors a candidate from a centrist or center-right party, but with a very high probability of failure. This also suggests a significant prior probability for non-standard outcomes like a technocratic government ("Other") or a dissolution leading to a caretaker government ("No Prime Minister").

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation is a direct continuation of the post-July 2024 political crisis. The parliamentary arithmetic has not changed, with three irreconcilable blocs. President Macron's refusal to appoint a PM from the NFP or RN remains a constant.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Repeated Failures:** The model of appointing a compromise PM from the Republican Right (Barnier) and The Democrats (Bayrou) has now been tried and has failed twice. This makes a third attempt using the same strategy less likely to be tried or to succeed.
    2.  **President's Power of Dissolution:** A crucial difference is that since July 2025, President Macron has regained the constitutional authority to dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections. This was not an option for him when he appointed Barnier or Bayrou. This new tool significantly changes his strategic options and increases the probability of the "No Prime Minister" outcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence:** The imminent collapse of the Bayrou government via a confidence vote.
    *   **Likelihood:** This is strong evidence *against* "The Democrats" remaining in the Prime Minister's office. P(Bayrou government falls | PM is a Democrat on Dec 31) is extremely low. This evidence forces a massive downward update on "The Democrats".

*   **Evidence:** The successful no-confidence vote against the Barnier (Republican Right) government.
    *   **Likelihood:** This demonstrates that the "compromise center-right PM" strategy is vulnerable. It reduces the likelihood that Macron will simply appoint another figure from the Republican Right and expect a different outcome. This lowers the probability for "Republican Right".

*   **Evidence:** Macron's regained power to dissolve parliament.
    *   **Likelihood:** This provides Macron with an escape hatch from the parliamentary deadlock. If he concludes that no stable government can be formed, dissolution is his ultimate constitutional weapon. This makes the scenario of a caretaker government much more likely. P(Macron has dissolution power | "No Prime Minister" outcome) is much higher than P(Macron has dissolution power | A stable PM is found). This strongly increases the probability of "No Prime Minister".

*   **Evidence:** The need to pass a 2026 budget.
    *   **Likelihood:** This acts as a forcing function. It could push the political class towards an unconventional solution to avoid chaos. This increases the likelihood of appointing a non-partisan technocrat ("Other") whose sole mission is to pass the budget, or it could be the final trigger for dissolution ("No Prime Minister") if no agreement is reached. It makes "business as usual" political appointments less likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with a prior that Macron will try another political appointee. Let's say P(Republican Right) = 40% as a starting point for the next attempt.

*   **Prior Odds (Republican Right vs. Not):** 0.40 / 0.60 = 0.67
*   **Evidence:** The Barnier government, from the same party, already failed spectacularly in an identical parliamentary configuration.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood of this evidence is much higher if the "Republican Right PM" model is unworkable (~Not H) than if it is workable (H). Let's estimate the likelihood ratio is about 1/4 (i.e., this evidence makes the hypothesis four times less likely).
*   **Posterior Odds:** 0.67 * (1/4) = 0.1675
*   **Posterior Probability:** 0.1675 / (1 + 0.1675) ≈ 14%

This single update shows how the repeated failures drastically reduce the probability of simply trying the same strategy again. The probability mass shifts away from the parties that have already failed (The Democrats, Republican Right) and towards the "break the glass" options: dissolution ("No Prime Minister") or a technocratic government ("Other").

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **My forecast is heavily weighted towards "No Prime Minister" and "Other". Am I underestimating the ability of French politicians to find a last-minute compromise?** It's possible. A surprise figure from Horizons (like Édouard Philippe) or the Republican Right could emerge and forge a temporary, budget-focused alliance. However, the fundamental opposition from LFI and RN remains. Any such government would be inherently unstable.
*   **What if Macron capitulates?** The crisis could become so severe that he is forced to appoint a PM from the Socialist Party to try and split the NFP. This would be a major political defeat for him but is a non-zero possibility. I have assigned a small probability to this.
*   **Best Alternative Forecast:** A forecast that puts "Republican Right" or "Horizons" higher. The argument would be that Macron sees dissolution as too risky for his own party and would rather try every possible political combination first. The Republican Right, despite Barnier's failure, remains the most plausible partner. This is a reasonable alternative, but I believe the evidence of repeated failures and the availability of the dissolution option makes it less likely than a system-breaking outcome. I will maintain a significant, but not leading, probability for these options.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed based on the analysis above. The highest probabilities are assigned to the outcomes that represent a break from the failed cycle of the past year (dissolution or a technocratic PM). Smaller probabilities are assigned to attempts to repeat the political compromise strategy, and tail-risk probabilities are assigned to a capitulation by the President. The sum is 100%.

The Democrats: 5%
Together for the Republic: 4%
Horizons: 8%
La France Insoumise: 1%
Socialists and affiliated: 5%
Republican Right: 10%
National Rally: 2%
Other: 30%
No Prime Minister: 35%
