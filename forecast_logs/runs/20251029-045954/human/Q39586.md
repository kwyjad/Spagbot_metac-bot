### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Virginia Gubernatorial Elections with an Opposite-Party President (The "Virginia Curse"):** Since 1977, Virginia has held 12 gubernatorial elections. In 11 of these 12 contests (92%), the party that did *not* hold the White House won the governorship. The only exception was in 2013 (Terry McAuliffe, D) during the Obama administration. The background information implies a Republican is in the White House in 2025 ("bodes well for Spanberger," a Democrat), making this a powerful base rate in favor of a Democratic win in Virginia.
2.  **New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections (Modern Era):** Since 2001, New Jersey has held 6 gubernatorial elections. Democrats have won 4 of these 6 contests (67%). However, two of the last four elections were won by a Republican (Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013), and the 2021 Democratic victory was by a narrow 3.2-point margin. This suggests a strong but not insurmountable Democratic advantage.
3.  **Combined Off-Year Gubernatorial Outcomes (VA & NJ):** In the six cycles since 2001 where both states held gubernatorial elections, the outcome has been a split party result four times (67%), Democrats winning both twice (33%), and Republicans winning both zero times. The base rate suggests a split decision (i.e., "Only Virginia" or "Only New Jersey") is the most common outcome.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-26** Ciattarelli's 2021 overperformance highlighted (WaPo) — ↓ — Reminds forecasters that polls in NJ may systematically underestimate Republican support, increasing uncertainty and slightly favoring the GOP relative to polling.
*   **2025-10-25** Ciattarelli touts Trump endorsement (CBS) — ↔ — Solidifies his base but may alienate moderate suburban voters crucial in a NJ general election. Net effect is likely small and offsetting.
*   **2025-10-15** Final VA gubernatorial debate — ↑ — Spanberger was widely seen as performing strongly, focusing on kitchen-table issues while portraying Earle-Sears as an extremist, potentially shoring up support with independent voters.
*   **2025-09-21** Profile of Sherrill highlights moderate credentials (WHYY) — ↑ — Reinforces her profile as a former prosecutor and veteran, which plays well in competitive suburban districts and counters GOP attacks.
*   **2025-08-10** Q2 fundraising reports released — ↑ — Both Democratic candidates, Spanberger and Sherrill, reported significant fundraising advantages over their Republican opponents, enabling greater ad spending in the final months.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **National Political Environment (Presidential Approval):** The performance and popularity of the sitting Republican president is a primary driver. Low approval ratings will create strong headwinds for the GOP candidates, reinforcing the Virginia "curse" and making the NJ race more difficult for Ciattarelli. (Large)
2.  **Candidate Quality and Ideological Fit:** Spanberger (VA) and Sherrill (NJ) are both former federal officials from competitive districts with reputations for moderation. This contrasts with Earle-Sears (VA), who is more closely aligned with the conservative wing of the GOP. Ciattarelli (NJ) has a unique profile as a proven, strong statewide campaigner. Mismatches in perceived moderation can swing suburban voters. (Moderate to Large)
3.  **State-Specific Economic Concerns:** In New Jersey, high property taxes are a perennial and powerful issue. Ciattarelli's focus on "affordability" is a direct and effective lever. In Virginia, the economy of the DC suburbs versus the rest of the state creates different priorities. (Moderate)
4.  **Turnout Differentials:** Off-year elections have lower, more volatile turnout. The party base that is more energized (often the one opposing the president) has a significant advantage. Events that mobilize or depress turnout in key demographics can be decisive. (Moderate)
5.  **Polling Accuracy:** The significant 2021 polling miss in New Jersey, where Ciattarelli outperformed expectations, is a causal factor in itself. It suggests either a "shy Republican" voter effect or a systemic failure in modeling the electorate, which may persist. This mechanism increases the probability of a GOP upset in NJ. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **VA: A Test of the "Curse" in a Polarized Era:** While the historical trend is strong, Virginia has trended more consistently Democratic at the federal level in the last decade. The "curse" will be tested against a more solidified Democratic base in the populous Northern Virginia suburbs than existed for much of the reference class period.
*   **NJ: A Repeat, Known Challenger:** Unlike a generic Republican, Jack Ciattarelli is a known quantity who has already demonstrated the ability to consolidate the GOP base and appeal to enough independents to come within a few points of winning. This is a stronger challenger profile than the base rate might suggest.
*   **NJ: Post-2021 Polling Uncertainty:** The reference class of past elections assumes polls are reasonably accurate. The 2021 election provides a specific, recent, and powerful reason to distrust the polls in this specific race, a factor not present in most prior cycles.
*   **Candidate Profiles:** Both Democratic nominees are women with military/intelligence backgrounds from competitive suburban congressional districts. This is a distinct and strong profile that may be particularly resilient to typical GOP attacks on national security and safety.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference classes, the prior should be centered on a split outcome. The powerful Virginia "curse" (with a GOP president) makes a Democratic win there highly likely (~90%). The NJ base rate suggests a Democratic win is more likely than not (~67%). This combination places the initial prior highest on "Both elections," followed by "Only Virginia."
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) **NJ Polling Unreliability & Ciattarelli's 2021 Performance:** This is the strongest piece of evidence. It significantly reduces confidence in a Democratic win in NJ, pulling probability mass directly from "Both elections" to "Only Virginia."
    *   (↑ Small) **Strong Democratic Candidate Profiles:** Both Spanberger and Sherrill have profiles well-suited to their states, potentially overperforming a generic Democrat. This slightly pushes back against the negative NJ evidence.
    *   (↑ Small) **Democratic Fundraising Advantage:** A consistent financial edge allows for message saturation and GOTV efforts, providing a marginal boost in both states.
    *   (↓ Small) **Ciattarelli's Trump Endorsement:** In a blue state general election, this is a net negative, likely alienating more suburban moderates than it gains in base enthusiasm. This slightly counteracts the main negative evidence in NJ.
*   **Net effect:** The prior starts high on "Both elections." The evidence, dominated by the extreme uncertainty and demonstrated GOP strength in New Jersey, should pull the posterior sharply away from "Both elections" and towards "Only Virginia." The posterior should show "Only Virginia" as the most likely outcome, with "Both elections" as a clear second.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Democrats):**
    *   Final polls in Virginia show Spanberger's lead widening to double digits.
    *   Final polls in New Jersey show Sherrill with a lead greater than 8 points (outside the 2021 margin of error).
    *   National approval rating of the Republican President drops below 40%.
    *   Late, major gaffe or scandal involving Earle-Sears or Ciattarelli.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Republicans):**
    *   Final polls in New Jersey show the race within the margin of error (a statistical tie).
    *   Earle-Sears closes the polling gap in Virginia to within 5 points.
    *   A national event (e.g., economic shock) creates a strong headwind for the party opposite the president, potentially overriding the VA curse.
    *   Reports of a significant Republican enthusiasm gap advantage in early voting.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Presidential Identity Assumption:** The entire analysis of Virginia is critically dependent on the background brief's implication that a Republican is in the White House. If this is incorrect, the "curse" flips to strongly favor the Republican, and the forecast

To forecast the outcome of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will apply Bayesian reasoning using the provided background and research report.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections:** Historically, Democrats have won both elections in 33% of the cycles since 2001. This is our base rate for this option.
- **Only Virginia:** The "Virginia Curse" suggests a 92% likelihood of the party opposite the sitting President winning. Assuming a Republican President, this gives a strong base rate for a Democratic win in Virginia.
- **Only New Jersey:** Democrats have won 67% of New Jersey gubernatorial elections since 2001. However, given recent polling inaccuracies and Ciattarelli's strong performance in 2021, this base rate is less reliable.
- **Neither election:** Republicans have not won both elections in any cycle since 2001, making this the least likely base rate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia:** The current scenario aligns well with the "Virginia Curse," with a Republican President and Spanberger leading in polls. Differences include Virginia's recent Democratic trend at the federal level.
- **New Jersey:** The historical Democratic advantage is challenged by Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance and polling inaccuracies. Sherrill's moderate profile and fundraising advantage are positives for Democrats.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia:**
  - Spanberger's strong debate performance and polling lead increase the likelihood of a Democratic win.
  - The "curse" and Spanberger's moderate profile further support this outcome.

- **New Jersey:**
  - Ciattarelli's 2021 overperformance and polling unreliability decrease confidence in a Democratic win.
  - Sherrill's moderate credentials and fundraising advantage slightly counteract this.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia:** Starting with a high prior for a Democratic win (92%), Spanberger's polling lead and debate performance increase this likelihood further.
- **New Jersey:** The prior of 67% for a Democratic win is reduced due to polling unreliability and Ciattarelli's past performance, but Sherrill's strengths prevent a complete collapse.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of polling errors in Virginia, though less likely given the "curse."
- In New Jersey, the potential for a Republican upset is significant due to polling issues and Ciattarelli's profile.
- Adjust probabilities to reflect these risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Based on the analysis, the probabilities are:

Both elections: 25%  
Only Virginia: 50%  
Only New Jersey: 15%  
Neither election: 10%  

These probabilities reflect the strong likelihood of a Democratic win in Virginia, uncertainty in New Jersey, and the historical tendency for split outcomes.

# Analysis of 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia Gubernatorial Elections:**
- Historical pattern: Since 1977, in 11 out of 12 elections (92%), the party opposite the White House has won.
- The background implies a Republican president in 2025 ("bodes well for Spanberger," a Democrat).
- Prior probability for Democratic win in Virginia: ~90%

**New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections:**
- Since 2001: Democrats won 4 of 6 elections (67%)
- However, Republicans have been competitive (Chris Christie won twice, Ciattarelli nearly won in 2021)
- Prior probability for Democratic win in New Jersey: ~65%

**Combined Outcomes (since 2001):**
- Split result (one party wins each state): 4/6 times (67%)
- Democrats win both: 2/6 times (33%)
- Republicans win both: 0/6 times (0%)

Initial priors based on historical patterns:
- Both elections (Dem): ~59% (0.90 × 0.65)
- Only Virginia (Dem): ~32% (0.90 × 0.35)
- Only New Jersey (Dem): ~7% (0.10 × 0.65)
- Neither election (Dem): ~2% (0.10 × 0.35)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Off-year elections with typically lower turnout
- Both states have their established partisan leanings (VA purple-blue, NJ solid blue)
- The "Virginia curse" pattern remains relevant with opposite-party president

**Key differences:**
- Virginia has become more consistently Democratic at the federal level
- Jack Ciattarelli is a repeat challenger who nearly won in 2021 (unusual strength)
- The 2021 NJ polling miss (underestimating GOP support) creates additional uncertainty
- Both Democratic candidates have strong moderate profiles (military/intelligence backgrounds)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia Evidence:**
- Current polling shows Spanberger leading
- The "Virginia curse" strongly favors Democrats with a Republican president
- Spanberger performed well in the final debate
- Spanberger has a fundraising advantage

If "Democrats win Virginia" is true, this evidence is highly likely (P(E|H) ≈ 0.95)
If "Democrats win Virginia" is false, this evidence would be surprising (P(E|~H) ≈ 0.20)
Likelihood ratio ≈ 4.75 in favor of Democrats winning Virginia

**New Jersey Evidence:**
- Current polling shows Sherrill leading
- Ciattarelli significantly outperformed polls in 2021 (48% vs. expected ~44%)
- NJ has elected Republican governors recently (Christie)
- Sherrill has moderate credentials but Ciattarelli has proven statewide appeal
- Trump endorsement may hurt Ciattarelli with moderates in a blue state

If "Democrats win New Jersey" is true, this evidence is moderately likely (P(E|H) ≈ 0.75)
If "Democrats win New Jersey" is false, this evidence is also plausible (P(E|~H) ≈ 0.45)
Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.67 in favor of Democrats winning New Jersey

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**For Virginia:**
- Prior odds: 90:10 = 9
- Likelihood ratio: 4.75
- Posterior odds: 9 × 4.75 = 42.75
- Posterior probability: 42.75/(1+42.75) ≈ 0.977 or ~98%

**For New Jersey:**
- Prior odds: 65:35 = 1.86
- Likelihood ratio: 1.67
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 1.67 = 3.11
- Posterior probability: 3.11/(1+3.11) ≈ 0.757 or ~76%

**Combined outcomes:**
- Both elections (Dem): 0.98 × 0.76 = 0.745 or ~74.5%
- Only Virginia (Dem): 0.98 × 0.24 = 0.235 or ~23.5%
- Only New Jersey (Dem): 0.02 × 0.76 = 0.015 or ~1.5%
- Neither election (Dem): 0.02 × 0.24 = 0.005 or ~0.5%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the strength of the "Virginia curse" pattern
- The 2021 NJ polling miss could be even more significant than accounted for
- National environment factors could shift dramatically in the final days
- Turnout patterns in off-year elections are highly volatile

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Ciattarelli could significantly outperform polls again, making NJ much closer
- The Virginia race could tighten if national Republican momentum builds
- A major late-breaking scandal could affect either race

**Adjustments:**
- I should reduce confidence in the NJ outcome given the 2021 polling miss
- The "Both elections" probability seems too high given historical split outcomes
- Need to account for greater uncertainty in off-year elections

**Revised estimates after red-teaming:**
- Both elections (Dem): ~68% (reduced from 74.5%)
- Only Virginia (Dem): ~28% (increased from 23.5%)
- Only New Jersey (Dem): ~3% (increased from 1.5%)
- Neither election (Dem): ~1% (increased from 0.5%)

## 6. Final Normalization

Ensuring probabilities sum to 100% and reflect appropriate uncertainty:

- Both elections: 68%
- Only Virginia: 28% 
- Only New Jersey: 3%
- Neither election: 1%

Sum: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 68%
Only Virginia: 28%
Only New Jersey: 3%
Neither election: 1%

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior, I will first determine the base probability of a Democratic win in each state and then combine them.

*   **Virginia:** The most relevant base rate is the "Virginia Curse," where the party not holding the White House has won the governorship in 11 of the last 12 elections (91.7%) since 1977. The background information implies a Republican is president, making this a strong prior for a Democratic victory. I'll set the initial probability **P(D_VA) at 90%**.
*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey is a blue-leaning state. Democrats have won 4 of the last 6 gubernatorial elections (66.7%). However, recent elections have been competitive, with Republican Chris Christie winning twice and Democrat Phil Murphy winning by a narrow 3.2-point margin in 2021. This suggests a Democratic advantage, but not an insurmountable one. I'll set the initial probability **P(D_NJ) at 65%**.

Combining these (assuming independence for the prior):
*   **P(Both):** 0.90 * 0.65 = 58.5%
*   **P(Only VA):** 0.90 * 0.35 = 31.5%
*   **P(Only NJ):** 0.10 * 0.65 = 6.5%
*   **P(Neither):** 0.10 * 0.35 = 3.5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Virginia:** The current case fits the base rate scenario (the "curse") almost perfectly. The state has trended more Democratic federally, but the 2021 election of Republican Glenn Youngkin (during a Democratic presidency) confirmed the curse's continued relevance. The Democratic candidate, Abigail Spanberger, has a strong profile for the state (moderate, swing-district background), which aligns well with the base case.
*   **New Jersey:** This case differs significantly from the base rate. The Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, is not a generic opponent. He is a known quantity who vastly overperformed polls in 2021 and nearly won. This specific challenger strength and the demonstrated unreliability of polling in this race are major deviations from a standard election.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the state-level probabilities based on the specific evidence provided.

*   **Virginia Evidence:**
    *   **Spanberger's strong profile & fundraising advantage:** This evidence is more likely given a Democratic win than a loss. It slightly strengthens the already high prior. P(Strong D candidate | D win) > P(Strong D candidate | D loss).
    *   **Polling showing Spanberger ahead:** This confirms the expectation from the base rate.
    *   **Net Effect:** The evidence slightly reinforces the strong prior. I will maintain the **P(D_VA) at 90%**, as it's difficult to be more confident than the powerful historical trend.

*   **New Jersey Evidence:**
    *   **Ciattarelli's 2021 overperformance & polling unreliability:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. The fact that polls significantly underestimated GOP support in the last election with this same candidate makes it much more likely that the current pro-Democratic polls are misleading. This is strong evidence against a Democratic win compared to the base rate. P(E | R win) >> P(E | D win).
    *   **Sherrill's strong profile & fundraising advantage:** This is positive evidence for a Democratic win, pushing back against the negative signal from 2021.
    *   **Ciattarelli's Trump Endorsement:** In a blue state like New Jersey, a Trump endorsement is likely a net negative in a general election, as it may alienate more moderate suburban voters than it gains in base enthusiasm. This is a small piece of evidence favoring a Democratic win.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will perform a conceptual update on the New Jersey probability, as it is the most contested.

*   **Prior:** P(D_NJ) = 65% (Prior odds: 0.65 / 0.35 ≈ 1.86 to 1 in favor of Democrats).
*   **Key Update:** The evidence of Ciattarelli's proven strength and the 2021 polling miss is a significant factor. This evidence is much more likely if the Republican is poised to win than if the Democrat is. This suggests a strong likelihood ratio against the Democrats (e.g., Likelihood Ratio < 0.5). This update alone would flip the odds to favor the Republican.
*   **Countervailing Evidence:** Sherrill's strong profile, fundraising, and the potential negative effect of Ciattarelli's Trump endorsement push back in the Democrats' favor.
*   **Posterior P(D_NJ):** The net effect of this conflicting evidence is to move the probability from D-favored (65%) to a genuine toss-up. The 2021 result is such a strong signal that it largely negates the generic blue-state advantage. I assess the race as extremely close, giving a slight edge to the Republican challenger based on his demonstrated overperformance. I will update **P(D_NJ) to 48%**.

With the updated individual probabilities—**P(D_VA) = 90%** and **P(D_NJ) = 48%**—I can calculate the final probabilities for the options.

*   **P(Both):** 0.90 * 0.48 = 0.432
*   **P(Only VA):** 0.90 * (1 - 0.48) = 0.90 * 0.52 = 0.468
*   **P(Only NJ):** (1 - 0.90) * 0.48 = 0.10 * 0.48 = 0.048
*   **P(Neither):** (1 - 0.90) * (1 - 0.48) = 0.10 * 0.52 = 0.052

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast hinges on the Virginia curse holding and the NJ race being a toss-up. The biggest risk is that the curse breaks, which I've assigned a 10% chance to. This seems reasonable given the 1-in-12 historical failure rate. The other key assumption is that Ciattarelli's 2021 performance is indicative of his strength in 2025. An alternative view is that 2021 was his best shot against a somewhat unpopular incumbent, and that the stronger profile of Mikie Sherrill in an open seat race will be enough for a Democratic hold. This would make "Both elections" the most likely outcome. However, the evidence of systemic polling error and Ciattarelli's specific appeal seems more compelling, making a very close race where the Republican has a slight edge the most prudent forecast. Therefore, "Only Virginia" should be the single most likely outcome, but only by a narrow margin over "Both elections".

### 6. Final Normalization

Rounding the calculated probabilities to the nearest whole number:

*   **Both elections:** 43%
*   **Only Virginia:** 47%
*   **Only New Jersey:** 5%
*   **Neither election:** 5%
*   **Total:** 100%

The distribution reflects high confidence in a Democratic win in Virginia, combined with high uncertainty about the outcome in New Jersey, which is modeled as a toss-up slightly favoring the Republican.

Both elections: 43%
Only Virginia: 47%
Only New Jersey: 5%
Neither election: 5%
