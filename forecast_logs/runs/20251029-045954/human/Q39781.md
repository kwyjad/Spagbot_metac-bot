### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency (SoEs) under President Noboa (Nov 2023 - Present):** Noboa has used SoEs frequently as a primary governance tool. In his first year, he has declared multiple SoEs, including a nationwide one in January 2024. This class suggests a higher-than-historical probability of an SoE being active on any given day. The base rate here is for *duration*. The January 2024 SoE was extended to its 90-day constitutional maximum. This suggests a ~25% chance (90/365 days) of a nationwide SoE being active, and a higher chance of a regional one.
2.  **SoEs triggered by major indigenous-led protests (2015-2025):** Major protests against economic measures occurred in 2019 (Lenín Moreno) and 2022 (Guillermo Lasso). Both led to SoEs that lasted for the duration of the acute crisis (typically 2-4 weeks) before being lifted as part of a negotiated settlement. This class suggests SoEs tied to protests are intense but relatively short-lived and rarely last their full constitutional term. The base rate for such an SoE being active on a specific future date, more than two months after its declaration, is low (<20%).
3.  **All provincial SoEs in Ecuador (2015-2025):** This class includes SoEs for security, natural disasters, and protests. Most are localized and last for the initial 60-day period without extension, unless the crisis is systemic (e.g., nationwide gang violence). The base rate of a *specific* province being under an SoE on a random day is very low (<5%), but the probability of *at least one* province being under an SoE is higher, perhaps 15-20%, given recent security trends.

*Limitations:* The current situation is a hybrid, with the government framing a social protest as a national security threat, blurring Classes 1 and 2. Noboa's presidency is short, making the base rate from his tenure volatile.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-06** SoE expanded to 16 provinces, plus two already under emergency orders, for a total of 18. — ↑ — The expansion indicates the government perceives the crisis as widespread and is committing to a broad, forceful response, making a simple lift less likely.
*   **2025-10-08** Government formally accuses Venezuelan cartel Tren de Aragua of instigating and financing protests. — ↑ — This rhetoric frames the conflict as a fight against terrorism, not a negotiation with a legitimate social movement, making it politically harder for the government to back down and justifying an extension.
*   **2025-10-15** Alleged assassination attempt on President Noboa during a visit to a conflict zone. — ↑ — Hardens the government's stance, increases public support for a crackdown, and provides a powerful justification for extending emergency measures for presidential security.
*   **2025-10-22** CONAIE (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador) calls for dialogue but rejects government's precondition to cease all protests first. — ↔ / ↑ — The call for dialogue is a potential off-ramp (↓), but the rejection of preconditions suggests a stalemate, making continued conflict and the need for an SoE more likely (↑).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Constitutional Clock (Large):** The Ecuadorian constitution limits SoEs to 60 days, with only one 30-day extension possible. The current 60-day SoE, declared October 4, is set to expire around December 3, 2025. This is a powerful driver toward 0, as the government must actively decide to extend it.
2.  **Protest Dynamics (Large):** The persistence and intensity of the protests are the primary justification for the SoE. If protests fizzle out due to state pressure or internal exhaustion, the SoE will likely be lifted. If they escalate, an extension is highly probable.
3.  **Noboa's Political Strategy (Large):** President Noboa has built his political brand on a "tough on crime" (mano dura) stance. Backing down to protesters could be perceived as weakness. Framing the protests as cartel-driven allows him to use the state's security apparatus, a popular move with his base, making an extension politically attractive.
4.  **Fiscal Imperative (Moderate):** The diesel subsidy cuts are driven by significant fiscal pressure and likely commitments to international lenders (e.g., IMF). This reduces the government's flexibility to concede to the primary demand of the protesters, prolonging the conflict.
5.  **Mediation and Negotiation (Moderate):** The success or failure of back-channel or formal negotiations, often mediated by the Catholic Church or the UN, is a key off-ramp. A breakthrough would lead to the SoE being lifted; a public failure would ensure its extension.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Conflation of Protest and Security:** Unlike the 2019 and 2022 protests, the government is not just treating this as a public order issue but explicitly framing it as a fight against transnational organized crime. This is a significant rhetorical escalation that justifies a more militarized, prolonged response.
*   **President's High Reliance on SoEs:** Previous presidents used SoEs as a last resort. Noboa uses them as a primary and recurring policy tool, normalizing their use and lowering the threshold for extension.
*   **Simultaneous Crises:** Ecuador is simultaneously battling a deep-rooted gang war and a major social protest. This dual crisis allows the government to plausibly link the two and maintain a state of high alert, making the continuation of emergency powers more likely than in a standalone protest scenario.
*   **Weakness of Political Opposition:** The traditional political opposition is fragmented, giving Noboa more latitude to pursue a hardline strategy without facing a unified political bloc that could pressure him to negotiate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered heavily on 0, reflecting the base rate from protest-driven SoEs (Class 2) and the hard constitutional deadline. The SoE *is scheduled to end* before Dec 25. An equivalent n=15 captures the strong historical pattern of these crises resolving within the initial 60-day period.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The constitutional deadline of ~Dec 3 creates a very strong pull to 0. The default outcome without further action is that the SoE expires.
    *   (↑ Large) Noboa's political strategy of conflating protest with terrorism makes de-escalation difficult and provides strong justification for an extension.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The initial severity and geographic spread of the protests suggest the underlying grievances are deep and will not be easily resolved.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The lack of progress in negotiations points towards a continued stalemate through the early December deadline.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests a bimodal outcome. The posterior should shift away from a simple "0" to a distribution with significant probability mass at 0 (if the SoE expires as scheduled) and another peak around 16-18 (if it is extended). The net effect is a significant upward revision from the prior, acknowledging that an extension is a very plausible alternative to the default expiration.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting a higher number of provinces):**
    *   Official announcement by the government of a 30-day extension to the SoE in early December.
    *   Major, violent escalations between protesters and security forces in late November.
    *   Government presents "evidence" (e.g., captured weapons, foreign fighters) linking protesters to Tren de Aragua.
    *   Breakdown of any tentative talks, with mediators publicly declaring an impasse.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting a lower number of provinces, likely 0):**
    *   Government announcement of a partial rollback or phased implementation of the subsidy cuts.
    *   Protests visibly lose momentum, with significantly lower turnout in major cities.
    *   Announcement of a formal, mediated dialogue between the government and CONAIE.
    *   No government announcement of an extension in the first few days of December.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The SoE could be lifted in most provinces but remain in a few "hotspots" (e.g., Pichincha, Pastaza). The final number could be low but non-zero. Also, a canton-level SoE (like Echeandía) may or may not count as the entire province being in a state of emergency depending on the precise resolution criteria.
*   **"Black Swan" Events:** The forecast is vulnerable to unrelated shocks, such as a major natural disaster (e.g., volcanic eruption) or a significant escalation in gang warfare in coastal provinces, which could trigger a new, overlapping SoE.
*   **Information Warfare:** The government's claims about cartel involvement are difficult to verify independently and may be a deliberate tactic to justify its actions. Relying solely on official statements is risky.
*   **Timing of Resolution:** The resolution date of December 25 falls during a holiday period. The government may choose to lift the SoE just before Christmas as a goodwill gesture, or extend it to prevent holiday-season disruptions.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast hinges on whether the current state of emergency, due to expire around December 3, is extended. While constitutional limits and historical precedent for protest-related emergencies pull strongly towards zero, President Noboa's hardline

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we'll follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The historical base rate for protest-driven states of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador suggests they are intense but short-lived, typically resolving within the initial 60-day period. Given the constitutional limit and historical precedent, the base rate for a protest-related SoE being active more than two months after its declaration is low (<20%).
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The prior distribution is heavily skewed towards 0 provinces, with a small probability mass for a few provinces remaining under SoE due to potential extensions.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation aligns with historical protest-driven SoEs, which are usually resolved within the initial period.
   - **Difference:** The current SoE is framed as a national security issue involving alleged cartel influence, which is a significant departure from past protest-driven SoEs. This framing increases the likelihood of an extension.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Constitutional Deadline:** Strong pull towards 0, as the SoE is scheduled to end around December 3.
   - **Political Strategy:** Noboa's framing of the protests as terrorism increases the likelihood of an extension, pushing the forecast upwards.
   - **Protest Dynamics:** The widespread and severe nature of the protests suggests deep-rooted issues, increasing the likelihood of continuation.
   - **Negotiation Stalemate:** The lack of progress in negotiations suggests a continued stalemate, supporting the possibility of an extension.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered on 0, the evidence of Noboa's political strategy and the framing of the protests as a security issue shifts the distribution upwards. The posterior distribution now has significant probability mass at both 0 and 16-18 provinces, reflecting the bimodal nature of the situation.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a partial resolution or a phased lifting of the SoE, which could result in a non-zero but lower number of provinces under SoE.
   - **Tail Risks:** Consider the impact of unrelated shocks, such as natural disasters or gang violence, which could trigger new SoEs.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a partial lifting of the SoE, with only a few provinces remaining under emergency measures. This scenario is less likely but should be considered.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast is bimodal, with significant probability at both 0 and 16-18 provinces. The percentiles reflect this distribution:

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 0  
P60: 16  
P80: 18  
P90: 18

# Forecasting the Number of Ecuadorian Provinces Under State of Emergency on December 25, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: States of emergency (SoEs) in Ecuador triggered by indigenous-led protests (2019-2025)
- Historical pattern shows these SoEs typically last 2-4 weeks before being lifted as part of negotiations
- They rarely last their full constitutional term (60 days + possible 30-day extension)
- Base rate for such an SoE being active 80+ days after declaration (as would be the case by Dec 25) is very low (~5-10%)
- This suggests a prior heavily weighted toward 0 provinces

**Secondary reference class**: President Noboa's use of SoEs (Nov 2023-Present)
- Noboa has used SoEs more frequently than predecessors
- January 2024 nationwide SoE was extended to its 90-day constitutional maximum
- This suggests a higher probability (~25-30%) of an SoE being active on any given date

The prior distribution is therefore centered heavily on 0, with a smaller probability mass around 16-18 provinces (the current number under SoE).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The current protests follow similar patterns to previous indigenous-led movements
- Constitutional limits still apply (60 days + possible 30-day extension)
- Economic grievances (subsidy cuts) are the primary driver, as in past protests

**Key differences**:
- Noboa has explicitly framed these protests as linked to organized crime/terrorism, unlike previous administrations
- The geographic scope is unusually broad (18 provinces currently under SoE)
- The alleged assassination attempt against Noboa creates a unique security justification
- Noboa has shown greater willingness to use and extend SoEs than predecessors

These differences suggest a higher probability of extension than the historical base rate would indicate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher number of provinces (extension of SoE)**:
- Framing protests as terrorism/cartel activity (LR ≈ 3:1) - This framing makes it politically difficult to back down
- Alleged assassination attempt (LR ≈ 2:1) - Provides strong security justification for continued emergency powers
- Broad geographic scope of current SoE (LR ≈ 1.5:1) - Indicates government perceives widespread threat
- Stalled negotiations with CONAIE (LR ≈ 1.5:1) - Reduces likelihood of peaceful resolution before December

**Evidence for zero provinces (SoE expiring)**:
- Constitutional deadline (~Dec 3) (LR ≈ 1:4) - Creates strong default toward expiration
- Historical pattern of protest-related SoEs being short-lived (LR ≈ 1:2)
- Political cost of maintaining emergency powers during Christmas period (LR ≈ 1:1.5)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior heavily weighted toward 0 (say 80% probability of 0 provinces, 15% probability of 16-18 provinces, 5% probability of other values).

First update on the constitutional deadline and Noboa's framing:
- The constitutional deadline pulls strongly toward 0
- But Noboa's terrorism framing provides justification for extension
- These partially offset, but net effect shifts probability mass from 0 toward 16-18

Second update on assassination attempt and negotiation status:
- Both factors increase likelihood of extension
- Posterior now shows significant bimodal distribution with peaks at 0 and 16-18
- Probability of 0 provinces reduced to ~60%, probability of 16-18 provinces increased to ~30%

Final update considering holiday timing:
- Christmas timing slightly increases likelihood government would lift SoE as goodwill gesture
- But also provides security justification to maintain it during a sensitive period
- Net effect is small, final posterior approximately 55% for 0 provinces, 35% for 16-18 provinces, 10% for other values

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating Noboa's political incentives to maintain a tough security stance
- The research doesn't provide clear indicators of protest momentum or potential for escalation
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of partial lifting (some provinces but not others)
- The timing (Dec 25) falls after the constitutional deadline but during holidays, creating unusual dynamics

**Alternative forecast**: A plausible alternative would place much higher probability on 16-18 provinces, arguing that:
1. Noboa has consistently extended SoEs when possible
2. The terrorism framing creates strong justification
3. The holiday period itself creates security concerns

**Rebuttal**: While these points have merit, they don't fully account for the constitutional constraints and the historical pattern of protest-related SoEs being lifted once acute crisis phases end.

**Adjustment**: I'll increase the probability of intermediate outcomes (partial lifting) to account for these considerations.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 12

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary question is whether a State of Emergency (SoE) declared on October 4, 2025, will be active on December 25, 2025. The Ecuadorian constitution limits SoEs to 60 days, with one 30-day extension. The initial 60-day period for the current SoE is set to expire around December 3, 2025.

Therefore, the most appropriate base rate is the probability that a protest-driven SoE is extended beyond its initial 60-day term. Historically, major protest-related SoEs in Ecuador (e.g., 2019, 2022) have been intense but relatively short, often lifted in 2-4 weeks as part of a negotiated settlement. They have not typically been extended.

This establishes a strong prior distribution heavily concentrated at **0 provinces**. The default constitutional and historical outcome is that the SoE will have expired before December 25. We can model this prior with a very high probability (e.g., >80%) at 0, and a small probability of a non-zero outcome.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
*   The trigger is widespread indigenous-led protests against economic austerity measures (fuel subsidy cuts), similar to the crises in 2019 and 2022.
*   The geographic focus includes many of the same highland and Amazonian provinces.

**Differences:**
*   **Presidential Style:** President Noboa has used SoEs more frequently and aggressively as a governance tool than his predecessors. He extended a previous nationwide SoE (Jan 2024) to its 90-day constitutional maximum, setting a precedent for using the full legal limit.
*   **Government Rhetoric:** The government is explicitly framing the protests not as a social movement but as an insurrection fueled by a transnational cartel ("Tren de Aragua") and threatening terrorism charges. This rhetoric makes negotiation politically difficult and justifies a prolonged security response.
*   **Escalating Events:** The alleged assassination attempt on President Noboa provides a powerful justification for maintaining a hardline stance and extending emergency powers for security reasons.

These differences suggest the current situation is far more likely to deviate from the historical base rate of short, negotiated SoEs.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1.  **Constitutional Clock (Strongly favors 0):** The SoE is legally scheduled to expire around December 3. The default outcome, without an active government decision to extend, is 0 provinces. This is the strongest piece of evidence for a low number.
2.  **Noboa's "Mano Dura" Strategy & Precedent (Strongly favors extension/high number):** Noboa's political brand is built on being tough on crime and disorder. He extended the January 2024 SoE to its maximum. This history makes an extension highly consistent with his established behavior.
3.  **"Terrorism" Framing & Assassination Claim (Very strongly favors extension/high number):** This evidence dramatically increases the likelihood of an extension. It reframes the crisis from one requiring negotiation to one requiring suppression. It would be politically difficult for Noboa to de-escalate after making such severe claims, making it much more likely he will seek the 30-day extension that would cover the December 25 resolution date.
4.  **Stalled Negotiations (Moderately favors extension/high number):** The government's precondition that protests must cease before dialogue begins is a common feature of stalemates, suggesting the conflict is unlikely to be resolved before the early December deadline.

The evidence related to the specific political context and Noboa's actions (Points 2, 3, 4) provides a very strong likelihood ratio in favor of an extension, significantly outweighing the pull from the historical base rate and the default constitutional clock.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A distribution with ~80% of its mass at 0, and 20% spread across higher numbers.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence (Noboa's strategy, terrorism framing) is far more likely under a scenario where the SoE is extended than one where it expires as normal. This evidence acts as a powerful multiplier on the small prior probability of a non-zero outcome.
*   **Update Step:**
    *   Start with Prior Odds of (Extension / No Extension) = 20 / 80 = 1/4.
    *   The evidence of framing protests as terrorism and the assassination claim makes an extension at least 5 times more likely. Likelihood Ratio ≈ 5.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/4) × 5 = 5/4.
    *   This translates to a Posterior Probability of Extension ≈ 5 / (5+4) = 5/9 ≈ 55%.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution is now bimodal. There is still a significant chance of 0 provinces (~45%), but the mode has shifted to a high number, corresponding to the ~55% chance of an extension. If an extension occurs, it will likely cover most or all of the current 18 provinces.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence in the "Hardline" Narrative:** Am I taking the government's rhetoric at face value? It could be posturing to gain leverage in eventual back-channel negotiations. A pre-Christmas deal to de-escalate could be a powerful "off-ramp" for both sides. This strengthens the case for the 0 outcome.
*   **Alternative Scenario: Partial De-escalation:** The government could extend the SoE for a smaller number of "hotspot" provinces (e.g., 3-6) while lifting it elsewhere. This would be a compromise, allowing Noboa to look both strong and reasonable. My bimodal (0 or 18) view is too simple. I need to add probability mass to the middle of the range (e.g., 2-10 provinces).
*   **Unrelated Events:** A new, unrelated crisis (e.g., a major volcanic eruption, a different security flare-up) could lead to a different SoE in a different set of provinces by Dec 25. This is a tail risk that suggests the absolute floor is 0, but the distribution of non-zero outcomes could be complex.

Considering these points, I will adjust my posterior. I will slightly increase the probability of the 0 outcome (from 45% to ~35%) to account for a potential holiday de-escalation, and I will distribute some probability mass in the low-to-mid range (1-15) to account for a partial extension, while maintaining a large probability mass around 16-18 for the full extension scenario.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution reflects a significant chance (~35%) that the SoE expires as scheduled, resulting in 0 provinces. However, if it is extended, it is most likely to be a full or near-full extension. This creates a bimodal-like distribution.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 4
P60: 16
P80: 17
P90: 18
