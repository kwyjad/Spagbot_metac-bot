### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested/Withdrawn Cabinet-Level Nominations:** A plausible reference class is high-profile nominations for agency heads that face significant internal opposition before a formal announcement. Historically, once a candidate's name is floated and faces a significant, public power struggle (especially from an insider like an acting secretary), their chances of nomination decrease significantly. The initial cancellation of Isaacman's nomination places him in this class. **Base Rate: 10-20%** for a candidate to be successfully re-nominated after a prior attempt was cancelled or withdrawn due to political infighting.
2.  **Presidential Appointments in a Second Term/New Administration:** Presidents typically fill key posts like NASA Administrator within the first year. The fact that an *acting* Administrator is still in place in October 2025 is unusual and suggests significant indecision or conflict. In such cases, the eventual nominee is often a compromise candidate or the one who wins the internal power struggle, not necessarily the first choice. **Base Rate: 30-40%** that the initial, high-profile "visionary" candidate (Isaacman) wins out over an entrenched bureaucratic rival (Duffy).
3.  **Appointments Influenced by Presidential-CEO Relationships:** The nomination is explicitly tied to the relationship between the President and Elon Musk. In administrations where personal relationships are paramount, a "falling out" between the President and a key corporate ally of the nominee is a major obstacle. The base rate for a nominee succeeding when their primary backer has lost favor with the President is very low. **Base Rate: <15%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-27** Irish Times reports on the Musk spat and Berger's analysis of the power struggle. ↓ — Confirms the conflict is public and frames it as a serious problem for the agency, with Duffy actively campaigning against Isaacman.
*   **2025-10-21** PCMag reports NASA officially reopens the lunar lander contract. ↓ — A major, concrete action by Duffy that moves beyond threats. It directly undermines SpaceX, Isaacman's key ally, and demonstrates Duffy's power as acting Administrator.
*   **2025-10-20** Space.com reports Duffy's public threat to pull the Artemis 3 contract from SpaceX. ↓ — Duffy is using his current position to create a public narrative that SpaceX is failing, thereby weakening the case for a SpaceX-friendly administrator like Isaacman.
*   **2025-10-14** Reuters reports Isaacman is back in contention for the role. ↑ — The possibility is not dead. This indicates Isaacman still has supporters with influence, forcing a decision rather than letting Duffy's de facto leadership become permanent.
*   **2025-07-09** Sean Duffy is named acting NASA administrator. ↓ — This put a political rival, with his own ambitions for the role and a different vision for the agency, in a position of power to block Isaacman's path.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **President Trump's Final Decision:** (Large) The background explicitly states the decision rests with him. His personal preference, loyalty tests, and relationship with Musk and Duffy will be the single most important factor, overriding policy arguments.
2.  **Duffy's Incumbency and Bureaucratic Power:** (Large) As acting Administrator and Secretary of Transportation, Duffy can take concrete actions (like reopening contracts) to undermine his rival's allies and demonstrate his own vision. He has direct, daily influence over the levers of power.
3.  **The Trump-Musk Relationship:** (Moderate-Large) The reported "falling out" is a significant headwind. If Trump perceives Musk as disloyal or problematic, he is likely to punish him by proxy, i.e., by denying his ally Isaacman the nomination.
4.  **Isaacman's Direct Lobbying Efforts:** (Moderate) As a billionaire entrepreneur, Isaacman likely has his own channels of influence. His ability to appeal directly to Trump or his inner circle could counteract Duffy's efforts, but this is less certain than Duffy's established power.
5.  **Performance of SpaceX (Starship Delays):** (Small-Moderate) While a driver, this is largely being used as a tool by Duffy. The delays are real, but their political importance is magnified by Duffy to provide a rationale for his campaign against Isaacman/SpaceX.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Acting Administrator as Direct Rival:** It is highly unusual for an *acting* agency head to be a direct and public competitor for the permanent role, actively using their position to undermine another leading candidate. Typically, an acting head is a caretaker.
*   **Nominee as Proxy for a CEO:** Isaacman's candidacy is inextricably linked with Elon Musk. This is not just a policy alignment; it's a personal and factional one, making the nomination a referendum on Musk's influence.
*   **Radical Restructuring Proposal:** The proposal to fold NASA into the Department of Transportation is a radical departure from the norm. This raises the stakes of the conflict from a simple personnel choice to a fundamental question about the agency's future and independence.
*   **Prior Failed Nomination:** This is not a fresh nomination process. Isaacman was the choice, and that choice was "cancelled." Re-litigating a failed nomination is much harder than starting with a clean slate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior, perhaps around 20%, based on the reference class of re-nominating a candidate after a previous attempt failed amidst political infighting. (Equivalent n ≈ 5).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Duffy is not a caretaker but an active, empowered rival using his office to block Isaacman.
    *   (↓ Large) The reported "falling out" between Trump and Musk, Isaacman's key sponsor, is a major obstacle in a relationship-driven administration.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Duffy has moved from threats to action by reopening the lunar lander contract, a concrete blow to the Isaacman/SpaceX faction.
    *   (↑ Small) Isaacman is confirmed to be "in contention," meaning his candidacy is not completely dead and still has some backing.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative. The recent, concrete actions by Duffy and the underlying political dynamics (Trump-Musk relationship) provide strong reasons to believe Isaacman's renewed bid will fail. The posterior should move down significantly from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements of praise for Isaacman or Musk from President Trump or his senior advisors.
    *   Reports of a meeting between Trump, Isaacman, and/or Musk.
    *   Any official action from NASA or the White House that walks back Duffy's threats against SpaceX.
    *   Leaks suggesting Duffy is out of favor or that the DoT merger idea has been rejected.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   President Trump publicly praises Sean Duffy's leadership at NASA or DoT.
    *   Further concrete actions taken by NASA to award contracts to SpaceX competitors.
    *   Prominent Trump allies or media outlets begin publicly criticizing Isaacman or Musk.
    *   No news or movement on the nomination by mid-December, suggesting Duffy will remain as acting admin indefinitely or a new candidate is being sought.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Volatility of the Decision-Maker:** President Trump's decision-making process is famously unpredictable and can be influenced by last-minute events or conversations. A sudden reconciliation with Musk could reverse the situation overnight.
*   **Information Gaps:** The analysis relies on public reporting of a behind-the-scenes power struggle. The true balance of influence and the nature of private conversations with the President are unknown.
*   **Resolution Window:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026. A decision could be made but the formal nomination paperwork delayed until the new year, which would cause a "No" resolution even if Isaacman is the intended choice.
*   **"Nominated" Definition:** The resolution requires a formal nomination. A public endorsement or tweet from the President would not be sufficient unless followed by the official submission to the Senate within the resolution window.

**Final Research Summary:**
Jared Isaacman's path to re-nomination is exceptionally difficult. He faces an empowered, entrenched rival in Sean Duffy who is actively undermining him, and his primary sponsor, Elon Musk, is reportedly out of favor with the ultimate decision-maker, President Trump.

To forecast the probability of Jared Isaacman being re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** Given the context of contested/withdrawn nominations and the political dynamics involved, a base rate of 10-20% is appropriate. This reflects the historical difficulty of re-nominating a candidate after a previous attempt was canceled due to political infighting.
   - **Rationale:** The base rate is informed by the historical frequency of similar high-profile nominations facing significant opposition and the specific challenges Isaacman faces, such as the falling out between Musk and Trump.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** Isaacman's situation is similar to past contested nominations where internal opposition and political dynamics played a significant role.
   - **Differences:** The presence of an acting administrator actively campaigning against Isaacman and the unique factor of Isaacman's candidacy being tied to Elon Musk's influence are notable differences that could further decrease his chances.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Duffy's Actions:** Duffy's active opposition and concrete actions against SpaceX (e.g., reopening the lunar lander contract) significantly decrease the likelihood of Isaacman's nomination. Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors non-nomination.
   - **Trump-Musk Relationship:** The reported falling out between Trump and Musk is a major negative factor, as it undermines Isaacman's primary support. Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors non-nomination.
   - **Isaacman's Continued Consideration:** The fact that Isaacman is still in contention provides some positive evidence, but it is weak compared to the negative factors. Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors nomination.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** Start with a prior probability of 15% (odds of 0.176).
   - **Likelihood Ratios:** The negative evidence from Duffy's actions and the Trump-Musk relationship significantly outweighs the positive evidence of Isaacman's continued consideration.
   - **Posterior Odds Calculation:** Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior odds decrease significantly from the prior odds.
   - **Posterior Probability:** The resulting posterior probability is lower than the prior, reflecting the overwhelming negative evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden reconciliation between Trump and Musk or a strategic shift that could favor Isaacman.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A new candidate could emerge, or Trump could decide to keep Duffy as acting administrator indefinitely.
   - **Adjustments:** Given the strong negative evidence, the probability remains low, but it's important to remain open to unexpected developments.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - **Calibrated Probability:** After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final probability reflects the significant challenges Isaacman faces in being re-nominated.

Final: 10%

# Will Jared Isaacman be re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a candidate being re-nominated after their initial nomination was withdrawn or cancelled, particularly in a politically contentious environment.

The most relevant reference class appears to be high-profile nominations for agency heads that:
- Were initially selected but had their nomination cancelled
- Face significant internal opposition from an acting administrator
- Are tied to a relationship between the President and a key ally (Musk) that has deteriorated

Based on historical patterns of presidential appointments, I'll use a base rate of 15%. This reflects:
- The rarity of re-nominating a candidate after a previous attempt failed
- The unusual situation where an acting administrator is actively campaigning against the potential nominee
- The political dynamics where the nomination is tied to a relationship (Trump-Musk) that has reportedly soured

**Prior probability: 15%** (or odds of 3:17)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other withdrawn nominations, there are powerful political actors opposing Isaacman
- The nomination requires presidential approval, which follows typical appointment processes
- There's a power struggle between different factions within the administration

**Key differences:**
- The acting administrator (Duffy) is unusually empowered and taking concrete actions to undermine Isaacman's allies
- Isaacman's nomination is uniquely tied to Elon Musk, making it a proxy for the Trump-Musk relationship
- The stakes are higher than typical appointments due to the proposal to fold NASA into the Department of Transportation
- The timeline is compressed (resolution by January 1, 2026)

These differences generally make Isaacman's re-nomination less likely than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Duffy's concrete actions against SpaceX**
- P(E|H): If Isaacman will be re-nominated, it's unlikely Duffy would be taking such bold actions (reopening lunar lander contracts)
- P(E|~H): If Isaacman won't be re-nominated, Duffy would feel empowered to take these actions
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.3 (strong evidence against re-nomination)

**Evidence 2: Reported "falling out" between Trump and Musk**
- P(E|H): If Isaacman will be re-nominated, a serious falling out between Trump and Musk is unlikely
- P(E|~H): If Isaacman won't be re-nominated, a falling out is consistent with this outcome
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (moderate evidence against re-nomination)

**Evidence 3: Reuters reporting Isaacman is "back in contention"**
- P(E|H): If Isaacman will be re-nominated, we would expect reports of his continued consideration
- P(E|~H): If Isaacman won't be re-nominated, such reports might still emerge as part of the political process
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (mild evidence for re-nomination)

**Evidence 4: Duffy's campaign to fold NASA into DoT**
- P(E|H): If Isaacman will be re-nominated, such a radical restructuring proposal would be unlikely to gain traction
- P(E|~H): If Isaacman won't be re-nominated, this proposal aligns with Duffy consolidating power
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.6 (moderate evidence against re-nomination)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3:17 (15%), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on Duffy's actions against SpaceX:**
- Prior odds: 3:17
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3
- Posterior odds: 3:17 × 0.3 = 0.9:17 ≈ 0.9:17
- Posterior probability: 0.9/(0.9+17) ≈ 5%

**Update on Trump-Musk falling out:**
- Prior odds: 0.9:17
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.9:17 × 0.5 = 0.45:17 ≈ 0.45:17
- Posterior probability: 0.45/(0.45+17) ≈ 2.6%

**Update on Isaacman being "back in contention":**
- Prior odds: 0.45:17
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.45:17 × 2.0 = 0.9:17
- Posterior probability: 0.9/(0.9+17) ≈ 5%

**Update on NASA-DoT merger proposal:**
- Prior odds: 0.9:17
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6
- Posterior odds: 0.9:17 × 0.6 = 0.54:17
- Posterior probability: 0.54/(0.54+17) ≈ 3.1%

After these updates, the posterior probability is approximately 3%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's unpredictability and tendency to make surprising personnel decisions
- The public reporting may not accurately reflect the private dynamics between Trump, Musk, and Isaacman
- There could be behind-the-scenes negotiations or compromises not visible in public reporting

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Trump and Musk could reconcile suddenly, dramatically improving Isaacman's chances
- Duffy's aggressive moves could backfire, making him appear disloyal to Trump's vision
- A compromise could emerge where Isaacman is nominated but with constraints on his authority

**Adjustments:**
Given Trump's unpredictability and the possibility of sudden reconciliation with Musk, I should adjust my estimate slightly upward from the very low 3%. The Manifold market at 53% seems far too optimistic given the evidence, but it suggests I may be missing something or that traders have information I don't.

I'll adjust my estimate to 8%, which still reflects the significant obstacles Isaacman faces while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in Trump's decision-making process.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that Jared Isaacman has approximately an 8% chance of being re-nominated as NASA Administrator before 2026.

Final: 8%

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is that of high-profile political nominations that were previously considered and then withdrawn or canceled due to political infighting, only to be reconsidered later.

*   **Reference Class:** Candidates for cabinet-level/agency head positions whose initial nomination attempt failed due to internal power struggles.
*   **Reasoning:** The background explicitly states Isaacman's initial nomination was "cancelled" after a "falling out between Musk and Trump." His name is now "in contention once again." This places him squarely in the reference class of re-litigated, contentious nominations. Such nominations are difficult to revive because the original political obstacles often remain. The research report suggests a base rate of 10-20% for a candidate in this situation to be successfully re-nominated.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will select a prior probability of **15%**, the midpoint of the suggested range.
    *   Prior Odds: 0.15 / (1 - 0.15) = 0.176 (approximately 1-to-5.6 against).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation has several features that make it even more challenging than a typical case from our reference class.

*   **Similarity:** The core political conflict that scuttled the first attempt (the relationship between Trump and Isaacman's sponsor, Musk) is still a central issue.
*   **Difference 1 (Empowered Rival):** It is highly unusual for the *acting* head of an agency (Sean Duffy) to be a direct, public rival for the permanent job. Duffy is not a caretaker; he is using the institutional power of his office (as acting NASA Administrator and Secretary of Transportation) to actively undermine Isaacman's candidacy and his allies (e.g., by reopening the lunar lander contract). This is a significant negative factor beyond a typical lobbying battle.
*   **Difference 2 (Proxy War):** Isaacman's nomination is inextricably linked to Elon Musk. The decision is less about Isaacman himself and more of a referendum on Musk's influence within the administration. This makes the outcome dependent on the volatile Trump-Musk relationship, which is reportedly poor.
*   **Difference 3 (Short Timeframe):** The resolution window is very short (roughly two months, until January 1, 2026). This limited time favors the status quo (Duffy as acting administrator) and makes it difficult to resolve a complex power struggle and complete the formal nomination process.

These differences suggest that the probability should be adjusted downwards from the already low 15% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate the key pieces of evidence. Let H be the hypothesis "Isaacman is re-nominated before 2026."

*   **Evidence (E1):** Sean Duffy is using his position as acting Administrator to take concrete actions against SpaceX, Isaacman's key ally.
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of an acting administrator openly defying and undermining the President's imminent choice is very low. It would be a politically reckless move.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of Duffy taking these actions if he is trying to win the job himself and eliminate a rival is very high. This is a classic power play.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H)): << 1.** This is strong evidence *against* Isaacman's nomination.

*   **Evidence (E2):** The reported "falling out" between President Trump and Elon Musk.
    *   P(E2 | H): It is unlikely that Trump would nominate the proxy of a CEO he has fallen out with, given his emphasis on personal loyalty.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): The falling out is highly consistent with Trump deciding against Musk's preferred candidate. The spat could be a cause or a consequence of the nomination failing.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: < 1.** This is also strong evidence *against* the nomination.

*   **Evidence (E3):** A Reuters report states Isaacman is "back in contention."
    *   P(E3 | H): If Isaacman were to be nominated, we would expect to see reports that he is in contention. This is very likely.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): Even if he is not the final choice, it is plausible his supporters would leak to the press to create momentum. However, a report in a major outlet like Reuters is more likely if the candidacy is being seriously considered.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: > 1.** This is the primary piece of evidence *for* the nomination and prevents the probability from dropping to near zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's update our 15% prior based on the evidence.

1.  **Start with Prior:** 15%
2.  **Incorporate Duffy's Actions (E1) & Musk Spat (E2):** These are two powerful, related pieces of negative evidence. They show an empowered rival taking action, motivated by a political rift between the principals. This evidence is strong enough to cut the initial probability by more than half. A reasonable update would move the probability from 15% down to the ~5-7% range.
3.  **Incorporate "In Contention" Report (E3):** This positive news confirms that Isaacman's candidacy is not dead and a real fight is occurring. This pushes the probability back up. If the chances were ~6%, this news might double them, suggesting the fight is real and his faction has a chance. This brings the estimate to around **12-14%**.
4.  **Incorporate Short Timeline:** The tight two-month window for resolving this fight and processing a formal nomination acts as a final negative modifier, favoring inertia and the status quo (no nominee, or Duffy remaining as acting). This nudges the probability slightly lower within that range.

The posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior, reflecting the overwhelmingly negative evidence, counteracted only slightly by the report that he remains a contender.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of ~14% is in stark contrast to the Manifold market's forecast of 53%. Why could I be wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The market may believe that Duffy's aggressive moves (especially the radical proposal to merge NASA into the DoT) will be seen by Trump as an overreach. Trump, not wanting to be pushed into a decision, might react by punishing Duffy and choosing Isaacman instead.
*   **Volatility:** The decision rests with one famously unpredictable individual. A single meeting between Trump and Musk could reset the entire situation, making the prior "falling out" irrelevant. My forecast might be underestimating this volatility.
*   **Rebuttal:** While possible, these scenarios seem less likely than the more straightforward interpretation: an empowered political insider (Duffy) is successfully outmaneuvering a rival whose sponsor has lost favor with the President. The structural factors strongly favor Duffy or a compromise third candidate.

I will stick with my analysis but acknowledge the high uncertainty. My final probability reflects a low-but-non-zero chance for Isaacman, accounting for the possibility of a sudden reversal by Trump.

### Final Forecast

The base rate for a failed nomination being revived is already low at ~15%. The specific evidence—an empowered rival in Sean Duffy actively using his office to undermine Isaacman, the ongoing political friction between Trump and Isaacman's sponsor Elon Musk, and a very short timeframe—points to an even lower probability. The only positive indicator is that Isaacman is still "in contention," meaning his supporters have not given up. Weighing these factors, the path to nomination for Isaacman is narrow and difficult.

Final: 14%
