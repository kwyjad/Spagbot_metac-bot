### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Longest Field Goal by NFL Season (2015-2024):** This is the most direct reference class. Over the last 10 seasons, the longest field goal has ranged from 58 to 66 yards. The median longest kick is 61 yards. The distribution is skewed right by a few exceptional kicks.
    *   **Data:** (approx.) 60, 58, 61, 63, 61, 65, 66, 62, 61, 62.
    *   **Base Rate:** A 50% chance the longest kick is 61 yards or less, and a 50% chance it is more. There is a ~20% chance of a kick of 65+ yards in a given season based on this 10-year sample.
    *   **Limitation:** This base rate is rapidly becoming obsolete due to a strong upward trend in kicking distance. It likely underestimates the 2025 outcome.

2.  **All 63+ Yard Field Goals in NFL History:** This class focuses on the extreme tail of the distribution. There have been 11 such kicks.
    *   **Data:** 66 (2021), 65 (2025), 64 (2013, 2021, 2025), 63 (1970, 1998, 2011, 2012, 2021, 2023).
    *   **Base Rate:** These are rare events, but their frequency is increasing dramatically. Six of the eleven (55%) have occurred since the start of the 2021 season. The historical base rate of ~1 per decade is no longer applicable; the modern rate is closer to 1-2 per season.
    *   **Limitation:** The sample size is extremely small, making it difficult to draw robust statistical conclusions, but the trend is undeniable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10 (early):** A 65-yard field goal is successfully kicked in the first four weeks of the season. (↑) — Establishes a very high floor for the final result. The longest kick of the season will be *at least* 65 yards.
*   **2025-09 (early):** A 64-yard field goal is successfully kicked in the first four weeks of the season. (↑) — Along with the 65-yarder, this confirms that the conditions in 2025 are highly conducive to long-range kicks.
*   **2025-08-09:** Rookie Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. (↑) — While not an official record, it serves as a proof-of-concept for the current upper limit of human kicking potential under game conditions.
*   **2025-03-25:** NFL owners approve a rule change allowing teams to prepare and practice with "kicking balls" (K-balls) all week. (↑) — This is a structural change from all prior seasons, believed to make balls easier to kick for maximum distance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Kicker Specialization & Biomechanics (Large):** Athletes are becoming more specialized and technically proficient. Like home run hitters or golf drivers, kickers are optimizing their bodies and technique for maximum power and accuracy, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
2.  **Altitude (Large):** Kicking in Denver's thin air provides a significant, quantifiable distance boost (estimated at 5-7 yards on a 60+ yard attempt). Games at Empower Field at Mile High are prime opportunities for record attempts.
3.  **"K-Ball" Rule Change (Moderate to Large):** The new ability for teams to "break in" kicking balls is a major new variable for 2025. This likely makes the ball softer and more compressible at impact, increasing energy transfer and distance. Its full effect is still being discovered.
4.  **Game Situation (Moderate):** The longest attempts almost exclusively occur at the end of a half or the end of a game. In these situations, a miss has a lower strategic cost, incentivizing coaches to attempt low-probability, high-reward kicks.
5.  **Analytics & Coaching (Small to Moderate):** Teams are more analytically savvy and may be more willing to attempt long field goals based on models that show it's a better option than a Hail Mary or punt in specific scenarios. Kicking-specific coaching has also improved.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Accelerating Trend:** The base rate, derived from the last decade, under-samples the recent explosion in long kicks. The period from 2021-2025 is fundamentally different from 2015-2020.
*   **Structural Rule Change:** The K-ball rule is a novel condition for the 2025 season that does not exist in any of the historical reference class data. This change specifically targets a mechanism for increasing distance.
*   **High Early-Season Floor:** A 65-yard field goal has *already* been made. In most prior seasons, the longest kick was often made mid-to-late season. This high watermark with ~60% of the season remaining increases the probability it will be surpassed.
*   **Demonstrated Human Potential:** Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick, while unofficial, provides a credible signal that the current 66-yard record is well within the range of today's top kickers, given the right conditions.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior distribution based on the 2015-2024 seasons, centered around 62.5 yards with significant variance, acknowledging the recent upward trend. (Equivalent n ≈ 10 seasons).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) A 65-yard FG has already been made. This truncates the left side of the distribution and sets a hard floor at 65.
    *   (↑ Large) The K-ball rule change is a structural break from the past, strongly suggesting the entire distribution of potential maximum distances has shifted to the right.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick provides an anchor for the plausible upper tail of the distribution, making a 67+ yard kick seem much more achievable.
    *   (↑ Small) The general, ongoing trend of improved kicker talent continues to apply upward pressure.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift dramatically upward. The prior mean of ~62.5 is no longer tenable. The new distribution should be centered significantly higher, likely in the 66-67 yard range, with a non-trivial probability mass on values exceeding the current 66-yard record.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any game played in Denver featuring a kicker with a strong leg (e.g., Brandon Aubrey, Jake Moody, Justin Tucker).
    *   Media reports of kickers hitting 68+ yard field goals in pre-game warmups.
    *   A close game involving a team with a top kicker reaching the opponent's 45-50 yard line with seconds left in a half.
    *   Games played in domes or with a significant, sustained tailwind.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Injuries to the league's premier long-distance kickers (e.g., Tucker, Aubrey, Little).
    *   A series of high-profile misses on 60+ yard attempts, potentially making coaches more risk-averse.
    *   Teams with top kickers playing remaining schedules primarily in cold-weather, outdoor stadiums (e.g., Buffalo, Green Bay, Chicago in December).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Stochastic Opportunity:** A record-breaking kick requires both the ability and the specific, rare game situation to attempt it. The league's strongest-legged kicker may not get a single opportunity all season.
*   **Small-N Problem:** We are forecasting a single data point (the maximum of a set) based on a historical trend derived from very few relevant events (kicks over 63 yards). This is inherently volatile.
*   **K-Ball Uncertainty:** The true impact of the K-ball rule is still a hypothesis. While plausible, its effect might be smaller than anticipated or may have already produced its maximum effect with the 65-yarder.
*   **Focus on the Mean vs. the Max:** Overall 50+ yard FG *percentage* not increasing (as noted in the background) is not strong evidence against the *maximum* distance increasing. The latter is a tail phenomenon driven by a few elite specialists under ideal conditions.

**Final Research Summary:** The 2025 season is operating under new conditions that favor longer kicks. An accelerating historical trend, a new rule allowing for "broken-in" balls, and two kicks of 64+ yards already this season strongly suggest the final longest field goal will be at least 65 yards, with a high probability of a new NFL record (67+ yards).

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the distribution of the longest field goals from the past decade (2015-2024), with a median of 61 yards and a range from 58 to 66 yards. The variance is significant due to the right-skewed nature of the data, with a few exceptional kicks stretching the distribution.
   - However, this base rate is rapidly becoming outdated due to recent trends in kicking performance, as evidenced by the increasing frequency of long kicks since 2021.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The base rate provides a historical context for the longest kicks, capturing the general capability of NFL kickers over the past decade.
   - Differences: The 2025 season has introduced new factors, such as the K-ball rule change and demonstrated potential for longer kicks (e.g., Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick), suggesting a shift in the distribution towards longer distances.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - A 65-yard field goal has already been made in the 2025 season, setting a high floor for the longest kick (↑ Large).
   - The K-ball rule change allows for better preparation with game balls, likely increasing maximum kick distances (↑ Large).
   - Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick indicates the potential for even longer kicks under game conditions (↑ Moderate).
   - The ongoing trend of improved kicker talent and biomechanics continues to push the boundaries of kicking distance (↑ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Centered around 62.5 yards with significant variance.
   - Evidence: The 65-yard kick and K-ball rule shift the distribution rightward, with the potential for a new record.
   - Posterior: The mean shifts to around 66-67 yards, with increased probability mass on values exceeding the current 66-yard record.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The small sample size and stochastic nature of record-breaking kicks mean predictions should account for variability.
   - Alternative scenario: If the K-ball rule has less impact than expected, or if key kickers are injured, the longest kick might not exceed 65 yards.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a record-breaking kick but maintain a realistic range given the uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles for the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season are as follows:
P10: 65
P20: 66
P40: 67
P60: 68
P80: 69
P90: 70

# Forecasting the Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two primary reference classes to establish my prior:

1. **Recent NFL Season Longest Field Goals (2015-2024)**:
   - Data points: 60, 58, 61, 63, 61, 65, 66, 62, 61, 62 yards
   - Mean: 61.9 yards
   - Median: 61.5 yards
   - Standard deviation: ~2.3 yards

2. **All 63+ Yard Field Goals in NFL History**:
   - 66 yards (2021)
   - 65 yards (2025)
   - 64 yards (2013, 2021, 2025)
   - 63 yards (1970, 1998, 2011, 2012, 2021, 2023)

I'm selecting these because they capture both the typical season maximum (first reference class) and the extreme tail events (second reference class). The first gives us a sense of central tendency, while the second helps understand the frequency of record-breaking kicks.

My prior distribution would be centered around 62 yards with a right skew, reflecting the historical pattern where most seasons top out in the low 60s, but with occasional outliers reaching mid-60s.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The fundamental physics of kicking hasn't changed
- The same stadiums (including altitude effects at Denver)
- Similar game situations that lead to long field goal attempts

**Key differences**:
1. **Rule change on kicking balls**: Teams can now practice with game balls all week, likely making them more broken-in and easier to kick for distance
2. **Accelerating trend**: 6 of the 11 kicks of 63+ yards in NFL history have occurred since 2021
3. **Early season floor**: A 65-yard field goal has already been made in the first four weeks of 2025
4. **Demonstrated potential**: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick shows the upper bound may be higher than previously thought
5. **Continued kicker specialization**: Kickers continue to improve technique and strength specifically for distance

These differences strongly suggest the distribution should shift rightward compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward**:
1. **65-yard field goal already made in 2025**: This establishes a floor for the season maximum. The likelihood ratio strongly favors outcomes ≥65 yards (essentially infinite for outcomes <65). This is the strongest piece of evidence.

2. **K-ball rule change**: The new rule allowing teams to practice with kicking balls all week is a structural change that should favor longer kicks. This evidence increases the likelihood of outcomes >66 yards by approximately 2-3x.

3. **Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick**: While not in a regular-season game, this demonstrates the physical possibility of kicks approaching 70 yards under game-like conditions. This increases the likelihood of outcomes in the 67-70 yard range by approximately 2x.

4. **Two 64+ yard kicks in first four weeks**: Having multiple very long kicks early in the season suggests conditions are favorable for extreme distance. This increases the likelihood of outcomes >66 yards by approximately 1.5x.

**Evidence pushing forecast downward**:
1. **No increase in 50+ yard percentage**: Through week 4, kickers aren't making a higher percentage of 50+ yard field goals compared to 2024. This slightly decreases the likelihood of outcomes >67 yards by perhaps 0.9x, but this is a weak signal for the maximum.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 62 yards with a standard deviation of ~2.3 yards:

**First update - 65-yard floor**:
- This truncates the distribution at 65 yards
- The posterior becomes a conditional distribution: P(X | X ≥ 65)
- This shifts the mean upward to approximately 66 yards

**Second update - K-ball rule change**:
- Applying a likelihood ratio of ~2.5x for outcomes >66 yards
- This further shifts the mean to approximately 66.5 yards
- It also increases the probability mass in the right tail (67-70 yards)

**Third update - Cam Little's 70-yard kick**:
- Applying a likelihood ratio of ~2x for outcomes in the 67-70 yard range
- This extends the right tail of the distribution
- The mean shifts slightly to ~66.7 yards
- The probability of a new NFL record (>66 yards) increases substantially

The posterior distribution is now centered around 66-67 yards, with significant probability mass in the 67-70 yard range, and a hard floor at 65 yards.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence**:
- I may be overweighting the significance of preseason kicks, which occur under less pressure
- The K-ball rule change might have already shown its full effect with the 65-yarder
- I might be underestimating the role of random chance - record kicks require specific game situations

**Alternative forecast**:
A more conservative forecast would argue that 65 yards will remain the season maximum because:
1. Most remaining games will be played in less favorable conditions (colder weather in later months)
2. The specific game situation for a 66+ yard attempt might not arise
3. The 65-yard kick might have been an outlier benefiting from perfect conditions

**Rebuttal**:
While these points have merit, they don't account for:
1. Multiple games still to be played in Denver's altitude
2. The demonstrated capability of kickers to hit from 67+ yards in practice
3. The strong upward trend in maximum distances

**Tail risk considerations**:
- Upper tail: A perfect storm of factors (Denver altitude + tailwind + end of half + elite kicker) could potentially produce a kick approaching 70 yards
- Lower tail: The 65-yarder could remain the season maximum if no similar opportunities arise

After this consideration, I'll slightly widen my uncertainty bands to account for these factors.

## 6. Final Percentiles

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is the longest field goal made in each of the last 10 NFL regular seasons (2015-2024). This provides a recent historical context for the maximum kicking distance in a season.

*   **Data (approximate):** 60, 58, 61, 63, 61, 65, 66, 62, 61, 62 yards.
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** This dataset has a median of 61.5 yards and a mean of 61.9 yards. The distribution is centered around 61-62 yards, with a tail extending to 66 yards. This prior suggests that in a typical recent season, the longest kick is around 62 yards, with roughly a 20% chance of reaching 65+ yards. However, this base rate must be viewed with caution as it reflects a period with a strong upward trend.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the 2015-2024 base case period due to several key factors:

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental mechanics of kicking, the presence of elite kickers, and the strategic situations that prompt long attempts (end of half/game) remain the same. The influence of favorable conditions like altitude (Denver) or domes persists.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Structural Rule Change:** A new rule for 2025 allows teams to practice with and "break in" the official kicking balls ("K-balls") all week. This is a significant departure from all prior seasons and is hypothesized to make the balls easier to kick for maximum distance.
    2.  **Accelerating Trend:** The trend of increasing kicking distance has accelerated dramatically. Four of the five longest kicks in history have occurred since 2021, and two of those have occurred in the first four weeks of this 2025 season.
    3.  **High Established Floor:** A 65-yard field goal has *already* been made this season. This truncates the entire lower end of the distribution. The question is no longer "what will the longest kick be?" but rather "by how much will the current 65-yard mark be surpassed?"

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several new pieces of evidence strongly suggest the final outcome will be higher than the base rate would predict.

*   **Evidence 1: 65-yard FG already made (through Week 4).** This is the single most important piece of information. It sets a hard floor for the final value at 65 yards. It provides extremely strong evidence that the 2025 environment is conducive to long kicks. (Likelihood: Massively shifts distribution upward, P(longest < 65) = 0).
*   **Evidence 2: New "K-ball" rule.** This provides a causal mechanism for why kicks might be traveling further in 2025. It suggests a systemic change affecting all kickers, pushing the entire distribution of potential distances to the right. (Likelihood: Increases probability of a new record, e.g., P(67+ yards) is 2-3x higher than in prior seasons).
*   **Evidence 3: Cam Little's 70-yard preseason FG.** While not an official kick, this serves as a crucial "proof of concept." It demonstrates that the physical potential of current kickers under the new conditions extends well beyond the current official record of 66 yards. This makes a 67, 68, or 69-yard kick seem much more plausible. (Likelihood: Fattens the upper tail of the distribution, making outcomes of 68+ yards more likely).
*   **Evidence 4: Two 64+ yard FGs in the first four weeks.** This corroborates the signal from the 65-yarder, indicating it wasn't an isolated fluke. The conditions in 2025 are repeatedly producing historic-level kicks. (Likelihood: Reinforces the upward shift of the entire distribution).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 62 yards, based on the 2015-2024 seasons.
*   **Update Step 1 (Hard Floor):** The observation of a 65-yard kick truncates the prior distribution. All probability mass for values less than 65 is eliminated and redistributed to values of 65 and above. The prior is now irrelevant; our new starting point is a distribution conditional on the result being ≥ 65.
*   **Update Step 2 (Likelihoods):** The K-ball rule and the 70-yard preseason kick act as strong evidence favoring a new record. They increase the relative likelihood of outcomes like 67, 68, and 69 compared to the outcome remaining at 65 or 66.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is entirely concentrated at 65 yards and above. The mode (most likely single outcome) is likely 65, as surpassing an already historic mark is difficult. However, the mean and median are pulled higher due to a significant probability of the record being broken. The distribution has a pronounced right skew, reflecting the non-trivial chance of a new record of 67 yards or more. My median is now around 66.5, indicating a slightly better than 50% chance the all-time record of 66 yards is broken.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The 65-yard kick was the pinnacle event of the season, occurring under a perfect confluence of factors that won't be replicated. The K-ball rule's effect might be marginal and already fully realized in that kick. For the rest of the season, coaches may become risk-averse, or key long-range kickers could be injured. In this plausible world, the final value remains 65. My distribution accounts for this by placing a significant amount of probability mass (around 35-40%) on the outcome being exactly 65.
*   **Overconfidence in Anecdotes:** Am I overweighting the 70-yard preseason kick? It wasn't under regular-season pressure. However, it serves as a physical demonstration of capability, which is a powerful signal. Combined with the two 64+ yard regular season kicks, it forms a consistent pattern.
*   **Stochasticity of Opportunity:** The main barrier to a new record isn't just ability, but opportunity. The right kicker needs to be in the right game situation (end of half, right yard line) in the right conditions (dome/altitude/wind). This is rare. However, with ~75% of the season remaining, the chances of such an opportunity arising are still substantial. My forecast, with a ~55% chance of a new record (≥67 yards), reflects a belief that such an opportunity is more likely than not to occur and be converted.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is anchored at the current season-long of 65 yards, but with a significant probability of that mark being surpassed and the all-time NFL record of 66 yards falling. The upper percentiles reflect the high ceiling demonstrated in the preseason.

P10: 65
P20: 65
P40: 66
P60: 67
P80: 68
P90: 69
