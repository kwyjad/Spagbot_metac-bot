### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the precise recent trend and volatility of the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) market share in Norway on a monthly basis?
    *   What are the key policy mechanisms and financial incentives/disincentives currently in effect, and are any changes anticipated before November 2025?
    *   What constitutes the remaining non-ZEV market? Who are these buyers and what vehicles are they purchasing?
    *   Are there any known supply-side factors (e.g., new model launches, import restrictions on non-ZEVs) that could influence the November figures?
    *   Are there seasonal patterns in Norwegian car registrations that might affect the ZEV percentage in November specifically?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `OFV bilsalget statistikk månedlig 2025` (OFV car sales statistics monthly 2025)
    *   `Norway electric vehicle market share October 2025`
    *   `Norwegian government budget 2026 electric car incentives`
    *   `Norway VAT exemption electric cars changes`
    *   `Top selling non-electric cars Norway 2025`
    *   `Norway commercial vehicle electrification rate`
    *   `Seasonality of car sales Norway OFV`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    The provided data establishes a clear, powerful trend. The ZEV share has moved from ~89% for the full year 2024 to a Q3 2025 average of approximately 97.5% (July: 97.2%, Aug: 96.9%, Sep: 98.3%). This indicates the market is in the final stages of transition, approaching the 100% target. The primary drivers are long-standing and potent government policies (tax exemptions for ZEVs, heavy taxes on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles). The remaining non-ZEV market is a sliver, likely composed of niche use cases (e.g., specific commercial vans, vehicles for remote areas) and a few enthusiast buyers. There is no indication of major policy reversals; in fact, the proximity to the 2025 deadline intensifies the political and social pressure to complete the transition. The key uncertainty is the month-to-month noise in this very small residual ICE market. A few dozen unexpected ICE registrations in a low-volume month could noticeably shift the percentage.

4.  **Drafting the Research Brief:**
    The following brief is structured according to the required format, synthesizing the above findings to inform the statistician's prior.

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Primary: Monthly ZEV Share in Norway (Q2-Q3 2025):** The most relevant reference class is the recent performance in the same market under identical policy conditions. The share has fluctuated in a narrow, high band.
    *   *Base Rate Range:* 96.5% - 98.5%.
    *   *Reasoning:* This range captures the recent monthly performance (Aug: 96.9%, Sep: 98.3%). It reflects the current state where the market is approaching saturation, but monthly volatility still exists.
*   **Secondary: Final-Stage Technology Adoption Curves:** This class describes systems approaching a 100% target. Typically, the rate of adoption slows as it nears the ceiling, as the remaining non-adopters are the most resistant or have unique barriers.
    *   *Base Rate Implication:* Suggests that achieving the final 1-3 percentage points is disproportionately difficult and may not follow a linear trend.
*   **Tertiary: Year-End Car Registration Patterns:** Car markets often exhibit year-end effects due to expiring incentives, model year changeovers, or sales targets.
    *   *Base Rate Implication:* This could either accelerate ZEV registrations (dealers pushing to meet goals) or see a small bump in non-ZEV registrations (last-chance purchases), introducing uncertainty.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-07-31:** ZEV share hits a record 97.2% for July. — ↑ — Demonstrates continued strong momentum and the market's capability to operate at very high ZEV penetration levels.
*   **2025-08-31:** ZEV share dips slightly to 96.9% for August. — ↓ — Highlights that month-to-month progress is not perfectly linear and minor pullbacks can occur, likely due to random variation in the small non-ZEV segment.
*   **2025-09-30:** ZEV share rebounds to a new record of 98.3% for September. — ↑ — A very strong signal that the underlying trend remains positive and the August dip was noise. This sets a new psychological and statistical benchmark.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Financial Incentives for ZEVs:** No purchase tax and VAT exemption (though now capped on the value above NOK 500,000) make ZEVs financially compelling. (Large positive driver)
*   **Punitive Taxation on ICE Vehicles:** High purchase taxes based on CO2 and NOx emissions make new fossil fuel cars prohibitively expensive for most buyers. (Large positive driver)
*   **The 2025 Political Goal:** The explicit parliamentary goal creates strong social norms and institutional pressure on importers, dealers, and public bodies to facilitate the final push to 100%. (Moderate positive driver)
*   **Shrinking Supply of non-ZEVs:** Importers and manufacturers are de-prioritizing the Norwegian ICE market, reducing model availability and effectively choking off supply. (Moderate positive driver)
*   **Residual Niche Demand:** A small segment of the market requires vehicles (e.g., certain heavy-duty 4x4s, specialized commercial vans) for which a ZEV equivalent is not yet available or suitable. (Small negative driver)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to the 100% Ceiling:** Unlike a year ago (at ~90%), the market is now operating at the asymptotic end of the adoption curve. Gains are harder to achieve and the dynamics are governed by the "last holdouts."
*   **Imminence of the 2025 Deadline:** With the year-end approaching, psychological and commercial pressure to hit the 100% target is at its absolute peak, which may influence dealer registration strategies in Q4.
*   **Minimal Non-ZEV Competition:** The number of non-ZEV models actively marketed and sold is drastically lower than in the reference period of the last 24 months. The choice for a non-ZEV buyer is extremely limited.
*   **Increased Data Granularity:** At >98% ZEV share, the percentage is highly sensitive to small absolute numbers of ICE registrations. A single fleet order of 50 non-ZEV vans could have a larger percentage impact than it would have two years ago.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the Q3 2025 average seems appropriate. Suggest a Beta distribution or a Normal distribution centered around **97.5%** with a standard deviation implying most of the mass is between 96% and 99% (equivalent n of ~20).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The September result of 98.3% is the most recent and strongest piece of evidence, suggesting the mean has shifted higher than the Q3 average.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The looming year-end and the political significance of the 2025 goal will likely cause a concerted push by manufacturers and dealers in the final months.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The "last mile" problem is real; the remaining 1-2% of the market represents the most difficult-to-convert use cases, creating a stubborn resistance level.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Random monthly volatility in a thin market. November could simply be a month where a few more niche ICE vehicles happen to be delivered.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward update from the 97.5% prior. The strength of the September data point and the political context should pull the posterior mean significantly higher, likely into the **98.0% to 99.0%** range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official OFV registration data for October 2025 (published early Nov) exceeding 98.3%.
    *   Major car importers announcing they will cease all non-ZEV imports before year-end.
    *   Government officials making strong public statements about ensuring the 2025 goal is met.
    *   High order intake reported for popular ZEV models for Q4 delivery.
*   **DOWN indicators:**

To forecast the percentage of zero-emission cars among Norwegian new car registrations during November 2025, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is selected from the recent monthly ZEV share in Norway during Q3 2025, which fluctuated between 96.9% and 98.3%. This range reflects the current state of the market nearing saturation with high ZEV penetration.
   - Mean/Median: 97.5%
   - Variance: Small, as the range is narrow (96.5% - 98.5%).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The current situation is similar to the reference distribution as the market continues to operate under the same policy conditions and incentives.
   - Difference: The proximity to the 100% target and the year-end deadline may increase efforts to push ZEV sales, potentially shifting the distribution slightly higher.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - September 2025 data shows a ZEV share of 98.3%, suggesting a strong upward trend.
   - The political and commercial pressure to meet the 2025 goal is a moderate positive driver.
   - The "last mile" problem and random monthly volatility are small negative drivers, indicating potential resistance and variability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Centered around 97.5% with a narrow spread.
   - Evidence: September's 98.3% and the political push suggest an upward shift.
   - Posterior Mean: Likely shifted to around 98.5% - 99.0%, with a slightly increased variance to account for potential volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The market is near saturation, but the final percentage points are challenging to achieve.
   - Tail risks: A sudden increase in non-ZEV registrations due to niche demand or unforeseen supply issues.
   - Alternative forecast: A scenario where the percentage remains around 97.5% due to persistent niche demand.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slightly wider range to account for these risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast percentiles are adjusted to reflect the evidence and potential variability.

P10: 97.2  
P20: 97.5  
P40: 98.0  
P60: 98.5  
P80: 98.8  
P90: 99.0

# Forecasting the Percentage of Zero-Emission Cars in Norwegian New Car Registrations (November 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the recent monthly ZEV market share in Norway as my primary reference distribution:
- July 2025: 97.2%
- August 2025: 96.9% 
- September 2025: 98.3%

This gives a mean of approximately 97.5% with a standard deviation of about 0.7 percentage points. This is an appropriate base rate because:
- It represents the most recent data from the same market under current policy conditions
- It captures the current state of a market approaching saturation
- It reflects the month-to-month volatility that still exists in this nearly-complete transition

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The same policy environment continues to exist (tax exemptions for ZEVs, heavy taxes on ICE vehicles)
- The market structure remains similar with limited non-ZEV options available
- The same social and political pressures toward electrification are present

**Differences from base rate:**
- November 2025 is closer to the year-end deadline, increasing pressure to meet the 100% goal
- Seasonal factors may affect November registrations differently than summer months
- The market is even further along the adoption curve, potentially making the final percentage points harder to achieve
- The most recent data point (September at 98.3%) suggests an accelerating trend

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
1. The September 2025 figure of 98.3% is the highest yet recorded, suggesting momentum is building (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher values)
2. The proximity to the year-end 2025 deadline creates stronger incentives for dealers and manufacturers to push ZEV sales (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring higher values)
3. The long-term trend is clearly upward, from 88.9% in 2024 to ~97.5% in Q3 2025 (likelihood ratio ~1.3:1 favoring higher values)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
1. The "last mile" problem - the remaining non-ZEV market likely represents the hardest-to-convert use cases (likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 favoring lower values)
2. Month-to-month volatility exists, as shown by the August dip to 96.9% (likelihood ratio ~1.1:1 favoring lower values)
3. November may have seasonal factors that could affect the mix of vehicles registered (likelihood ratio ~1.1:1 favoring lower values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 97.5% with a standard deviation of 0.7 percentage points, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - September data point:**
- Prior: Mean = 97.5%, SD = 0.7pp
- Evidence: September reached 98.3%, suggesting the trend is accelerating
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher values
- Posterior: Mean ≈ 98.0%, SD ≈ 0.6pp (narrower due to increased confidence)

**Second update - Proximity to deadline:**
- Prior: Mean = 98.0%, SD = 0.6pp
- Evidence: Increased pressure as 2025 deadline approaches
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring higher values
- Posterior: Mean ≈ 98.3%, SD ≈ 0.6pp

**Third update - "Last mile" resistance:**
- Prior: Mean = 98.3%, SD = 0.6pp
- Evidence: Remaining non-ZEV market represents hardest cases to convert
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring lower values
- Posterior: Mean ≈ 98.1%, SD ≈ 0.6pp

After these updates, my posterior distribution is centered around 98.1% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.6 percentage points.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the difficulty of reaching the final 1-2% of the market
- I haven't fully accounted for potential seasonal effects in November
- There could be supply chain issues affecting ZEV availability in late 2025
- I may be overconfident in the stability of the trend

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. A major push by the government and industry leads to near-100% ZEV registrations (99.5%+)
2. A batch of specialized commercial vehicles or fleet orders for non-ZEV vehicles could temporarily drop the percentage (to ~95%)
3. Economic factors or incentive changes could cause unexpected shifts in purchasing patterns

**Adjustments:**
- I should widen my uncertainty bands to account for these possibilities
- The distribution should be slightly left-skewed, as there's more room for downside surprises than upside (bounded at 100%)

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 96.8
P20: 97.3
P40: 98.0
P60: 98.5
P80: 99.0
P90: 99.3

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the distribution of monthly Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) market share for new passenger cars in Norway during the most recent period with stable policy conditions, which is Q3 2025.

*   **Reference Class:** Monthly ZEV market share in Norway, Q3 2025.
*   **Data:** July 2025 (97.2%), August 2025 (96.9%), September 2025 (98.3%).
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** The average for this period is approximately 97.5%. The month-to-month variation suggests a standard deviation of around 0.7 percentage points. Therefore, I will set my prior as a Normal distribution centered at **97.5%** with a standard deviation of **0.7%**. This implies that, before considering other factors, there's a roughly 95% chance the value would fall between 96.1% and 98.9%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast month, November 2025, is very similar to the Q3 2025 base case in terms of the fundamental policy drivers (strong ZEV incentives, punitive ICE taxes). However, there are critical differences:

*   **Trend:** The data shows a clear upward trend, not a stationary process. The September figure of 98.3% is substantially higher than the Q3 average, suggesting the underlying mean is shifting upwards.
*   **Proximity to Deadline:** November is one of the final months of the year for which the Norwegian parliament set its 100% ZEV goal. This creates exceptional political, social, and commercial pressure on importers and dealers to maximize ZEV registrations and minimize any remaining ICE vehicle sales. This is a significant factor not fully present in mid-Q3.
*   **Asymptotic Slowdown:** The market is approaching 100% saturation. This is the "last mile" of the technology adoption S-curve, where the remaining non-adopters are often the most difficult to convert due to niche needs (e.g., specific commercial vehicle types) or strong preferences. This creates a powerful headwind preventing a smooth, linear progression to 100%.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their likely impact on the prior distribution.

*   **September 2025 result (98.3%):** This is the most recent and most important data point. It is more than one standard deviation above my prior mean of 97.5%. This is strong evidence that the true mean for Q4 is higher than the Q3 average. This evidence strongly pushes the entire distribution upwards.
*   **The 2025 Year-End Goal:** This is a powerful causal mechanism. It creates a concerted push from government, importers, and dealers. This makes outcomes higher than the recent trend more likely and outcomes lower than the recent trend less likely. It suggests a strong upward shift in the mean for the final months of the year.
*   **Residual Niche Demand (The "Last Mile"):** This is a causal mechanism pushing downwards. The existence of a small, hard-to-convert segment of the market makes achieving the final few percentage points difficult. This makes extremely high outcomes (e.g., >99.5%) less likely and compresses the right tail of the distribution, introducing a left skew.
*   **Monthly Volatility:** The dip from 97.2% in July to 96.9% in August, despite the strong trend, shows that random noise is a factor. Because the non-ZEV market is so small in absolute numbers, a single fleet order can cause a noticeable percentage swing. This evidence argues for maintaining a reasonable variance in the forecast and not having an overly narrow range.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Normal distribution with a mean of 97.5% and a standard deviation of 0.7%.
*   **Updating Step:** The strong September result (98.3%) and the intense pressure of the year-end goal are the dominant new pieces of information. They compel a significant upward revision of the central tendency. I will shift the center of my distribution from the Q3 average of 97.5% to a point above the September result, reflecting the expected continuation of the trend for two more months (October and November). I estimate the new median to be around **98.5%**.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The "last mile" problem acts as a soft ceiling, making it harder to achieve each additional tenth of a percent. This will compress the upper tail of the distribution, creating a left skew (mean slightly lower than the median). The potential for random monthly noise, as seen in the August dip, means the lower tail should still have significant mass. My posterior will therefore be centered around 98.5% but with a wider tail to the left than to the right.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider how this forecast could be wrong.

*   **Overconfidence in the Trend:** Am I putting too much weight on the single data point from September and the narrative of a "final push"? Perhaps September was a positive outlier, and the market will revert closer to the 97.5% mean. While possible, the combination of the data trend and the powerful causal drivers makes this less likely. The risk is real, however, and justifies keeping the lower percentiles (P10, P20) reasonably low.
*   **Underestimating the "Last Mile" Problem:** The remaining 1.7% of the market (as of September) might be a "brick wall" of demand that cannot be electrified with current technology (e.g., specialized vehicles). If so, the market might plateau, and my upper percentiles (P80, P90) could be too high. I've tried to account for this by capping my P90 at 99.2%, which represents a significant but not total erosion of the remaining ICE market.
*   **A "Last Chance" Rush for ICE vehicles:** Could there be a small surge of buyers trying to get the last available ICE models before they are gone? This seems unlikely given the punitive tax regime and shrinking supply, but it's a possibility that supports keeping the lower tail of the distribution intact.

After red-teaming, I believe my median of 98.5% is sound. I will slightly widen the lower end of my distribution to better account for the volatility risk, setting my P10 at 97.4%, which would represent a significant negative shock.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast reflects a distribution centered around 98.5%, with a left skew due to the difficulty of reaching 100%, and tails that account for both the strong upward momentum and the possibility of random monthly volatility.

P10: 97.4
P20: 97.8
P40: 98.3
P60: 98.7
P80: 99.0
P90: 99.2
