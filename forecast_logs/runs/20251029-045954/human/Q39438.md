### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: Statutory Interpretation of IEEPA:** What are the strongest textual and structural arguments for and against the President's authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA? Specifically, does "regulate... any... importation" include the power to set tariffs? Does the statute's overall purpose (sanctions, asset freezes) limit this interpretation? What is the legal weight of the "deal with" requirement?
*   **Q2: Supreme Court Jurisprudence on Executive Power:** How has the current Supreme Court, particularly its 6-3 conservative majority, ruled on cases involving broad delegations of authority to the executive branch? Are doctrines like the Major Questions Doctrine or non-delegation doctrine likely to be invoked? How does the Court balance executive power in foreign affairs/national security against clear congressional authority (like tariffs)?
*   **Q3: Precedent and Analogs:** How have courts previously interpreted IEEPA? How does this case compare to litigation over other statutes used to impose tariffs, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962? Are there key differences that make this case stronger or weaker for the government?
*   **Q4: Judicial Ideology and Voting Blocs:** How are individual justices likely to approach this question? Which justices are most skeptical of executive overreach (e.g., Gorsuch)? Who is most deferential (e.g., Alito in national security contexts)? Is there a plausible path to a 5-vote majority for any specific outcome (lawful, unlawful, mixed)?
*   **Q5: The Nature of the "Emergency":** How will the Court view the declared emergencies? Is a trade deficit an "unusual and extraordinary threat" in the sense meant by IEEPA? Is the nexus between tariffs on all goods from Mexico/Canada/China and the threat of drug trafficking sufficiently direct to satisfy the "deal with" requirement?

**2. Proposed Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `"International Emergency Economic Powers Act" statutory text analysis`, `IEEPA legislative history tariffs`, `"deal with" requirement IEEPA case law`, `Dames & Moore v. Regan IEEPA analysis`
*   **Q2:** `Supreme Court "major questions doctrine" cases`, `West Virginia v. EPA analysis`, `Gundy v. United States nondelegation`, `Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer Zone 2 analysis`, `Supreme Court deference to president foreign affairs`
*   **Q3:** `IEEPA litigation history`, `Section 232 tariffs court challenges`, `Comparing IEEPA and Section 232 authority`
*   **Q4:** `Justice Gorsuch on executive power`, `Chief Justice Roberts administrative state jurisprudence`, `SCOTUS 6-3 majority voting patterns executive power`
*   **Q5:** `IEEPA "unusual and extraordinary threat" definition`, `legal standard for nexus under IEEPA`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The core of the case is a statutory interpretation question viewed through the lens of separation of powers. The government's argument rests on a broad reading of IEEPA's text, granting the President sweeping power to regulate commerce during an emergency. The challengers' argument is that this reading violates the statute's context, history, and constitutional structure, which reserves the power to tax and tariff to Congress. The current Supreme Court has shown significant skepticism towards broad claims of executive authority, especially in areas of major economic and political significance (the Major Questions Doctrine). The unanimity of the lower courts, though on slightly different grounds, creates a strong presumption against the government's position. The "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits appear particularly vulnerable, as this justification strays far from IEEPA's national security origins. The "trafficking tariffs" have a slightly more plausible national security nexus, opening the door for a "Mixed ruling," but still face the fundamental question of whether IEEPA authorizes tariffs at all.

**4. Draft of Comprehensive Answer:**

***

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Supreme Court Cases on Presidential Power vs. Congress:** In landmark cases where the President asserts broad authority in a domain traditionally controlled by Congress without explicit statutory permission (e.g., *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*), the President tends to lose. **Base rate for President's actions being found unlawful: 60-70%.**
2.  **Recent "Major Questions Doctrine" Cases:** In recent years, when the Supreme Court has applied the Major Questions Doctrine (or similar reasoning) to strike down executive agency actions of vast economic and political significance not explicitly authorized by Congress (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*), the executive branch has consistently lost. **Base rate for executive action being found unlawful: 75-85%.**
3.  **Supreme Court Review of Unanimous Circuit Rulings:** While the Supreme Court often reverses circuit courts, it is less common when there is broad agreement among lower courts on the outcome (even if reasoning differs). This case features uniform lower court rejection of the tariffs. This suggests a lower-than-average probability of reversal. **Base rate for affirming the lower courts (i.e., "Tariffs unlawful"): 65-75%.**

Limitations: These are imperfect analogs. IEEPA grants explicit emergency powers, distinguishing it from cases where the President acts with no statutory basis. However, the *scope* of the asserted power is the central issue, making these reference classes highly relevant.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari on an expedited schedule. — **(↑ Unlawful/Mixed)** — Signals the Court sees an urgent need to resolve the issue, likely to curb a massive assertion of executive power causing economic disruption. Reduces the chance of "No 2025 ruling."
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms the Court of International Trade ruling against the tariffs in a 7-4 decision. — **(↑ Unlawful)** — A powerful appellate court, specializing in trade, found the tariffs exceeded IEEPA authority. This creates a strong headwind for the government at SCOTUS.
*   **2025-06-17** Plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* petition for certiorari before judgment. — **(↑ Unlawful/Mixed)** — Indicates plaintiffs' confidence in their legal arguments and the urgent need for a final resolution, which they believe will be in their favor.
*   **2025-05-28** Two different federal courts (*V.O.S. Selections* and *Learning Resources*) rule the tariffs unlawful on different grounds. — **(↑ Unlawful)** — Demonstrates that the government's position is weak from multiple legal angles—both on the scope of IEEPA power generally and on the specifics of its application here.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's increasing tendency to require explicit congressional authorization for executive actions with vast economic and political impact. This is a powerful tool to strike down the tariffs. **(Large impact, favors "Unlawful")**
*   **Textualism/Statutory Interpretation:** The debate over whether IEEPA's text ("regulate...importation") implicitly includes the power to impose tariffs, a power traditionally seen as distinct. A narrow, textualist reading likely disfavors the government. **(Large impact, favors "Unlawful")**
*   **Separation of Powers/Non-Delegation Doctrine:** Concern that allowing the President to impose tariffs under a general emergency statute would represent a massive transfer of Congress's core constitutional power of the purse. **(Large impact, favors "Unlawful")**
*   **National Security Deference:** The Court's historical tendency to defer to the President on matters of national security and foreign affairs. The government will frame the tariffs (especially the trafficking ones) in these terms. **(Moderate impact, favors "Lawful" or "Mixed")**
*   **Severability:** The possibility that the Court could analyze the "reciprocal tariffs" and the "trafficking tariffs" separately. The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible (though still contested) link to a national emergency, creating a path to a "Mixed ruling." **(Moderate impact, favors "Mixed")**
*   **Lower Court Consensus:** The fact that multiple judges across multiple courts, appointed by both parties, have ruled against the administration provides persuasive authority and momentum against the tariffs. **(Moderate impact, favors "Unlawful")**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions (e.g., freezing assets), this is a novel application to impose broad, revenue-generating tariffs on entire countries, including key allies. This stretch makes it easier for the Court to reject.
*   **Economic vs. Traditional Security Threat:** The justification for the "reciprocal tariffs" (trade deficits) is purely economic, not a traditional national security threat. This significantly weakens the government's case for judicial deference.
*   **Current Court's Skepticism of the Administrative State:** The current 6-3 conservative majority is arguably the most skeptical of broad executive authority in generations. This political/judicial context is highly unfavorable to the government's position compared to historical reference points.
*   **Expedited Timeline:** The case is on a rocket docket. This speed suggests the Court is not looking for an off-ramp but intends to issue a decisive ruling on the merits before the end of the year, making "No 2025 ruling" highly unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the reference classes would center on **"Tariffs unlawful" (~70%)**, with smaller probabilities for "Mixed ruling" (~15%), "Tariffs lawful" (~10%), and "Other/No ruling" (~5%). This reflects a moderately strong belief (equivalent n≈15) that the Court will reject this assertion of executive power.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   The novel and broad application of IEEPA to tariffs is a major stretch. **(↑ Unlawful, large)**
    *   The current Court's established skepticism of executive overreach via the Major Questions Doctrine strongly aligns with the challengers' arguments. **(↑ Unlawful, large)**
    *   The unanimity of lower court rulings against the tariffs provides significant momentum. **(

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Based on historical cases where the Supreme Court has ruled against broad executive powers without explicit Congressional authorization, especially under the Major Questions Doctrine, the base rate is approximately 70%.
- **Mixed ruling**: Considering the possibility of the Court distinguishing between different types of tariffs (reciprocal vs. trafficking), the base rate is around 15%.
- **Tariffs lawful**: Given the current Court's skepticism towards broad executive authority, especially in economic matters, the base rate is about 10%.
- **Other ruling**: Historically, the Supreme Court rarely issues rulings that do not address the merits in high-profile cases like this, so the base rate is 3%.
- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule and the urgency of the issue, the base rate is 2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves a broad assertion of executive power, similar to past cases where the Court has ruled against such assertions.
- **Differences**: The IEEPA provides explicit emergency powers, which could be seen as a distinguishing factor. However, the scope of the power asserted (imposing broad tariffs) is unprecedented.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unanimous lower court rulings against tariffs**: Strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful, increasing the likelihood of "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Major Questions Doctrine**: The Court's recent application of this doctrine suggests a high likelihood of ruling against broad executive actions without clear Congressional authorization.
- **National security argument for trafficking tariffs**: Provides some likelihood for a "Mixed ruling," as the Court may find a plausible national security nexus.
- **Expedited Supreme Court review**: Suggests urgency and a likelihood of ruling on the merits, decreasing the probability of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Prior odds of 70% increase with strong evidence from lower court rulings and the Major Questions Doctrine.
- **Mixed ruling**: Prior odds of 15% increase slightly due to the national security argument for trafficking tariffs.
- **Tariffs lawful**: Prior odds of 10% decrease due to strong evidence against broad executive power.
- **Other ruling**: Prior odds of 3% remain low due to the nature of the case.
- **No 2025 ruling**: Prior odds of 2% decrease further due to the expedited schedule.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consideration of overconfidence: The strong evidence against the tariffs being lawful could lead to overconfidence in the "Tariffs unlawful" outcome. However, the possibility of a "Mixed ruling" should not be underestimated.
- Alternative scenarios: A "Mixed ruling" is plausible if the Court distinguishes between different types of tariffs based on their national security justification.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 75%  
Mixed ruling: 15%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%

```

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 65%)**
- In cases where the President asserts broad authority in a domain traditionally controlled by Congress (like tariffs), the executive branch tends to lose (60-70% of cases).
- Recent Supreme Court cases applying the Major Questions Doctrine to strike down executive actions of vast economic significance show a 75-85% rate of finding such actions unlawful.
- When lower courts unanimously reject an executive action (as here), the Supreme Court affirms those rulings 65-75% of the time.

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 20%)**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases.
- There are two distinct types of tariffs at issue (trafficking and reciprocal), creating a natural path for differentiation.
- Historical cases show the Court sometimes upholds executive authority in national security contexts while limiting it in purely economic ones.

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 10%)**
- The Court has occasionally deferred to presidential authority in foreign affairs/national security.
- IEEPA explicitly grants emergency powers, unlike some other cases where executive overreach was found.

**Other ruling (Prior: 3%)**
- Procedural dismissals or non-merits rulings are relatively rare in high-profile cases granted expedited review.

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 2%)**
- The expedited schedule (argument in November 2025) makes a 2025 ruling highly likely.
- The Court specifically granted certiorari on an expedited basis, signaling urgency.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major questions cases, this involves an executive branch stretching a statute to claim vast economic power.
- Like other separation of powers cases, it involves tension between Congress's constitutional authority over tariffs and the President's foreign affairs powers.
- The lower court unanimity against the tariffs matches cases where SCOTUS typically affirms.

**Key differences:**
- IEEPA explicitly grants emergency powers, unlike some other cases where executive overreach was found.
- The dual justification (drug trafficking vs. trade deficits) creates a more complex case than typical binary executive power disputes.
- The economic scale is massive - tariffs on major trading partners affect the entire economy.
- The current 6-3 conservative Court is particularly skeptical of broad administrative authority.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 90% - Very likely to see unanimous lower court rejection if the tariffs are truly unlawful
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 10% - Highly unlikely all lower courts would reject if the tariffs were lawful
- Likelihood ratio: 9:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 2: Two distinct types of tariffs with different justifications**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = 80% - Having distinct tariff types with different justifications creates a natural path for a mixed ruling
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 50% - Even with different justifications, all could be found unlawful
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 50% - Even with different justifications, all could be found lawful
- Likelihood ratio: Favors "Mixed ruling" over both uniform outcomes

**Evidence 3: Current Court's jurisprudence on executive power**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = 80% - The current Court has consistently limited executive power in major economic cases
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = 20% - The Court rarely upholds broad executive authority without clear statutory basis
- Likelihood ratio: 4:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence 4: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 5% - Very unlikely the Court would expedite only to delay ruling
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = 95% - Highly likely given the expedited schedule
- Likelihood ratio: 19:1 favoring a 2025 ruling over no ruling

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on the unanimous lower court rulings:

Prior odds (Tariffs unlawful) = 65:35 = 1.86:1
Likelihood ratio = 9:1
Posterior odds = 1.86 × 9 = 16.74:1
Posterior probability = 16.74/(1+16.74) ≈ 94%

This seems too high given uncertainty, so let's adjust for the distinct tariff types:

Prior odds (Mixed ruling vs. Tariffs unlawful) = 20:65 = 0.31:1
Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.6:1 (80:50)
Posterior odds = 0.31 × 1.6 = 0.496:1
Relative posterior probabilities: Mixed ≈ 33%, Unlawful ≈ 67%

Adjusting our distribution based on all evidence:
- "Tariffs unlawful" remains most likely but should be reduced from 94%
- "Mixed ruling" increases substantially due to the distinct tariff types
- "Tariffs lawful" remains low but not zero given IEEPA's explicit emergency powers
- "No 2025 ruling" becomes extremely unlikely given the expedited schedule

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to the President on national security matters, especially regarding drug trafficking.
- The Court could surprise by finding creative statutory interpretations that weren't considered by lower courts.
- I might be overweighting the Major Questions Doctrine, which some justices (Thomas, Alito) have criticized.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could rule on narrower grounds than expected, focusing on the specific application rather than IEEPA's overall scope.
- The Court might split the tariffs not just on type (trafficking vs. reciprocal) but on country (e.g., China vs. allies).
- A procedural ruling is more likely than I initially estimated if the Court wants to avoid the political implications.

**Adjustments:**
- Increase "Mixed ruling" probability given the natural division between tariff types
- Slightly increase "Other ruling" to account for the Court potentially seeking narrower grounds
- Slightly decrease "Tariffs unlawful" to avoid overconfidence

## 6. Final Normalization

After all considerations, my final probability distribution:

Tariffs unlawful: 58%  
Mixed ruling: 27%  
Tariffs lawful: 8%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%  
(sum 100%)

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 58%
Mixed ruling: 27%
Tariffs lawful: 8%
Other ruling: 5%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use three reference classes:

1.  **Major Separation-of-Powers Cases:** In landmark cases where the President asserts broad authority in a domain traditionally belonging to Congress (like taxation/tariffs) without explicit statutory authorization (*e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*), the President's actions are typically found unlawful. This suggests a base rate of **~65% for "Tariffs unlawful."**
2.  **Recent Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** The current Supreme Court has consistently used the MQD to strike down executive actions of vast economic and political significance that are not clearly authorized by Congress (*e.g., West Virginia v. EPA*). This is a highly relevant modern doctrine. The base rate for the executive action being struck down in such cases is very high, perhaps **~80% for "Tariffs unlawful."**
3.  **Supreme Court Affirmance of Lower Courts:** The Supreme Court affirms lower court decisions more often than it reverses them. When multiple lower courts, including a specialized appellate court, reach the same outcome, the odds of affirmance increase. This suggests a base rate of **~70% for affirming the lower courts**, which would mean a ruling of "Tariffs unlawful."

Averaging these perspectives, I will set my initial prior probability (P(H)) heavily in favor of the tariffs being struck down.
*   **Prior for Tariffs unlawful:** ~70%
*   **Prior for Mixed ruling:** ~15% (Acknowledging the possibility of severability)
*   **Prior for Tariffs lawful:** ~10%
*   **Prior for Other/No ruling:** ~5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** This case fits the reference classes well. It involves a massive assertion of executive power (imposing tariffs on nearly all trade) in a core congressional domain (commerce and revenue), triggering separation-of-powers concerns. The justification for the "reciprocal tariffs" (trade deficits) is an economic issue of vast significance, making it a prime candidate for MQD analysis.
*   **Differences:** Unlike *Youngstown*, the President is acting under a specific statute, the IEEPA. The core question is one of statutory interpretation, not inherent authority. However, the interpretation sought by the administration is so broad and novel (applying IEEPA for general tariffs) that it functions like a claim of new power. The existence of two distinct sets of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) creates a possibility for a split decision not present in a single-issue case, making the "Mixed ruling" option more plausible than in a typical case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate several key pieces of evidence from the background information:

*   **E1: Two different sets of tariffs.** The "reciprocal tariffs" are based on an economic justification (trade deficits), while the "trafficking tariffs" are based on a more traditional national security justification (drug cartels).
    *   **P(E1 | Mixed ruling):** Very high. This is the factual predicate for a mixed ruling.
    *   **P(E1 | Unlawful):** High. The Court could find both justifications insufficient or the tariff power absent from IEEPA entirely.
    *   **P(E1 | Lawful):** Low. The Court would have to find the extremely broad "trade deficit" justification valid, which is unlikely.
    *   *Effect:* This evidence significantly increases the probability of a "Mixed ruling" relative to a clean "Tariffs lawful" outcome.

*   **E2: Unanimous lower court outcomes.** Two different federal courts, and a 7-4 majority in the specialized Federal Circuit, ruled the tariffs unlawful.
    *   **P(E2 | Unlawful):** High. This is the expected precursor to an affirmance.
    *   **P(E2 | Lawful):** Very low. This would require the Supreme Court to find that multiple lower courts, including specialists, were fundamentally wrong.
    *   *Effect:* This is strong evidence against "Tariffs lawful" and provides momentum for "Tariffs unlawful."

*   **E3: The current Supreme Court's jurisprudence.** The 6-3 conservative majority has shown consistent skepticism of broad executive authority on major policy questions (the MQD).
    *   **P(E3 | Unlawful):** Very high. The challengers' arguments align perfectly with this judicial trend.
    *   **P(E3 | Lawful):** Very low. This would require the Court to reverse its recent jurisprudential direction.
    *   *Effect:* This is arguably the strongest piece of evidence, pushing probabilities heavily toward "Unlawful" and "Mixed," and away from "Lawful."

*   **E4: Expedited Supreme Court review.** The Court granted certiorari and scheduled arguments for November 2025.
    *   **P(E4 | No 2025 ruling):** Extremely low. An expedited schedule for a November argument makes a decision by December 31, 2025, highly probable.
    *   **P(E4 | Other ruling):** Low. The speed indicates the Court's intent to decide the case on its merits due to its national importance, making a procedural dismissal unlikely.
    *   *Effect:* This evidence allows me to shift probability mass away from "No 2025 ruling" and "Other ruling" and into the merits-based outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through a conceptual update.

*   **Prior Odds (Unlawful vs. Not Unlawful):** 70:30, or 2.33:1.
*   **Evidence:** The combination of the lower court consensus (E2) and the current Court's MQD jurisprudence (E3) is extremely powerful. The likelihood ratio P(E2 & E3 | Unlawful) / P(E2 & E3 | Not Unlawful) is very large, let's say conservatively 4:1.
*   **Posterior Odds:** 2.33 * 4 = 9.32:1.
*   **Posterior Probability (Unlawful):** 9.32 / (1 + 9.32) ≈ 90%.

This initial update suggests a very high probability of the tariffs being found unlawful in some way. Now, I must distribute that 90% between a complete loss for the government ("Unlawful") and a partial loss ("Mixed"). The existence of two distinct tariff types (E1) makes the "Mixed" option a plausible off-ramp for a Court seeking a narrow, compromise ruling. The trafficking tariffs have a stronger (though still weak) national security nexus, which some justices might find sufficient. Therefore, I will allocate a significant portion of the "Not Lawful" probability to the "Mixed" outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis points heavily toward the government losing. The strongest counterargument is that a "Mixed ruling" is being underestimated. The Court, particularly Chief Justice Roberts, often seeks narrow rulings that avoid sweeping changes. Striking down the reciprocal tariffs (a clear overreach) while upholding the trafficking tariffs (giving deference to the executive on national security) would be a classic judicial compromise. This would rein in the President's most extreme action while preserving IEEPA as a tool for national security emergencies. The trafficking tariffs are more defensible, and a Court majority might coalesce around upholding them while making a strong statement against using IEEPA for general economic policy. This scenario is plausible enough that I will assign it a substantial probability, pulling down the probability of a complete "Unlawful" ruling. The chance of "Tariffs lawful" remains near zero, as the reciprocal tariffs are almost certainly doomed.

### 6. Final Normalization

Based on the reasoning above, I will finalize my probabilities.

*   **Tariffs unlawful (65%):** This remains the most likely single outcome. The Court could rule that IEEPA does not grant tariff authority at all, or that both emergency declarations were invalid, leading to a complete victory for the challengers. This aligns with the lower courts and the Court's skepticism of executive overreach.
*   **Mixed ruling (30%):** This is the most plausible alternative. The Court could sever the two tariff policies, striking down the economically-justified "reciprocal tariffs" under the Major Questions Doctrine while deferring to the President's national security judgment on the "trafficking tariffs."
*   **Tariffs lawful (2%):** This is a tail-risk scenario. It would require the Court to endorse an exceptionally broad view of presidential power that runs contrary to its recent jurisprudence.
*   **Other ruling (2%):** A procedural dismissal is unlikely given the expedited review and national importance of the case.
*   **No 2025 ruling (1%):** With arguments in November 2025, a decision before January 1, 2026, is almost certain.

The probabilities sum to 100%.
