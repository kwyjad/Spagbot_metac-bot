### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the historical precedent for selecting COP hosts, especially within the Western European and Others Group (WEOG)? How often do stalemates occur, and how are they resolved?
    *   What are the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the Australian and Turkish bids? This includes their climate policy credibility, diplomatic leverage within WEOG, and the narrative appeal of their proposals.
    *   What does the requirement for "consensus" within WEOG imply? Which members or sub-blocs (e.g., EU, Umbrella Group) hold the most sway, and what are their likely preferences?
    *   What is the probability of the failure state, i.e., no consensus being reached, leading to a default host location in Bonn, Germany?
    *   What recent events (in the last 6-12 months) have materially shifted the odds for either candidate or the default option?

2.  **Proposed Search Queries:**
    *   `UNFCCC COP host selection process WEOG`
    *   `history of contested COP host bids`
    *   `COP host selection consensus rule`
    *   `Australia COP31 bid support WEOG members`
    *   `Turkey COP31 bid support EU statement`
    *   `Australia Nationally Determined Contribution 2035 UNFCCC`
    *   `Turkey climate policy commitments Paris Agreement`
    *   `"stalemate" "COP31" Australia Turkey`
    *   `UNFCCC default host Bonn precedent`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The core of the issue is a diplomatic stalemate. The selection process requires consensus, meaning any single WEOG member can effectively veto a bid.
    *   Australia has built a very strong case based on two pillars: high climate ambition (evidenced by its new, aggressive 2035 NDC) and a compelling narrative (co-hosting with climate-vulnerable Pacific Island nations). This aligns well with the stated goals of the Paris Agreement.
    *   Turkey's bid appears to be more conventional. While it is a credible host, its primary leverage is its ability to block Australia's bid to force a negotiation. Its geopolitical relationships within WEOG, particularly with the EU, are complex and can be a source of friction.
    *   The stalemate itself is a key piece of evidence. The longer it persists, the higher the probability of the default outcome (Bonn, Germany). The decision was expected earlier and has been delayed, as noted in the sources.
    *   Recent events, particularly Australia's formal submission of an ambitious NDC in September 2025, significantly strengthen its diplomatic hand. It allows Australia to frame its bid as being about climate action, not just logistics.

4.  **Drafting the Research Brief:**
    The synthesized information will now be structured into the required format for the forecasting panel.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Contested COP Host Selections (Global):** In recent years, regional group consensus has become more fraught with geopolitical tension. The Eastern European Group's selection for COP29 was deadlocked by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, eventually leading to a compromise candidate (Azerbaijan). This suggests that when major geopolitical rifts exist within a group, stalemates are plausible (~10-20% chance of a non-obvious/compromise outcome).
*   **WEOG Host Selections:** The Western European and Others Group (WEOG) is diverse but generally cohesive on climate issues. Contested bids are rare, and a public stalemate lasting this long is highly unusual. Historically, a WEOG host is selected smoothly (>90% of the time).
*   **Default to Bonn, Germany:** The provision for the conference to default to Bonn if no consensus is reached is a known failure state. It has been threatened but has very rarely, if ever, been invoked for a full COP. This is a tail risk, with a historical base rate of <5%. However, the existence of a public stalemate elevates this probability significantly compared to the historical average.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-06-26] Bonn Climate Conference concludes — neutral — The mid-year technical conference proceeded as normal, but no public breakthrough on the COP31 host was announced, confirming the stalemate was ongoing.
*   [2025-08-14] News reports confirm stalemate — ↓ Australia/Turkey, ↑ Germany — Public acknowledgement of the diplomatic stalemate increases the perceived probability of the default (Bonn) scenario as the deadline approaches.
*   [2025-09-02] Panel discussion highlights Australia's bid — ↑ Australia (small) — Reinforces the seriousness and narrative strength of Australia's bid, keeping it in the public eye and framing it around Pacific partnership.
*   [2025-09-12] Australia submits ambitious 2035 NDC — ↑ Australia (large) — This is a major, credible action. It provides Australia with significant diplomatic leverage and frames their hosting bid as a commitment to climate leadership.
*   [2025-10-13] Australian gov't details Net Zero Plan — ↑ Australia (small) — Adds substantive detail to the NDC, further bolstering Australia's credibility and demonstrating follow-through on its climate commitments.
*   [2025-10-28] UNFCCC report praises new NDCs — ↑ Australia (moderate) — Independent validation from the UNFCCC that Australia's plan is a serious contribution lends international credibility and strengthens its moral case to host.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Climate Ambition as Leverage:** A country's demonstrated climate commitment (especially via its NDC) is a powerful tool in negotiations. High ambition can attract support from climate-progressive nations. (Size: Large)
*   **WEOG Consensus Rule:** The requirement for unanimity gives Turkey veto power, regardless of the merits of Australia's bid. This turns the decision into a diplomatic negotiation, not just a technical evaluation. (Size: Large)
*   **Narrative and Moral Authority:** Australia's proposal to co-host with Pacific Island nations is a novel and potent narrative. It frames the bid around climate justice, which resonates strongly with many UNFCCC parties. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Geopolitical Alliances:** Support from major blocs like the European Union or key players like the United States is critical. Turkey's complex relationship with the EU could be a hindrance. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Risk of "Mutually Assured Destruction":** If neither side backs down, the outcome is Bonn. This creates pressure on both parties to find a compromise, as a default is a "loss" for both bidders. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Public Stalemate:** Unlike typical host selections that are resolved quietly, this contest is a known, public stalemate, which is highly unusual for the typically aligned WEOG.
*   **Co-Host with Another Region:** Australia's bid to co-host with Pacific Island nations (from the Asia-Pacific Group) is a significant departure from the standard single-country, single-region hosting model.
*   **Explicit Linkage of Bid to NDC:** The Australian government has explicitly and successfully timed its ambitious NDC submission to bolster its COP31 bid, making climate policy a central pillar of its campaign.
*   **Geopolitical Outlier within WEOG:** Turkey's position within WEOG is unique. It is not part of the EU or the Umbrella Group (a key negotiating bloc including Australia, the US, Canada), making it more of a geopolitical free agent and complicating consensus.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible, weak prior given two official bids and a default option might be: Australia 45%, Turkey 40%, Germany 10%, Other 5%. This reflects a slight edge for Australia's stronger initial proposal but acknowledges Turkey's blocking power. (Equivalent n ≈ 3).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large) Australia's ambitious and well-received 2035 NDC submission.
    *   ↑ (Moderate) The powerful and unique narrative of co-hosting with Pacific nations.
    *   ↓ (Moderate) The persistence of the stalemate, which erodes the probability of *either* candidate succeeding and increases the "Germany" outcome.
    *   ↓ (Small) Turkey's lack of a competing high-ambition climate announcement or similarly compelling narrative.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence strongly favors Australia over Turkey. The posterior for Australia should increase significantly, primarily by drawing probability from Turkey. The probability for Germany should also be nudged slightly upward from the prior due to the confirmed stalemate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Australia):**
    *   Public statements of support for Australia's bid from major WEOG members (e.g., the EU presidency, US, Canada).
    *   Reports of high-level diplomatic talks between Australia and Turkey, suggesting a deal is being brokered.
    *   Turkey announcing a bid for a future COP (e.g., COP36), indicating a concession.
    *   Leaked drafts from pre-COP30 meetings showing Australia as the presumptive host.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Australia):**
    *   A formal announcement from the UNFCCC or WEOG chair that consensus has not been reached.
    *   Public statements from Turkey reaffirming its intention to block Australia's bid.
    *   Emergence of a "compromise" candidate from within WEOG.
    *   Any negative developments in Australia's domestic climate policy that undermine its NDC.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Opaque Negotiations:** The final decision will be made in closed-door diplomatic negotiations. Public signals may not reflect the true state of play.
*   **Geopolitical Horse-Trading:** The decision could be linked to unrelated issues. Turkey could trade its veto for a concession from Australia or its allies on another matter.
*   **The "Consensus" Trap:** Consensus means any single WEOG member could block the decision for its own reasons, not just Turkey.
*   **Surprise Compromise:** The "Other" option is not impossible. If the stalemate is intractable, a third WE

To forecast which country will host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP 31) in 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given Australia's strong bid, including its ambitious climate policies and the proposal to co-host with Pacific Island nations, a prior of 45% is reasonable. This reflects Australia's proactive stance and the narrative strength of its bid.
- **Turkey**: Turkey's bid is credible but lacks the same level of climate ambition and narrative appeal as Australia's. A prior of 40% is appropriate, considering Turkey's potential to block Australia's bid.
- **Germany**: Historically, the default to Bonn is rare, but the ongoing stalemate increases this possibility. A prior of 10% reflects this tail risk.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This option is unlikely given the current bids, so a prior of 2% is assigned.
- **Other**: The possibility of a compromise candidate emerging is low, so a prior of 3% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The situation aligns with historical patterns of WEOG host selections, where consensus is typically reached.
- **Differences**: The public stalemate and Australia's unique co-hosting proposal with Pacific Island nations are significant deviations from the norm.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia's Ambitious NDC**: Increases the likelihood of Australia being selected (P(E | H) high for Australia).
- **Public Stalemate**: Increases the likelihood of Germany as the default (P(E | H) high for Germany).
- **Turkey's Lack of Competing Narrative**: Decreases the likelihood of Turkey being selected (P(E | H) low for Turkey).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: The ambitious NDC and narrative strength significantly increase Australia's probability. Posterior odds for Australia increase due to strong evidence.
- **Turkey**: The lack of a compelling narrative and the stalemate decrease Turkey's probability.
- **Germany**: The stalemate slightly increases Germany's probability as a default option.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of geopolitical negotiations leading to a compromise or a surprise candidate.
- **Tail Risks**: The stalemate could lead to unexpected outcomes, such as a third-party compromise.
- **Alternative Forecast**: A compromise candidate could emerge, but current evidence does not strongly support this.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- **Australia**: 55%
- **Turkey**: 25%
- **Germany**: 15%
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: 2%
- **Other**: 3%

# Forecasting COP 31 Host Country

I'll analyze which country will host COP 31 in 2026 using Bayesian reasoning.

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Looking at the WEOG rotation and current bids:
- **Australia**: 45% - Strong bid with Pacific Island co-hosting narrative
- **Turkey**: 35% - Official bid with geopolitical leverage
- **Germany**: 15% - Default option if consensus fails
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: 3% - Low probability given WEOG rotation
- **Other**: 2% - Covers unexpected outcomes

These priors reflect that Australia and Turkey are the main contenders, with Germany as the default option if consensus fails. The rotation system strongly favors WEOG countries, making non-WEOG options unlikely.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The host selection follows the established UN regional rotation system
- WEOG is scheduled to host COP 31
- The decision requires consensus within the regional group

**Key differences:**
- Australia's bid includes co-hosting with Pacific Island nations, an unusual arrangement
- A public stalemate exists between the two main contenders
- Australia has made significant climate policy announcements timed with its bid
- The decision timeline is extended, increasing the probability of the default option

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Australia:**
- Submitted an ambitious 2035 NDC (September 2025)
- Detailed Net Zero Plan (October 2025)
- Received UNFCCC praise for climate commitments (October 2025)
- Compelling narrative of co-hosting with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations
- Adelaide designated as host city with funding and feasibility studies

P(E|Australia hosts) = High (~0.8)
P(E|Australia doesn't host) = Low (~0.2)
Likelihood ratio ≈ 4:1 favoring Australia

**Evidence for Turkey:**
- Official bid with Antalya as likely host
- Veto power through consensus requirement
- No comparable recent climate policy announcements
- Complex relationship with EU members in WEOG

P(E|Turkey hosts) = Moderate (~0.5)
P(E|Turkey doesn't host) = Moderate (~0.5)
Likelihood ratio ≈ 1:1 (neutral)

**Evidence for Germany (default):**
- Confirmed stalemate increases default probability
- UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn provides logistical advantage
- Historical precedent for default locations when consensus fails

P(E|Germany hosts) = Moderate-High (~0.7)
P(E|Germany doesn't host) = Low-Moderate (~0.3)
Likelihood ratio ≈ 2.3:1 favoring Germany as default

## 4. Bayesian Updating

**For Australia:**
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45:55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 4:1
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 4 = 3.28
- Posterior probability: 3.28/(1+3.28) = 76.6%

Australia's probability increases significantly due to its strong climate commitments and compelling co-hosting narrative.

**For Turkey:**
- Prior probability: 35%
- Prior odds: 35:65 = 0.54
- Likelihood ratio: 1:1
- Posterior odds: 0.54 × 1 = 0.54
- Posterior probability: 0.54/(1+0.54) = 35%

Turkey's probability remains stable without strong evidence shifting its position.

**For Germany:**
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15:85 = 0.18
- Likelihood ratio: 2.3:1
- Posterior odds: 0.18 × 2.3 = 0.41
- Posterior probability: 0.41/(1+0.41) = 29.1%

Germany's probability increases due to the confirmed stalemate.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- The research doesn't mention Turkey's specific climate commitments
- Closed-door diplomatic negotiations may have different dynamics than public statements
- Geopolitical horse-trading could lead to unexpected outcomes
- The consensus requirement means any WEOG member could block either bid

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could trade its veto for concessions on other matters
- A compromise candidate from WEOG might emerge
- Australia's co-hosting model might face procedural challenges
- The stalemate could persist until the default option becomes inevitable

**Adjustments:**
- Reducing Australia's probability slightly to account for the consensus hurdle
- Increasing "Other" slightly to account for possible compromise candidates
- Maintaining Germany's elevated probability due to the stalemate

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:
- Australia: 65%
- Turkey: 18%
- Germany: 12%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
- Other: 3%

## 7. Output Format

Australia: 65%
Turkey: 18%
Germany: 12%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider a scenario with two official bids from a UN regional group and a known default option if they fail to reach consensus. The research report suggests a weak prior, which I will adapt slightly.

*   **Australia & Turkey:** As the two official bidders, they should start with the bulk of the probability. Given Australia's stronger initial narrative (co-hosting with Pacific nations), I'll assign it a slight edge. Prior: Australia 45%, Turkey 40%.
*   **Germany:** This is the default option in case of a stalemate. Historically, this is a very rare outcome (<5%). However, in a known contested bid, the probability is significantly higher. A prior of 10% is a reasonable starting point for this failure state.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation:** This is procedurally very unlikely. The host must come from the designated regional group (WEOG). A Pacific Island Nation would be from the Asia-Pacific Group. This could only happen as part of a complex, rule-bending compromise, making it a subset of the "Other" category. I'll assign it a 1% prior.
*   **Other:** This represents a compromise candidate from within WEOG stepping in to break the deadlock. This has happened in other regional groups (e.g., the Eastern European Group for COP29). This is a plausible, though not common, outcome. I'll assign it a 4% prior.

**Initial Prior Distribution:**
*   Australia: 45%
*   Turkey: 40%
*   Germany: 10%
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
*   Other: 4%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case differs from a typical WEOG selection in several key ways:
*   **Public Stalemate:** The deadlock is public and protracted, which is highly unusual for the normally cohesive WEOG. This elevates the probability of non-standard outcomes (Germany or "Other") compared to the historical base rate.
*   **Asymmetric Bids:** Australia's bid is uniquely strong, linking a compelling narrative (climate justice for Pacific islands) with a concrete, ambitious policy action (the 2035 NDC). Turkey's bid is more conventional, with its primary leverage being its veto power under the consensus rule.
*   **Explicit Policy Linkage:** Australia has explicitly and effectively used its climate policy submission (NDC) as a diplomatic tool to strengthen its bid. This is a sophisticated maneuver that changes the dynamics of the negotiation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will focus on the two most critical pieces of evidence.

**Evidence 1 (E1): The persistent, public stalemate.**
*   This evidence significantly increases the likelihood of the outcomes that result from a deadlock.
*   P(E1 | Germany hosts): High. A stalemate is the direct cause for the default to Germany.
*   P(E1 | "Other" hosts): High. A stalemate is the precondition for a compromise candidate to emerge.
*   P(E1 | Australia or Turkey hosts): Low. If either were a consensus choice, a long public stalemate would not occur.
*   **Conclusion:** This evidence shifts probability mass *away* from Australia and Turkey and *towards* Germany and "Other".

**Evidence 2 (E2): Australia's ambitious 2035 NDC submission and its positive international reception (Sept-Oct 2025).**
*   This evidence dramatically strengthens Australia's position relative to Turkey's.
*   P(E2 | Australia hosts): High. This is a costly and credible signal of commitment, designed to win the bid by appealing to the core purpose of the UNFCCC.
*   P(E2 | Turkey hosts): Low. This action makes it diplomatically very difficult for other WEOG members to side with Turkey against Australia, as it would appear to be a vote against climate ambition.
*   **Conclusion:** The likelihood ratio P(E2 | Australia) / P(E2 | Turkey) is very large. This evidence should shift a significant amount of probability from Turkey to Australia.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Priors:** Australia 45%, Turkey 40%, Germany 10%, Other/Pacific 5%.
2.  **Update for Stalemate (E1):** The stalemate makes the default/compromise options more likely. I will increase the combined probability of Germany and Other/Pacific from 15% to 35%, taking that probability proportionally from the two main bidders.
    *   P(Germany + Other) moves from 15% -> 35%. Let's allocate this as Germany 25%, Other/Pacific 10%.
    *   P(Australia + Turkey) moves from 85% -> 65%.
    *   Intermediate posterior: Australia (45/85 * 65) ≈ 34%, Turkey (40/85 * 65) ≈ 31%, Germany 25%, Other/Pacific 10%.
3.  **Update for Australia's NDC (E2):** This evidence strongly favors Australia over Turkey. The research brief calls the impact "large". I will model this with a likelihood ratio of 4:1. The prior odds (from the intermediate step) were roughly 34:31, or ~1.1 to 1.
    *   Posterior Odds (Australia vs. Turkey) = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio ≈ 1.1 × 4 = 4.4 to 1.
    *   Now, I re-distribute the 65% probability mass for (Australia + Turkey) according to these new odds.
    *   **Final P(Australia)** = 65% × (4.4 / 5.4) ≈ 53%
    *   **Final P(Turkey)** = 65% × (1 / 5.4) ≈ 12%

This leaves the probabilities for the stalemate outcomes unchanged by this second update, as the NDC evidence primarily affects the contest *between* the two bidders.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary concern is underestimating the power of Turkey's veto. The consensus rule is absolute. Turkey could be holding its veto for reasons entirely unrelated to climate policy, and might be willing to absorb the diplomatic cost to achieve another goal. If this is the case, the stalemate is more likely to be intractable, which would mean the probability for Germany should be even higher.

However, the counterargument is that the pressure from other major WEOG powers (the EU, US, Canada, UK) to not obstruct a climate-ambitious bid would be immense. Australia has successfully framed this as a test of climate leadership. For this reason, I believe Turkey is more likely to concede in exchange for future considerations than to force a default to Bonn. My 25% estimate for Germany already represents a significant increase from the historical base rate and adequately captures this risk. The 9% for "Other" also provides a hedge against a surprise compromise candidate. The distribution seems robust.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will now normalize the final probabilities, splitting the "Other/Pacific" category.

*   Australia: 53%
*   Turkey: 12%
*   Germany: 25%
*   Another Pacific Island Nation: 1% (Remains a very low probability tail risk)
*   Other: 9% (The remaining probability for a compromise candidate)

The sum is 53 + 12 + 25 + 1 + 9 = 100%. The probabilities are consistent and reflect the analysis.

---
Australia: 53%
Turkey: 12%
Germany: 25%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 1%
Other: 9%
