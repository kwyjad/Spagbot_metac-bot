### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent La Niña Winters (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23):** During the recent "triple-dip" La Niña, peak daily anomalies for Nov/Dec were lower than in subsequent El Niño years. Based on Copernicus data, these peaks were in the range of **1.3°C to 1.5°C** above the 1850-1900 baseline. This class represents a scenario where La Niña's cooling influence is dominant.
2.  **Recent Post-El Niño / Neutral Winters (e.g., 2024):** The winter of 2024 followed a major El Niño and saw the emergence of a weak, short-lived La Niña. Temperatures remained exceptionally high due to residual ocean heat. Peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec 2024 were likely in the **1.6°C to 1.8°C** range. This class represents a scenario where system inertia and accumulated heat dominate over a weak cooling signal.
3.  **Recent El Niño Winters (2023):** The winter of 2023 occurred during a strong El Niño, leading to unprecedented global temperature spikes. In November 2023, daily anomalies exceeded 2.0°C for the first time on record. The base rate for a peak in this class is **1.9°C to 2.1°C**. This class serves as an upper bound but is unlikely to be representative given the current La Niña.

*Reasoning:* These classes are chosen to reflect the dominant mode of interannual climate variability (ENSO) within the context of the last ~3 years of exceptionally high global temperatures. The primary uncertainty is whether the current climate state more closely resembles a classic La Niña period or a "new normal" where background heat overwhelms ENSO's cooling effects.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-09** La Niña conditions officially announced by NOAA. ↓ — Confirms the presence of a key global cooling mechanism, making the extreme anomalies of 2023/2024 less likely.
*   **2025-09-30** (approx.) September 2025 data shows year-to-date temperature rank slipping to third warmest. ↓ — The provided chart shows a clear deceleration in the 2025 anomaly relative to 2023/2024, consistent with a cooling influence taking hold.
*   **2025-08-31** (approx.) Summer 2025 temperatures, while high, did not set records like 2023/2024. ↓ — Reinforces the narrative that the extreme, record-shattering heat peak of the 2023-24 El Niño has passed.
*   **2025-05-31** (approx.) Transition from a brief ENSO-neutral state to La Niña conditions began. ↓ — The shift towards a cooling oceanic state started months ago, allowing time for its atmospheric effects to manifest by Nov/Dec.
*   **2025-02-07** January 2025 reported as warmest on record despite cooling conditions. ↑ — Highlights the immense underlying thermal inertia in the climate system, suggesting La Niña's cooling effect may be muted.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** Cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific cool the global atmosphere. The current weak La Niña is the primary driver pushing temperatures down from 2023/24 highs. (Size: Large)
2.  **Global Ocean Heat Content (OHC):** The oceans have absorbed the vast majority of excess energy in the climate system and are at record-high temperatures. This provides a persistent, massive heat source that elevates the baseline temperature and counteracts La Niña's cooling. (Size: Large)
3.  **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The underlying trend from greenhouse gas emissions adds approximately 0.2°C of warming per decade, ensuring that any modern La Niña event occurs on a much warmer baseline than past ones. (Size: Large)
4.  **Short-term Weather Variability:** The question resolves on a *single day's* peak. A specific synoptic weather pattern (e.g., a large, persistent high-pressure system over a major landmass) could cause a short-term spike unrelated to the broader climate state. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Stratospheric Water Vapor:** The 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption injected a significant amount of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) into the stratosphere. While the effect is debated, it likely provides a small, persistent warming influence. (Size: Small)
6.  **Aerosol Concentrations:** Potential reductions in atmospheric aerosols (e.g., from shipping fuel regulations) may be reducing the "aerosol masking effect," leading to a slight increase in solar radiation reaching the surface. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Baseline Heat:** Compared to the 2020-2022 La Niña reference class, the current global system (especially OHC) is substantially hotter. The "floor" for temperatures is higher than ever before.
*   **Opposite ENSO State:** Compared to the 2023 El Niño reference class, the key driver of interannual variability is now exerting a cooling, rather than a warming, influence.
*   **Post-Peak Dynamics:** Unlike 2024, which was still experiencing the thermal hangover of a major El Niño, late 2025 is several months into a developing La Niña. The cooling signal should be more established.
*   **Weak La Niña:** The advisory notes a "weak" La Niña is anticipated. This may not have the same cooling power as the stronger, more persistent La Niña events of 2020-2022, making a full return to that temperature range less likely.
*   **Compounding Minor Warmth Factors:** The potential small warming effects from Hunga Tonga and reduced aerosols were not as prominent or established during the earlier reference periods, potentially nudging the baseline slightly higher.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be centered on the peak anomaly from the post-El Niño winter of 2024 (Reference Class 2), perhaps around **1.75°C**, with moderate uncertainty (equivalent n=10) to reflect the high volatility of daily peaks.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) **Confirmed La Niña:** The strongest evidence pushing the forecast down. This makes the extreme >1.9°C peaks of 2023 highly improbable.
    *   (↓ Moderate) **Observed 2025 Temperature Deceleration:** The data in the provided chart confirms that 2025 is already tracking cooler than 2023 and 2024, validating the expected cooling effect.
    *   (↑ Large) **Record Ocean Heat Content:** This is the primary evidence against a major drop in temperature, providing a powerful buffer and keeping the temperature floor exceptionally high.
    *   (↑ Small) **Underlying Warming Trend:** The world of late 2025 is warmer than the world of the last La Niña in 2022, making a direct repeat of those temperatures unlikely.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should move downwards from the 2024-based prior. The strong evidence of an active La Niña outweighs the smaller warming factors, but the immense heat already in the system prevents a return to the levels of the 2020-2022 La Niña. The update suggests a value lower than 2024 but significantly higher than 2022.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Weekly Niño 3.4 index values weakening (moving towards 0.0°C).
    *   Copernicus monthly report for October 2025 shows a surprising rebound

To forecast the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate selection is crucial for establishing a starting point for our forecast. Given the context of ENSO cycles and recent temperature anomalies, we consider the following reference classes:

- **Recent La Niña Winters (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23):** Peak anomalies ranged from 1.3°C to 1.5°C.
- **Recent Post-El Niño / Neutral Winters (2024):** Anomalies ranged from 1.6°C to 1.8°C.
- **Recent El Niño Winters (2023):** Anomalies exceeded 2.0°C.

Given the current La Niña conditions, the most appropriate base rate is the Recent La Niña Winters, with a mean anomaly of approximately 1.4°C and a moderate variance reflecting the variability within this class.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current La Niña conditions align with the La Niña reference class, suggesting a cooling influence.
- **Difference:** The global system is warmer due to record ocean heat content and long-term warming trends, which could elevate the baseline anomaly compared to past La Niña events.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **La Niña Conditions (↓ Large):** Strong cooling influence, making extreme anomalies less likely.
- **Record Ocean Heat Content (↑ Large):** Provides a persistent warming influence, counteracting La Niña's cooling.
- **Long-term Warming Trend (↑ Small):** Adds a slight warming bias over past La Niña events.
- **Observed 2025 Temperature Deceleration (↓ Moderate):** Confirms the cooling trend relative to 2023/2024.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered around 1.4°C, we adjust based on the evidence:
- **La Niña's cooling effect** suggests a downward adjustment.
- **Ocean heat content and warming trend** suggest an upward adjustment.

The net effect is a posterior distribution slightly lower than the 2024 post-El Niño winter but higher than the 2020-2022 La Niña winters, centering around 1.5°C with a moderate spread.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected weather patterns causing short-term spikes.
- **Tail Risks:** A strong synoptic weather event could push anomalies higher than expected.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where La Niña's influence is weaker than anticipated, leading to anomalies closer to 1.6°C.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Considering the evidence and adjustments, the final percentiles for the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025 are:

P10: 1.3  
P20: 1.4  
P40: 1.5  
P60: 1.6  
P80: 1.7  
P90: 1.8

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly for Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use three reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Recent La Niña winters (2020-2022)**: Peak daily anomalies during Nov/Dec ranged from 1.3°C to 1.5°C above the 1850-1900 baseline.
2. **Recent post-El Niño/neutral winters (2024)**: Peak daily anomalies in Nov/Dec 2024 were approximately 1.6°C to 1.8°C.
3. **Recent El Niño winters (2023)**: Peak daily anomalies reached 1.9°C to 2.1°C.

Given the confirmed La Niña conditions, I'll center my prior on a weighted average of classes 1 and 2, with more weight on class 1 since we have an established La Niña. This gives a prior centered at approximately **1.5°C**, with a standard deviation of about 0.2°C to reflect uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- La Niña conditions are present, similar to the 2020-2022 period
- The underlying warming trend continues at approximately 0.2°C per decade
- Daily temperature anomalies show significant variability around the monthly mean

**Differences from base case:**
- The current climate system is substantially warmer than during the 2020-2022 La Niña
- Ocean heat content is at record levels, providing a higher temperature floor
- The current La Niña is described as "weak" compared to the stronger 2020-2022 event
- 2025 temperatures have already shown a deceleration pattern compared to 2023-2024
- Additional warming factors (stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga, reduced aerosols) may be present

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing the forecast down:**
- **La Niña conditions confirmed (October 9, 2025)**: Strong evidence (LR ≈ 1:3) favoring lower temperatures compared to El Niño or neutral conditions
- **Temperature rank slipping to third warmest**: Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 1:2) that 2025 is experiencing cooling relative to recent years
- **Summer 2025 temperatures not setting records**: Weak evidence (LR ≈ 1:1.5) supporting the cooling trend

**Evidence pushing the forecast up:**
- **Record ocean heat content**: Strong evidence (LR ≈ 3:1) that the temperature floor remains exceptionally high
- **January 2025 warmest on record despite cooling conditions**: Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 2:1) of system inertia and high baseline temperatures
- **Underlying warming trend**: Weak evidence (LR ≈ 1.5:1) that even La Niña years are warmer than previous ones

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 1.5°C with σ = 0.2°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - La Niña conditions:**
- Prior: μ = 1.5°C, σ = 0.2°C
- Likelihood ratio: 1:3 favoring lower temperatures
- Posterior: μ ≈ 1.4°C, σ ≈ 0.18°C (narrower due to increased certainty)

**Second update - Record ocean heat content:**
- Prior: μ = 1.4°C, σ = 0.18°C
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1 favoring higher temperatures
- Posterior: μ ≈ 1.5°C, σ ≈ 0.17°C (slightly higher mean, narrower distribution)

**Third update - Temperature rank slipping:**
- Prior: μ = 1.5°C, σ = 0.17°C
- Likelihood ratio: 1:2 favoring lower temperatures
- Posterior: μ ≈ 1.45°C, σ ≈ 0.16°C

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior distribution centers around 1.45°C with reduced uncertainty compared to the prior. The distribution is slightly right-skewed due to the possibility of short-term weather events causing temperature spikes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the persistence of ocean heat content and its ability to override La Niña cooling
- Daily temperature anomalies can spike significantly above monthly averages due to short-term weather patterns
- The timing of La Niña's peak influence might not align perfectly with Nov-Dec 2025
- I might be overweighting recent years and underweighting longer-term climate trends

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 1.6°C, arguing that the current climate system's thermal inertia will dominate over La Niña's cooling effect. This would be supported by the fact that January 2025 set a record despite cooling conditions.

**Rebuttal:**
The temperature deceleration shown in the chart and NOAA's confirmation of La Niña conditions provide strong evidence that the cooling mechanism is already taking effect. The question asks for the highest anomaly during Nov-Dec, when La Niña's influence should be well-established.

**Adjustment:**
I'll slightly widen my uncertainty bounds to account for the possibility of short-term weather events causing temperature spikes, and shift the upper tail slightly higher to account for the possibility that ocean heat content dominates more than expected.

P20: 1.32

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary driver of interannual temperature variability is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Therefore, the most appropriate reference classes are recent years with similar ENSO states, adjusted for the strong background warming trend.

1.  **Recent La Niña Winters (2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23):** This "triple-dip" La Niña period provides a reference for a modern, cool-phase climate. Peak daily anomalies for November/December were in the **1.3°C to 1.5°C** range (above the 1850-1900 baseline). This forms a plausible lower-end anchor for the forecast.
2.  **Recent Post-El Niño Winter (2024):** This period followed a major El Niño and saw the onset of a weak La Niña. Residual ocean heat kept temperatures very high, with likely Nov/Dec peaks in the **1.6°C to 1.8°C** range. This represents the "thermal inertia" scenario and serves as a plausible upper-end anchor.
3.  **Recent El Niño Winter (2023):** With a strong El Niño, daily anomalies surpassed 2.0°C. This is not a good reference for the current La Niña conditions and serves only as an extreme upper bound.

My prior distribution is a weighted combination of the La Niña and Post-El Niño reference classes, centered between them but with high uncertainty. A starting median might be around **1.65°C**, reflecting the ambiguity of whether La Niña's cooling or the ocean's stored heat will dominate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in late 2025 has features of both primary reference classes.
*   **Similar to the La Niña base case (2020-22):** A La Niña is officially active, which is a direct atmospheric cooling mechanism.
*   **Similar to the Post-El Niño base case (2024):** The planet is coming off an exceptionally warm period, and Ocean Heat Content (OHC) remains at record highs, providing a powerful warming inertia that counteracts atmospheric cooling.
*   **Key Differences:**
    *   Compared to 2020-22, the baseline temperature and OHC are significantly higher. The current La Niña is also forecast to be "weak," potentially having less cooling power than the stronger events of the triple-dip.
    *   Compared to 2024, the La Niña has had more time to establish itself. In late 2024, the system was still shedding heat from the El Niño peak, whereas in late 2025, the cooling mechanism has been active for several months.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the prior distribution.

*   **(↓ Strong) Confirmed La Niña and Observed Cooling Trend:** NOAA confirmed La Niña conditions on Oct 9. The provided chart for 2025 (dark red line) corroborates this, showing a clear deceleration and drop in the temperature anomaly relative to 2023 and 2024. This is the strongest evidence pushing the forecast downwards, making a repeat of 2024's peak anomalies (1.6-1.8°C) less likely and the 2023 peak (>1.9°C) extremely unlikely.
*   **(↑ Strong) Record Ocean Heat Content (OHC) and Thermal Inertia:** The oceans hold a record amount of heat. This acts as a massive, persistent heat source, creating a high "floor" for global temperatures. This is the primary evidence pushing the forecast upwards, making a full return to the 2020-22 La Niña temperature levels (1.3-1.5°C) less likely. The fact that January 2025 was the warmest on record despite cooling conditions highlights this inertia.
*   **(↓ Moderate) "Weak" La Niña Forecast:** The official forecast is for a weak La Niña. This tempers the cooling expectation. A weak event will struggle to overcome the massive OHC, suggesting the final anomaly will land somewhere between the two main reference classes, rather than fully reverting to the cooler one. This evidence narrows the distribution and pulls the median away from the low end.
*   **(↑ Small) Long-term Warming Trend:** The underlying anthropogenic warming trend adds ~0.02°C per year. This means the baseline for late 2025 is slightly warmer (~0.06°C) than the average of the 2020-22 La Niña period, providing a small but definite upward nudge.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Centered around 1.65°C, spanning the range between the 2020-22 La Niña (~1.4°C) and 2024 post-El Niño (~1.75°C) outcomes.
*   **Update:** The most compelling evidence is the chart showing 2025 is already tracking significantly cooler than 2024. This strongly suggests the peak will be lower than in 2024. I will perform a significant downward update on my prior median.
    *   *Initial Median:* 1.65°C
    *   *Evidence:* The observed cooling trend suggests the La Niña effect is taking hold.
    *   *Posterior Median:* I will shift the median down to **1.60°C**. This new median is below the 2024 range but still well above the 2020-22 range. This position reflects the balance of power: the active La Niña is winning against the 2024 "inertia" case, but the record OHC and weak nature of the La Niña prevent a full return to the 2020-22 "cool" case. The variance remains high due to these competing forces.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario 1: La Niña's cooling is underestimated.** What if the weak La Niña couples very effectively with the atmosphere, or another cooling factor (e.g., aerosol changes) emerges? In this case, the peak anomaly could fall back into the 2020-22 range. A peak of 1.50°C is very plausible, and a value around 1.44°C is a credible low-end outcome (P10).
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Ocean heat inertia is underestimated.** This seems to be the larger risk. The climate system is in an unprecedented state. If the La Niña's cooling effect is overwhelmed by the heat emanating from the oceans, temperatures could remain stubbornly high, potentially matching or even slightly exceeding the 2024 peak. This suggests the upper tail of the distribution should be quite high, with a peak of 1.79°C being a plausible high-end outcome (P90).
*   **Daily Variability:** The question asks for the *highest single day's* anomaly. This is subject to random weather patterns, which can cause short-term spikes. This justifies maintaining a wide distribution, especially in the upper tail, compared to forecasting a monthly average. My final distribution reflects this by having a P80-P90 gap that is relatively large.

My central estimate of 1.60°C seems robust, but the significant uncertainty warrants a wide 80% confidence interval.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 1.50
P40: 1.56
