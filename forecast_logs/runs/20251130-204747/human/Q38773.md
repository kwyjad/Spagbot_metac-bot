### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Global Cryonics Organizations (Alcor, Cryonics Institute):** These are the largest and oldest providers. Alcor (founded 1972) has ~240 patients, and the Cryonics Institute (CI, founded 1976) has ~270 patients. Their growth has been slow and roughly linear over decades, averaging approximately 4-6 new patients per year in the modern era. This suggests a base rate of **4-6 patients/year** for an established provider.
2.  **Shandong Yinfeng's Historical Growth:** The institute is the most specific reference class. It grew from 10 patients in September 2020 to 31 patients in October 2025. This is an increase of 21 patients over 61 months. This establishes a specific historical base rate for Yinfeng of **~4.1 patients per year** (or ~0.34 patients per month).
3.  **New Technology Adoption Curves (S-Curve):** Cryonics can be viewed as a nascent technology in its early adoption phase. Such technologies often exhibit slow initial growth, followed by an acceleration phase. Yinfeng, being newer and in a large untapped market (China), might be positioned at the start of this curve. However, the technology's speculative nature and high cost have kept the entire field in the "early adopter" stage for 50+ years, suggesting a flattened, linear-like curve is more likely than a rapid takeoff within the forecast horizon.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-01** Cryonics Wiki updated patient count to 31. (↑) — This provides a very recent, hard data point, anchoring the forecast just before the final two months of the resolution period.
*   **2025-05-27** Yinfeng won a provincial award for ovarian tissue cryopreservation technology. (↑) — Reinforces the institute's scientific credibility and public profile, which could attract new clients. Matters for long-term growth, but has a small effect on the immediate term.
*   **2025-02-07** A collaborative project involving Yinfeng was listed among top scientific advances. (↑) — Similar to the May award, this enhances institutional legitimacy and brand value, a small positive driver for client acquisition.
*   **2024-12-24** Yinfeng's documentary "China Temperature" was recognized for brand building. (↑) — Indicates a deliberate and successful public relations strategy to normalize cryonics and attract interest, likely contributing to the steady growth rate.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Public Relations & Marketing:** Yinfeng is actively building its brand through documentaries and publicizing scientific awards. This increases awareness and legitimacy in a country with little prior exposure to cryonics, driving client interest. (Moderate)
2.  **Monopoly Status:** As the only cryonics provider in China, Yinfeng faces no domestic competition. It captures the entirety of a potentially massive market, giving it a significant structural advantage for growth. (Large)
3.  **Cost & Funding Model:** Cryopreservation is extremely expensive, which is the primary limiting factor on demand. Yinfeng's connection to the large Yinfeng Group may provide financial stability, but high costs for individuals will cap the growth rate. (Large, constraining)
4.  **Scientific Legitimacy:** The institute's parallel research in more accepted fields like organ and tissue preservation lends it a scientific halo that other, more single-focus cryonics organizations lack. This can reduce public skepticism. (Moderate)
5.  **Operational Capacity:** The number of simultaneous cryopreservation procedures the institute can handle is a physical constraint. This includes trained personnel, equipment, and long-term storage space, limiting the maximum possible intake per year. (Moderate, constraining)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Corporate Structure:** Unlike the non-profit, member-owned models of Alcor and CI, Yinfeng is part of a large, for-profit biomedical conglomerate. This may afford it more capital for R&D and marketing but could also mean its priorities could shift based on profitability.
*   **State-Linkage & Regulatory Environment:** Operating in China implies a different relationship with the state than Western counterparts. While not state-owned, its existence suggests at least tacit approval, providing stability. However, it is also vulnerable to sudden shifts in government policy.
*   **Untapped Market:** Yinfeng is serving a market of 1.4 billion people with rapidly growing wealth, whereas the US/European market is more mature and saturated with information. This provides a higher growth ceiling.
*   **Broader Research Focus:** Yinfeng's emphasis on organ and tissue preservation is a key differentiator. This may be its primary long-term goal, with full-body cryonics being a high-profile but secondary activity. This could divert resources but also enhances its scientific reputation.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior distribution should be strongly anchored on the observed linear growth trend. The data from Sep 2020 (10 patients) to Oct 2025 (31 patients) implies a stable rate of ~4.1 new patients per year. This is a strong prior (equivalent n > 20) given the 5-year observation period.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ small) Recent awards and PR successes slightly increase the probability of maintaining or slightly accelerating the established growth rate.
    *   (→ neutral) The lack of news regarding price reductions, major capacity expansions, or a high-profile celebrity case means there is no evidence to suggest a sharp deviation from the trend.
    *   (↑ large) The October 2025 data point of 31 patients is the most significant piece of evidence, confirming the trend is ongoing and providing a high-confidence starting point for the final 2.5 months.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should be a slight upward shift from a pure extrapolation, but remain very close to the historical trend line. The forecast should be a tight distribution just above the last known count of 31.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new media report (e.g., from SCMP, Xinhua) mentioning a new patient count before year-end.
    *   Announcement of a partnership with a major hospital for standby services.
    *   A high-profile individual in China publicly signing up for cryopreservation.
    *   Launch of a lower-cost option (e.g., neuro-preservation only).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Negative statements from Chinese state media or medical associations regarding cryonics.
    *   Reports of technical failures or internal disputes at the institute.
    *   No further media mentions or website updates before the deadline (suggesting the number remains 31).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting Lag:** The resolution depends on a *report*. The actual number of patients on Dec 31, 2025, might be higher than the last reported number. The forecast is for the *reported* number.
*   **Report Timing:** The last report was in October 2025. There is no guarantee another report will be issued before 2026. If not, the question resolves ambiguously. However, the existence of the Oct 2025 report satisfies the "after or during 2024" clause. The key risk is whether a *new* report emerges.
*   **Definition of "Patient":** The question relies on the standard definition (a cryopreserved human body or brain). There's a small risk that Yinfeng could begin including other services (e.g., the ovarian tissue preservations) in their public-facing "patient" count, which would inflate the number unexpectedly.
*   **Data Source Reliability:** The primary source for the patient count is the Cryonics Wiki, which is a secondary source. While generally reliable, it could have errors or delays in updating.

### Final Research Summary
The forecast should be tightly anchored to the most recent data point of 31 patients as of October 2025. The institute's historical growth rate is a stable ~4.1 patients per year, suggesting a high probability of 1 new patient in the final 2.5 months of 2025, making the most likely outcome 32.

To forecast the number of patients the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute will report by 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical growth rate of the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute from 10 patients in September 2020 to 31 patients in October 2025, which is approximately 4.1 patients per year.
- **Reasoning:** This base rate is chosen because it reflects the specific historical growth of the institute, which is the most relevant reference class. The mean is approximately 4.1 patients per year, with a variance reflecting the relatively stable growth observed over the past five years.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to the historical trend, with no major disruptions or accelerations reported.
- **Difference:** Recent awards and public relations efforts might slightly increase growth, but no evidence suggests a significant deviation from the trend.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Recent Data Point:** The October 2025 count of 31 patients confirms the ongoing trend.
- **Awards and PR Successes:** These factors slightly increase the likelihood of maintaining or slightly accelerating growth.
- **Lack of Major Changes:** No significant changes in pricing, capacity, or high-profile cases suggest no sharp deviation from the trend.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around the historical growth rate of 4.1 patients per year.
- **Likelihood:** Recent evidence slightly favors maintaining or slightly increasing the growth rate.
- **Posterior:** The forecast is a slight upward shift from a pure extrapolation, remaining close to the historical trend line. The most likely outcome is 32 patients by the end of 2025.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of reporting lag or unexpected changes in patient count definitions.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden policy change or a major new client could alter the forecast.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative estimate might assume no new patients, resulting in 31. However, the evidence supports a slight increase.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **P10:** 31
- **P20:** 31
- **P40:** 32
- **P60:** 32
- **P80:** 33
- **P90:** 33

These percentiles reflect a tight distribution around the most recent data point, with a slight upward adjustment based on recent evidence.

# Forecast: Patients at Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute by 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two primary reference classes to establish my prior:

1. **Shandong Yinfeng's own historical growth rate**: The institute grew from 10 patients in September 2020 to 31 patients in October 2025, representing 21 new patients over 61 months. This gives a growth rate of approximately 4.1 patients per year or 0.34 patients per month.

2. **Established cryonics organizations**: Alcor and Cryonics Institute have shown growth rates of 4-6 patients per year over longer periods.

My prior distribution will be centered on the expected number of patients by December 31, 2025, starting from the last known count of 31 in October 2025. With approximately 2.5 months remaining and a growth rate of 0.34 patients per month, I'd expect about 0.85 additional patients (2.5 × 0.34), giving a prior median of approximately 31.85 patients.

The variance of this prior should be relatively small given the consistency of the historical growth rate, but I'll account for some uncertainty in the exact timing of new patients.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Yinfeng continues to operate under the same business model and regulatory environment
- The cost of cryopreservation remains high, limiting the potential customer base
- The institute maintains its monopoly status in China
- No major technological breakthroughs have been reported that would dramatically change the value proposition

**Differences from base case:**
- Recent awards and recognition may have slightly increased Yinfeng's visibility and credibility
- The institute appears to be actively building its brand through documentaries and publicity
- We're looking at a very short time horizon (2.5 months) compared to the 5-year historical data, which increases uncertainty about exact timing

These differences suggest a slight positive adjustment to the growth rate, but the short time frame means we should still expect only 0-2 new patients in the remaining period.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Key evidence affecting the forecast:

1. **Recent patient count (31 as of October 2025)**: This is the strongest piece of evidence, providing a firm anchor point just 2.5 months before the resolution date. This makes values below 31 extremely unlikely.

2. **Consistent historical growth rate (4.1 patients/year)**: The stability of this rate over 5 years suggests it's reliable for short-term projections. This strongly supports expecting 0-1 new patients in the remaining 2.5 months.

3. **Recent awards and recognition**: The provincial award for ovarian tissue cryopreservation (May 2025) and recognition for scientific advances (February 2025) slightly increase the likelihood of higher growth rates. I'd estimate this increases the probability of adding 1-2 patients by about 10% compared to the base rate.

4. **Documentary recognition (December 2024)**: The recognition of Yinfeng's documentary suggests effective marketing, which could slightly increase patient acquisition rates. This provides a small upward adjustment.

5. **No reported capacity expansions or price changes**: The absence of news about major operational changes suggests the growth rate is unlikely to dramatically accelerate or decelerate in the short term.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 31.85 patients (31 + 0.85), I'll update based on the evidence:

- The recent awards and documentary recognition slightly increase the probability of higher growth. This shifts my posterior median slightly upward to about 32 patients.

- The absence of any reported major changes in operations or pricing keeps the distribution relatively tight around this median.

- The short time frame (2.5 months) means there's a significant probability (~40%) that no new patients will be added before the end of 2025, leaving the count at 31.

- There's also a smaller but non-negligible probability (~10%) of seeing 2 or more new patients in this period, especially if the recent publicity has created a small pipeline of interested clients.

My posterior distribution is thus centered at 32 patients, with most of the probability mass between 31 and 33 patients.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Reporting lag**: The question resolves based on the most recent report before 2026. If no new report is published after October 2025, the question would resolve to 31 regardless of actual patient count. Given Yinfeng's pattern of occasional updates, there's perhaps a 30-40% chance no new report will be published.

2. **Seasonal factors**: I haven't considered whether cryopreservation has seasonal patterns. End-of-year holidays might affect operations or reporting.

3. **Definitional issues**: If Yinfeng were to change how they count "patients" (e.g., including tissue samples), this could cause a sudden jump in numbers.

4. **Black swan events**: A high-profile case (celebrity) or negative publicity could significantly impact the short-term growth rate.

5. **Overconfidence in the linear trend**: While the historical growth appears linear, cryonics adoption could follow an S-curve with potential acceleration points.

Adjusting for these considerations, I should widen my distribution slightly and put more weight on the possibility that the reported number remains at 31 due to reporting lags.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the historical growth of the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute itself. This provides the most specific reference class.

-   **Data:** The institute grew from 10 patients in September 2020 to 31 patients in October 2025.
-   **Calculation:** This represents an increase of 21 patients over a period of 61 months.
-   **Base Rate:** The historical growth rate is approximately **4.1 patients per year**, or about 0.34 patients per month.

This prior suggests a slow, roughly linear growth model. This rate is also consistent with the lower end of the growth rate for more established Western cryonics organizations (4-6 patients/year), which serves as a secondary reference class and increases confidence in this prior.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is highly comparable to the historical base case. The forecast horizon is extremely short, as the question resolves at the end of 2025 and the last data point is from October 2025. The fundamental drivers and constraints of cryonics adoption—high cost, speculative nature, logistical complexity, and Yinfeng's monopoly status in China—have not changed. Therefore, the historical linear trend is expected to be highly predictive for the remaining two months of the year.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The forecast is dominated by two key pieces of evidence: the last known data point and the resolution mechanism.

1.  **Anchor Point (Strong Evidence):** The most significant piece of evidence is the known count of **31 patients as of October 1, 2025**. This firmly anchors the forecast, making the problem an estimation of a very small increment over a short period.

2.  **Resolution Mechanism (Strong Evidence, Pushes Down):** The question resolves to the number in the *most recent report* before 2026. There is a substantial probability that no new official or media report will be published between October 1, 2025, and the end of the year. In this scenario, the resolution value would be the last reported number, 31. This possibility creates a large probability mass at the value of 31, pulling the median and lower percentiles down to this anchor point.

3.  **Growth Rate (Moderate Evidence, Pushes Up):** The historical rate of ~0.34 patients/month implies an expected growth of ~1 patient in the final three months of 2025 (Oct, Nov, Dec). This evidence suggests the most likely *actual* number of patients by year-end is 32. This pushes the forecast upward from the anchor of 31.

4.  **PR Activity (Weak Evidence, Pushes Up):** Recent awards and a documentary suggest Yinfeng is actively managing its public image. This slightly increases the likelihood that they will publish a year-end update, and could contribute to a slight acceleration in growth. This provides a weak push for the upper percentiles of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
-   **Prior Distribution:** A linear projection starting from 31 in October 2025 and growing by ~1 patient by the end of December 2025. This would center the distribution of the *actual* number of patients around 32.
-   **Updating with Reporting Likelihood:** This prior must be updated by the likelihood of a new report being published. Let's estimate a ~45% chance of no new report (or a new report that still says 31). This creates a large probability mass at 31. The remaining ~55% probability is distributed across outcomes of 32, 33, etc., based on the Poisson-like arrival of new patients.
-   **Posterior Shape:** The resulting posterior distribution is discrete and highly right-skewed. The mode is 31. However, because the cumulative probability of adding one or more patients (and it being reported) is greater than 50%, the median is 32. The distribution has a rapidly decaying tail for values greater than 32.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Overconfidence in Linearity:** Could a batch of patients (e.g., a family) sign up at once, causing a non-linear jump? Yes, this is possible and has happened at other organizations. This would fatten the right tail of the distribution. My upper percentiles should account for a small probability of adding 2-3 patients.
-   **Blind Spot - Definition Change:** A key risk is that Yinfeng could change its public definition of "patient" to include other cryopreserved tissues (like the ovarian tissue for which it won an award). This is a low-probability but high-impact event that could cause the number to jump unexpectedly. This justifies stretching the P90 percentile further to the right than a simple linear model would suggest.
-   **Alternative Forecast (Stagnation):** An alternative is that growth has stalled or the October 1 update was the final one for the year. This would make 31 the most likely outcome by a large margin. My model already accounts for this by placing a ~45% probability on the outcome being 31, making it the mode of the distribution.

My final distribution reflects these considerations, with a floor and mode at 31, a median at 32, and a tail that extends to 34 to account for small accelerations or batch events.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
For the target variable (reported number of patients by 2026), the most appropriate base rate is Yinfeng's own historical growth, as it's the specific reference class. From 10 patients in September 2020 to 31 in October 2025 (21 patients over 61 months), this gives an average of ~0.344 patients per month or ~4.1 per year. This is chosen because it's direct empirical data from the institute, more relevant than global cryonics averages (4-6 per year for Alcor/CI), though consistent with them. Assuming a Poisson process for additions, the prior for new patients over the ~3 months from October 2025 to year-end (for potential reporting) is Poisson with λ ≈ 1.03 (0.344 × 3), leading to a prior mean of 31 + 1.03 = 32.03 patients, with variance 1.03 (sd ≈ 1.01). The distribution is right-skewed, with ~36% chance of 0 new, ~37% of 1, ~19% of 2, etc.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base rate in that Yinfeng has shown steady, linear growth without major disruptions, operating in a stable regulatory environment with ongoing PR efforts. Differences include recent positive developments (awards, documentaries) that could slightly accelerate growth by boosting visibility in China's large market, unlike the more saturated Western markets. However, the short forecast horizon (~2 months remaining from today, Nov 30, 2025) limits potential for big shifts, and reporting infrequency could keep the number at 31 if no update occurs. These differences suggest a small upward shift in the mean but also added uncertainty in the lower tail due to reporting risk.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- Anchor at 31 patients (Oct 2025 wiki update): Strong evidence anchoring the floor; consistent with low values but makes very low outcomes (<31) impossible (likelihood ratio ~∞ against values <31).
- Recent awards/PR (2025 developments): Slightly favors higher values by enhancing credibility and attracting clients; qualitatively, this makes outcomes 1-2 patients above base ~1.2× more likely than below (small upward push).
- Monopoly in China and untapped market: Supports higher growth potential vs. global base; makes +2-3 patients ~1.5× more likely than stagnation (moderate upward).
- No negative news or capacity issues: Neutral but reduces downside risk.
- Reporting lag risk: The lack of updates since Oct 2025 (despite ~2 months passed) increases likelihood of no new report, favoring the status quo of 31 (~2× more likely for low-end stasis vs. unreported surge).
Net: Evidence pushes slightly up (PR/legitimacy) but constrains tails (short time, reporting uncertainty).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Conceptually, Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood. Start with prior (Poisson-shifted mean ~32.03, sd ~1.01, truncated at 31). Update with evidence: The anchoring at 31 and reporting risk add a truncation effect, increasing the mass at/near 31 (likelihood favors low variance). PR evidence applies a small multiplicative boost to higher outcomes (e.g., scale probabilities for k≥1 by ~1.2-1.5x, normalized).

Explicit update step: Prior P(k=0 new)=0.36, P(1)=0.37, P(2)=0.19, P(3+)=0.08. Apply likelihood ratios (e.g., PR makes k≥2 ~1.3x more likely, reporting risk makes k=0 ~1.5x more likely). Post-normalization: P(0)≈0.42, P(1)≈0.34, P(2)≈0.17, P(3+)≈0.07. Posterior mean ~31 + 0.89 = 31.89 (slight downward shift from prior due to reporting risk overweighting low end), variance ~1.1 (slightly stretched for uncertainty), with more mass at 31 and mild right skew.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Potential overconfidence: The distribution might be too tight; historical rate assumes steady Poisson, but cryonics growth can be lumpy (e.g., dependent on rare events like high-profile deaths). Blind spots: Underestimating reporting lag— if updates are annual-ish, P(no new report) could be >50%, biasing toward 31. Tail risks: Upside (5% chance of surge to 35+ if celebrity case or major news breaks in December); downside minimal (floored at 31, but ambiguous resolution unlikely since 2025 report exists). Alternative forecast: More optimistic (mean 33, P90=37) if assuming acceleration from PR in untapped market—plausible given China's scale, but rebutted by short horizon and no evidence of imminent spike. Conversely, pessimistic (mean 31.5, stuck at 31) if reporting stalls—plausible but rebutted by historical updates and active PR. Adjustments: Widen sd to ~1.2 for lumpy risk, shifting posterior mean to ~32.1 and adding upper tail mass (P>34 ~5%).
