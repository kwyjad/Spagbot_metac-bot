### Reference class & base rates
1.  **African Incumbents in Authoritarian/Hybrid Regimes:** Zimbabwe is a competitive authoritarian state where the ruling party, ZANU-PF, maintains power through a mix of electoral processes and repression. In such regimes, leaders are rarely removed by elections. The primary risks are internal (coups, party removal) or natural (death). Historically, the annual rate of irregular leadership turnover (e.g., coup, resignation under pressure) in such states is low, perhaps 5-10%. Scaled to the ~2-month forecast horizon (Nov-Dec 2025), this suggests a base rate of **~1-2%** for removal via coup or internal ouster.
2.  **Heads of State Aged 80+:** Emmerson Mnangagwa was born in September 1942, making him 83 years old during the forecast period. Advanced age is a significant factor. Based on standard actuarial tables for males, the annual mortality risk at this age is roughly 10-12%. This translates to a **~1.5-2.0%** probability of death or severe incapacitation within the two-month horizon.
3.  **Post-Coup Regimes:** Mnangagwa came to power via a military-backed coup in 2017. Leaders who take power this way are often more vulnerable to the same mechanism. However, they are also acutely aware of the threat and often engage in "coup-proofing" by purging rivals and securing loyalty from security services. The base rate for a counter-coup is difficult to establish but suggests a slightly elevated risk compared to a standard authoritarian regime, though this is likely offset by the leader's own preventative measures.

*Reasoning:* Combining these classes, a plausible prior for Mnangagwa *not* being president on Jan 1, 2026, is in the **3-5% range**. The primary drivers are a non-trivial health risk and a small but real risk of an internal power play, most likely from the military faction that brought him to power.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-31** Mnangagwa's third-term bid is reported to be fomenting violence, with his ZANU-PF party adopting a resolution to extend his term to 2030. (↑ Mnangagwa) — This indicates his faction is on the offensive and successfully using party structures to legitimize a power grab, suppressing internal dissent.
*   **2025-10-28** ZANU-PF officially endorses Mnangagwa's plan to cancel the 2028 elections and extend his rule until 2030, explicitly sidelining VP Chiwenga. (↑ Mnangagwa) — This is a major consolidation of power, showing Mnangagwa has outmaneuvered his primary rival within the party's formal structures.
*   **2025-10-21** ZANU-PF directs the Justice Minister to fast-track constitutional amendments for the term extension. (↑ Mnangagwa) — Moves the plan from rhetoric to concrete legal action, demonstrating momentum and control over the state apparatus.
*   **2025-09-19** Mnangagwa publicly shifts focus to winning the 2028 elections, seemingly brushing aside the "2030 Agenda." (↓ Mnangagwa) — This earlier report contradicts the October news. It was likely a strategic feint or a sign of internal debate that his faction has since decisively won.
*   **2025-04-09** Reports emerge of a succession battle creating economic uncertainty, with Mnangagwa allies pushing for term extension against a Chiwenga-aligned faction. (↔ Neutral) — Establishes the core conflict that recent events show Mnangagwa is winning.
*   **2025-01-16** ZANU-PF announces its intention to initiate constitutional amendments for a third term. (↑ Mnangagwa) — Shows this power play has been in motion for most of the year, giving Mnangagwa time to build support and neutralize opposition.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ZANU-PF Internal Power Consolidation:** Mnangagwa's faction appears to have successfully co-opted or purged key party structures to endorse his "2030 agenda." This marginalizes rivals like Chiwenga, making a party-led ouster very difficult. (Large impact)
2.  **Control of Security Forces:** The ultimate arbiter of power in Zimbabwe. While Chiwenga is a former general, Mnangagwa has had eight years as president to appoint loyalists to key command positions, likely "coup-proofing" his regime. The success of his recent political moves suggests he has the backing of the security sector's leadership. (Large impact)
3.  **President's Health:** At 83, Mnangagwa's health is a major uncertainty. A sudden death or incapacitation is a plausible, albeit low-probability, path for him to leave office within the short two-month horizon. This is an exogenous shock. (Potentially large impact, but low probability)
4.  **Chiwenga's Desperation:** Being publicly sidelined and having his succession path blocked could force Chiwenga and his military allies to act. However, a coup is extremely high-risk. The short timeline makes a hastily planned, reactive coup less likely to succeed. (Moderate impact, but low probability)
5.  **Opposition and Civil Society:** The formal opposition is fractured and repressed, as noted by Human Rights Watch. Civil society groups are calling for resistance but lack the power to force a leadership change. They are not a significant driver in this timeframe. (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in two months. This heavily favors the incumbent, as coups, impeachments, or organized resignations typically require longer planning horizons. The base rates (usually annual) must be significantly down-weighted.
*   **Public Succession Struggle:** Unlike many authoritarian regimes where succession battles are opaque, the Mnangagwa-Chiwenga rivalry is relatively public. Recent events show a clear victory for the Mnangagwa faction in this public phase, which likely solidifies his position in the short term.
*   **Post-Coup Incumbent:** Mnangagwa knows exactly what a coup looks like and has likely spent years securing his position against one. This "incumbent's advantage" in coup-proofing is likely stronger than in a typical authoritarian state.
*   **Advanced Age:** At 83, Mnangagwa's personal health risk is significantly higher than the average incumbent in the reference class, making natural causes a more prominent, albeit still unlikely, scenario in the short term.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior of **95-97%** for Mnangagwa remaining in office, derived from the base rates for health and political stability over a two-month period. (Equivalent n ≈ 30).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The successful push for the "2030 agenda" and ZANU-PF's formal endorsement demonstrate Mnangagwa's firm control over the party and state, significantly reducing the probability of a successful internal challenge.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** The public sidelining of VP Chiwenga, the most credible challenger, without immediate, visible pushback suggests Chiwenga's faction currently lacks the capacity or will for a short-fuse counter-move.
    *   **↓ Small:** The president's advanced age (83) represents a persistent, irreducible risk of a health event that is independent of the political situation.
    *   **↓ Small:** The very public nature of Chiwenga's humiliation could, in theory, provoke a low-probability "last gasp" attempt at a coup, though this is unlikely given the apparent consolidation of security forces.
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The political developments show Mnangagwa is more secure in his position now than he was six months ago. The posterior probability for Mnangagwa remaining president should move **upwards, to the 97-99% range**.

To forecast who will be President of Zimbabwe on January 1, 2026, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Emerson Mnangagwa**: Given the context of African incumbents in authoritarian regimes, the base rate for an incumbent remaining in power over a short period (2 months) is high. The prior probability for Mnangagwa staying in power is around 95-97%, considering the low annual rate of irregular leadership turnover and his control over the party and security forces.

- **Grace Mugabe, Constantino Chiwenga, Kembo Mohadi, Someone else**: These options collectively have a low base rate. The probability of any one of them becoming president within the next two months is low, given the stability of Mnangagwa's position and the lack of immediate evidence suggesting a successful coup or resignation. The base rate for any of these options is collectively around 3-5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The current situation aligns with the base case of an authoritarian regime where the incumbent has consolidated power and faces minimal immediate threats.

- **Differences**: Mnangagwa's advanced age introduces a higher health risk than typical for incumbents, but this is still a low-probability event over the short term.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Mnangagwa's Consolidation of Power**: Recent developments show Mnangagwa's successful push for a term extension and sidelining of rivals, indicating strong control over the party and reducing the likelihood of an internal challenge. Likelihood of Mnangagwa remaining in power given this evidence is high.

- **Health Risks**: At 83, Mnangagwa's health is a concern, but the likelihood of a health event causing a change in leadership within two months is low.

- **Chiwenga's Sidelining**: The lack of immediate pushback from Chiwenga suggests his faction lacks the capacity for a quick coup. Likelihood of Chiwenga becoming president is low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Mnangagwa**: Starting with a prior of 95-97%, the evidence of political consolidation increases this probability. Posterior probability is adjusted upwards to 97-99%.

- **Others**: The evidence does not significantly increase the likelihood of any other candidate becoming president. Their collective probability remains low, around 1-3%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: The main risk is overestimating Mnangagwa's health stability. However, given the short timeframe, this remains a low-probability event.

- **Alternative Scenarios**: A sudden health event or an unexpected coup could alter the outcome, but these remain unlikely within the given period.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100%. Given the strong evidence for Mnangagwa's continued presidency, the distribution is heavily skewed in his favor.

### 7. Output Format

Emerson Mnangagwa: 98%  
Grace Mugabe: 0.5%  
Constantino Chiwenga: 0.5%  
Kembo Mohadi: 0.5%  
Someone else: 0.5%  

These probabilities reflect the strong likelihood of Mnangagwa remaining in power, with minimal chances for other candidates given the current political landscape and short timeframe.

# Analysis: Who Will be President of Zimbabwe on January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Emerson Mnangagwa (Prior: 95%)**
- Incumbent advantage in authoritarian regimes is extremely strong
- Recent successful consolidation of power through "2030 agenda"
- Short time horizon (only 2 months until resolution) favors status quo
- At 83, health risks exist but are relatively small over a 2-month period (~1.5-2%)

**Constantino Chiwenga (Prior: 3%)**
- As Vice President, he's the constitutional successor if Mnangagwa leaves office
- Has military background and was key in the 2017 coup that brought Mnangagwa to power
- Historical precedent for VPs succeeding presidents in Zimbabwe

**Grace Mugabe (Prior: 0.1%)**
- No current political position in Zimbabwe
- Fled the country after her husband's removal
- No visible support base or pathway to power

**Kembo Mohadi (Prior: 0.5%)**
- Second Vice President, would be in line after Chiwenga
- Resigned from government position in 2021 over scandal but returned to party position
- Limited independent power base

**Someone else (Prior: 1.4%)**
- Covers other ZANU-PF officials, opposition leaders, or military figures
- Low probability given the short timeframe and Mnangagwa's consolidation

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Zimbabwe remains a competitive authoritarian regime where power transitions typically occur through internal party mechanisms or coups, not elections
- ZANU-PF maintains firm control of state institutions
- Military continues to be the ultimate arbiter of power

**Key differences:**
- Mnangagwa has recently consolidated power more firmly than typical for the base case
- The succession battle has become unusually public with the "2030 agenda"
- Mnangagwa's advanced age (83) creates higher health risk than average incumbents
- The extremely short time horizon (2 months) significantly reduces likelihood of organized power transitions

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for Mnangagwa remaining president:**
- ZANU-PF officially endorsed Mnangagwa's plan to extend rule until 2030 (Oct 28, 2025)
- Party directed Justice Minister to fast-track constitutional amendments (Oct 21, 2025)
- Successful marginalization of Chiwenga faction within party structures
- No visible military resistance to the "2030 agenda"
- Short timeframe gives little opportunity for opposition to organize

**Evidence against Mnangagwa remaining president:**
- Advanced age (83) creates non-trivial health risks
- Public humiliation of Chiwenga could potentially trigger desperate action
- War veterans' earlier calls for resignation (Jan 2025) suggest some erosion of traditional support base
- Constitutional crisis over term limits could theoretically trigger intervention

**Likelihood ratios:**
- Recent ZANU-PF endorsement: Much more likely if Mnangagwa will remain in power (LR ≈ 3:1)
- Fast-tracking constitutional amendments: Much more likely if Mnangagwa will remain in power (LR ≈ 2:1)
- Chiwenga's public sidelining without immediate pushback: Moderately more likely if Mnangagwa will remain in power (LR ≈ 1.5:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probabilities:
- Mnangagwa: 95%
- Chiwenga: 3%
- Mohadi: 0.5%
- Grace Mugabe: 0.1%
- Someone else: 1.4%

**Update based on ZANU-PF endorsement of 2030 agenda:**
- Prior odds for Mnangagwa: 95/5 = 19:1
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1
- Posterior odds: 19 × 3 = 57:1
- Posterior probability: 57/(57+1) ≈ 98.3%

**Update based on fast-tracking constitutional amendments:**
- Prior odds (from previous update): 98.3/1.7 ≈ 57.8:1
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1
- Posterior odds: 57.8 × 2 ≈ 115.6:1
- Posterior probability: 115.6/(115.6+1) ≈ 99.1%

**Qualitative adjustment for health risks:**
- The 99.1% seems too high given irreducible health risks at age 83
- Actuarial tables suggest ~1.5-2% chance of death/incapacitation over 2 months
- Adjusting downward to account for this factor: ~97.5%

**Distributing remaining probability:**
- Chiwenga as constitutional successor gets majority of remaining probability
- Mohadi as second VP gets smaller portion
- "Someone else" category covers military intervention or other scenarios
- Grace Mugabe remains extremely unlikely

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Health information about Mnangagwa may be tightly controlled; he could be in worse health than publicly known
- Military loyalty is difficult to assess from outside; there could be hidden factions
- The public nature of Chiwenga's marginalization might force action that appears irrational from outside
- Zimbabwe's economic situation could deteriorate rapidly, triggering unforeseen instability

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Health crisis scenario:** Mnangagwa could suffer a sudden health event, automatically elevating Chiwenga
- **Military intervention scenario:** Chiwenga, facing political extinction, could attempt a desperate military move
- **Party compromise scenario:** Internal ZANU-PF negotiations could lead to a surprise leadership change

**Adjustments:**
- Increasing probability for Chiwenga slightly to account for health risks and potential desperation moves
- Slightly increasing "Someone else" to account for unforeseen scenarios
- Reducing Mnangagwa's probability to a more defensible ~96%

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting probabilities to ensure they sum to 100%:
- Mnangagwa: 96%
- Chiwenga: 2.5%
- Mohadi: 0.3%
- Grace Mugabe: 0.1%
- Someone else: 1.1%

## 7. Final Forecast

Emerson Mnangagwa: 96%
Constantino Chiwenga: 2.5%
Kembo Mohadi: 0.3%
Grace Mugabe: 0.1%
Someone else: 1.1%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider the stability of leaders in similar political contexts and the specific personal risks to the incumbent, Emmerson Mnangagwa.

*   **Reference Class 1: Incumbents in Authoritarian Regimes.** Zimbabwe is a competitive authoritarian state where leadership changes are rare and often irregular. The annual base rate for an irregular leadership turnover (e.g., coup, forced resignation) in such regimes is low, estimated at 5-10%.
*   **Reference Class 2: Leader's Health.** As of late 2025, President Mnangagwa is 83 years old. Standard actuarial tables suggest an annual mortality risk of approximately 10-12% for a male of this age.
*   **Combined Annual Risk & Prior:** Combining these risks, the total annual probability of Mnangagwa leaving office is roughly 15-20% (10% health risk + 5% political risk). The forecast horizon is very short, approximately two months (November-December 2025), which is 1/6th of a year. Therefore, the base rate probability of him *not* being president on January 1, 2026, is approximately (15-20%) / 6 ≈ 2.5% to 3.3%.
*   **Initial Prior:** This leads to a prior probability of **~97% for Mnangagwa** remaining in office and **~3%** for him not being in office. The 3% would be distributed among potential successors, with First Vice President Constantino Chiwenga being the most likely alternative.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The case fits the reference class of an aging leader in a post-coup authoritarian system, where both health and internal power struggles are key risks.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is the **extremely short time horizon** (two months), which heavily favors the status quo. Additionally, the provided evidence points to a very specific, dynamic situation: Mnangagwa is not just passively holding power but is actively and successfully consolidating it against his primary rival, which may make him *more* secure than the base rate suggests in the short term.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The research report contains several crucial pieces of evidence from late 2025:

*   **Evidence (E1):** ZANU-PF's official endorsement of Mnangagwa's plan to extend his rule to 2030 and the fast-tracking of constitutional amendments (October 2025).
*   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence is highly probable if Mnangagwa is securely in power (P(E1 | H_Mnangagwa) is high). It is very improbable if a successful plot to oust him in the next two months is underway (P(E1 | ~H_Mnangagwa) is very low). This evidence has a very high likelihood ratio in favor of Mnangagwa remaining in power. It suggests he has outmaneuvered his rivals and controls the party apparatus.

*   **Evidence (E2):** The public sidelining of VP Chiwenga.
*   **Likelihood Assessment:** This reinforces E1. A leader about to be overthrown is typically not in a position to publicly humiliate their most powerful rival. This action suggests Mnangagwa is confident in his control over the security forces, which Chiwenga formerly led.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Prior:** P(Mnangagwa) ≈ 97%, P(Not Mnangagwa) ≈ 3%.
*   **Update:** The strong evidence of Mnangagwa's successful power consolidation significantly reduces the perceived political risk. The prior's ~5% annual political risk, which translated to <1% for the two-month period, now seems too high. The recent events suggest the short-term political risk is close to zero.
*   **Posterior Calculation:** The main remaining risk is the non-political, age-related health risk. The annual risk of ~10% translates to a two-month risk of approximately 1.5-2.0% (calculated as 1 - (1 - 0.10)^(2/12) ≈ 1.7%). The political risk, given the evidence, is likely below 0.5%.
*   **Combined Posterior Risk:** The total probability of Mnangagwa not being president is the sum of these risks, approximately 1.7% (health) + 0.3% (political) = **2.0%**.
*   **Posterior Probability:** This implies a posterior probability for Mnangagwa remaining president of **98.0%**. The remaining 2.0% is distributed among the other candidates, primarily the constitutional successor.

If Mnangagwa leaves office, First VP Chiwenga is the most likely person to be acting president on Jan 1, 2026. Therefore, he receives the largest share of the remaining probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I considered whether I am overconfident in Mnangagwa's stability. The strongest counterargument is that publicly cornering a rival like Chiwenga could provoke a high-risk "desperation coup." While this is a plausible tail risk, a coup is incredibly difficult to organize and execute in two months, especially against an incumbent who is actively purging rivals and securing loyalty. The evidence of Mnangagwa's control over the party machinery suggests he likely has control of the security apparatus as well. Therefore, while the risk is not zero, it is small. The 98% estimate for Mnangagwa appropriately balances the strong evidence of his political dominance against the irreducible, and more probable, risk of a sudden health event.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed as follows, summing to 100%:

*   **Emerson Mnangagwa (98%):** Overwhelmingly likely to remain president due to the short time horizon and recent, successful consolidation of power.
*   **Constantino Chiwenga (1.5%):** The most plausible alternative. He is the constitutional successor in the most likely exit scenario (health issue) and the leader of any unlikely political ouster.
*   **Kembo Mohadi (0.2%):** As Second VP, a distant possibility in a chaotic succession.
*   **Someone else (0.3%):** Accounts for other dark horse candidates from within ZANU-PF.
*   **Grace Mugabe (0%):** No viable path to power.

This distribution reflects the current political reality in Zimbabwe as described in the reports.

Emerson Mnangagwa: 98%
Grace Mugabe: 0%
Constantino Chiwenga: 1.5%
Kembo Mohadi: 0.2%
