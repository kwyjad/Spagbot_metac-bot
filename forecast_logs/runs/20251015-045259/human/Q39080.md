### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Government Taking Equity Stakes in Major Corporations:** Historically, this is rare and typically occurs during severe economic crises to prevent systemic collapse. The primary modern example is the 2008-2009 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), where the government took equity/warrants in banks (Citigroup, AIG) and auto companies (GM, Chrysler). Outside of acute, systemic crises, proactive equity stakes as a tool of industrial policy are nearly unprecedented. **Base rate: <5%** in any given 2-year period for a specific strategic-sector company.
2.  **Major, Unilateral Changes to Congressionally-Authorized Grant Programs:** It is uncommon for an executive branch to fundamentally alter the nature of a major, congressionally-mandated subsidy program (like CHIPS) from grants to equity investments without new legislation. While executive orders can shape implementation, such a drastic change often invites legal and political challenges. **Base rate: ~10-15%** of major programs undergoing such a fundamental shift in mechanism post-enactment.
3.  **Completion of Complex Government-Corporate Negotiations:** Finalizing a multi-billion dollar deal involving equity stakes, valuation, shareholder rights, and national security stipulations is a complex process that typically takes many months, if not years. The probability of such a deal being initiated and finalized with a new, previously un-targeted company in a ~2.5 month window is low. **Base rate: <10%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-28] Intel receives $5.7B in exchange for a 10% government stake. — ↑↑ — Establishes a powerful, concrete precedent for the administration's new policy and proves it can be executed.
*   [2025-08-25] Trump administration vows to target other semiconductor firms for similar deals. — ↑ — Signals clear intent to expand the equity-for-funding model beyond the initial Intel deal.
*   [2025-08-21] US Trade Secretary Lutnick clarifies the equity requirement will not apply to TSMC and Micron. — ↓↓ — Significantly narrows the field of potential targets and shows the administration is willing to make exceptions for critical, well-positioned firms, reducing the policy's perceived universality.
*   [2025-08-21] TSMC states it would consider returning subsidies if terms are changed. — ↓ — Demonstrates strong resistance from a key foreign firm, indicating that forcing a deal will be costly and difficult, potentially deterring the administration.
*   [2025-04-01] An executive order establishes the 'US Investment Accelerator' to renegotiate CHIPS deals. — ↑ — Creates a dedicated bureaucratic entity with a mandate to pursue these specific types of deals, increasing administrative capacity and focus.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Administration's "Better Deals" Ideology:** The core driver is the Trump administration's transactional approach, viewing grants as "giveaways" and equity as a "smarter" deal for the taxpayer. This ideological commitment is the primary force pushing for more such deals. (Size: Large)
2.  **Corporate Resistance & Leverage:** Foreign-owned firms like TSMC and Samsung may be culturally and politically opposed to government ownership. Their credible threats to delay or cancel investments in the US give them significant leverage to resist these terms. (Size: Large)
3.  **Financial Needs of Target Companies:** Companies with high capital expenditure needs and weaker balance sheets are more likely to accept dilutive or unconventional financing. Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip's specific financial situations will determine their willingness to negotiate. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **The "Intel Precedent":** The successful Intel deal creates a template and political momentum. It makes the concept seem viable and sets an anchor point (e.g., ~10% stake) for future negotiations, making it easier to pressure the next company. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Administrative & Timeline Constraints:** Negotiating valuation, governance rights, and shareholder agreements is extremely complex. The ~2.5 month timeline before 2026 is a major constraint, making it difficult to finalize a deal from a standing start. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Motivation:** Unlike the TARP reference class, this is not a reactive bailout during a crisis. It is a proactive, ideological shift in industrial policy aimed at securing a national asset (semiconductor manufacturing) on more favorable financial terms for the government.
*   **Actors & Authority:** The policy is driven by a uniquely transactional executive (Trump) through a newly created, empowered office (Investment Accelerator). This may allow for faster, more aggressive negotiations than would occur under standard bureaucratic processes.
*   **Target Companies:** The targets are a mix of domestic (Global Foundries, Microchip) and foreign-owned (Samsung, TSMC) firms. The willingness to exempt key foreign players (TSMC, Micron) suggests a selective, strategic approach rather than a blanket policy, which is a key deviation.
*   **Existing Program:** The administration is repurposing an existing, fully-funded program (CHIPS Act) rather than seeking new congressional authority, potentially accelerating the process but also creating legal and political friction.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 15%, equivalent n=20) based on the historical rarity of the US government taking non-crisis equity stakes in major corporations.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑↑ (Large): The Intel deal is a "proof of concept" and a powerful precedent.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The creation of the Investment Accelerator institutionalizes the new policy.
    *   ↓↓ (Large): The exemption for TSMC and Micron drastically narrows the scope and shows the administration is pragmatic and can be deterred. This is the strongest piece of evidence against a "Yes" resolution.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): Strong corporate pushback (e.g., TSMC's threat) demonstrates that companies have leverage and will not acquiesce easily.
    *   ↓ (Large): The extremely short timeline (~2.5 months) is a major practical barrier to finalizing a complex equity deal with a new target.
*   **Net effect:** The initial evidence (Intel deal, new office) dramatically increases the probability from the historical base rate. However, the subsequent clarification exempting two major players and the severe time constraint act as powerful countervailing forces. The posterior should be higher than the initial prior, but the exemptions and timeline likely pull it back down to a point where "No" is favored. Net effect is a moderate downward revision from the peak probability post-Intel deal.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Commerce Secretary Lutnick or President Trump publicly naming Samsung or Global Foundries as the next negotiation target.
    *   Leaks from the Commerce Department or a target company about active, advanced-stage negotiations.
    *   A target company (e.g., Global Foundries) announces financial difficulties or a need for immediate capital infusion.
    *   The Investment Accelerator announces a standardized template for equity deals to speed up negotiations.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A formal policy statement from the Commerce Department outlining the criteria for exemptions, potentially including all foreign-owned firms.
    *   Samsung or Global Foundries publicly stating they will not accept an equity deal and will forgo CHIPS funding if required.
    *   Key personnel from the Investment Accelerator resign or are reassigned.
    *   Congressional leaders from either party launch an investigation or legal challenge into the legality of the CHIPS program's repurposing.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Scope:** The question resolves "Yes" with *any amount* of stock. A small, symbolic warrant attached to a loan or grant could trigger resolution, even if it's not a major equity stake like Intel's.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Reality:** The administration's public vows may be negotiating tactics rather than firm policy. It is crucial to distinguish between political statements and concrete, reported deal-making activity.
*   **Timeline Illusion:** While 2.5 months is short, a deal that has been secretly in the works for longer could be announced before the deadline. We have imperfect information on the state of current talks.
*   **Subsidiary Complexity:** The resolution includes "US-based subsidiaries" (e.g., Samsung Austin Semiconductor). A deal could be structured with a subsidiary rather than the foreign parent, potentially making it more palatable for the company and legally simpler.

**Final Research Summary:** The administration has demonstrated both the will and the capacity to take equity stakes via the Intel deal. However, by exempting TSMC and Micron, it has signaled this is not a universal policy, and the extremely short timeline presents a formidable obstacle to finalizing another complex deal with a resistant company before 2026.

To forecast the probability of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for the US government taking equity stakes in major corporations outside of crisis situations is very low, estimated at <5% in any given 2-year period for a specific strategic-sector company. Given the context of the CHIPS Act and recent developments, a slightly higher base rate of 15% is reasonable, reflecting the administration's proactive policy shift.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves the US government potentially taking equity stakes in strategic-sector companies, similar to past crisis interventions.
   - Differences: This is a proactive policy shift rather than a crisis response, with a specific focus on semiconductor companies and a precedent set by the Intel deal.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Intel Deal (↑↑):** The successful Intel deal establishes a precedent, increasing the likelihood of similar deals. Likelihood ratio >1.
   - **Investment Accelerator (↑):** The creation of a dedicated office increases administrative capacity, slightly increasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio >1.
   - **Exemption for TSMC and Micron (↓↓):** This significantly narrows the field of potential targets, decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio <1.
   - **Corporate Pushback (↓):** Resistance from companies like TSMC indicates potential difficulties, decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio <1.
   - **Short Timeline (↓):** The limited time frame is a major constraint, decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio <1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 15%, the Intel deal and the establishment of the Investment Accelerator increase the probability. However, the exemptions for TSMC and Micron, corporate pushback, and the short timeline are strong countervailing forces.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Adjusting for the evidence, the probability increases initially but is then pulled back down by the negative evidence, resulting in a moderate downward revision from the peak probability post-Intel deal.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a deal being secretly in the works or a subsidiary-level agreement, suggests some uncertainty remains. However, the strong negative evidence and timeline constraints are compelling.
   - The best alternative forecast might consider a higher probability if there were indications of active negotiations or financial distress in target companies, but current evidence does not support this.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Taking into account the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability reflects a cautious approach, acknowledging both the precedent set by the Intel deal and the significant barriers to additional deals.

Final: 20%

# Will the US government acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US government acquiring stock in any of the specified semiconductor companies (Micron, TSMC, Samsung or US subsidiaries, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology) before 2026 (approximately 2.5 months from now).

The most appropriate reference class is recent US government equity acquisitions in strategic industries outside of financial crises. This is rare, with the most notable examples being:
- The 2008-2009 TARP program (crisis response)
- Occasional defense contractor arrangements
- The recent Intel deal (most relevant precedent)

Given the rarity of such arrangements in normal times, but accounting for the recent Intel precedent, I'll set a base rate of **15%**.

This reflects:
- The historical rarity of government equity stakes in private companies (~5% in any 2-year period)
- Adjusted upward due to the recent Intel precedent and explicit policy shift

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The semiconductor industry is considered strategically important to national security
- The CHIPS Act provides a legal framework and funding mechanism
- The Trump administration has demonstrated willingness to take equity stakes (Intel)

**Key differences:**
- Timeline constraint: Only 2.5 months remain until 2026
- Narrowed scope: The administration has explicitly exempted TSMC and Micron
- Resistance: Foreign companies like Samsung have shown resistance to equity arrangements
- Mechanism change: This represents a fundamental shift in how CHIPS Act funding works

These differences significantly impact the probability. The exemption of TSMC and Micron removes two major potential targets, while the short timeline creates a substantial practical barrier.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Intel deal completed with 10% government stake**
- P(E|H): ~0.95 (Very likely to see this if government will acquire more stakes)
- P(E|~H): ~0.20 (Could be a one-off special case)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75
- Direction: Strongly increases probability

**Evidence 2: TSMC and Micron explicitly exempted**
- P(E|H): ~0.30 (Unlikely to see major exemptions if policy is being broadly applied)
- P(E|~H): ~0.80 (More likely to see exemptions if no further deals are planned)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38
- Direction: Strongly decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Short timeline (2.5 months until 2026)**
- P(E|H): ~0.25 (Difficult but not impossible to complete complex negotiations in this timeframe)
- P(E|~H): ~0.90 (Very likely to see this constraint if no deals will complete)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.28
- Direction: Strongly decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Creation of Investment Accelerator to renegotiate CHIPS deals**
- P(E|H): ~0.90 (Very likely to create institutional capacity if planning more deals)
- P(E|~H): ~0.40 (Might create for other reasons or just for Intel)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- Direction: Moderately increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15:85 (0.18 odds ratio):

**Update on Intel deal:**
- Posterior odds = 0.18 × 4.75 = 0.86
- Posterior probability = 0.86/(1+0.86) ≈ 46%

**Update on TSMC/Micron exemption:**
- Posterior odds = 0.86 × 0.38 = 0.33
- Posterior probability = 0.33/(1+0.33) ≈ 25%

**Update on timeline constraint:**
- Posterior odds = 0.33 × 0.28 = 0.09
- Posterior probability = 0.09/(1+0.09) ≈ 8%

**Update on Investment Accelerator:**
- Posterior odds = 0.09 × 2.25 = 0.20
- Posterior probability = 0.20/(1+0.20) ≈ 17%

This sequential updating suggests a posterior probability around 17%, but I need to be careful about potential double-counting of evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the timeline constraint. Negotiations could be further along than publicly known.
- The question resolves "Yes" with ANY amount of stock, not necessarily a 10% stake like Intel. A smaller, symbolic stake would be easier to negotiate quickly.
- Samsung's US subsidiaries might be more amenable to a deal than the parent company.
- Global Foundries and Microchip Technology haven't made public statements opposing equity deals.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The administration could announce a deal in principle before 2026, with details to be finalized later.
- A company facing financial pressure might accept a deal for immediate funding.
- The administration might offer more favorable terms to secure a quick deal for political purposes.

**Adjustments:**
- The timeline constraint is significant but not insurmountable, especially for a motivated administration.
- The exemption of TSMC and Micron still leaves Samsung, Global Foundries, and Microchip as potential targets.
- The Intel precedent provides a template that could accelerate future negotiations.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my probability upward slightly from the 17% calculated above.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that the US government will acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026 at 20%.

This reflects:
- The demonstrated willingness to take equity stakes (Intel deal)
- The creation of institutional capacity (Investment Accelerator)
- Balanced against the narrowed scope (TSMC/Micron exemptions)
- The significant but not insurmountable timeline constraint
- The possibility of smaller, symbolic stakes that would still resolve "Yes"

Final: 20%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The central event is the US government taking an equity stake in a major semiconductor company as a tool of industrial policy, not as a crisis-era bailout.

- **Historical Base Rate:** The US government taking equity stakes in major corporations outside of a systemic crisis (like the 2008 TARP program) is extremely rare. A base rate for this occurring with any specific company in a given year would be very low, likely under 5%.
- **Adjusted Base Rate for New Policy:** However, the context has fundamentally changed. The Trump administration has explicitly stated this is its new policy, created an office (the 'US Investment Accelerator') to execute it, and has a successful precedent with the Intel deal. Therefore, the relevant reference class is not "all US industrial policy," but rather "follow-on actions after a new, aggressive policy with a successful precedent has been established." In such cases, the probability of at least one more action is significant.

Given this, a simple historical base rate is insufficient. I will set a prior of **25%**. This acknowledges that while such actions are historically rare, a new policy and a recent precedent make another instance plausible, though still far from certain. This corresponds to prior odds of 0.25 / 0.75 = 1:3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The primary base case is the recently announced Intel deal.

- **Similarities:** The administration's motivation (getting a "better deal" for taxpayers), the funding source (CHIPS Act), and the target sector (semiconductors) are identical. The same administrative body would likely be negotiating.
- **Differences:**
    1.  **Timeline:** The Intel deal was announced on August 28, 2025. The time remaining before the 2026 deadline is only ~2.5 months. This is an extremely compressed timeframe to negotiate and finalize a complex equity transaction from a standing start.
    2.  **Target Profile:** Intel is a US-based company. The remaining targets include foreign-owned giants (Samsung, TSMC) and smaller US-based firms (Global Foundries, Microchip). Foreign ownership introduces significant political and legal complexity.
    3.  **Element of Surprise:** The Intel deal set the precedent. Other companies are now aware of the administration's playbook and have had time to prepare their response, unlike Intel, which may have been caught more off-guard.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update my 25% prior based on the key pieces of evidence.

- **Evidence 1: The US Trade Secretary exempted TSMC and Micron.**
    - This is the most significant piece of evidence. It removes two of the five potential targets, narrowing the path to a "Yes" resolution.
    - P(E | H): If the government intends to acquire stock in *any* of the companies (H), it's plausible they would exempt the most difficult/critical ones to focus their efforts on more pliable targets. This could be seen as a pragmatic strategy.
    - P(E | ~H): If the government is going to fail to acquire any more stock (~H), it is very likely that this failure would be preceded by them backing down from powerful, resistant companies.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is ambiguous. It could signal a failing policy (LR < 1) or a focused, strategic policy (LR > 1). I interpret it as the latter: the administration is picking its battles, which slightly *increases* the chance of a "win" with a remaining target. I'll assign a small positive likelihood ratio of **1.3**.

- **Evidence 2: The extremely short timeline (~2.5 months).**
    - This is a powerful practical constraint.
    - P(E | H): If a deal is to be completed (H), it is very unlikely it could be initiated and finalized in such a short period. This would only be likely if negotiations were already at an advanced stage.
    - P(E | ~H): If no deal is completed (~H), the short timeline is a very strong and plausible explanation.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** This strongly favors "No". I'll estimate a likelihood ratio of **0.6**.

- **Evidence 3: The resolution criterion is for "any amount of stock".**
    - This lowers the bar for a "Yes" resolution significantly. A deal for warrants or a token <1% stake is much easier and faster to negotiate than a major 10% stake like Intel's. A company might concede on warrants to secure funding quickly.
    - P(E | H): If a deal happens (H), it is much more likely to be a small/symbolic one given the constraints. The low bar of the question makes H more probable.
    - P(E | ~H): If no deal happens (~H), the ease of this resolution path makes the failure to clear it more surprising.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence makes a "Yes" outcome substantially more likely. I'll estimate a likelihood ratio of **1.6**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will now update the prior odds using the likelihood ratios.

- **Prior Odds:** 1:3 (or 0.33), corresponding to 25% probability.

- **Step 1: Update for TSMC/Micron exemptions (LR = 1.3)**
    - Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR = 0.33 × 1.3 = 0.43
    - Posterior Probability = 0.43 / (1 + 0.43) ≈ 30%

- **Step 2: Update for short timeline (LR = 0.6)**
    - Posterior Odds = 0.43 × 0.6 = 0.258
    - Posterior Probability = 0.258 / (1 + 0.258) ≈ 20.5%

- **Step 3: Update for "any stock" resolution criterion (LR = 1.6)**
    - Posterior Odds = 0.258 × 1.6 = 0.413
    - **Final Posterior Probability** = 0.413 / (1 + 0.413) ≈ **29.2%**

The final probability after updating on the evidence is approximately 29%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~29% implies that "No" is the likely outcome, but there is a very substantial chance of "Yes".

- **Alternative Forecast (Higher, e.g., 50%):** This would be plausible if a deal with Global Foundries or Microchip is already in advanced stages. My forecast is vulnerable if negotiations have been progressing in secret since the 'US Investment Accelerator' was formed in April. The short timeline would then be an illusion. The administration's desire for another political "win" could be a powerful motivator to force a deal through.

- **Alternative Forecast (Lower, e.g., 10%):** This would be plausible if the Intel deal was truly unique and the political/corporate backlash has effectively killed the policy. The exemptions for TSMC/Micron could be the first sign that the administration has abandoned the strategy in practice, even if not in rhetoric. The remaining companies may simply refuse to negotiate, calculating that the US needs their fabs more than the administration needs a political victory.

My forecast of 29% attempts to balance these scenarios. It acknowledges the very real administrative hurdles and corporate resistance (favoring "No") but gives significant weight to the administration's proven intent and the low bar for resolution (favoring "Yes"). The largest uncertainty remains the unknown status of current negotiations.

### 6. Final Forecast
After weighing the base rate against the conflicting evidence, the analysis points to a "No" as the more probable outcome, primarily due to the severe time constraints. However, the administration's clear intent, the precedent of the Intel deal, and the low threshold for resolution ("any stock") create a non-trivial probability of a deal being finalized with one of the remaining, more pliable targets like Global Foundries or Microchip Technology. My final probability reflects this balance.

Final: 30%
