### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia - "President's Party" Rule:** The most salient reference class is Virginia gubernatorial elections relative to the party in the White House. Since 1977, the party not holding the presidency has won 11 of the 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections (~92% base rate). Assuming a Republican won the 2024 presidential election (as implied by the background), this strongly favors a Democratic win.
*   **Virginia - State Partisan Lean:** A second reference class is modern (post-2008) Virginia statewide elections (President, Senate, Governor). Democrats have won 13 of the last 16 contests (~81%), indicating a strong blue trend driven by demographics in Northern Virginia. This trend provides a floor for Democratic performance, even if the "President's Party" rule is the primary driver.
*   **New Jersey - Gubernatorial Elections:** The reference class of NJ gubernatorial elections since 2000 shows Democrats winning 4 of 6 races (67%). While the state is reliably blue in federal elections, gubernatorial races are often more competitive, with Republicans winning as recently as 2013. This suggests a baseline favoring Democrats but with significant variance.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-14] Ciattarelli (R-NJ) campaigns on suburban "overdevelopment crisis." (↓ for "Both") — This is a potent, localized issue that could peel away moderate suburban voters from the Democratic candidate, tightening the NJ race.
*   [2025-10-13] Key issues in NJ race are housing, immigration, and utility costs. (↓ for "Both") — These are affordability-focused topics that can benefit challengers and create headwinds for the party (Democrats) that has held the governorship for eight years.
*   [2025-09-21] Sherrill (D-NJ) campaign focuses on affordability and accountability. (↑ for "Both") — Indicates the Democratic campaign is not ceding ground on key economic issues and is actively working to neutralize a primary Republican line of attack.
*   [Fictional, per background] [2025-10-10] A major Virginia poll shows Spanberger (D) leading Earle-Sears (R) by 7 points. (↑ for "Both" / "Only Virginia") — A concrete polling lead outside the margin of error is strong, direct evidence for a Democratic win in Virginia.
*   [Fictional, per background] [2025-10-08] A Monmouth University poll in NJ shows Sherrill (D) leading Ciattarelli (R) by 5 points. (↑ for "Both" / "Only New Jersey") — While a lead, this is potentially within the margin of error and recalls the 2021 polling miss, but it still favors the Democrat.

To forecast the outcome of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to assign probabilities to each of the possible outcomes.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Both elections:** 
  - Virginia's historical trend of electing a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President gives Democrats a strong base rate (~92%). 
  - New Jersey has a Democratic base rate of 67% in gubernatorial elections since 2000. 
  - Combined, the base rate for Democrats winning both is roughly 92% * 67% = 61.64%.

- **Only Virginia:** 
  - Virginia's base rate for a Democratic win is 92%. 
  - The probability of New Jersey not going Democratic is 33% (1 - 67%). 
  - Combined, the base rate for Democrats winning only Virginia is 92% * 33% = 30.36%.

- **Only New Jersey:** 
  - New Jersey's base rate for a Democratic win is 67%. 
  - The probability of Virginia not going Democratic is 8% (1 - 92%). 
  - Combined, the base rate for Democrats winning only New Jersey is 67% * 8% = 5.36%.

- **Neither election:** 
  - The probability of neither state going Democratic is 8% * 33% = 2.64%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia:** The current scenario aligns well with the historical trend of electing a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President. Spanberger's lead in the polls further supports this.
  
- **New Jersey:** While historically competitive, the Democratic candidate is leading in the polls, albeit within a margin that recalls past polling errors.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia Polls:** A major poll shows Spanberger leading by 7 points, which is strong evidence for a Democratic win in Virginia (↑ for "Both" / "Only Virginia").
  
- **New Jersey Polls:** Sherrill leads by 5 points, which is positive but within the margin of error, suggesting some uncertainty (↑ for "Both" / "Only New Jersey").

- **Local Issues in NJ:** Ciattarelli's focus on suburban overdevelopment and affordability could sway moderate voters, introducing uncertainty (↓ for "Both").

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia:** The strong polling lead and historical trends reinforce the high probability of a Democratic win. The prior probability of 92% is adjusted slightly upwards due to the polling lead.

- **New Jersey:** The polling lead for Sherrill suggests a Democratic win, but the local issues and past polling errors introduce uncertainty. The prior probability of 67% is adjusted slightly downwards.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider potential polling errors and the impact of local issues in New Jersey. The possibility of a polling miss similar to 2021 should be factored in, slightly increasing the probability of a Republican win in New Jersey.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to 100% while reflecting the evidence and base rates.

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 60%  
Only Virginia: 28%  
Only New Jersey: 8%  
Neither election: 4%  

These probabilities reflect the strong Democratic base rate in Virginia, the competitive nature of New Jersey, and the current polling data.

# Analysis of 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Virginia:**
- Historical pattern: Since 1977, the party opposite the White House has won 11 of 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections (~92%)
- Recent partisan lean: Democrats have won 13 of 16 statewide elections since 2008 (~81%)
- Prior probability for Democratic win: ~85% (weighted average considering both patterns)

**New Jersey:**
- Recent gubernatorial elections: Democrats won 4 of 6 races since 2000 (~67%)
- 2021 election: Ciattarelli (R) narrowly lost with 48% of the vote
- Prior probability for Democratic win: ~65%

**Combined priors:**
- Both Democratic wins: 85% × 65% = ~55%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 85% × 35% = ~30%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: 15% × 65% = ~10%
- Neither Democratic win: 15% × 35% = ~5%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
- Virginia's pattern of electing governors from the opposite party of the White House remains relevant
- New Jersey continues to be a Democratic-leaning state but with competitive gubernatorial races
- Both races feature experienced politicians with name recognition

**Differences:**
- Current polling shows Democrats leading in both states
- Specific candidates and issues differ from previous elections
- The national political environment in 2025 may differ from previous cycles

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia Evidence:**
- Polling shows Spanberger (D) leading by ~7 points
  - P(E|H) for "Democrats win Virginia" = ~0.8 (polls often accurate but can miss)
  - P(E|~H) for "Democrats lose Virginia" = ~0.2 (would require significant polling error)
- Virginia's historical pattern strongly favors the out-party (Democrats in this scenario)
  - P(E|H) = ~0.9
  - P(E|~H) = ~0.1

**New Jersey Evidence:**
- Polling shows Sherrill (D) leading by ~5 points
  - P(E|H) for "Democrats win NJ" = ~0.7 (smaller lead, more uncertainty)
  - P(E|~H) for "Democrats lose NJ" = ~0.3 (polling errors of this magnitude are not uncommon)
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (48%)
  - P(E|H) for "Democrats win NJ" = ~0.6 (suggests a competitive race)
  - P(E|~H) for "Democrats lose NJ" = ~0.4 (shows Ciattarelli has strong base support)
- Campaign focus on housing, immigration, and utility costs
  - P(E|H) = ~0.5 (these issues don't clearly favor either party)
  - P(E|~H) = ~0.5

## 4. Bayesian Updating

**Virginia Update:**
- Prior odds for Democratic win: 85/15 = 5.67
- Likelihood ratio from polling: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 5.67 × 4 = 22.68
- Posterior probability: 22.68/(1+22.68) ≈ 96%

**New Jersey Update:**
- Prior odds for Democratic win: 65/35 = 1.86
- Likelihood ratio from polling: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Likelihood ratio from Ciattarelli's 2021 performance: 0.6/0.4 = 1.5
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~2.33 × 1.5 = ~3.5
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 3.5 = 6.51
- Posterior probability: 6.51/(1+6.51) ≈ 87%

**Combined posterior probabilities:**
- Both Democratic wins: 96% × 87% = ~84%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: 96% × 13% = ~12%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: 4% × 87% = ~3%
- Neither Democratic win: 4% × 13% = ~1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Polling errors can be correlated across states
- Late-breaking developments could shift both races
- Turnout in off-year elections is unpredictable
- The background information may not capture all relevant factors

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Republicans could outperform polls in both states as they did in some recent elections
- Local issues might override national patterns
- Voter turnout could differ significantly from expectations

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce confidence in "Both" outcome to account for correlated polling errors
- Increase probability of "Only Virginia" given stronger historical pattern there
- Slightly increase "Only New Jersey" and "Neither" to account for uncertainty

## 6. Final Normalization

After red-teaming and considering uncertainty:
- Both Democratic wins: ~75%
- Only Virginia Democratic win: ~18%
- Only New Jersey Democratic win: ~5%
- Neither Democratic win: ~2%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 75%  
Only Virginia: 18%  
Only New Jersey: 5%  
Neither election: 2%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To determine the probabilities for the four possible outcomes, I will first establish a prior probability for a Democratic win in each state individually.

*   **Virginia (VA):** The most relevant base rate is the "President's Party" rule. Since 1977, the party not holding the White House has won 11 of the 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections. The background information implies a Republican won the 2024 presidential election, making the Democrats the non-presidential party. This suggests a base rate of P(D_VA) ≈ 92%. A secondary base rate is the state's modern partisan lean; since 2008, Democrats have won ~81% of statewide races. Given the strength of the "President's Party" trend, I will set a strong initial prior of **P(D_VA) = 90%**.

*   **New Jersey (NJ):** The state is reliably blue in federal elections, but gubernatorial races are more competitive. Since 2000, Democrats have won 4 of 6 gubernatorial elections. This provides a base rate of P(D_NJ) ≈ 67%. The state has elected Republican governors recently (Chris Christie), so the race is not a foregone conclusion. I will set the initial prior at **P(D_NJ) = 65%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Virginia:** The current case fits the base rate scenario (an off-year election with an opposing party in the White House) almost perfectly. The candidates, Abigail Spanberger (D) and Winsome Earle-Sears (R), are both credible, with Spanberger having a track record in a swing district and Earle-Sears being the incumbent Lt. Governor. There are no immediate factors suggesting a major deviation from the historical pattern.

*   **New Jersey:** The case differs from a generic gubernatorial race because of the specific Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli. He significantly overperformed expectations in 2021, losing by only ~3 points. His demonstrated strength as a candidate in NJ makes this race likely more competitive than the 65% base rate would suggest for a generic Republican.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will now update these priors based on the specific evidence provided.

*   **Virginia Evidence:**
    *   **Polling:** A 7-point lead for Spanberger is strong evidence. The likelihood of seeing a 7-point lead is much higher if Spanberger is going to win than if she is going to lose (P(E|H) >> P(E|~H)). This evidence reinforces the strong prior.
    *   **Candidate Quality:** Spanberger's history as a moderate from a competitive district is a good fit for a statewide run in Virginia. This is a slight positive.
    *   **Update:** The polling evidence is confirmatory. I will maintain the **P(D_VA) at 90%**, viewing the polling as consistent with the strong historical prior rather than a reason to push it even higher into overconfidence territory (e.g., 95%+). This leaves a 10% chance for a major polling error or a late-breaking event.

*   **New Jersey Evidence:**
    *   **Ciattarelli's 2021 Performance:** This is strong evidence that the race is tighter than the base rate suggests. It significantly increases the likelihood of a Republican win compared to a generic scenario. This evidence pushes the probability down from 65%.
    *   **Polling:** A 5-point lead for Sherrill (D) is positive for Democrats. However, the background notes the 2021 polling miss, which underestimated Republican support. Therefore, this evidence should be weighted cautiously. It pushes the probability up, but not by much.
    *   **Campaign Issues:** The focus on affordability, housing, and utility costs often benefits the challenger party, creating a headwind for the Democrats who have held the governorship for eight years. This is a slight negative for the Democrats.
    *   **Update:** Ciattarelli's proven strength and the campaign issues are significant headwinds for Democrats. The modest polling lead for Sherrill provides a counterbalance. I will adjust the initial 65% prior downwards to reflect the competitiveness of this specific matchup. A final probability of **P(D_NJ) = 60%** seems appropriate, indicating the Democrat is favored but that there is a very substantial chance of a Republican victory.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior) and Correlation

Now, I will combine the individual probabilities—P(D_VA) = 90% and P(D_NJ) = 60%—to find the probabilities for the four options. A simple independent calculation would be:
*   Both: 0.90 * 0.60 = 54%
*   Only VA: 0.90 * 0.40 = 36%
*   Only NJ: 0.10 * 0.60 = 6%
*   Neither: 0.10 * 0.40 = 4%

However, these elections are not independent. They are subject to the same national political environment. A national "wave" favoring one party would increase the chances of that party winning both races. This means the "Both" and "Neither" outcomes are more likely, and the "split-ticket" outcomes ("Only VA", "Only NJ") are less likely than the independent calculation suggests. I will adjust for this correlation by shifting probability mass from the middle options to the tail options.

*   I will take 6 percentage points from "Only Virginia" and 1 percentage point from "Only New Jersey".
*   I will add 5 percentage points to "Both elections" and 2 percentage points to "Neither election".

This results in the following posterior distribution:
*   **Both elections:** 54% + 5% = 59%
*   **Only Virginia:** 36% - 6% = 30%
*   **Only New Jersey:** 6% - 1% = 5%
*   **Neither election:** 4% + 2% = 6%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

Is 90% for a Democratic win in Virginia too confident? The "President's Party" rule is extremely strong, but it did fail once. A 10% chance of failure seems reasonable to account for a major polling miss, a scandal, or an unexpectedly strong Republican wave. Is 60% for a Democratic win in New Jersey correct? It reflects a competitive race where the Democrat is favored, which aligns with the state's lean, the polling, and the strong Republican challenger. The correlation adjustment seems appropriate; a national environment is a key shared variable. The final distribution seems robust: "Both" is the most likely outcome, "Only Virginia" is the most plausible upset scenario (as NJ is the closer race), and "Only NJ" and "Neither" are correctly identified as low-probability tail risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

The adjusted probabilities are:
*   Both elections: 59%
*   Only Virginia: 30%
*   Only New Jersey: 5%
*   Neither election: 6%
These sum to 100% and represent my final forecast.

Both elections: 59%
Only Virginia: 30%
Only New Jersey: 5%
Neither election: 6%
