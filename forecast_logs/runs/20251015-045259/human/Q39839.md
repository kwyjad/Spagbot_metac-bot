### Reference class & base rates
*   **First Few Landing Attempts of a New Orbital-Class Reusable Booster:** This is the most relevant class, primarily defined by SpaceX's Falcon 9. Falcon 9 failed its first three ocean landing attempts before succeeding on the fourth. This suggests a base rate for success on a *second* attempt of around 20-30%. This class is limited as it's dominated by a single company's development path.
*   **Blue Origin Suborbital Booster Landings (New Shepard):** Blue Origin has a near-perfect record of successfully landing its suborbital New Shepard boosters. While this demonstrates core competency in vertical landing, the physics are significantly different and less demanding than an orbital-class booster recovery (lower speeds, altitudes, and thermal loads). This class suggests a higher base rate (>90%) but is a weak proxy for the orbital challenge.
*   **Maiden Flights of Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicles:** Historically, the success rate for the maiden flight of a new heavy-lift rocket is around 60%. New Glenn's first launch successfully reached orbit, outperforming this base rate for the ascent portion. However, this class does not inform the novel landing portion of the mission.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-12** ESCAPADE mission confirmed for NG-2 in "late 2025". — ↑ — Reinforces the company's and its customer's commitment to a launch within the resolution window.
*   **2025-10-09** New Glenn not selected for NSSL contracts. — ↓ — Increases pressure to succeed to gain certification, but also highlights that the vehicle is not yet considered operationally mature by the US Space Force.
*   **2025-09-26** Photo shows "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster nearly complete. — ↑ — Provides tangible evidence of hardware readiness, making a Q4 launch more credible.
*   **2025-08-14** 2025 launch target scaled back; next launch slips past Aug 15 target. — ↓ — Demonstrates a recent and ongoing pattern of schedule delays, reducing confidence in the "late 2025" window holding.
*   **2025-01-16** New Glenn maiden flight reaches orbit; booster landing fails. — ↓ — Establishes a 0% success rate (n=1) for the specific task in question, confirming its difficulty.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Launch Schedule Adherence:** Blue Origin has a multi-year history of significant delays. The primary driver of failure for this question is the launch date slipping into 2026. The current window is tight. (Large)
*   **Root Cause Analysis of First Landing Failure:** The probability of success hinges on whether the failure mode from the January 2025 attempt was correctly identified and robustly fixed. Blue Origin's "cautious" culture suggests they would be thorough. (Large)
*   **BE-4 Engine Maturity:** The seven BE-4 engines on the first stage have now flown successfully on both ULA's Vulcan and New Glenn's first flight. This reduces risk in the ascent and relight phases of the landing sequence. (Moderate)
*   **Customer & Certification Pressure:** The need to launch NASA's ESCAPADE mission and achieve NSSL certification creates strong incentives to launch in 2025 and demonstrate full mission capability, including recovery. (Moderate)
*   **Suborbital Landing Experience:** Decades of data from New Shepard landings provide a deep well of experience in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) for the terminal phase of landing, even if the overall mission profile is new. (Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Development Philosophy:** Unlike SpaceX's iterative, "fail-to-learn" approach which defined the base rate, Blue Origin's "Gradatim Ferociter" (step-by-step, ferociously) philosophy emphasizes extensive ground testing to minimize flight failures. This could lead to a higher success probability per attempt but also contributes to the schedule delays.
*   **Pre-existing Knowledge:** Blue Origin is not attempting this in a vacuum. They can learn from a decade of SpaceX's public successes and failures, potentially avoiding early pitfalls and accelerating their learning curve.
*   **Direct Suborbital Analogue:** Blue Origin's extensive and successful New Shepard landing program provides direct, albeit lower-energy, experience that SpaceX did not have when it began Falcon 9 landing attempts.
*   **Engine Technology:** New Glenn uses methalox (Methane/LOX) BE-4 engines, which have different relight characteristics and operational complexities compared to the Falcon 9's kerolox (Kerosene/RP-1) Merlin engines.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around 25% seems appropriate, anchored to the reference class of second orbital booster landing attempts (equivalent n≈4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The persistent and recent history of schedule slips makes a launch before year-end highly uncertain, significantly weighing against a "Yes" resolution.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard provides a strong, unique positive indicator for their ability to solve the GNC problem.
    *   (↑ Small) Tangible hardware progress (the booster is built) slightly increases confidence in the launch timeline.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The cautious culture, while potentially good for eventual success, has demonstrably created delays that threaten the 2025 timeline.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests a net downward update. The powerful negative signal from the high probability of schedule slip likely outweighs the positive signals related to technical competence for the landing itself. The posterior should move down from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcement of a firm launch date (e.g., "NET November 9" becomes "Targeting November 9").
    *   Successful static fire test of the "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster at the launch pad.
    *   Booster rollout to the launch pad.
    *   NASA confirmation of ESCAPADE's readiness and integration schedule.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official statement pushing the launch target to "December" or "Q1 2026".
    *   News of a failed test or required component replacement.
    *   NASA announcing a slip in the ESCAPADE launch window.
    *   Silence from Blue Origin as the November 9 target date approaches.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is notoriously secretive. Public information is scarce and highly curated, making it difficult to assess true progress and risk.
*   **Conflated Probabilities:** The question requires two independent events to occur: (1) a launch in 2025 and (2) a successful landing. It is easy to focus on the technical challenge of landing while underestimating the programmatic risk of delay.
*   **Definition of "Successful Landing":** The criteria are not specified. This is assumed to mean the booster lands on the platform in a recoverable state, but a hard landing where the vehicle is technically "recovered" but a total loss could be an edge case.
*   **Fictional Scenario:** This analysis is based on the provided sources and a hypothetical 2025 timeline. It must be insulated from real-world events outside this scenario.

**Final Research Summary:** The resolution hinges on two distinct probabilities: launch timing and landing success. While Blue Origin's technical experience suggests a reasonable chance of landing success *if they launch*, their consistent history of major schedule delays makes a launch within the tight, 10-week remaining window the dominant uncertainty and primary driver of a likely "No" outcome.

To forecast the probability of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launching before 2026 and successfully landing, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the success rate of second attempts at landing orbital-class reusable boosters, primarily informed by SpaceX's Falcon 9 history. Falcon 9 succeeded on its fourth attempt, suggesting a base rate for success on a second attempt of around 20-30%. Given Blue Origin's cautious approach, we will start with a prior probability of 25%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are attempting to land orbital-class boosters, which involves complex GNC and relight challenges.
   - Differences: Blue Origin's cautious, step-by-step approach contrasts with SpaceX's rapid iteration. Blue Origin also benefits from extensive suborbital landing experience and lessons learned from SpaceX's public trials.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Schedule Delays**: Blue Origin's history of delays suggests a high likelihood of slipping past 2025, decreasing the probability of a successful launch and landing within the timeframe. (Likelihood ratio < 1)
   - **Suborbital Experience**: Blue Origin's success with New Shepard landings provides a positive indicator for solving GNC challenges, slightly increasing the probability. (Likelihood ratio > 1)
   - **Hardware Readiness**: The completion of the booster increases confidence in a 2025 launch, but the impact is small given the tight schedule. (Likelihood ratio > 1)
   - **Cautious Culture**: While thorough, this approach has led to delays, reducing confidence in a timely launch. (Likelihood ratio < 1)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 25%, the evidence of schedule delays is a significant negative factor, while technical readiness and suborbital experience provide moderate positive signals.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (combined effect of evidence)
   - Given the strong negative impact of potential delays, the posterior probability is adjusted downward from the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence in technical readiness could overlook the dominant risk of schedule delays.
   - Alternative scenario: Blue Origin resolves schedule issues and launches successfully, but this is less likely given historical patterns.
   - Adjustments: Consider the high likelihood of delays as the primary risk, leading to a conservative forecast.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, the probability of Blue Origin launching "Never Tell Me The Odds" before 2026 and successfully landing is estimated at 15%.

Final: 15%

# Probability Analysis: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to consider two independent events: (1) the rocket launching before 2026 and (2) the first stage successfully landing.

The most relevant reference class is the success rate of second landing attempts for orbital-class reusable boosters. SpaceX's Falcon 9 failed its first three landing attempts before succeeding on the fourth, suggesting a base rate of around 20-30% for a second attempt.

However, this question requires both a timely launch AND a successful landing. Given Blue Origin's history of delays and the tight remaining window (only about 10 weeks left in 2025), I need to factor in the probability of launching on schedule.

**Prior probability**: I'll start with a prior of 25% based on the reference class of second orbital booster landing attempts, but this will need to be adjusted for the launch timing constraint.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Like SpaceX's early attempts, this is an early-stage orbital booster recovery program
- The physics challenges of decelerating, controlling, and landing a large orbital-class booster remain similar
- Both companies have strong engineering talent and financial resources

**Key differences**:
- Blue Origin has extensive experience with suborbital landings via New Shepard
- Blue Origin can learn from SpaceX's decade of public successes and failures
- Blue Origin's "cautious" development philosophy differs from SpaceX's rapid iteration
- The BE-4 methalox engines have different relight characteristics than SpaceX's kerolox Merlins
- The timeline constraint (before 2026) adds a significant hurdle not present in the base rate

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Schedule adherence history**
- P(Delays | Launch in 2025) is low
- P(Delays | No launch in 2025) is high
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors "No"
- Blue Origin has consistently missed deadlines, with the recent August 2025 target already slipping
- With only 10 weeks remaining in 2025, any further delays would push beyond the resolution window

**Evidence 2: Hardware readiness**
- P(Booster nearly complete | Launch in 2025) is high
- P(Booster nearly complete | No launch in 2025) is moderate
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Yes"
- Photos from September 2025 show the "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster nearly complete
- This suggests hardware readiness may not be the limiting factor

**Evidence 3: First landing attempt results**
- P(First landing failed | Second landing succeeds) is moderate
- P(First landing failed | Second landing fails) is high
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "No"
- The January 2025 landing attempt failed, establishing a 0% success rate (n=1)
- This confirms the technical difficulty of the landing task

**Evidence 4: Suborbital landing experience**
- P(Extensive suborbital success | Orbital landing success) is high
- P(Extensive suborbital success | Orbital landing failure) is moderate
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Yes"
- Blue Origin has a near-perfect record with New Shepard landings
- This demonstrates core competency in vertical landing technology, though at lower energies

**Evidence 5: Customer and certification pressure**
- P(NASA mission scheduled | Launch in 2025) is high
- P(NASA mission scheduled | No launch in 2025) is moderate
- Likelihood ratio moderately favors "Yes"
- The ESCAPADE mission is confirmed for NG-2 in "late 2025"
- This creates strong incentives to launch within the resolution window

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 25%, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on schedule adherence history**:
- This is the strongest negative factor
- Prior odds: 25% / 75% = 1/3
- Likelihood ratio: approximately 1/3 (strong negative)
- Posterior odds: 1/3 × 1/3 = 1/9
- Posterior probability: 1/9 ÷ (1 + 1/9) ≈ 10%

**Update on hardware readiness and customer pressure**:
- These provide moderate positive evidence
- Prior odds (from previous step): 10% / 90% = 1/9
- Combined likelihood ratio: approximately 2 (moderate positive)
- Posterior odds: 1/9 × 2 = 2/9
- Posterior probability: 2/9 ÷ (1 + 2/9) ≈ 18%

**Update on technical factors (first attempt results vs. suborbital experience)**:
- These roughly balance each other out
- Prior odds (from previous step): 18% / 82% ≈ 2/9
- Combined likelihood ratio: approximately 1 (neutral)
- Posterior odds remain at 2/9
- Posterior probability remains at approximately 18%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting Blue Origin's history of delays. If they've learned from past mistakes, they could be more schedule-reliable now.
- I might be underestimating the technical challenge. Even SpaceX took four attempts to succeed, and Blue Origin may face unique challenges.
- The definition of "successful landing" is not precisely specified. A partial success might count differently than I've assumed.

**Alternative forecast**:
A reasonable alternative would be a higher probability (30-35%) based on:
- Blue Origin's extensive ground testing might lead to higher per-attempt success rates
- The ESCAPADE mission creates strong incentives to launch in 2025
- Their suborbital experience provides valuable expertise for the landing phase

**Rebuttal to alternative**:
- The schedule constraint remains the dominant factor. Even with strong incentives, complex aerospace projects routinely face delays.
- Only 10 weeks remain in 2025, leaving little margin for any issues
- The question requires both launch timing AND landing success, multiplying the probabilities

After this consideration, I'll make a small upward adjustment to 20% to account for the possibility that I've overweighted the schedule risk.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the dual requirements of this question (launch timing AND landing success), I arrive at a final probability of 20%.

Final: 20%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question requires two independent events to occur: (1) the rocket launches in 2025, and (2) the booster landing is successful. I will establish a prior for each component and combine them.

*   **P(Successful Landing | Launch):** The most relevant reference class is the success rate of early landing attempts for new orbital-class reusable boosters. The only available data is from SpaceX's Falcon 9, which succeeded on its fourth ocean landing attempt. This suggests a low success rate for any given early attempt. A base rate of **25%** for success on a second attempt seems appropriate, reflecting that it's a difficult task with a high chance of failure early in a program.
*   **P(Launch in 2025):** The current date is October 15, 2025, leaving approximately 10 weeks in the year. The base rate for a new heavy-lift rocket making its second flight within a specific ~3-month window is low, given the industry's general tendency for delays. A base rate of **40%** seems like a reasonable starting point for a generic company in this situation.

Combining these gives a joint prior probability: P(Event) = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Successful Landing | Launch) = 0.40 × 0.25 = **10%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The mission profile (orbital launch, booster return to a sea platform) is fundamentally similar to the Falcon 9 base case. It is the second attempt after a first failure, placing it early in the learning curve.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(Pro) Learning from Precedent:** Blue Origin has had a decade to observe SpaceX's public successes and failures, which should allow them to avoid some early design and operational mistakes.
    *   **(Pro) Suborbital Experience:** Blue Origin has a near-perfect record of landing its suborbital New Shepard booster. While the energy regime is much less demanding, this provides invaluable real-world data on guidance, navigation, control (GNC), and engine throttling for the terminal landing phase—an advantage SpaceX did not have.
    *   **(Con) Schedule Adherence:** Blue Origin's specific history is one of profound and consistent schedule slips, far exceeding the industry average. This makes the "launch in 2025" component much less likely than the generic base rate suggests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the two components of the probability separately.

**A. On the probability of launching in 2025 (Prior: 40%)**

*   **Evidence (Strongly Negative):** Blue Origin's multi-year history of delays with New Glenn, including a recent slip past an August 2025 target. This specific track record is strong evidence that a launch within the tight 10-week window is unlikely. P(History of Delays | Slip to 2026) > P(History of Delays | Launch in 2025). This significantly lowers the probability.
*   **Evidence (Slightly Positive):** The booster "Never Tell Me The Odds" is physically nearing completion, and a customer (NASA's ESCAPADE) is manifested for a "late 2025" launch. This provides tangible evidence of progress and intent.

**Update on P(Launch in 2025):** The company's specific, long-term pattern of delays is a much stronger signal than the generic base rate or recent hardware photos. I will update the probability of a 2025 launch down from the 40% base rate to **25%**.

**B. On the probability of a successful landing, given a launch (Prior: 25%)**

*   **Evidence (Strongly Positive):** The extensive and successful New Shepard landing program. This demonstrates mastery of the core competencies for the terminal phase of a propulsive landing. This evidence is far more likely if they have a high chance of technical success (P(E|H)) than if they don't (P(E|~H)).
*   **Evidence (Moderately Positive):** The ability to learn from SpaceX's public data and the maturity of the BE-4 engines (having now flown twice).

**Update on P(Successful Landing | Launch):** The New Shepard experience is a powerful positive indicator that is unique to Blue Origin and not present in the Falcon 9 base case. It suggests their technical ability to perform the landing is significantly higher than the 25% prior. I will update this conditional probability to **55%**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will now combine the updated probabilities of the two independent components.

*   Updated P(Launch in 2025) = 25%
*   Updated P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025) = 55%

Posterior Probability = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025)
Posterior Probability = 0.25 × 0.55 = 0.1375

This calculation results in a final probability of approximately 14%. The initial 10% prior is updated upwards because the strong positive evidence for technical landing competence (a jump from 25% to 55%) outweighs the strong negative evidence for meeting the schedule (a drop from 40% to 25%).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast could be too low if the main development bottleneck (the BE-4 engine) is truly solved, allowing for a much faster launch campaign than historical data suggests. The pressure from NASA could also accelerate the timeline. My forecast could be too high if I am overestimating the relevance of the suborbital New Shepard data to the much more challenging orbital re-entry environment. The schedule risk is the dominant factor; any single delay in testing, weather, or range availability in the next 10 weeks would push the launch to 2026, making the probability 0%. The 75% chance of a schedule slip seems very plausible and is the primary driver of the low final forecast. The two-part nature of the question (timing AND success) makes a low probability outcome the most likely scenario.

### 6. Final Forecast

The analysis hinges on two main uncertainties: the schedule and the technology. While Blue Origin's technical experience with New Shepard provides a solid reason to be optimistic about the landing itself, their consistent and significant historical delays make a launch in the remaining 10 weeks of 2025 a major challenge. The high probability of a schedule slip into 2026 is the dominant factor, keeping the overall probability low.

Final: 14%
