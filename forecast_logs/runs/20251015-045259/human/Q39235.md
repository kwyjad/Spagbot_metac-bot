### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2020-2022):** This is the most relevant reference class, as it reflects current response capabilities, including the availability of the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine.
    *   **Data:** Three outbreaks in the DRC since the large Kivu epidemic ended and vaccine use became standard.
        *   Équateur (2020): 55 deaths
        *   North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
        *   Équateur (2022): 5 deaths
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths is 6. The range is 5-55. This class suggests that most outbreaks are now contained very quickly with a low death toll, but that a moderate outbreak in the ~50-60 death range is plausible.
    *   **Limitations:** A very small sample size (n=3) makes this class indicative but not statistically robust.

2.  **All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-2022):** This class provides a view of the full range of possibilities, including catastrophic tail risks, before the vaccine became a game-changer.
    *   **Data:** The DRC has experienced 15 outbreaks prior to the current one. The death tolls are highly skewed.
        *   Notable large outbreaks (deaths): Kivu (2018-20) ~2,287; Yambuku (1976) ~280; Kikwit (1995) ~250.
        *   Most other outbreaks were under 100 deaths, with many under 50.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median is low (approx. 30-40 deaths), but the mean is high (~200 deaths) due to the extreme skew from the Kivu epidemic. This highlights the power-law-like distribution of epidemic severity.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is less relevant for the central estimate due to major advances in treatment and prevention (vaccines), but it is crucial for understanding the worst-case scenarios and tail risks.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-07** Outbreak size updated to 64 cases and 43 deaths. — ↑ — Shows sustained transmission over the first month and that the outbreak has already surpassed the death toll of the last two DRC outbreaks (2021, 2022).
*   **2025-09-05** WHO officially reports on the outbreak. — ↓ — Signals that international and national response mechanisms have been activated, which is critical for containment.
*   **2025-09-04** DRC declares the new outbreak in Kasaï Province. — ↑/↓ — The declaration is a necessary step for mobilizing resources (↓), but the initial reported size (32 cases, 15 deaths) was already non-trivial (↑).
*   **2025-08-25** Death of the first known case. — ↑ — Establishes the start of the transmission timeline, indicating the virus was circulating for at least a week before the official alert.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed and Efficacy of Response:** (Large) The single most important factor. Rapid deployment of contact tracers, mobile labs, treatment centers, and ring vaccination campaigns can stop an outbreak in its tracks. Delays of even a few weeks can lead to exponential growth.
2.  **Vaccine Availability and Uptake:** (Large) The Ervebo vaccine is highly effective. The ability to quickly procure and administer it to contacts and contacts-of-contacts ("ring vaccination") is the primary tool for containment in the modern era.
3.  **Geographic Location and Population Density:** (Moderate-Large) The outbreak is in Kasaï Province, described as remote. This is a double-edged sword: it can slow geographic spread to major urban centers but also severely hampers the logistical efforts of response teams to bring in staff and supplies.
4.  **Security and Community Trust:** (Large) The 2018-20 Kivu outbreak demonstrated that conflict and community mistrust can be catastrophic, preventing healthcare workers from doing their jobs. While Kasaï is not Kivu, any local instability or resistance to response efforts could dramatically worsen the outcome.
5.  **Pre-existing Healthcare Infrastructure:** (Moderate) The capacity of local clinics to identify, isolate, and treat initial cases without becoming centers of amplification is key. Weak infrastructure can accelerate early spread before a full-scale response is mounted.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Outpacing Recent Precedent:** The current outbreak, with 43 deaths by early October, has already exceeded the final toll of the 2021 (6 deaths) and 2022 (5 deaths) outbreaks. This suggests initial containment was less successful or the circumstances are more challenging.
*   **Location in Kasaï Province:** Most recent outbreaks have been in the Équateur or Kivu provinces, where response teams have deep, recent experience. While the DRC has national capacity, the specific logistical and social challenges of Kasaï may be different and less familiar to responders.
*   **Not a High-Intensity Conflict Zone (vs. Kivu):** Unlike the 2018-20 Kivu epidemic, this outbreak is not occurring in a region with active, large-scale armed conflict. This is a significant advantage and makes a repeat of the Kivu catastrophe highly unlikely. However, the Kasaï region has a history of instability that could still pose challenges.
*   **Established Modern Response Playbook:** Compared to the full historical base rate (pre-2018), the existence of a proven vaccine, therapeutic treatments, and a well-honed international response protocol fundamentally changes the dynamic of any outbreak. A failure to contain is now more of a logistical/social failure than a purely epidemiological one.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior would be a distribution centered on the post-vaccine reference class, perhaps a log-normal distribution with a median around 25 deaths (between the 6 and 55 of the reference class) and significant variance to account for uncertainty. Equivalent n is low (~5), reflecting the small reference class and high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The death toll has already reached 43, placing it near the top of the post-vaccine reference class. This strongly suggests the final outcome will be larger than the median of that class.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The growth from 15 to 43 deaths in ~30 days indicates a reproduction number that was significantly above 1, meaning transmission was not under control during September.
    *   **↓ (Large):** A full-scale response, including vaccination, is presumably underway. This is a powerful force for containment that should bend the curve downwards.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The absence of Kivu-level armed conflict is a major positive factor, making response efforts far more feasible.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the posterior estimate upwards from the initial prior. The fact that the outbreak has already grown this large despite modern tools suggests a final toll well above the recent median of 6. The posterior median should likely shift into the **75-125 death range**, with the upper tail of the distribution (for >200 deaths) being thicker than the prior suggested, but still representing a low-probability outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmed cases appearing in a major city (e.g., Kananga or Mbuji-Mayi).
    *   Weekly case growth rate remaining positive or flattening at a high level.
    *   Reports of attacks on healthcare workers or significant community resistance.
    *   Any spread to a neighboring country.
    *   Reports of vaccine or supply chain shortages.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Two consecutive weeks of declining new case numbers (the strongest signal).
    *   High reported ring vaccination coverage (>80%) in affected health zones.
    *   No new cases reported outside the initial cluster of health zones for >21 days.
    *   The ratio of new deaths to new cases begins to decline, suggesting better clinical outcomes.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lags and Accuracy:** Information from a remote region like Kasaï is likely to be delayed and subject to revision. The true number of cases/deaths could be higher than reported.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves on Jan 1, 2026 (~2.5 months away). This timeframe makes a multi-thousand death epidemic like Kivu impossible. The forecast is for a relatively rapid, single-wave outbreak.
*   **Definition of "Linked":** If the outbreak spreads across borders, attributing deaths correctly as "linked to this outbreak" could become complex, though it is unlikely to be a major issue given the probable scale.
*   **Political Instability:** The broader political situation in the DRC is a constant source of uncertainty and could divert resources or attention away from the outbreak response.
*   **Sudan Ebolavirus Risk:** While unlikely, if this outbreak were caused by the Sudan strain (as in Uganda 2022), the Ervebo vaccine would be ineffective, and the forecast would need to be revised dramatically upwards. This is a low-probability, high-impact risk.

**Final Research Summary:**
The current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï has already proven more severe than recent post-vaccine outbreaks in the DRC, indicating challenges in early containment. While the powerful tools of vaccination and experienced response teams should prevent a catastrophic Kivu-scale scenario, the sustained initial growth suggests a final death toll in the high tens to low hundreds is plausible.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province, DRC, before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is the post-vaccine DRC Ebola outbreaks (2020-2022), with a median of 6 deaths and a range of 5-55 deaths. This reflects the impact of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and modern containment strategies.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** The median is 6 deaths, with a variance reflecting the range up to 55 deaths. This distribution is skewed towards lower death counts due to effective containment in recent outbreaks.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current outbreak benefits from the same vaccine and international response protocols as recent outbreaks.
- **Differences:** The current outbreak has already resulted in 43 deaths, surpassing recent precedents, indicating initial containment challenges. The location in Kasaï Province presents unique logistical challenges compared to previous outbreaks in more familiar regions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **↑ (Large):** The death toll of 43 already exceeds recent post-vaccine outbreaks, suggesting a more severe outbreak.
- **↑ (Moderate):** Rapid increase from 15 to 43 deaths in a month indicates high transmission.
- **↓ (Large):** Ongoing international response and vaccination efforts are expected to curb further spread.
- **↓ (Moderate):** Lack of high-intensity conflict in Kasaï, unlike Kivu, aids containment efforts.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Log-normal distribution centered around 25 deaths, reflecting post-vaccine data.
- **Evidence Update:** The current death toll and growth rate push the posterior upwards. The effective response and lack of conflict push downwards.
- **Posterior Shift:** The median shifts to 75-125 deaths, with a thicker upper tail for >200 deaths, reflecting the current outbreak's severity and containment efforts.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of underreporting or delayed data from Kasaï.
- **Tail Risks:** The potential for spread to urban centers or neighboring countries, though unlikely, could increase deaths.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with faster containment could result in fewer deaths, but current evidence supports a higher estimate.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the number of deaths are:

P10: 50  
P20: 65  
P40: 85  
P60: 105  
P80: 140  
P90: 180

# Forecasting Ebola Deaths in the DRC Outbreak (2025-2026)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two key reference classes to establish a prior:

**Post-Vaccine DRC Ebola Outbreaks (2020-2022):**
- Équateur (2020): 55 deaths
- North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
- Équateur (2022): 5 deaths
- Median: 6 deaths, Mean: ~22 deaths, Range: 5-55 deaths

**All DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-2022):**
- 15 outbreaks with highly skewed distribution
- Notable large outbreaks: Kivu (2018-20) ~2,287 deaths; Yambuku (1976) ~280; Kikwit (1995) ~250
- Most outbreaks under 100 deaths
- Median: ~35 deaths, Mean: ~200 deaths (skewed by Kivu)

For my prior, I'll use a log-normal distribution centered between these reference classes, with a median of approximately 25 deaths and significant variance to account for uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same disease (Ebola) in the same country (DRC)
- Modern response capabilities including the Ervebo vaccine
- Similar rural/remote setting as many previous outbreaks

**Key differences:**
- Current outbreak has already reached 43 deaths (as of Oct 7, 2025), exceeding the final toll of the 2021 and 2022 outbreaks
- Location in Kasaï Province differs from recent outbreaks in Équateur or Kivu
- Not occurring in a high-intensity conflict zone like Kivu (positive factor)
- Sustained transmission over the first month suggests initial containment challenges

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
- Already 43 deaths recorded, indicating this outbreak is larger than recent ones
- Growth from 15 to 43 deaths in ~30 days shows R₀ > 1 during September
- Remote location in Kasaï may hamper rapid response logistics
- Outbreak was already substantial (32 cases, 15 deaths) when first detected

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
- Modern response protocols including vaccination are powerful containment tools
- Absence of major armed conflict (unlike Kivu) should enable better response
- International attention and WHO involvement activated quickly
- Short time horizon (only ~2.5 months until Jan 1, 2026) limits potential growth

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 25 deaths (median):

**First update - Current death toll:**
- Evidence: 43 deaths already recorded
- Likelihood ratio: This strongly favors outcomes above the prior median
- Posterior shift: Median shifts upward to ~80 deaths

**Second update - Growth trajectory:**
- Evidence: Growth from 15 to 43 deaths in one month
- Likelihood ratio: This suggests continued growth but likely with diminishing rate as response intensifies
- Posterior shift: Median shifts to ~100 deaths, with wider upper tail

**Third update - Response capabilities:**
- Evidence: Vaccine availability and absence of major conflict
- Likelihood ratio: This favors more rapid containment than historical worst cases
- Posterior adjustment: Tightens the upper tail, reducing probability of outcomes >300 deaths

The resulting posterior has a median around 100 deaths, with significant uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Data lags from remote regions could mean current figures undercount true impact
- Political instability in DRC could suddenly worsen, hampering response
- Vaccine hesitancy or community resistance could emerge
- If this were the Sudan strain of Ebola (unlikely), the Ervebo vaccine would be ineffective

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might argue that modern response capabilities will quickly bend the curve, resulting in a final toll of only 60-70 deaths. This is plausible if:
- Ring vaccination proves highly effective in this context
- No spread to urban centers occurs
- Community engagement is strong

However, the already substantial death toll and growth trajectory suggest this is less likely.

**Tail risks:**
- Spread to a major urban center could cause a significant jump in cases
- Supply chain issues could hamper vaccine distribution
- Cross-border spread could complicate containment

I'll widen my uncertainty bands to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 70
P40: 90
P60: 115
P80: 160

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the set of Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since the widespread adoption of the rVSV-ZEBOV (Ervebo) vaccine. This reference class includes three outbreaks from 2020-2022.

*   **Data:**
    *   Équateur (2020): 55 deaths
    *   North Kivu (2021): 6 deaths
    *   Équateur (2022): 5 deaths
*   **Distribution:** This small dataset suggests a highly right-skewed distribution. The median is 6 deaths, while the mean is 22. Most post-vaccine outbreaks are contained very quickly with minimal fatalities, but a moderately sized outbreak in the range of 50-60 deaths is a plausible outcome.
*   **Prior Model:** My prior distribution is centered on these recent outcomes. I would model this as a log-normal distribution with a median of approximately 20 deaths, reflecting the skew, but with high variance due to the small sample size (n=3). This prior acknowledges that while small outcomes are most common, larger ones are possible.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current outbreak is in the DRC, a nation with significant, albeit strained, experience in Ebola response. The modern toolkit, including the Ervebo vaccine and international support protocols, is available, as it was for the base rate outbreaks.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Initial Scale:** The most critical difference is that the current outbreak has already caused 43 deaths as of October 7, 2025. This already places it near the top of the post-vaccine reference class and means it has definitively escaped the rapid containment that characterized the 2021 and 2022 outbreaks.
    2.  **Location:** The outbreak is in Kasaï Province. This is a less common location for Ebola than Équateur or the Kivus, which could mean less experienced local response teams and unique logistical challenges due to the region's remoteness.
    3.  **Security Context:** Unlike the catastrophic 2018-20 Kivu epidemic, Kasaï is not an active high-intensity conflict zone. This is a major advantage, making a successful response far more feasible and a Kivu-scale disaster highly unlikely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence 1: Death toll at 43 as of Oct 7.** This is the single most important piece of evidence. This observation is extremely unlikely under a hypothesis that the final toll will be small (e.g., <50). It is much more consistent with a final toll in the high tens or low hundreds. This evidence provides a hard floor for the forecast and strongly pushes the entire distribution upwards.
*   **Evidence 2: Growth from 15 to 43 deaths in one month (Sept 7 - Oct 7).** This indicates that the effective reproduction number (R_eff) was significantly above 1 for the first month of the response. This outbreak has momentum. This evidence suggests that even with an improving response, deaths will continue to accrue for several weeks from people who are already infected. This reinforces the strong upward update.
*   **Evidence 3: Full-scale response is underway.** The involvement of the WHO and the DRC Ministry of Health activates the modern Ebola response playbook (ring vaccination, therapeutics, contact tracing). This is a powerful force for containment that drastically lowers the probability of catastrophic tail-risk scenarios (>500 deaths). This evidence puts a "soft cap" on the upper end of the forecast.
*   **Evidence 4: Location in remote Kasaï Province.** This is a mixed factor. Remoteness can slow spread to major urban centers (downward pressure), but it also complicates logistics for the response team (upward pressure). Given the initial failure of containment, the logistical challenges appear to be a dominant factor, providing a partial explanation for the outbreak's current size and suggesting continued difficulties.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A log-normal distribution with a median around 20 deaths and a 90th percentile around 60 deaths.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The evidence that the death toll is already 43 and grew substantially during the first month makes the prior untenable. This new information is far more likely under a scenario where the final death toll is >75 than <75.
*   **Posterior:** The prior distribution is shifted significantly to the right. The new lower bound is effectively the current death toll (~43-50, accounting for lags). The central tendency of the forecast moves from ~20 to the 80-120 range. The outbreak has already "broken out" of the small-scale containment pattern. The posterior median should now be around 100 deaths. The right tail, while capped by the effectiveness of a full-scale response, must be substantial to account for the possibility of logistical or social failures. The final distribution is still right-skewed, reflecting that a complete response failure is a higher-impact risk than a surprisingly fast containment from this point.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overly Pessimistic Case:** Could I be underestimating the response? The growth to 43 deaths might represent the peak of uncontrolled spread just before the response became fully effective. If ring vaccination is now working perfectly, new transmissions could drop to near zero, and the final toll might only be around 60-70 as existing cases resolve. This scenario informs the lower percentiles of my forecast.
*   **Overly Optimistic Case:** Could I be underestimating the challenges? My forecast assumes the modern response will eventually work. However, community resistance, even without armed conflict, could severely hamper efforts. A logistical breakdown in a remote region is also a real possibility. If the response falters for another month or two, the death toll could easily climb into the 150-250 range, similar to some pre-vaccine historical outbreaks. This risk of significant failure informs the upper percentiles.
*   **Black Swan:** The report mentions the risk of this being the Sudan ebolavirus strain, for which the Ervebo vaccine is ineffective. This is a very low-probability event (all prior DRC outbreaks were Zaire ebolavirus) but would result in a dramatically worse outcome. I will account for this by slightly thickening the extreme upper tail of my distribution.

After considering these alternatives, my central estimate remains robust, but I will ensure my final percentiles reflect this wide range of possibilities, from a rapid, successful containment effort from this point forward to a significantly troubled response.
