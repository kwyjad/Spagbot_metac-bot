### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent Nov/Dec Periods (2021-2024):** This class captures the current high-temperature regime. The peak daily anomalies in this period provide a relevant range.
    *   **Nov/Dec 2023 (Strong El Niño):** Monthly anomalies were exceptionally high (~+1.75°C vs 1991-2020 baseline). The peak daily anomaly likely approached or exceeded **1.90°C**.
    *   **Nov/Dec 2022 (La Niña):** Monthly anomalies were lower, around +1.20°C. The peak daily anomaly was likely in the **1.35-1.45°C** range.
    *   **Nov/Dec 2021 (La Niña):** Similar to 2022, with monthly anomalies around +1.25°C and a likely daily peak in the **1.40-1.50°C** range.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class provides recent, high-quality data under modern climate conditions. Its limitation is the small sample size and high variability due to different ENSO phases.

2.  **Post-El Niño to Weak La Niña Transition Years (e.g., 2010, 2016):** This class is mechanistically similar to the current situation. These years tend to be cooler than the preceding El Niño peak but warmer than established La Niña years due to residual ocean heat.
    *   **Nov/Dec 2016:** Following a major El Niño, this period saw a weak La Niña develop. Monthly anomalies were around +1.30°C, suggesting a daily peak around **1.40-1.50°C**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class offers a better causal analogue. However, the global baseline temperature was significantly lower in these past events, meaning these historical values should be considered a lower bound. Adjusting for ~0.2°C of warming since 2016 would place the base rate closer to **1.60-1.70°C**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-09** NOAA confirms La Niña emerged in September and is expected to persist. **(↓)** — The primary global short-term cooling mechanism is now officially active, exerting downward pressure on temperature anomalies.
*   **2025-10-09** Forecasts consistently describe the La Niña as "weak" and potentially "short-lived." **(↑)** — Mitigates the cooling effect, suggesting anomalies will remain much higher than during the stronger 2020-2022 La Niña event.
*   **2025-10-01** September 2025 was the third-warmest on record globally. **(↑)** — Establishes a very high thermal baseline entering the forecast period, indicating significant inertia in the climate system that will resist cooling.
*   **2025-10-01** The 12-month mean anomaly (Oct 2024-Sep 2025) was 1.51°C above pre-industrial. **(↑)** — Reinforces the high-energy state of the climate system, making a drop to pre-2022 anomaly levels unlikely.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **ENSO Phase (La Niña):** The presence of cooler-than-average waters in the equatorial Pacific has a global teleconnection that lowers average global temperatures. This is the primary driver pushing the forecast down. **(Large impact)**
2.  **Long-term Anthropogenic Warming Trend:** The inexorable background trend from greenhouse gas emissions provides a powerful, persistent upward pressure on all temperature measurements. **(Large impact)**
3.  **Global Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs):** Outside of the equatorial Pacific, many ocean basins (especially the Atlantic) remain at or near record warmth. This acts as a massive heat reservoir, counteracting La Niña's cooling influence. **(Large impact)**
4.  **Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Water Vapor:** The 2022 eruption injected a significant amount of stratospheric water vapor (a greenhouse gas), which is still exerting a small but persistent warming effect. **(Small impact)**
5.  **Short-term Weather Variability:** The question resolves on a *single day's peak*. Specific synoptic-scale weather patterns can cause short-term global temperature spikes or dips independent of the broader climate state. This adds significant variance to the forecast. **(Small impact on mean, Large impact on peak)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Baseline Warmth:** The global system, particularly ocean heat content, is far warmer than during any previous La Niña event. This creates a fundamental tension where a cooling pattern is imposed on a record-hot background.
*   **Weakness of the Forcing Event:** Unlike the multi-year, moderate-to-strong La Niña of 2020-2022, this event is forecast to be weak and brief. Its cooling capacity is therefore expected to be substantially lower.
*   **Lingering El Niño Heat:** The system is still shedding heat from the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño. This thermal inertia will blunt the initial cooling impact of the developing La Niña.
*   **Compounding Warming Factors:** The small but positive forcing from the Hunga Tonga eruption was not a factor in previous La Niña reference class years, adding a slight upward nudge to the baseline.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be anchored to the peak daily anomaly during the 2016 weak La Niña, adjusted for subsequent background warming. This suggests a prior centered around **1.60°C** with moderate confidence (equivalent n of ~10), reflecting that the analogy is good but not perfect.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Official confirmation of La Niña conditions provides strong evidence for a cooling trend relative to the 2023-2024 peak.
    *   **↑ (Large):** The characterization of the La Niña as "weak" and the continued record warmth of non-Pacific oceans severely limits the potential for cooling.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The fact that September 2025 was still the 3rd warmest on record, even as La Niña was emerging, demonstrates the system's powerful thermal inertia.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests that while temperatures will be lower than the El Niño-driven peaks of 2023-2024, they will remain exceptionally high for a La Niña period. The downward pressure is real but is being largely offset by the high baseline and weakness of the event. The posterior should remain close to the prior, perhaps shifting slightly lower to **~1.58°C**, but with increased confidence that it will not drop to the levels seen in 2021-2022.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   NOAA/CPC weekly ENSO updates show Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) values weakening or trending back toward neutral (-0.5°C).
    *   Global SST anomaly maps from Copernicus show persistent or intensifying marine heatwaves outside the equatorial Pacific.
    *   The daily global temperature anomaly from Copernicus consistently tracks above 1.5°C through late October and early November.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Weekly ENSO updates show a rapid strengthening of La Niña, with ONI values dropping below -1.0°C.
    *   Atmospheric indicators (e.g., Southern Oscillation Index) become strongly positive, confirming a robust ocean-atmosphere coupling.
    *   Extensive and early snow cover establishment across the Northern Hemisphere, increasing planetary albedo.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Daily Peak vs. Monthly Mean:** The resolution is on the highest *daily* anomaly, which is inherently more volatile and subject to short-term weather noise

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the base rate, I will use the peak daily temperature anomalies during November and December from recent years, particularly focusing on years with similar ENSO phases. The years 2021-2024 provide a relevant reference class, with anomalies ranging from 1.35°C to 1.90°C. Given the current weak La Niña conditions, the 2016 post-El Niño to weak La Niña transition year is also relevant, adjusted for background warming, suggesting a base rate around 1.60°C to 1.70°C.
   - Mean/median: 1.65°C, Variance: Moderate, reflecting variability in ENSO phases and background warming.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation shares characteristics with past weak La Niña years, with a cooling influence expected but mitigated by high baseline temperatures.
   - Differences: The unprecedented baseline warmth and weak La Niña suggest higher anomalies than typical La Niña years, but lower than strong El Niño years.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - La Niña conditions (↓): Suggests a cooling effect, but the weak nature limits its impact.
   - High baseline warmth (↑): September 2025 was the third warmest on record, indicating strong thermal inertia.
   - Weak La Niña (↑): Limits the cooling potential, suggesting higher anomalies than past La Niña events.
   - Global SSTs and Hunga Tonga eruption (↑): Provide additional warming influences.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered at 1.65°C.
   - Evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment due to La Niña, but strong upward pressures from baseline warmth and weak La Niña.
   - Posterior mean shifts slightly lower to ~1.58°C, with reduced variance due to increased confidence in limited cooling.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast may underestimate the potential for short-term weather variability to cause spikes.
   - Alternative scenario: A stronger-than-expected La Niña could push anomalies lower, but this is mitigated by current forecasts.
   - Adjustments: Consider potential for short-term spikes due to weather variability, slightly widening the distribution.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the high baseline warmth and weak La Niña conditions.

P10: 1.45  
P20: 1.50  
P40: 1.55  
P60: 1.60  
P80: 1.65  
P90: 1.70

# Forecasting the Highest Surface Air Temperature Anomaly in Nov-Dec 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two key reference classes to establish my prior:

1. **Recent La Niña November-December periods (2020-2022)**: During these periods, the highest daily temperature anomalies were approximately:
   - 2020 La Niña (moderate): ~1.25°C
   - 2021 La Niña (moderate): ~1.45°C
   - 2022 La Niña (moderate-to-weak): ~1.40°C

2. **Post-El Niño transition years with weak La Niña development**:
   - 2016 (following strong 2015-16 El Niño): ~1.45°C
   - 2010 (following moderate 2009-10 El Niño): ~1.30°C

Adjusting for the ~0.2°C warming since 2016, these historical analogues suggest a base rate centered around 1.55-1.65°C.

My prior distribution is therefore:
- Central tendency: 1.60°C
- Spread: Approximately 0.25°C (standard deviation)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- We're entering a La Niña phase following an El Niño period
- The transition timing (fall into winter) matches our historical examples
- The global climate system continues to show strong warming trends

**Key differences:**
- The current baseline temperature is exceptionally high (2025 has been the 2nd/3rd warmest year on record)
- The emerging La Niña is characterized as "weak" and potentially "short-lived"
- Ocean heat content outside the equatorial Pacific remains at or near record levels
- The climate system is still shedding heat from the powerful 2023-2024 El Niño

These differences suggest that while La Niña will exert downward pressure on temperatures, the cooling effect will likely be more limited than in previous La Niña events.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- NOAA's confirmation of La Niña conditions (October 9) is strong evidence for cooling relative to El Niño peaks (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring lower values)
- La Niña typically reduces global temperature anomalies by 0.1-0.3°C compared to neutral conditions

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- The characterization of La Niña as "weak" suggests limited cooling potential (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher values)
- September 2025 was still the third-warmest on record despite emerging La Niña conditions (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher values)
- The 12-month mean anomaly through September 2025 was 1.51°C above pre-industrial levels, indicating significant thermal inertia (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher values)
- Non-Pacific ocean basins remain exceptionally warm, limiting global cooling potential (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 1.60°C, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**First update - La Niña confirmation:**
- Prior: centered at 1.60°C
- Evidence: La Niña conditions confirmed (favors lower values)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring lower values
- Posterior shift: ~0.07°C downward
- New central estimate: ~1.53°C

**Second update - Weak La Niña characterization and persistent warmth:**
- Prior: centered at 1.53°C
- Evidence: Weak La Niña + third-warmest September + warm ocean basins
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring higher values than typical La Niña
- Posterior shift: ~0.05°C upward
- New central estimate: ~1.58°C

The posterior distribution has:
- Mean: ~1.58°C
- Slightly reduced variance (increased confidence)
- Right-skewed (higher potential for warm outliers than cool ones)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating La Niña's cooling potential if it strengthens more rapidly than expected
- Daily temperature anomalies have higher variance than monthly means, creating potential for both higher and lower extremes
- Short-term weather patterns could create anomalous spikes or dips independent of climate state
- The question asks for the highest anomaly over a two-month period, which biases toward capturing upward spikes

**Alternative forecasts:**
- A more pessimistic view might center around 1.45°C, arguing that La Niña cooling will be more substantial
- A more optimistic view might center around 1.70°C, arguing that the background warming and thermal inertia will almost completely offset La Niña cooling

**Adjustments for uncertainty:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for daily variability
- I'll shift the upper tail higher to account for the possibility of short-term warm spikes

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 1.40
P20: 1.47
P40: 1.55
P60: 1.61
P80: 1.68

Answering the question: What will be the highest surface air temperature anomaly during November and December 2025?
Units: °C

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate comes from a reference class of years with similar large-scale climate drivers. The current situation is a transition from a strong El Niño to a weak La Niña. The best historical analogue is late 2016, which followed the 2015-16 super El Niño.

*   **Reference Class:** Post-strong El Niño, weak La Niña years.
*   **Data Point:** In Nov/Dec 2016, monthly anomalies were around +1.30°C relative to the 1991-2020 baseline. The daily peak anomaly would likely be higher, around 1.40-1.50°C.
*   **Adjustment for Warming:** There has been significant background warming in the ~9 years since 2016, at a rate of roughly 0.2°C per decade. This adds approximately +0.18°C to the 2016 value.
*   **Prior Distribution:** This adjusted analogue suggests a prior centered around **1.60-1.65°C** (e.g., 1.45°C + 0.18°C = 1.63°C). The distribution should be wide to account for the high volatility of a daily peak measurement compared to a monthly mean. A plausible 80% confidence interval for the prior might be [1.50°C, 1.75°C].

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The primary similarity is the ENSO transition state: moving from a strong El Niño into a newly-formed, weak La Niña. This provides a strong causal anchor to the 2016 reference case.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the state of the broader climate system. Global ocean heat content is at an unprecedented high, far warmer than in 2016. The 12-month global temperature anomaly leading into this period is a record-breaking ~1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This creates a much higher thermal baseline, suggesting the cooling influence of La Niña will be less effective than in the past.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update the prior based on recent evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: La Niña is officially confirmed but forecast to be "weak".**
    *   The confirmation of La Niña provides downward pressure compared to an El Niño or neutral state. However, its weakness is a strong counter-signal. A weak La Niña has a muted global cooling effect. This evidence suggests the outcome will be cooler than 2023/2024 (~1.9°C peak) but likely much warmer than the stronger La Niña of 2021/2022 (~1.4-1.5°C peak). This evidence supports the prior being in the middle of these two regimes.

*   **Evidence 2: Extreme background warmth and thermal inertia.**
    *   September 2025 was the third-warmest on record, *even as La Niña was emerging*. This is a powerful piece of evidence. It demonstrates that the immense heat already in the Earth system (particularly the oceans) is resisting the cooling influence. This makes lower outcomes (e.g., below 1.55°C) much less likely and pushes the entire distribution upwards. This is the strongest factor suggesting the outcome will be significantly higher than the simple warming-adjusted 2016 base rate.

*   **Evidence 3: The question is for the highest *daily* peak.**
    *   This factor primarily affects the variance, not the central tendency. Short-term, synoptic-scale weather patterns can cause a spike in the global average temperature for a day or two. This means the upper tail of the distribution should be fatter, as a random spike is more plausible than a random event that suppresses the peak over a two-month window.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Centered around 1.63°C, based on the warming-adjusted 2016 analogue.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence of extreme thermal inertia (3rd warmest September) provides a strong upward update. The cooling from a weak La Niña is likely to be overwhelmed by the record-hot baseline. This shifts the prior median upwards significantly.
*   **Update Step:** Starting with a 1.63°C median, the overwhelming evidence of background warmth pushes this higher. A reasonable update would be +0.05°C to +0.10°C. I will settle on a posterior median around **1.67°C**.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The distribution is shifted higher than the prior. It is also positively skewed, reflecting the higher probability of a short-term weather spike creating a high peak versus a sustained event that would lower the peak. The lower bound is supported by the presence of La Niña (unlikely to be below 1.50°C), and the upper bound is constrained by the absence of El Niño (unlikely to surpass 1.85°C).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Could I be wrong?** Yes. The main point of failure would be underestimating the cooling power of this La Niña. If the event strengthens unexpectedly to a "moderate" or "strong" category, the peak anomaly could fall closer to 1.50°C. My P10 of 1.53°C accounts for this possibility.
*   **Alternative View:** An alternative forecast might anchor more heavily on past La Niña events, arguing "La Niña is La Niña," and predict a peak around 1.55°C. My rebuttal is that the initial conditions are unprecedented. No past La Niña has been superimposed on such a warm planet, making historical analogues less reliable without a significant upward adjustment for the record ocean heat content, which the September 2025 data strongly supports.
*   **Overconfidence:** The P10-P90 range of 0.31°C (1.53 to 1.84) is substantial, reflecting the high uncertainty from the competing warming and cooling drivers, as well as the volatility of a daily peak. This seems appropriately cautious.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 1.53
P20: 1.57
P40: 1.63
P60: 1.71
P80: 1.79
P90: 1.84
