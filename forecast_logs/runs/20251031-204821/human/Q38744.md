### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the baseline probability of an incumbent leader in a similar regime being removed from office non-electorally within a ~2-month period?** This establishes the reference class and prior.
*   **Q2: What are the primary mechanisms for presidential removal in Zimbabwe?** This involves understanding the constitutional process (impeachment, incapacitation) and the extra-constitutional process (coup, forced resignation), particularly the precedent of the 2017 coup.
*   **Q3: Who are the key actors, what are their power bases, and what are their current postures?**
    *   Emmerson Mnangagwa (EM): How secure is his control over the party (ZANU-PF), state security, and government?
    *   Constantino Chiwenga (CC): What is the status of his rivalry with EM? How strong is his influence over the military? Is he positioned to act?
    *   ZANU-PF Factions: How deep are the divisions over the "2030 agenda"? Is the party leadership consolidating around EM or fracturing?
    *   War Veterans: Is the dissent from figures like Blessed Geza a fringe movement or a significant threat?
*   **Q4: What is the current state of play regarding the "third term/2030 agenda"?** Is this a source of imminent instability, or a longer-term political maneuver?
*   **Q5: Are there any acute, short-term triggers (e.g., health crisis, economic collapse, major protest movement) that could destabilize the situation before January 1, 2026?**

**2. Search Queries & Information Extraction Strategy (from provided sources):**

*   **For Q1 (Base Rates):**
    *   Search: "coups in Africa since 2000," "authoritarian leader removal rate," "presidential mortality rate age 83."
    *   Extract: Frequency of non-electoral power transfers in sub-Saharan Africa. Use this to create a rough annual probability, then scale it down for a 2-month period.
*   **For Q2 (Mechanisms):**
    *   Search: "Zimbabwe constitution presidential succession," "2017 Zimbabwe coup d'état timeline."
    *   Extract: The constitutional line of succession (VP Chiwenga is first in line). Note the precedent of military-led "restoration of legacy."
*   **For Q3 (Key Actors):**
    *   Scan provided sources for keywords: "Mnangagwa," "Chiwenga," "ZANU-PF," "war veterans," "Tagwirei."
    *   Extract: Evidence of EM consolidating power (expelling Geza), sidelining rivals (Tagwirei plan to bypass CC), and managing narratives. Note the clear factional split between EM's camp and the military wing aligned with CC.
*   **For Q4 (Third Term Agenda):**
    *   Scan provided sources for keywords: "third term," "2030," "constitutional amendment."
    *   Extract: The conflicting signals—allies push for 2030, while EM publicly focuses on 2028. This suggests a strategic ambiguity to test the waters and consolidate power, not an imminent constitutional crisis.
*   **For Q5 (Triggers):**
    *   Search: "Zimbabwe economic outlook 2025," "Emmerson Mnangagwa health."
    *   Extract: General information on ongoing economic hardship and Mnangagwa's age (born 1942, making him 83). Note that chronic economic issues are unlikely to be an acute trigger in a 2-month window without a catalyst.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The core tension is a long-term succession battle between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga, playing out through the proxy fight over a potential third term. However, the provided evidence from the last 6-12 months suggests Mnangagwa is actively and effectively managing this conflict. He is purging dissenters (Geza), floating alternative succession plans to sideline Chiwenga (Tagwirei), and controlling the public narrative. The "third term" push, while destabilizing in the long run, currently serves as a tool for his faction to consolidate power. The very short time horizon (approx. 2 months) makes a sudden, organized removal highly unlikely. Inertia is strong. The primary risks are non-political (a sudden health event) or a "black swan" political event (a precipitous move by Chiwenga). The base rate for such events in any given 2-month period is extremely low.

**4. Draft Comprehensive Answer.**

---

### **Research Brief: President of Zimbabwe on January 1, 2026**

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Coup African Incumbents:** Leaders who came to power via a coup or forced resignation often face a higher risk of being deposed by the same means. However, the annual rate of successful coups in Africa is low. Since 2010, there have been roughly 2-3 successful coups per year across 54 countries. This suggests a <5% annual probability for any single country, and thus a **<1% base rate of removal by coup in a 2-month period.**
2.  **Zimbabwean Presidential Tenures:** Since 1987, Zimbabwe has had two presidents. Robert Mugabe ruled for 30 years before being removed by a coup. This history establishes that extra-constitutional removal is a plausible, albeit rare, mechanism. This precedent slightly increases the base rate compared to a generic autocracy.
3.  **Heads of State Over 80:** President Mnangagwa is 83. Actuarial data suggests a male of this age has a ~10-12% annual mortality rate. This implies a **~1.5-2% probability of death or severe incapacitation within the next two months.**

Combining these, the baseline probability of Mnangagwa *not* being president on Jan 1, 2026, due to a random event (coup, health) is low, likely in the **2-4% range.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-24** Report on Mnangagwa's plan to install businessman K. Tagwirei as successor. **↑** (for Mnangagwa) — Shows proactive maneuvering to sideline his primary rival, VP Chiwenga, indicating he is shaping events, not just reacting to them.
*   **2025-10-20** ZANU-PF advocates for a constitutional amendment to extend Mnangagwa's rule to 2030. **↑** — Demonstrates that Mnangagwa's faction feels confident enough to publicly push a long-term power consolidation project.
*   **2025-09-20** Mnangagwa states he will not contest in 2028, following the expulsion of a dissenting war veteran. **↑** — A tactical move to appear constitutional while simultaneously purging internal opposition, a classic sign of a leader securing his position.
*   **2025-09-19** Mnangagwa publicly brushes aside the "2030 Agenda" to focus on 2028 elections. **↑** — He is controlling the political narrative, reducing internal pressure by appearing to adhere to the constitution, while his allies continue the 2030 push.
*   **2025-0

To forecast who will be President of Zimbabwe on January 1, 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Emmerson Mnangagwa**: As the current president, the base rate for incumbents remaining in power in similar regimes is relatively high. Historically, leaders in Zimbabwe have had long tenures, and Mnangagwa is currently serving his second term. Base rate: 70%.
  
- **Grace Mugabe**: She has not been politically active since her husband's removal and lacks a clear power base. Base rate: 2%.
  
- **Constantino Chiwenga**: As Vice President and a key figure in the military, he has a potential path to power, especially given historical precedents of military influence in Zimbabwe. Base rate: 10%.
  
- **Kembo Mohadi**: Another Vice President, but with less influence compared to Chiwenga. Base rate: 5%.
  
- **Someone else**: This includes any unexpected candidates or scenarios. Given the political dynamics, this is possible but less likely. Base rate: 13%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Emmerson Mnangagwa**: Similar to the base case, he is the incumbent with control over the party and government. However, the call for his resignation by war veterans introduces a risk factor.
  
- **Grace Mugabe**: Unlike the base case, she lacks current political engagement or support.
  
- **Constantino Chiwenga**: Similar to the base case, he has military backing, but there is no immediate indication of a coup or power grab.
  
- **Kembo Mohadi**: Similar to the base case, he is a VP but lacks significant influence.
  
- **Someone else**: Similar to the base case, unexpected events could lead to a different leader, but this is less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Mnangagwa's maneuvering**: His actions to consolidate power and manage narratives suggest he is actively maintaining control. Likelihood of staying: High.
  
- **War veterans' dissent**: This introduces a risk but is not yet a decisive factor. Likelihood of removal: Moderate.
  
- **Chiwenga's position**: His military influence remains strong, but no immediate action is evident. Likelihood of taking power: Moderate.
  
- **Economic and health factors**: These are potential destabilizers but not immediate threats. Likelihood of impacting Mnangagwa's tenure: Low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Emmerson Mnangagwa**: Prior odds = 70/30. Given his active control and lack of immediate threats, the likelihood ratio is favorable. Posterior probability increases slightly.
  
- **Constantino Chiwenga**: Prior odds = 10/90. The lack of immediate action keeps the likelihood ratio neutral. Posterior probability remains similar.
  
- **Others**: Given the lack of strong evidence for other candidates, their probabilities decrease slightly.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of a sudden health crisis or unexpected political maneuvering. Adjust probabilities slightly to account for these tail risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Emmerson Mnangagwa: 75%  
Grace Mugabe: 1%  
Constantino Chiwenga: 10%  
Kembo Mohadi: 4%  
Someone else: 10%  

These probabilities reflect the current political landscape and the likelihood of each scenario based on available evidence.

# Forecasting Zimbabwe's President on January 1, 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Emerson Mnangagwa (Current President)**: 
- Base rate: 90%
- Rationale: Incumbency advantage is extremely strong in semi-authoritarian regimes. Mnangagwa is currently in power, has consolidated control, and the timeframe is very short (only ~2 months from now to January 1, 2026).

**Constantino Chiwenga (Current Vice President)**:
- Base rate: 5%
- Rationale: As first VP, he's constitutionally next in line if Mnangagwa is removed or incapacitated. He has military backing and was instrumental in the 2017 coup.

**Grace Mugabe**:
- Base rate: 0.5%
- Rationale: She has been politically marginalized since her husband's removal. Her faction (G40) was purged from ZANU-PF.

**Kembo Mohadi (Second Vice President)**:
- Base rate: 1.5%
- Rationale: As second VP, he would be in line if both Mnangagwa and Chiwenga were unavailable, but has less power than Chiwenga.

**Someone else**:
- Base rate: 3%
- Rationale: This covers all other possibilities, including other ZANU-PF officials, opposition leaders, or military figures.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Zimbabwe has a history of long presidential tenures (Mugabe ruled for 37 years)
- ZANU-PF remains the dominant political force
- The constitutional framework provides for presidential succession
- Mnangagwa has consolidated power since taking office in 2017

**Key differences**:
- War veterans (a key support group) have recently called for Mnangagwa's resignation
- There are internal ZANU-PF tensions over a potential "2030 agenda" (third term)
- Mnangagwa is 83 years old, creating health uncertainty
- The research indicates Mnangagwa is actively managing succession plans, possibly favoring businessman K. Tagwirei over Chiwenga

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: War veterans calling for Mnangagwa's resignation**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Moderate (40%) - Dissent from war veterans is concerning but manageable
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): High (80%) - This would be expected before a removal
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 against Mnangagwa

**Evidence 2: Mnangagwa expelling dissenting war veteran**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): High (80%) - Shows he's actively consolidating power
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): Low (20%) - Would indicate weakness if he couldn't purge opponents
- Likelihood ratio: 4:1 for Mnangagwa

**Evidence 3: Mnangagwa's plan to install Tagwirei as successor**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): High (75%) - Shows he's planning long-term and sidelining Chiwenga
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): Low (25%) - Such maneuvering would be unnecessary if removal was imminent
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1 for Mnangagwa

**Evidence 4: ZANU-PF advocating constitutional amendment for 2030**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): High (70%) - Indicates his faction feels secure
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): Moderate (30%) - Could provoke backlash leading to removal
- Likelihood ratio: 2.3:1 for Mnangagwa

**Evidence 5: Mnangagwa publicly stating he won't contest in 2028**
- P(E|Mnangagwa remains): Moderate (60%) - Strategic ambiguity to reduce pressure
- P(E|Mnangagwa removed): Moderate (40%) - Could indicate weakness or preparation for exit
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5:1 for Mnangagwa

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the strongest evidence first - Mnangagwa expelling the dissenting war veteran:

For Mnangagwa:
- Prior odds: 90/10 = 9:1
- Likelihood ratio: 4:1
- Posterior odds: 9 × 4 = 36:1
- Posterior probability: 36/(36+1) = 97.3%

However, we need to consider the war veterans calling for resignation:
- Prior odds (now): 97.3/2.7 = 36:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1:2 (against)
- Posterior odds: 36 × 0.5 = 18:1
- Posterior probability: 18/(18+1) = 94.7%

Updating on Mnangagwa's succession plan with Tagwirei:
- Prior odds: 94.7/5.3 = 17.9:1
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1
- Posterior odds: 17.9 × 3 = 53.7:1
- Posterior probability: 53.7/(53.7+1) = 98.2%

This seems too high given the uncertainties, so I'll adjust downward based on other factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- Health risks: At 83, Mnangagwa faces significant mortality/health risks (~1.5-2% in a 2-month period)
- Military intervention: The 2017 coup shows the military can act decisively when motivated
- Economic crisis: Zimbabwe's chronic economic problems could reach a tipping point
- Underestimating Chiwenga: He has military connections and could move against Mnangagwa

**Alternative scenarios**:
- Sudden health crisis forces Mnangagwa to step down, elevating Chiwenga
- Military intervention similar to 2017, with Chiwenga taking power
- A compromise candidate emerges from ZANU-PF to prevent a Mnangagwa-Chiwenga conflict

Considering these factors, I should reduce Mnangagwa's probability to account for health risks and political instability.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting based on all evidence and red-teaming:

**Emerson Mnangagwa**: 92% (down from 98.2% to account for health risks and political instability)
**Constantino Chiwenga**: 5% (most likely successor if Mnangagwa is removed)
**Kembo Mohadi**: 1% (unlikely but possible in specific scenarios)
**Grace Mugabe**: 0.1% (extremely unlikely given her marginalization)
**Someone else**: 1.9% (covering other ZANU-PF officials, military figures, or compromise candidates)

## 7. Output Format

Emerson Mnangagwa: 92%  
Constantino Chiwenga: 5%  
Kembo Mohadi: 1%  
Grace Mugabe: 0.1%  
Someone else: 1.9%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The central question is the probability of an incumbent leader in a country like Zimbabwe being removed from office over a very short period (approximately two months, from late October 2025 to January 1, 2026).

*   **Incumbent Stability**: In most political systems, especially authoritarian or semi-authoritarian ones, the status quo has strong inertia. The probability of a leader remaining in power from one month to the next is extremely high.
*   **Mechanisms for Change**: For President Emmerson Mnangagwa (EM), there are two primary non-electoral risks in this timeframe:
    1.  **Health/Mortality**: At age 83, there is a non-trivial actuarial risk. A male of this age has an annual mortality rate of roughly 10-12%. Scaled to a two-month period (1/6th of a year), this translates to a **~1.5-2%** probability of death or severe incapacitation.
    2.  **Coup/Forced Resignation**: While rare, Zimbabwe has a recent precedent with the 2017 coup. The annual rate of successful coups in Africa is low (less than 5% for any given country), which implies a sub-1% probability for a two-month period. However, given Zimbabwe's specific history and internal tensions, we can set this base rate slightly higher, perhaps at **~1.5-2%**.

Combining these risks, the initial base rate (prior) for Mnangagwa *not* being president on January 1, 2026, is approximately 3-4%. Therefore, the prior for him remaining in office is **P(Mnangagwa) ≈ 96-97%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: Zimbabwe's political system, dominated by the ZANU-PF party and its security apparatus, creates immense institutional inertia that favors the incumbent, consistent with the base case for authoritarian regimes.
*   **Differences**: The key difference is the well-documented and active rivalry between President Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga (CC), who was instrumental in the 2017 coup. This specific, high-stakes power struggle makes the political situation more volatile than in a typical autocracy with a settled succession plan. This suggests the risk of a political ouster, while still low, is the most significant variable to watch.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The provided research report contains several key pieces of evidence about the ongoing power struggle.

*   **Evidence A: Mnangagwa's faction is actively pushing a "third term/2030 agenda" and floating alternative successors (e.g., K. Tagwirei).**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment**: This evidence is highly likely if Mnangagwa is securely in control and proactively managing his succession (P(E | Mnangagwa remains high)). It is much less likely if he were weak and on the verge of being ousted (P(E | Mnangagwa is about to be ousted) is low). This evidence shows his faction is on the offensive, aiming to sideline his primary rival, Chiwenga.
*   **Evidence B: Mnangagwa is successfully purging dissenters (e.g., the war veteran Blessed Geza) and managing the public narrative (publicly dismissing the 2030 agenda while his allies push it).**
    *   **Likelihood Assessment**: This demonstrates political savvy and control over the party apparatus. A leader about to be overthrown is typically losing control of the narrative and failing to suppress dissent. This evidence is far more probable under the hypothesis that Mnangagwa is consolidating power.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Prior Odds**: P(Mnangagwa) / P(Not Mnangagwa) ≈ 96% / 4% = 24 to 1.
*   **Likelihood Ratio**: The combined evidence (proactive succession planning, purging dissent, controlling the narrative) is significantly more likely if Mnangagwa is secure than if he is not. Let's estimate a conservative likelihood ratio of 2:1 in favor of him remaining in power.
*   **Posterior Odds**: 24 (Prior Odds) × 2 (Likelihood Ratio) = 48 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability**: P(Mnangagwa) = 48 / (48 + 1) ≈ 98%.

However, this update might be too aggressive. The very actions Mnangagwa is taking to consolidate power (sidelining Chiwenga) could act as a catalyst, forcing Chiwenga's hand. This "action-reaction" dynamic means the evidence of EM's strength could paradoxically increase the short-term risk. A more cautious approach is to conclude that the evidence confirms the high-stakes nature of the rivalry but doesn't significantly change the overall low probability of a change in the next two months. Therefore, I will revert to a posterior probability for Mnangagwa that is closer to the initial base rate.

Let's set **P(Mnangagwa) = 96%**. This leaves a 4% probability for a change.

This 4% probability mass must be distributed among the other candidates.
*   **Constantino Chiwenga**: As First Vice President, he is the constitutional successor in the event of Mnangagwa's death or incapacitation (~2% risk). He is also the leader of the rival faction and the most likely figure to lead a coup (~2% risk). Therefore, he is the beneficiary of nearly all non-Mnangagwa scenarios.
*   **Other Candidates**: Grace Mugabe is politically marginalized. Kembo Mohadi would only succeed if both Mnangagwa and Chiwenga were removed. "Someone else" is a remote possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily weighted on the incumbent's stability and inertia over a short timeframe. The biggest risk is a "black swan" event. Could the reports of Mnangagwa's strength be a deliberate misdirection campaign by his faction, masking underlying weakness? Or could Chiwenga's faction be planning a swift, unexpected move, with the lack of public signals being a feature of their operational security? The 2017 coup serves as a reminder that such events can happen quickly. While this risk is real, a 4% probability for a change of leadership within two months is already quite high for a head of state and adequately accounts for this tail risk. The evidence of Mnangagwa's proactive measures still suggests he is more likely the actor than the one being acted upon.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed as follows, summing to 100%:

*   **Emmerson Mnangagwa (96%)**: The incumbent is overwhelmingly likely to remain in power over the short two-month horizon due to political inertia, his control of the state, and proactive measures against his rival.
*   **Constantino Chiwenga (3.5%)**: As the primary rival and constitutional successor, he is the only plausible alternative. This probability covers the combined risk of a health event incapacitating Mnangagwa and a successful political move (coup/forced resignation) by Chiwenga's faction.
*   **Kembo Mohadi (0.2%)**: A very low probability, as his succession requires a scenario where both Mnangagwa and Chiwenga are removed from the line of succession.
*   **Someone else (0.3%)**: Accounts for other unforeseen "black swan" scenarios, such as a different military leader or a surprise party candidate emerging from a crisis.
*   **Grace Mugabe (0%)**: Has no realistic path back to power.

Emmerson Mnangagwa: 96%
Grace Mugabe: 0%
Constantino Chiwenga: 3.5%
Kembo Mohadi: 0.2%
Someone else: 0.3%
