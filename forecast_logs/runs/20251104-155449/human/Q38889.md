### Reference class & base rates
-   **Interstate Wars Lasting >1 Year (post-1945):** Wars that are not resolved quickly often become protracted conflicts of attrition. Of interstate wars lasting over one year, a significant portion (ballpark 30-40%) extend beyond three years. The Russo-Ukrainian war, having begun in earnest in February 2022, is approaching its three-year mark. This reference class suggests that a resolution in 2025 is plausible but far from certain, with a high base rate for continuation into 2026.
-   **Conflicts Ending via Great Power Mediation:** Conflicts where a great power (here, the U.S.) actively mediates a settlement have a different dynamic. Success often depends on the mediator's leverage over belligerents and its ability to bridge the gap between their minimum demands. The base rate for success is mixed (ballpark 40-50% success within a year of serious mediation starting), often resulting in fragile ceasefires or frozen conflicts rather than comprehensive peace treaties. The current U.S. effort began intensifying in early 2025.
-   **"Hurting Stalemate" Preconditions:** A common precondition for successful negotiation is a "mutually hurting stalemate," where both sides believe the cost of continuing the war outweighs potential gains. The base rate suggests that until this condition is met, negotiations are unlikely to succeed. The current situation appears to be an *asymmetric* stalemate, where one side (Russia) may believe it is winning through attrition.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-04] Ukraine receives more U.S. Patriot systems, holding on in Pokrovsk. **↓** — Bolsters Ukrainian defense, reducing immediate pressure to accept unfavorable terms and potentially prolonging the stalemate.
-   [2025-10-23] Trump cancels a summit with Putin and imposes new sanctions on Russian oil. **↓** — Indicates growing U.S. frustration and friction with Russia, making a near-term cooperative agreement less likely.
-   [2025-09-30] CSIS assesses Russia believes it is winning a war of attrition. **↓** — A party that believes it is winning has little incentive to stop fighting and make concessions for a ceasefire.
-   [2025-09-15] CFR notes a Trump-Putin meeting in Anchorage yielded no concrete agreement. **↓** — Demonstrates that high-level talks have not yet been sufficient to produce a breakthrough, suggesting significant obstacles remain.
-   [2025-05-22] RAND report highlights the war has strengthened the transatlantic alliance. **↓** — A cohesive Western alliance supporting Ukraine makes a Russian military victory harder, but also provides Ukraine with the means to resist a forced peace.
-   [2025-04-03] UK Parliament briefing notes a U.S. policy shift to prioritize a negotiated peace. **↑** — The primary external power is now actively and forcefully pushing for a settlement, a significant change from the previous administration's policy.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **U.S. Administration's Political Will:** The Trump administration's prioritization of a deal is the single most powerful driver toward a ceasefire. Its willingness to exert immense pressure on Ukraine and engage directly with Russia is a causal lever of **large** effect.
-   **Russian Strategic Calculus:** Russia's belief that it can win a war of attrition and outlast Ukrainian/Western will is the primary driver against a ceasefire. Until Moscow believes it has more to gain from a deal than from fighting, no agreement is likely. This is a **large** driver.
-   **Battlefield Dynamics:** The absence of a clear path to victory for either side creates the underlying stalemate. Russian incremental gains strengthen its belief in an attrition strategy, while Ukrainian defensive successes (enabled by Western aid) prevent collapse and prolong the conflict. This is a **moderate** driver.
-   **Ukrainian Dependence on U.S. Aid:** Ukraine's near-total reliance on U.S. military and financial support makes it highly susceptible to U.S. pressure. A credible threat to cut off aid is a powerful tool to force Kyiv to the negotiating table. This is a **large** driver, but contingent on U.S. will.
-   **Domestic Political Constraints:** War weariness in Ukraine, economic strain in Russia, and political polarization in the U.S. all influence leadership decisions. However, these appear to be secondary to the strategic calculations of the leaders. This is a **small-to-moderate** driver.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Highly Transactional Mediator:** The U.S. administration's approach is unusually transactional, explicitly linking security assistance to other demands (e.g., critical minerals) and applying public pressure. This differs from traditional, more value-neutral mediation.
-   **Asymmetric Leverage:** The mediator's (U.S.) leverage is almost entirely concentrated on one party (Ukraine). It has far less leverage over Russia, creating an imbalance that could lead to a coerced, unstable ceasefire rather than a mutually agreed-upon peace.
-   **Maximalist War Aims:** The conflict retains existential characteristics for Ukraine (sovereignty) and foundational security importance for Russia, making compromise far more difficult than in typical territorial disputes that form the bulk of the reference class.
-   **Personalized Diplomacy:** The outcome is heavily dependent on the personal relationship and decision-making of two leaders, Trump and Putin, making it more volatile and less predictable than institution-led processes.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior based on protracted interstate wars would be centered on "Not before 2026," reflecting the difficulty of ending conflicts of this scale and intensity. Equivalent n ≈ 10.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↑ (Large):** Unprecedented and sustained U.S. pressure on Ukraine to accept a ceasefire.
    -   **↓ (Large):** Strong evidence that Russia's leadership believes its attrition strategy is succeeding and time is on its side.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** Recent diplomatic setbacks (canceled summit, new sanctions) indicate a worsening, not improving, U.S.-Russia relationship, which is necessary for a bilateral deal.
    -   **↓ (Small):** Continued provision of key defensive weapons to Ukraine allows it to stave off collapse, reducing the immediate coercive power of Russian attacks.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting, but the Russian calculus (↓) is a more fundamental barrier to a *bilateral* agreement than U.S. pressure on Ukraine (↑) is a catalyst. The recent diplomatic friction further dampens prospects. The posterior should therefore move slightly further toward **"Not before 2026."**

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (ceasefire more likely):**
    -   A successfully rescheduled and held Trump-Putin summit with a joint statement on de-escalation.
    -   Public statements from Russian officials emphasizing the "consolidation of existing territorial gains" over new offensive goals.
    -   A major U.S. aid package for Ukraine being explicitly and publicly conditioned on accepting ceasefire terms.
    -   A significant, unexpected Ukrainian battlefield success that alters Russia's cost-benefit analysis.
-   **DOWN indicators (ceasefire less likely):**
    -   The launch of a major new Russian offensive towards a strategic city like Kharkiv, Odesa, or Kyiv.
    -   A formal breakdown in U.S.-Ukraine relations or a public refusal by Zelenskyy to negotiate under pressure.
    -   Further significant U.S. sanctions targeting the core of the Russian economy or leadership.
    -   Intelligence reports indicating a successful Russian mobilization effort or a breakthrough in munitions production.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Fictionalized Scenario:** This analysis is based entirely on the provided fictional sources set in late 2025. It does not reflect the real-world state of affairs.
-   **Leader Unpredictability:** The decisions of Presidents Trump and Putin are highly personalized and can defy traditional geopolitical models. A sudden change of mind by either could dramatically alter the forecast.
-   **Definition of "Ceasefire":** The resolution requires a comprehensive, bilateral ceasefire. Watch for attempts by either side to implement a limited or local truce that would not meet the criteria but could be framed as progress.
-   **Information Gaps:** The true state of military stockpiles, casualty rates, and domestic political stability in Russia and Ukraine are largely unknown and subject to disinformation.
-   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast is vulnerable to sudden, high-impact events such as the death of a key leader, a major technological breakthrough on the battlefield, or the collapse of a front line.

**Final Research Summary:**
The U.S. administration is applying immense pressure on Ukraine for a ceasefire, but Russia's belief that it is winning through attrition remains the dominant obstacle, making a bilateral agreement before 2026 unlikely.

To forecast when a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement in the Russo-Ukraine conflict might first go into effect, let's apply Bayesian reasoning to the given options.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **1 January 2025 - 31 March 2025:** Given the timeline and recent developments, this period is already past, so the probability is 0%.
- **1 April 2025 - 30 June 2025:** This period is also past, so the probability is 0%.
- **1 July 2025 - 30 September 2025:** This period is also past, so the probability is 0%.
- **1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025:** The base rate for a resolution within this period is low. Historical data on protracted conflicts and the current state of negotiations suggest a low probability. Let's assign a base rate of 10%.
- **Not before 2026:** Given the historical tendency for such conflicts to extend beyond three years, and the current geopolitical dynamics, the base rate for this option is higher. Let's assign a base rate of 90%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The conflict is protracted, similar to other interstate wars that last over a year. The involvement of a great power (U.S.) in mediation is also a common factor.
- **Differences:** The U.S. administration's highly transactional approach and the asymmetric leverage over Ukraine are unusual. Russia's belief in its attrition strategy also differs from typical scenarios where both sides are equally pressured to negotiate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **U.S. Pressure on Ukraine (↑):** The U.S. is exerting pressure on Ukraine for a ceasefire, which increases the likelihood of an agreement in 2025. However, this is countered by Russia's stance.
- **Russia's Attrition Strategy (↓):** Russia believes it is winning, reducing the likelihood of a ceasefire in 2025.
- **Diplomatic Setbacks (↓):** Recent diplomatic failures and sanctions indicate worsening relations, decreasing the likelihood of a 2025 resolution.
- **Military Aid to Ukraine (↓):** Continued aid bolsters Ukraine's defense, reducing immediate pressure to negotiate.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025:** Start with a prior of 10%. The evidence (Russia's stance, diplomatic setbacks) suggests a lower likelihood, reducing the posterior probability to around 5%.
- **Not before 2026:** Start with a prior of 90%. The evidence supports this option, increasing the posterior probability to around 95%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The high probability for "Not before 2026" could be overconfident. Consider the possibility of a sudden shift in U.S.-Russia relations or a change in Russian strategy.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A breakthrough in negotiations due to unforeseen events (e.g., a major battlefield shift) could lead to a ceasefire in late 2025. However, current evidence does not strongly support this.

### 6. Final Normalization
Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:
- **1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025:** 5%
- **Not before 2026:** 95%

### 7. Output Format
1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025: 5%  
Not before 2026: 95%

# Forecasting a Russo-Ukrainian Ceasefire

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question about when a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement might first go into effect, I'll establish base rates for each time period:

**Historical Base Rates for Interstate Wars:**
- Wars lasting 3+ years (as this one has) tend to have a high probability of continuing even longer
- Based on the COW dataset, roughly 60-70% of interstate wars that reach 3+ years continue beyond 4 years
- The base rate for "Not before 2026" should therefore be high, around 60-65%
- For the remaining 35-40%, I'll distribute across the 2025 quarters with a slight preference for later periods

**Initial Base Rates:**
- 1 January 2025 - 31 March 2025: 5% (already passed in the scenario)
- 1 April 2025 - 30 June 2025: 5% (already passed in the scenario)
- 1 July 2025 - 30 September 2025: 10% (already mostly passed in the scenario)
- 1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025: 20% (current period in the scenario)
- Not before 2026: 60%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Rate Scenario:**
- This is a high-intensity interstate conflict with territorial objectives
- The conflict involves a major power (Russia) against a smaller state (Ukraine)
- There are significant geopolitical interests from external powers (US, Europe)
- The war has reached a protracted phase with no clear military resolution

**Key Differences:**
- The US administration has explicitly prioritized a negotiated settlement (unusual level of great power pressure)
- The conflict has direct nuclear implications (Russia is a nuclear power)
- The asymmetric leverage situation (US has leverage over Ukraine but limited leverage over Russia)
- The personalized nature of diplomacy between Trump and Putin

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for Earlier Ceasefire (2025):**
- US administration's explicit prioritization of a negotiated peace (April 2025 UK Parliament briefing)
- Ukraine agreed to support a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire (March 2025)
- Putin expressed support for the ceasefire idea in principle (March 2025)
- Trump's direct involvement in negotiations with Putin (February 2025)

**Evidence Against Earlier Ceasefire:**
- CSIS assessment that Russia believes it's winning a war of attrition (September 2025)
- Trump-Putin meeting in Anchorage yielded no agreement (September 2025)
- Trump canceled a summit with Putin and imposed new sanctions (October 2025)
- Ukraine receiving more Patriot systems, reducing pressure to accept unfavorable terms (November 2025)
- Failed negotiations between US and Ukraine over critical minerals (February 2025)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update based on key evidence:

**Update 1: US Policy Shift to Prioritize Peace**
- Prior for "Not before 2026": 60%
- Likelihood ratio: P(Policy shift | Ceasefire in 2025) / P(Policy shift | No ceasefire in 2025) ≈ 1.5
- This increases the odds of a 2025 ceasefire by about 50%
- New probability for "Not before 2026": ~52%

**Update 2: Russia Believes It's Winning Through Attrition**
- Prior after update 1 for "Not before 2026": 52%
- Likelihood ratio: P(Russia believes winning | Ceasefire in 2025) / P(Russia believes winning | No ceasefire in 2025) ≈ 0.6
- This decreases the odds of a 2025 ceasefire
- New probability for "Not before 2026": ~65%

**Update 3: Recent Diplomatic Setbacks (Canceled Summit, New Sanctions)**
- Prior after update 2 for "Not before 2026": 65%
- Likelihood ratio: P(Diplomatic setbacks | Ceasefire in 2025) / P(Diplomatic setbacks | No ceasefire in 2025) ≈ 0.7
- This further decreases the odds of a 2025 ceasefire
- New probability for "Not before 2026": ~73%

**Update 4: Continued Military Support to Ukraine**
- Prior after update 3 for "Not before 2026": 73%
- Likelihood ratio: P(Continued support | Ceasefire in 2025) / P(Continued support | No ceasefire in 2025) ≈ 0.9
- This slightly decreases the odds of a 2025 ceasefire
- New probability for "Not before 2026": ~75%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's ability to force a deal through personalized diplomacy
- The research report doesn't fully capture Ukraine's internal political dynamics or war fatigue
- I might be overweighting recent negative developments over longer-term pressures for peace
- The "mutually hurting stalemate" could develop more quickly than anticipated

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- A sudden battlefield collapse could force Ukraine to accept terms quickly
- Trump might dramatically increase pressure on Ukraine by threatening complete aid cutoff
- Putin might see strategic value in a temporary ceasefire to regroup and rearm
- A "Christmas ceasefire" in December 2025 could be politically attractive

**Adjustments:**
- I should slightly increase probability for Oct-Dec 2025 to account for potential "Christmas ceasefire" dynamics
- I should slightly decrease "Not before 2026" to avoid overconfidence given the unpredictable nature of the key decision-makers

## 6. Final Normalization

Distributing the remaining 25% (after assigning 75% to "Not before 2026") across the 2025 periods, with emphasis on the later periods:

- 1 January 2025 - 31 March 2025: 0% (already passed in scenario)
- 1 April 2025 - 30 June 2025: 0% (already passed in scenario)
- 1 July 2025 - 30 September 2025: 2% (mostly passed, but included for completeness)
- 1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025: 23% (current period with highest near-term potential)
- Not before 2026: 75%

## 7. Final Forecast

1 January 2025 - 31 March 2025: 0%
1 April 2025 - 30 June 2025: 0%
1 July 2025 - 30 September 2025: 2%
1 October 2025 - 31 December 2025: 23%
Not before 2026: 75%

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided fictional scenario.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The conflict described began in February 2022 and, as of the scenario's date of November 4, 2025, has been ongoing for over 3.5 years. This places it in the reference class of protracted interstate wars.

*   **Reference Class:** Interstate wars lasting over three years since 1945.
*   **Base Rate:** Such wars have high inertia. Once they become wars of attrition, they tend to continue until one side is exhausted or a fundamental strategic shift occurs. The probability of such a conflict ending in any specific short period (like the remaining two months of 2025) is low.
*   **Prior Probability:** A reasonable prior, before considering the specific evidence of 2025, would be a high probability that the war continues into the next calendar year. I will set a prior of **95% for "Not before 2026"** and **5% for the remaining part of Q4 2025**. This reflects the strong tendency for such conflicts to persist. The first three options for 2025 have a probability of 0% as those periods have already passed.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The conflict is a war of attrition with a relatively static front line (a "hurting stalemate"), which is a common feature of the reference class.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Aggressive US Mediation:** The primary difference is the intense, transactional pressure for a deal from the fictional Trump administration. This is a significant factor that could accelerate a resolution compared to the base case.
    2.  **Asymmetric Stalemate:** Unlike a "mutually hurting stalemate" where both sides seek an exit, the scenario explicitly states that Russia believes it is winning through attrition. This is a crucial difference that works against a negotiated settlement.
    3.  **Asymmetric Leverage:** The US mediator has immense leverage over Ukraine (via aid) but very little over Russia. This imbalance makes it difficult to broker a *bilateral* agreement that Russia would willingly accept.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update my prior odds (5/95 ≈ 0.053) based on the key pieces of evidence from the fictional 2025.

*   **Evidence For a 2025 Ceasefire (↑):** The US has made a negotiated peace a top priority and is using its leverage over Ukraine (UK Parliament briefing, US-Ukraine talks).
    *   P(E | Ceasefire in Q4 2025): High. This US pressure is a necessary precondition for any near-term deal.
    *   P(E | No ceasefire before 2026): Moderate. The pressure could be applied for a long time without success.
    *   **Effect:** This evidence increases the probability of a 2025 ceasefire relative to the prior.

*   **Evidence Against a 2025 Ceasefire (↓↓):** Russia believes it is winning a war of attrition (CSIS assessment, Sep 30).
    *   P(E | Ceasefire in Q4 2025): Very Low. A party that believes time is on its side has a powerful incentive to continue fighting rather than accept a ceasefire that freezes the conflict.
    *   P(E | No ceasefire before 2026): Very High. This belief is the core driver for prolonging the war.
    *   **Effect:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It strongly pushes the probability toward "Not before 2026".

*   **Evidence Against a 2025 Ceasefire (↓↓):** Recent US-Russia diplomatic talks have failed (Anchorage meeting, Sep 15), and relations have worsened (canceled summit, new sanctions, Oct 23).
    *   P(E | Ceasefire in Q4 2025): Very Low. A bilateral agreement requires functional, high-level diplomatic channels. This evidence shows these channels are currently broken and moving in the wrong direction. A reversal and successful negotiation within the next 7 weeks is extremely unlikely.
    *   P(E | No ceasefire before 2026): High. This is the expected pattern of events if the conflict is set to continue.
    *   **Effect:** This recent, specific evidence strongly reinforces the conclusion that a deal is not imminent.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through the update conceptually.

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(Q4 2025) = 5%, P(Not before 2026) = 95%.
2.  **Apply Positive Evidence:** The intense US pressure on Ukraine is a significant factor. Let's imagine this doubles the perceived chance of a near-term deal, shifting the probabilities to roughly P(Q4 2025) = 10%, P(Not before 2026) = 90%.
3.  **Apply Negative Evidence:** The two key pieces of negative evidence—Russia's belief it is winning and the recent diplomatic breakdown—are more fundamental barriers. Russia's calculus negates the US pressure on Ukraine (it takes two to make a deal), and the diplomatic failure shows the mechanism for a deal is not working. Combined, this evidence is much stronger than the positive evidence. It should reduce the probability of a Q4 2025 deal by a large factor (e.g., 70-80%).
4.  **Posterior Calculation:** Taking the 10% chance from the previous step and reducing it by 70% gives a final probability of 3%.
    *   Posterior P(Q4 2025) ≈ 3%
    *   Posterior P(Not before 2026) ≈ 97%

This posterior reflects that while a sudden deal is not impossible (given the volatile nature of the described US administration), the structural conditions and recent events make it extremely improbable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating the sheer coercive power of the US and the unpredictability of its leader? A plausible alternative scenario is that the canceled summit and sanctions were a "maximum pressure" tactic, to be followed by a dramatic offer that Putin accepts. A "Christmas Truce" could be announced for political effect.
*   **Counter-Argument:** This scenario requires Putin to be willing and able to accept and implement a deal on Trump's timeline. The evidence that Russia believes it is winning suggests Putin has the stronger negotiating position and no reason to rush. Furthermore, the resolution criteria are strict (comprehensive, bilateral), making a hasty, for-show agreement less likely to qualify.
*   **Conclusion:** The risk of a sudden, personality-driven deal exists, but it is a tail risk. The 3% probability for Q4 2025 adequately accounts for this possibility while giving appropriate weight to the strong contrary evidence.
