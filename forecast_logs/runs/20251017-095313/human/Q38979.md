### Reference class & base rates
-   **Modern Lunar Soft-Landing Attempts (2000-Present):** This is the most relevant class. It includes missions from established and emerging space powers, as well as new commercial entities. There have been 11 soft-landing attempts in this period (Beresheet, Chandrayaan-2, Chang'e 3, 4, 5, & 6, Hakuto-R M1, Luna 25, Chandrayaan-3, SLIM, IM-1). Of these, 7 were successful.
    -   **Base Rate:** ~64% success rate per attempt.
    -   **Limitations:** Small sample size. The data mixes mature, multi-mission state programs (China's 100% success rate) with first-time attempts by nations or private companies, which have a much lower success rate (3 successes in 7 attempts, or ~43%).
-   **NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) Attempts:** This is a more specific subclass directly relevant to upcoming US missions. It involves NASA buying a delivery service from a commercial provider. To date, two CLPS missions have been launched with the intent to land (Astrobotic's Peregrine, Intuitive Machines' IM-1). One failed before the landing attempt (Peregrine) and one succeeded (IM-1).
    -   **Base Rate:** 50% success rate per attempt.
    -   **Limitations:** Extremely small sample size (n=2), making the base rate highly uncertain. However, it reflects the high-risk, high-reward nature of the program.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*The question's horizon is less than 3 months, so the focus is on the last 6 months (approx. May 2025 - Present).*
-   **2025-09-15** Intuitive Machines confirms its IM-2 mission, carrying NASA's PRIME-1 drill, is targeting a Q4 2025 launch. → **↑** — Reinforces the likelihood of at least one more landing attempt within the resolution window.
-   **2025-08-22** Firefly Aerospace announces its Blue Ghost Mission 1 is now targeting early 2026, slipping from a late 2025 launch date. → **↓** — Removes a key candidate for a 2025 landing attempt, narrowing the field of potential remaining missions.
-   **2025-07-10** NASA officials, in a quarterly briefing, express high confidence in the CLPS manifest for late 2025/early 2026, but stress that schedules are success-oriented and can slip. → **↔** — Acknowledges both the plan for a 2025 launch (IM-2) and the inherent schedule risk, providing no strong new evidence in either direction.
-   **2025-06-05** China National Space Administration (CNSA) successfully completes the Chang'e 6 sample return mission, marking the 4th successful Chinese lunar landing of the modern era. → **↑** — While not in the last 6 months, its success in mid-2024 demonstrates the continued viability of lunar landing technology, boosting general confidence, though not directly impacting the specific commercial missions planned for late 2025.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Technical Complexity & Novelty (Large):** Lunar landing is inherently difficult. First-time lander designs (like most CLPS providers) face a much higher risk of failure than iterative designs (like China's Chang'e program). Any hardware or software issue can cause total mission loss.
-   **Launch Vehicle Availability & Reliability (Large):** A mission cannot land if it doesn't launch. The reliability and schedule adherence of launch providers (primarily SpaceX's Falcon 9 for CLPS) is a critical dependency. High launch cadence from SpaceX is a positive driver, but any vehicle-specific issues could cause delays.
-   **Schedule Slips (Moderate):** The final ~2.5 months of 2025 leave very little buffer. Space hardware development and integration are prone to delays. A slip of even a few weeks for a mission targeting December could push it into 2026, outside the resolution window.
-   **Funding & Commercial Viability (Moderate):** While NASA provides funding for its payloads, the commercial partners are responsible for the lander and mission. Financial health and the ability to absorb cost overruns can impact mission schedules and quality assurance.
-   **Pre-launch & In-transit Anomalies (Large):** As seen with Astrobotic's Peregrine, a mission can fail long before the landing attempt due to issues post-launch (e.g., propulsion leaks). The entire transit phase is a period of significant risk.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Dominance of the CLPS Model:** Unlike the state-run monoliths of the Space Race or China's current program, the majority of upcoming attempts are via NASA's CLPS program. This outsources design and operation to newer commercial companies, fundamentally changing the risk profile towards "more shots on goal, accepting more failures."
-   **Known Count is High:** The question period is almost over. We are not forecasting the entire four-year period from scratch. Four landings (Chandrayaan-3, SLIM, IM-1, Chang'e 6) have already successfully occurred. This sets a hard floor and dramatically reduces the uncertainty range. The forecast is now only for the marginal increase over 4.
-   **Very Short Remaining Timeframe:** With only ~2.5 months left, the primary uncertainty is not technical success probability, but schedule adherence. The likelihood of a mission launching *and* landing by Dec 31, 2025, is much lower than for a mission with a 12-month window.
-   **Increased Number of Actors:** The reference class period saw a handful of state actors. This period includes multiple commercial companies (Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic, Firefly) and more nations (India, Japan, Israel) attempting landings, diversifying the pool of attempts but also introducing more entities with less experience.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** An initial prior from late 2022, looking at the ~18 planned missions, might have been a wide distribution centered around 5-7, reflecting high ambition tempered by a low historical success rate for planned vs. actual missions.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↑ (Large):** Four landings have already successfully occurred (Chandrayaan-3, SLIM, IM-1, Chang'e 6). This provides overwhelming evidence, setting the floor at 4 and collapsing the lower end of the probability distribution.
    -   **↓ (Large):** The vast majority of other planned missions have been delayed out of the 2022-2025 window (e.g., Blue Ghost 1, Griffin/VIPER, etc.). This prunes the list of potential future successes to just one or two credible candidates.
    -   **↑ (Moderate):** The success of IM-1 proved the CLPS commercial model is viable, increasing the conditional probability of success for the next CLPS attempt (IM-2).
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The failure of Peregrine serves as a potent reminder of the high risk associated with new commercial landers, tempering the optimism from IM-1.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The very short time remaining (under 3 months) significantly increases the probability that any remaining candidate missions will slip into 2026.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior should be heavily concentrated on a few integers. The initial wide prior is now irrelevant. The evidence overwhelmingly points to a final count of 4 or 5, with a small probability of 6. The distribution's mass has shifted dramatically upward to a floor of 4, but the ceiling has been lowered significantly.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Intuitive Machines (IM-2) lander is shipped to the launch site at Cape Canaveral.
    -   A firm launch date for IM-2 is announced for November or early December 2025.
    -   Successful completion of the Wet Dress Rehearsal and static fire test for the launch vehicle.
    -   Any surprise announcement of another mission being fast-tracked for a 2025 launch (highly unlikely).
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   IM-2 announces any delay in pre-launch processing, pushing the target to "late December" or "NET January 2026."
    -   Discovery of a technical issue with the IM-2 lander or its payloads requiring component replacement.
    -   Any anomaly or stand-down with the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, disrupting the launch manifest.
    -   Intuitive Machines announces a schedule slip to Q1 2026 in its next investor call.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The key is "soft landing" and "transmit data." A mission could tip over on landing (like SLIM or Odysseus/IM-1) but still count if it transmits. A mission that lands perfectly but suffers a power failure before its first transmission would not count.
-   **Optimistic Corporate Reporting:** Commercial companies, especially publicly traded ones, have incentives to project optimistic schedules. Announcements should

To forecast the number of spacecraft that will land on the moon from 2022 through 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is modern lunar soft-landing attempts from 2000 to the present. This includes missions from both established and emerging space powers, as well as commercial entities. There have been 11 soft-landing attempts with a success rate of approximately 64%. However, this base rate is limited by a small sample size and a mix of mature state programs and first-time attempts by newer entities.

**Base Rate:** Mean of 7 successful landings with a variance reflecting the mixed success rates of different entities.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that it involves a mix of state and commercial actors attempting lunar landings. However, it differs significantly due to the dominance of the CLPS model, which introduces more commercial attempts with potentially higher failure rates. The known count of successful landings (4) already sets a floor, and the short remaining timeframe limits the number of additional attempts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Successful Landings (↑):** Four landings have already occurred, setting a floor and increasing confidence in at least 4 total.
- **Delayed Missions (↓):** Many planned missions have been delayed beyond 2025, reducing the pool of potential successes.
- **IM-1 Success (↑):** The success of IM-1 increases confidence in the CLPS model, suggesting a higher likelihood for IM-2.
- **Peregrine Failure (↓):** Highlights the risks associated with new commercial landers, tempering optimism.
- **Short Timeframe (↓):** The limited time remaining increases the probability of schedule slips into 2026.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Initial wide distribution centered around 5-7.
- **Evidence Update:** The successful landings shift the distribution upwards, setting a floor at 4. Delays and the short timeframe shift the ceiling downwards.
- **Posterior:** The distribution is now concentrated around 4-5, with a small probability of reaching 6.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected successful launches or last-minute schedule accelerations.
- **Tail Risks:** A surprise mission or an unexpected success could push the count to 6.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more optimistic scenario might consider 5-6 landings if IM-2 and another mission succeed.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the evidence and Bayesian updating, the forecasted percentiles are:

P10: 4  
P20: 4  
P40: 4  
P60: 5  
P80: 5  
P90: 6

# Forecasting: Spacecraft Landing on the Moon (2022-2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use two key reference distributions:

1. **Recent Lunar Landing Attempts (2000-2022)**: Before the question period, there were 5 successful lunar landings in the modern era (Chang'e 3, 4, 5, and Luna missions). The success rate was approximately 70-80% for established space agencies.

2. **Planned Missions (2022-2025)**: The background mentions "at least 18" planned landing missions for this period. Historical completion rates for planned space missions typically range from 30-50% due to delays, cancellations, and failures.

The prior distribution would have a median around 7-9 successful landings, with significant uncertainty (wide variance) given the ambitious plans but historical challenges.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Lunar landing remains technically challenging
- Mix of established space agencies and newer entrants
- Similar technical approaches to landing

**Differences from base rate:**
- We're now in October 2025, with only ~2.5 months left in the period
- We have concrete information about actual landings that have occurred
- Commercial lunar landing programs (CLPS) are now active
- More countries and private companies are attempting landings

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key evidence:**

1. **Confirmed successful landings to date (2022-2025)**: 
   - Chandrayaan-3 (India)
   - SLIM (Japan)
   - IM-1 (Intuitive Machines/NASA CLPS)
   - Chang'e 6 (China)
   - This establishes a firm floor of 4 successful landings

2. **Remaining scheduled missions in 2025:**
   - IM-2 (Intuitive Machines) targeting Q4 2025
   - Firefly's Blue Ghost Mission 1 slipped to early 2026
   - No other missions with high likelihood of launch before end of 2025

3. **Success rates of recent attempts:**
   - CLPS program: 1 success (IM-1), 1 failure (Peregrine) = 50% success rate
   - Overall modern attempts: ~64% success rate

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior centered around 7-9 landings, we update based on:

1. **Update on confirmed landings**: We now know exactly 4 landings have occurred, which collapses the lower end of our distribution.

2. **Update on remaining missions**: Most planned missions have been delayed beyond 2025, with only IM-2 having a realistic chance of landing in 2025.

3. **Update on success probability**: Given IM-2 is from the same company that successfully landed IM-1, its probability of success is higher than the base rate for first attempts, perhaps 70-80%.

4. **Update on schedule probability**: With only 2.5 months left, there's a significant chance (~40-50%) that IM-2 could slip to 2026.

This gives us a posterior distribution heavily concentrated on:
- 4 landings (if IM-2 slips or fails): ~50-60% probability
- 5 landings (if IM-2 launches and succeeds): ~40-50% probability
- 6+ landings: <5% probability (would require a surprise mission)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a surprise mission announcement
- I might be overestimating the likelihood of IM-2 launching in 2025
- There could be classified military missions not publicly disclosed

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view might place higher probability on 5 landings, arguing that Intuitive Machines has strong incentives to launch in 2025 and has demonstrated capability. However, space mission schedules are notoriously prone to delays, especially in Q4 when holidays can impact operations.

**Tail risks:**
- Extremely low probability (<1%) of a stealth mission from China or another actor
- Small chance (~5%) that I've missed a credible mission in the public schedule

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the evidence and analysis, my distribution is heavily concentrated on 4-5 landings, with minimal probability mass elsewhere:

P10: 4
P20: 4
P40: 4
P60: 5
P80: 5
P90: 5

Here is my probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question asks for the total number of successful lunar landings from 2022 through 2025. As of today (October 17, 2025), the vast majority of this period has already passed. Therefore, a traditional base rate for the entire four-year period is no longer appropriate.

The most relevant starting point is the **confirmed number of successful landings to date**, which sets a hard floor for the forecast. My research indicates four successful landings have occurred within the resolution window:
1.  **Chandrayaan-3** (August 2023)
2.  **SLIM** (January 2024)
3.  **IM-1 (Odysseus)** (February 2024)
4.  **Chang'e 6** (June 2024)

Thus, the current count is 4. The forecast is now focused on the number of *additional* landings in the remaining ~2.5 months of 2025. The "prior" is now the list of missions planned to launch and land in this short window. Research shows only one credible candidate: **Intuitive Machines' Mission 2 (IM-2)**.

The problem is therefore reduced to: What is the probability that IM-2 successfully lands by December 31, 2025? The final count will be 4 + (outcome of IM-2).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is fundamentally different from forecasting at the start of 2022.
*   **Similarities:** The inherent technical difficulty of lunar landing remains, making failure a significant possibility for any given attempt.
*   **Differences:** Uncertainty has collapsed. Instead of forecasting across ~18 planned missions over four years, we are forecasting the outcome of a single mission over ~75 days. The primary uncertainty drivers have shifted from the overall success rate of a large portfolio to the specific schedule and technical risks of one mission.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The final count will be 5 if IM-2 succeeds in 2025, and 4 otherwise. The probability of success can be broken down into two main components:
P(Success in 2025) = P(Launches in time for a 2025 landing) × P(Technical success | Launch)

*   **Evidence for Launching in Time:**
    *   **Positive:** IM-2 is officially targeting Q4 2025. The launch vehicle, SpaceX's Falcon 9, has a high flight rate and schedule flexibility.
    *   **Negative:** The term "Q4" is vague, and we are already in mid-October. Space missions are notoriously prone to schedule slips. The research report notes that Firefly's Blue Ghost mission slipped from late 2025 to 2026, which is a strong piece of evidence for the softness of these schedules. A slip of even a few weeks could push the landing into 2026.
    *   **Adjustment:** The risk of a schedule slip is the dominant uncertainty. I estimate the probability of launching in time for a 2025 landing at **~55%**.

*   **Evidence for Technical Success (Conditional on Launch):**
    *   **Positive:** This is Intuitive Machines' second attempt. They have invaluable direct experience from the successful (though imperfect) IM-1 mission. This should increase their chances compared to a first-time lander.
    *   **Negative:** Lunar landing is exceptionally difficult. IM-1's success was a near-failure, saved by a last-minute software patch. The modern base rate for non-Chinese landing attempts is poor (3 successes in 7 attempts, ~43%). The CLPS program itself is 1-for-2 (50%).
    *   **Adjustment:** The experience from IM-1 is a significant positive factor, pushing the probability above the base rates for first-timers or the CLPS program in general. However, the inherent difficulty caps this optimism. I estimate the conditional probability of technical success at **~65%**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My initial state was a confirmed count of 4, with uncertainty about one additional mission. I can now combine the likelihoods to form a posterior distribution for the final count.

*   Probability of one additional landing (IM-2 succeeds in 2025):
    *   P(Count = 5) = P(Launches in time) × P(Technical success)
    *   P(Count = 5) = 0.55 × 0.65 = 0.3575 ≈ **36%**

*   Probability of zero additional landings (IM-2 slips, fails, or both):
    *   P(Count = 4) = 1 - P(Count = 5)
    *   P(Count = 4) = 1 - 0.3575 = 0.6425 ≈ **64%**

My posterior distribution is heavily concentrated on two values: a 64% chance of the final count being 4, and a 36% chance of it being 5. The median of this distribution is 4.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

I've considered reasons why my forecast might be wrong.
*   **Could the count be > 5?** This would require another, currently unknown or unscheduled, mission to launch and land in the next ~75 days. Given the long lead times and public nature of space launches, this is extremely unlikely. I assign a near-zero probability to this.
*   **Is my probability for IM-2 success (36%) too low?** Perhaps the experience from IM-1 makes technical success much more likely (>80%), and as a public company, IM has immense pressure to avoid schedule slips. This could push the probability of a final count of 5 to over 50%.
*   **Is my probability for IM-2 success (36%) too high?** The history of space exploration is littered with failures and delays. My 55% chance of launching on time and 65% chance of technical success could both be overly optimistic. A more conservative view would place the probability of the count remaining at 4 even higher, perhaps at 70-75%.

I believe my final estimate of ~36% for an additional landing correctly balances the positive factor of prior experience against the strong negative base rates of schedule slips and technical failures in this domain. The distribution correctly reflects that 4 is the most likely outcome, while 5 remains a very plausible alternative.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The posterior distribution is P(4) ≈ 64% and P(5) ≈ 36%. This translates to the following percentiles:

P10: 4
P20: 4
P40: 4
P60: 4
P80: 5
P90: 5
