### Reference class & base rates
-   **GiveWell Top Charity List Composition:** GiveWell's top charity list was historically stable. However, in the last 5 years (2020-2025), there has been significant change. In 2022, four deworming charities were removed simultaneously due to a strategic criteria change. This suggests a ~20% annual probability of a major structural change to the list, but a much lower probability (<5%) of any single charity being added or removed in a given year outside of such a restructuring. The base rate for a *reversal* of a strategic change within 3 years is very low.
-   **Status of Previously-Recommended Charities:** Charities that leave the top list rarely return. Typically, removal is due to declining cost-effectiveness or filled funding gaps. In this case, the removal was for strategic reasons, placing deworming charities in a new "standout" category. The base rate for a charity returning from this specific status is unprecedented, but likely low, as this new structure appears stable.
-   **Evaluator Stance on Controversial Interventions:** Interventions with a polarized evidence base (like deworming) are subject to higher volatility in ratings. However, GiveWell's position has been remarkably consistent for nearly a decade: they acknowledge the controversy but find the expected value compelling after applying heavy discounts. The base rate of them changing this fundamental stance without major new evidence is very low.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-05-01** GiveWell grant to Evidence Action — ↓ — Confirmed continued funding for deworming in high-need areas (Nigeria) but supported exits from others (Kenya, Pakistan) due to declining prevalence. This reinforces the current strategy of targeted grants, not a return to the top charities list.
-   **2024-11-27** GiveWell's 2024 Top Charity Announcement — ↓ — The annual recommendation list for 2025 was released without any deworming charities, cementing the post-2022 status quo. The list remained focused on malaria, vitamin A, and cash incentives for infant vaccination.
-   **2022-08-19** Strategic Change in Top Charity Designation — ↓ — GiveWell removed all deworming charities from its top list, not due to a change in its evaluation of their effectiveness, but to direct its "Maximum Impact Fund" to a smaller set of programs it deemed even *more* cost-effective and in need of funding. This is the key historical event driving the current situation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **New Blockbuster Evidence (Large):** A definitive, high-quality replication of the Miguel & Kremer (2004) study showing large long-term economic gains would be the most powerful driver. Conversely, a high-profile failed replication would permanently end the debate against deworming. The evidence base has been static for years, so this is unlikely.
-   **GiveWell Methodological Changes (Large):** A significant shift in GiveWell's cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) framework—such as changing moral weights or discount rates for future income gains—could re-shuffle the rankings and potentially elevate deworming.
-   **Funding Saturation of Current Top Charities (Moderate):** If the current top charities (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation, Malaria Consortium) were to report that they have absorbed all the funding they can effectively use, GiveWell would direct new funds to the next-highest-rated programs, which would include deworming.
-   **Change in GiveWell's Communication Strategy (Moderate):** The 2022 change was partly justified as a way to provide clearer, more focused recommendations to donors. A future decision that this strategy is not working could lead to a reversal, but this is improbable in the short term.
-   **Declining Worm Prevalence (Moderate):** As deworming programs succeed, the prevalence of worms decreases. This reduces the marginal cost-effectiveness of mass treatment, making it harder for deworming to compete with other interventions for the top spots, as seen in the May 2025 grant.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Deliberate Strategic Stratification:** Unlike past list changes driven by new evidence on a single charity, the 2022 removal of deworming charities was a deliberate, system-wide change. GiveWell created a stable, alternative home for them (funded by the "All Grants Fund"), making a return to the top list less necessary and therefore less likely.
-   **"Thin Reed" Evidence Base:** Deworming's position is uniquely dependent on a single, controversial study for the vast majority of its modeled benefits. This makes it structurally different from interventions like malaria nets or vitamin A supplements, whose benefits are supported by a wider, more robust evidence base.
-   **Proximity to Resolution:** With only two months until the end of 2025, the window for a major strategic change, which is typically announced with significant lead time and justification in November/December, is nearly closed. Inertia is extremely high.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior near the base rate of a demoted charity returning to a top list, which is low. Given the strategic nature of the demotion, a prior of 10% (equivalent n=10) seems reasonable.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The 2022 strategic change established a new, stable equilibrium where deworming is intentionally separated from the "top charities" list. This is the strongest evidence for NO.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The absence of any new, game-changing evidence on deworming's effectiveness means the core reason for its controversial status has not changed, providing no impetus for a re-evaluation.
    -   (↓ Small) The May 2025 grant to Evidence Action confirms the new model: deworming is still valued and funded, but on a case-by-case basis through discretionary grants, not as a default top recommendation.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The extreme proximity to the resolution date makes a reversal of a major, publicly-explained strategic decision highly improbable. GiveWell's annual recommendations are imminent and are unlikely to contain such a surprise.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the post-2022 status quo. The posterior should move significantly downward from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A GiveWell blog post in Nov/Dec 2025 announcing a reversal of the 2022 "top charities" framework.
    -   A surprise announcement that one or more current top charities (e.g., Malaria Consortium) have become fully funded.
    -   Publication of a major, positive replication of the long-term economic benefits of deworming.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   GiveWell's official end-of-year recommendations for 2026 are published and do not include any deworming charities (this would be

To forecast the probability that at the end of 2025, any of GiveWell's top charities will perform mass deworming as their primary intervention, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for a charity returning to GiveWell's top list after being removed is very low, given the strategic nature of the 2022 removal. Historically, GiveWell's top charity list has been stable, but the 2022 change was a deliberate strategic shift. The base rate for a reversal of such a strategic change within three years is extremely low, likely less than 5%.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the strategic nature of the removal and the stability of the new structure, a prior probability of 10% seems reasonable. This reflects the low likelihood of a charity returning to the top list after a strategic removal.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base case in that GiveWell has maintained its strategic decision to separate deworming charities from the top list, reinforcing the stability of this decision.
- **Differences:** The proximity to the resolution date (end of 2025) makes a reversal of this decision even less likely, as major strategic changes are typically announced with significant lead time.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Strategic Change (2022):** The 2022 strategic change to remove deworming charities from the top list is strong evidence against a reversal. This change was not due to a reevaluation of effectiveness but to focus on more cost-effective interventions.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly decreases the probability of deworming returning to the top list.
- **Lack of New Evidence:** There has been no new, game-changing evidence on the effectiveness of deworming that would prompt a reevaluation.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately decreases the probability.
- **Recent Developments (2025):** The May 2025 grant to Evidence Action confirms the current strategy of targeted grants rather than a return to the top list.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Slightly decreases the probability.
- **Proximity to Resolution:** With only two months until the end of 2025, the likelihood of a major strategic change is very low.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The cumulative effect of the evidence strongly supports the status quo, suggesting a significant decrease in probability.
- **Posterior Odds:** Given the strong evidence against a reversal, the posterior odds are significantly lower than the prior odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is adjusted downward from the prior, reflecting the strong evidence against a reversal.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected developments, such as a sudden strategic shift by GiveWell or new evidence emerging.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major positive replication of the deworming study could change the landscape, but this is unlikely given the static evidence base.
- **Adjustments:** Given the strong evidence and proximity to resolution, the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian updating, the probability that any of GiveWell's top charities will perform mass deworming as their primary intervention at the end of 2025 is very low.

Final: 2%

# Probability Assessment: Will any of GiveWell's top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention by end of 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on the current status of deworming charities in GiveWell's recommendations and historical patterns of change.

**Key facts for establishing the prior:**
- As of 2022, GiveWell removed all deworming charities from its top charities list
- This was a strategic change in designation, not a change in effectiveness evaluation
- Deworming charities were placed in a "standout" category
- The question resolves in approximately 2 months (end of 2025)

The most appropriate base rate is the probability of a charity returning to GiveWell's top list after being strategically recategorized. Since this specific scenario (strategic recategorization rather than effectiveness concerns) is relatively unprecedented, I'll use a conservative prior of **10%**.

This prior reflects:
- The rarity of GiveWell reversing strategic framework decisions
- The short timeframe remaining until resolution (2 months)
- The fact that deworming charities weren't removed due to effectiveness concerns

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- GiveWell continues to value deworming interventions (still funds them through other mechanisms)
- The evidence base for deworming remains largely unchanged since the 2022 decision
- GiveWell maintains a structured approach to charity evaluation and categorization

**Key differences:**
- The 2022 change was a deliberate strategic restructuring, not a typical charity-specific decision
- GiveWell created a stable alternative funding mechanism for deworming charities
- The May 2025 grant to Evidence Action shows GiveWell is comfortable with the current model of funding deworming through discretionary grants rather than top charity status
- We are extremely close to the resolution date (2 months), with GiveWell's annual recommendations typically announced in November/December

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of deworming returning to the top charities list compared to the base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: The 2022 strategic restructuring**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to top charities, this would represent a rapid reversal of a major strategic decision. Probability: 0.2
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, this is consistent with maintaining the new structure. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: May 2025 grant to Evidence Action**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to top charities, this recent grant would likely have signaled that change. Probability: 0.3
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, this grant pattern fits the current model perfectly. Probability: 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.95 = 0.32 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Proximity to resolution date**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to top charities, we would expect signals of this change by now. Probability: 0.15
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, the lack of signals is expected. Probability: 0.98
- Likelihood ratio: 0.15/0.98 = 0.15 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 4: Stable evidence base for deworming**
- P(E|H): If deworming returns to top charities, we would expect new positive evidence. Probability: 0.4
- P(E|~H): If deworming doesn't return, the unchanged evidence base is consistent. Probability: 0.85
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.85 = 0.47 (moderate evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10%/(100%-10%) = 0.111

First update (2022 strategic restructuring):
- Posterior odds = 0.111 × 0.22 = 0.024
- Posterior probability = 0.024/(1+0.024) = 2.4%

Second update (May 2025 grant pattern):
- Posterior odds = 0.024 × 0.32 = 0.008
- Posterior probability = 0.008/(1+0.008) = 0.8%

Third update (Proximity to resolution):
- Posterior odds = 0.008 × 0.15 = 0.0012
- Posterior probability = 0.0012/(1+0.0012) = 0.12%

Fourth update (Stable evidence base):
- Posterior odds = 0.0012 × 0.47 = 0.00056
- Posterior probability = 0.00056/(1+0.00056) = 0.06%

This extremely low probability reflects the compounding evidence against deworming returning to GiveWell's top charities list by the end of 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of the 2022 strategic change
- I might be underestimating GiveWell's willingness to rapidly reverse course if new information emerges
- The resolution criteria include an alternative condition: if GiveWell no longer maintains a "top charities" list but 10% of regrants go to deworming

**Alternative scenarios:**
- GiveWell could announce a complete restructuring of their recommendation framework in November/December 2025
- A major new study confirming deworming's long-term benefits could emerge in the next month
- Current top charities might suddenly become fully funded, pushing GiveWell to expand their list

**Adjustments:**
The alternative resolution criterion (10% of regrants to deworming) provides a second path to positive resolution. However, the May 2025 grant suggests deworming is receiving targeted funding rather than broad regrants. Given the extremely low calculated probability and these considerations, I should adjust upward slightly to account for unforeseen scenarios and the alternative resolution path.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I adjust my forecast from 0.06% to 1%. This reflects:
- The extremely strong evidence against deworming returning to the top charities list
- The short timeframe remaining until resolution
- A small allowance for unforeseen developments or the alternative resolution path
- Recognition that extremely low probabilities often benefit from some regression to avoid overconfidence

Final: 1%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether a deworming charity will regain "top charity" status by the end of 2025, after the entire category was removed in a strategic shift in 2022. A suitable reference class is the rate at which major strategic decisions at established non-profits are reversed within a short timeframe (e.g., 3 years). Such reversals are uncommon, as they can signal instability and undermine credibility. A generous base rate for such a reversal, before considering any specific evidence, might be around 10%. This acknowledges that strategies can and do change, but it's not a frequent event.

*   **Prior P(H): 10%** (or 1:9 odds)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This situation differs from a standard charity being demoted and later returning.
*   **Similarities:** A category of intervention has been removed from the highest tier of recommendation, similar to how a single charity might be.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Systemic vs. Specific Change:** This was not an evaluation of a single charity's performance but a strategic decision to restructure the entire "top charities" list to focus on a smaller, more clearly communicated set of interventions.
    2.  **Stable Alternative:** The deworming charities were not simply dropped; they were moved to a "standout" category and continue to receive funding through GiveWell's "All Grants Fund." This new structure appears stable and intentional, reducing the need or pressure to reverse the decision.
    3.  **"Thin Reed" Evidence:** Deworming's heavy reliance on a single, controversial study for its modeled long-term benefits makes it a prime candidate for exclusion when the goal is to simplify and focus recommendations on less contentious interventions.

These differences suggest that a return to the top list is less likely than the base rate for a generic strategic reversal. The new structure is a stable equilibrium.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will assess the key evidence since the 2022 change.

*   **Evidence 1: The 2022 Strategic Change.** GiveWell removed all deworming charities from the top list to narrow its focus, not because their cost-effectiveness estimate changed dramatically. They created a new system for funding them.
    *   P(E | H): This event is unlikely if the plan was to restore them by 2025. A temporary change would have been framed differently.
    *   P(E | ~H): This event is the direct cause of the current state where deworming charities are not on the top list.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (strongly favors ~H).** This is the foundational evidence.

*   **Evidence 2: GiveWell's November 2024 Top Charity Announcement.** The official list for 2025 was released and did not include any deworming charities.
    *   P(E | H): For a deworming charity to be on the list at the end of 2025, it would have to be added mid-cycle, which is rare. Not being on the main annual list is strong evidence against H.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is exactly what we would expect if the post-2022 status quo continues.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (strongly favors ~H).**

*   **Evidence 3: Proximity to Resolution (October 25, 2025).** There are only about two months until the resolution date. GiveWell's annual recommendations are typically announced in November/December.
    *   P(E | H): For H to occur, GiveWell must announce a reversal of a major, publicly-justified strategic decision within the next ~6-8 weeks. Such a sudden reversal with no prior signaling is extremely improbable for a deliberate organization like GiveWell.
    *   P(E | ~H): The passage of time without any signal of a change is perfectly consistent with the status quo holding.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (very strongly favors ~H).** Institutional inertia is extremely high this close to the deadline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the updates conceptually.

1.  **Start with a 10% prior.** This is the chance of a strategic reversal within 3 years.
2.  The November 2024 announcement, which explicitly excluded deworming charities for the 2025 calendar year, was a major confirmation of the new strategy. This evidence should dramatically lower the probability, moving it from 10% into the low single digits (e.g., ~2-3%).
3.  The final and most powerful piece of evidence is the time decay. As of late October 2025, the window for a major, un-telegraphed strategic reversal to be announced and implemented has shrunk to almost nothing. This final update pushes the probability down much further.

*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR(E1) × LR(E2) × LR(E3)**
*   Posterior Odds = (1/9) × (very small number) × (very small number) × (extremely small number)
*   The result is a posterior probability that is very close to zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Best Case for "Yes":** The strongest counterargument is that all current top charities (malaria, vitamin A, etc.) simultaneously report that their funding gaps are filled for the foreseeable future. This would force GiveWell to direct its "Maximum Impact Fund" to the next tier of interventions, which would include deworming. They could then announce this as a change in their end-of-year recommendations.
*   **Rebuttal:** This scenario is highly unlikely. GiveWell monitors funding gaps continuously, and it's improbable that all would saturate at once without warning. Even if they did, GiveWell might choose to add a new intervention type rather than reverse its 2022 decision.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Am I being too confident in institutional stability? Yes, surprises happen. However, the sheer weight of consistent evidence—the initial strategic rationale, the subsequent confirmations, and the lack of any counter-signals—makes this a very high-confidence forecast. A probability of 1% leaves room for a "black swan" event or a completely unexpected internal decision, which is appropriate.

### 6. Final Forecast
The 2022 decision to remove deworming charities was a deliberate, structural change, not a temporary re-evaluation. All subsequent actions and the lack of new game-changing evidence have reinforced this new status quo. With only two months remaining until the resolution date, the window for a reversal of this major strategic decision is nearly closed. The probability of such an event is extremely low.

Final: 1%
