Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Base Rate Analysis:** What is the historical frequency of peaceful, negotiated transfers of sovereignty for populated territories, especially between allied Western democracies in the post-WWII era? What about US territorial acquisitions specifically?
2.  **US Motivation & Priority:** What is the current US interest in Greenland? Is it primarily driven by one individual (Donald Trump), or is there a deeper institutional strategic interest? How high a priority is this for a potential second Trump administration, based on stated plans like Project 2025 and other policy outlines?
3.  **Danish Political Landscape:** What is the political consensus in Denmark regarding Greenland's sovereignty? How did the Danish government and public react to the 2019 proposal? What are the domestic political costs for any Danish government to even entertain such negotiations?
4.  **Greenland's Stance & Autonomy:** What is the position of the Greenlandic government (Naalakkersuisut) and its people? What powers does the 2009 Act on Greenland Self-Government grant them regarding sovereignty? What are their long-term political aspirations (e.g., independence)?
5.  **Procedural & Timeline Feasibility:** What are the legal and constitutional steps required for such a transfer? Could "formal negotiations" be announced and initiated within the short timeframe (by January 1, 2026), considering a new US administration would just be starting?
6.  **Recent Signals (Last 6 Months):** Have there been any recent diplomatic overtures, high-level meetings, or public statements from US, Danish, or Greenlandic officials that suggest this topic is active?

### **Step 2: Proposed Search Queries**

1.  **Base Rate:**
    *   `peaceful transfer of sovereignty post-1945`
    *   `history of US territorial purchases`
    *   `sale of populated territory between democracies`
    *   `precedent for selling autonomous region`
2.  **US Motivation:**
    *   `Project 2025 foreign policy Greenland`
    *   `Heritage Foundation "Mandate for Leadership" Greenland`
    *   `Donald Trump statements Greenland 2024 2025`
    *   `US strategic interest in Arctic resources Greenland`
    *   `US consulate Nuuk purpose and activities`
3.  **Danish Stance:**
    *   `Danish government reaction Trump Greenland offer 2019`
    *   `Mette Frederiksen Greenland sovereignty "absurd"`
    *   `Danish political parties stance on Greenland sale`
    *   `Denmark constitution transfer of territory`
4.  **Greenland's Stance:**
    *   `Greenland government reaction to US purchase offer`
    *   `Greenland Self-Government Act sovereignty clause`
    *   `Greenland independence movement status 2025`
    *   `Public opinion in Greenland on US vs Denmark`
5.  **Procedural Feasibility:**
    *   `legal process to transfer Greenland sovereignty`
    *   `referendum requirements Greenland independence sale`
    *   `timeline for treaty negotiations between countries`
6.  **Recent Signals:**
    *   `US-Denmark-Greenland joint committee meetings 2025`
    *   `Arctic Council news US Denmark 2025`
    *   `statements from US ambassador to Denmark on Greenland`

### **Step 3: Synthesis of Findings**

My research indicates that the probability is extremely low. The base rate for such a transaction in the modern era is effectively zero. The 2019 proposal was met with swift, unified, and derisive rejection from all political actors in both Denmark and Greenland, who framed it as an insult to their sovereignty and self-determination. The provided sources on a potential second Trump administration's priorities (Project 2025, etc.) focus on tax cuts, deregulation, trade, and immigration, with no mention of purchasing Greenland, suggesting it is not a prepared, high-priority policy goal. Legally, the process would be extraordinarily complex, requiring consent and likely referenda in Greenland and Denmark, making the short timeline to Jan 1, 2026, completely unfeasible for announcing *formal* negotiations. The primary driver for a "Yes" is the idiosyncratic and unpredictable nature of Donald Trump, but even he would face insurmountable institutional and diplomatic opposition.

### **Step 4: Draft Research Brief**

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Peaceful transfer of populated territory between allied democracies (post-1945):** The base rate is effectively 0%. There are no modern precedents for one Western democratic nation selling a populated, autonomous territory to another. Such actions are contrary to post-war norms of self-determination.
*   **US acquisitions of foreign territory:** This is a historical reference class. The last major acquisition was the US Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917. Other examples (Alaska 1867, Louisiana 1803) occurred in a vastly different geopolitical era of empires and colonialism. This class suggests such events are, at best, a once-in-a-century phenomenon, making the prior probability extremely low.
*   **Failed/rejected territorial offers:** A more relevant class may be public offers for territory that were immediately rejected. President Truman's 1946 offer of $100 million for Greenland was also rejected by Denmark. This suggests a pattern of US interest and Danish refusal.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-11-05] Donald Trump wins the 2024 US Presidential election. ↑ — This is the primary catalyst for the question, as he is the only modern political figure to have publicly floated the idea.
*   [2024-11-08] Project 2025 policy documents gain wide attention. ↓ — The comprehensive, 900+ page blueprint for a conservative administration makes no mention of purchasing Greenland, suggesting it is not a prepared policy priority for a second Trump term.
*   [2025-06-10] US Consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, marks its fifth anniversary. ↔ — Shows sustained US strategic interest in Greenland and the Arctic, but this engagement operates through conventional diplomatic channels, not territorial acquisition.
*   [Hypothetical 2025-11-20] Danish and Greenlandic officials, in response to media speculation, reiterate that Greenland is not for sale. ↓ — Any re-emergence of the topic would likely be met with a swift and public shutdown, reinforcing the high political barriers.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Trump's personal transactional worldview:** The single most important driver for "Yes." His tendency to view foreign policy through a real estate and business lens makes him uniquely capable of proposing such a deal. (Size: Large, but low probability of overcoming other factors).
*   **Danish political and public consensus:** An overwhelming driver against. The idea is considered "absurd" across the political spectrum in Denmark. Entertaining it would be politically suicidal for any Danish government. (Size: Large).
*   **Greenlandic self-determination:** A powerful driver against. Greenland is on a path toward greater autonomy and potential independence. Being sold would be seen as a colonial act, which is anathema to the Greenlandic political identity. (Size: Large).
*   **US institutional foreign policy:** The US State Department and DoD have strategic interests in the Arctic (countering Russia/China, climate change, shipping lanes) but prefer to pursue them via alliances, basing rights (Thule Air Base), and investment, not disruptive territorial acquisitions. (Size: Moderate, against).
*   **Procedural and timeline constraints:** The legal path requires, at minimum, agreement from the governments of the US, Denmark, and Greenland, likely followed by parliamentary ratifications and a referendum in Greenland. This process takes years, not weeks. (Size: Large).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Greenland's autonomy:** Unlike territories purchased in the 19th or early 20th centuries, Greenland has a high degree of self-governance and a distinct national identity. Its government and people must consent, which is a near-insurmountable hurdle.
*   **Nature of the proponent:** The idea originates not from a calculated, institutional foreign policy process but from the idiosyncratic worldview of a specific political leader (Donald Trump). This makes it both more likely to be proposed and less likely to succeed.
*   **Geopolitical context:** The US is not seeking territory for colonial expansion, but for strategic advantage in the Arctic. However, this advantage can be secured through less disruptive means that do not violate modern international norms of self-determination.
*   **Seller's position:** Denmark is a wealthy nation under no financial duress that would compel it to sell a strategically and emotionally significant part of its Realm.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The prior should be extremely low, reflecting a base rate near 0% for such transfers in the modern era. An "equivalent n" of over 100 observations of non-events seems appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Trump's election victory and known personal interest. (Moderate positive update from the floor).
    *   (↓) Overwhelming, publicly-stated, and politically-entrenched opposition from both Denmark and Greenland. (Large negative update).

To forecast the probability of the United States and Denmark announcing formal negotiations over the possible transfer of sovereignty of Greenland to the United States before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical frequency of peaceful, negotiated transfers of sovereignty for populated territories between Western democracies in the post-WWII era is effectively 0%. The last major US territorial acquisition was the US Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, which occurred in a different geopolitical context. Thus, the base rate for such an event is extremely low, near 0%.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the lack of precedent and the historical context, the initial prior probability is set very low, at approximately 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a Western democracy (the US) expressing interest in acquiring a territory (Greenland) from another Western democracy (Denmark), similar to historical cases of territorial acquisition.
- **Differences:** Unlike historical acquisitions, Greenland is an autonomous territory with a distinct national identity and self-governance. The geopolitical context has shifted towards respecting self-determination and sovereignty, making such acquisitions highly unlikely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Trump's Interest:** Donald Trump's previous expression of interest in acquiring Greenland provides some evidence for the possibility, but it is largely driven by his personal worldview rather than institutional policy. Likelihood ratio: Slightly increases probability.
- **Danish and Greenlandic Opposition:** Strong opposition from Denmark and Greenland, both politically and publicly, significantly decreases the probability. Likelihood ratio: Strongly decreases probability.
- **US Institutional Policy:** The lack of mention in Project 2025 and other policy documents suggests it is not a priority, further decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio: Decreases probability.
- **Procedural Complexity:** The legal and procedural requirements for such a transfer are complex and time-consuming, making it unlikely within the given timeframe. Likelihood ratio: Strongly decreases probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1% probability translates to odds of 1:99.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is heavily weighted against the event occurring.
- **Posterior Odds:** The posterior odds remain very low, as the evidence overwhelmingly suggests the event is unlikely.
- **Posterior Probability:** After updating, the probability remains extremely low, around 0.1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast considers the possibility of unexpected political shifts or diplomatic developments, but these are deemed unlikely given the strong opposition and procedural hurdles.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where Trump prioritizes this issue and overcomes opposition is considered, but remains implausible due to entrenched political and public resistance.
- **Adjustment:** No significant adjustment is necessary, as the analysis already accounts for potential tail risks.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** The final forecast reflects the base rate and the impact of the evidence, resulting in a very low probability of the event occurring.

Final: 0.1%

# Will the US and Denmark announce formal negotiations over the possible transfer of sovereignty of Greenland to the United States before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for sovereign territory transfers between democratic nations in the modern era.

**Historical base rate considerations:**
- Post-WWII transfers of populated territory between democratic allies: Effectively 0 cases
- US territorial acquisitions in the 20th-21st centuries: Only the US Virgin Islands (1917) from Denmark
- Failed/rejected territorial offers: Truman's 1946 offer for Greenland, Trump's 2019 interest

The most appropriate base rate is extremely low. The last US territorial acquisition was over 100 years ago, and there are no modern examples of democratic nations selling populated autonomous territories to allies. The international norm has shifted decisively toward self-determination.

**Prior probability: 0.5%**

This reflects the near-zero historical frequency while acknowledging that extremely rare events do occasionally occur in international relations.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Involves the same countries (US and Denmark) as previous territorial transactions
- Strategic Arctic interests remain relevant for the US
- Trump's personal interest in Greenland acquisition mirrors his 2019 position

**Key differences:**
- Greenland now has significantly more autonomy than territories historically transferred
- Modern international norms strongly oppose territorial transfers without population consent
- Danish and Greenlandic political consensus against any sale is stronger and more unified
- The timeline (by January 2026) is extremely compressed for such complex negotiations

These differences significantly reduce the already low probability, as the barriers are higher than in historical cases.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's re-election and personal interest**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were to be announced, Trump's personal interest would almost certainly be the driving factor (≈95%)
- P(E|~H): Trump can be re-elected without Greenland negotiations occurring (≈99%)
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.96 (slightly negative)
- While Trump's interest is necessary for this scenario, his election alone is insufficient to overcome other barriers

**Evidence 2: Danish and Greenlandic political opposition**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were announced, we would expect to see some softening of Danish/Greenlandic opposition (≈20%)
- P(E|~H): Strong opposition is expected regardless (≈95%)
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.21 (strongly negative)
- The unified, cross-party rejection of the idea in both Denmark and Greenland presents a major obstacle

**Evidence 3: Absence from Project 2025 and policy priorities**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were to be announced, we would expect some mention in policy documents (≈70%)
- P(E|~H): Absence from policy documents is expected (≈90%)
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.78 (negative)
- The absence of Greenland acquisition from Trump administration planning documents suggests it's not a prepared priority

**Evidence 4: Procedural and timeline constraints**
- P(E|H): If negotiations were announced, they would need to begin very early in Trump's term (≈30%)
- P(E|~H): The timeline is prohibitively short for such complex negotiations (≈95%)
- Likelihood ratio: Approximately 0.32 (strongly negative)
- The compressed timeline makes even preliminary announcements of formal negotiations highly unlikely

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.005/0.995 ≈ 0.005:

Updating on Danish/Greenlandic opposition:
- Posterior odds = 0.005 × 0.21 ≈ 0.001
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.1%

Further updating on procedural/timeline constraints:
- Posterior odds = 0.001 × 0.32 ≈ 0.00032
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.03%

The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that formal negotiations are extremely unlikely before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Trump's unpredictability and willingness to pursue unconventional foreign policy
- There could be private diplomatic channels or discussions not visible to the public
- A major geopolitical shift in the Arctic (e.g., aggressive Russian moves) could change strategic calculations

**Alternative scenario:**
Trump could announce "negotiations" unilaterally without Danish agreement, which might technically satisfy the resolution criteria. However, this would likely be immediately rejected by Denmark and not constitute genuine "formal negotiations."

**Adjustments:**
Given the possibility of unpredictable actions by Trump, I should slightly increase my probability from the near-zero value calculated above.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the extremely low historical base rate, the strong political opposition in Denmark and Greenland, the absence of this goal in policy planning documents, and the prohibitive timeline constraints, the probability of formal negotiations being announced before 2026 is very low.

However, accounting for Trump's unpredictability and the small possibility of unilateral actions or dramatic geopolitical shifts, I'll adjust slightly upward from my calculated posterior.

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the announcement of formal negotiations for the peaceful transfer of sovereignty of a populated, autonomous territory between two allied Western democracies.

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is such transfers in the post-WWII era. In this period, international norms have heavily favored self-determination, and the concept of "selling" a populated territory has become politically and ethically unacceptable.
*   **Historical Frequency:** There are no instances of one allied Western democracy selling a populated, autonomous territory to another since 1945. The last major US territorial purchase was the US Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917, which occurred in a vastly different geopolitical era of colonialism. President Truman's 1946 offer for Greenland was also rejected.
*   **Prior Probability:** Based on this reference class, the base rate is effectively 0%. For forecasting purposes, I will set a very low prior probability, reflecting an event that is historically unprecedented in the modern era. A prior of **0.1%** (or 1:999 odds) seems appropriate, representing a "black swan" level of rarity.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base case (of non-events) in that Denmark is a wealthy, stable democracy under no financial or political duress that would compel it to sell territory. Furthermore, Greenland possesses a high degree of autonomy and a strong political desire for self-determination, not a change of suzerain.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the specific political actors involved. The idea was revived by former (and in this scenario, current) President Donald Trump, whose transactional and unconventional approach to foreign policy makes him uniquely capable of proposing such a deal. His presidency is the single factor that makes this question non-trivial. This moves the situation from "unthinkable" in a normal administration to "highly improbable but conceivable" under a Trump administration.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that formal negotiations are announced before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Donald Trump is the US President.**
    *   This is the primary catalyst. His known interest from 2019 and his transactional worldview make the event plausible enough to ask the question.
    *   P(E | H) is very high (nearly 1), as the event is almost unimaginable without him as president.
    *   P(E | ~H) is also high, as his presidency doesn't guarantee this specific outcome.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence dramatically increases the probability from the near-zero prior.

*   **Evidence 2: Vehement, unified opposition from Denmark and Greenland.**
    *   In 2019, the Danish Prime Minister called the idea "absurd," and the Greenlandic government stated unequivocally, "Greenland is not for sale." This sentiment is politically entrenched and reflects public opinion.
    *   P(E | H) is extremely low. For H to occur, both governments would need to completely reverse this public, deeply-held position.
    *   P(E | ~H) is very high. This opposition is the primary reason the event is unlikely.
    *   The likelihood ratio is very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The extremely short timeline.**
    *   The question resolves on January 1, 2026. The current date is November 23, 2025. This leaves only about five weeks for an announcement.
    *   P(E | H) is infinitesimally small. Diplomatic negotiations of this magnitude, especially starting from a point of public hostility, take years of groundwork. To reach the stage of a "formal announcement" in five weeks is virtually impossible. There have been no public signals of any secret back-channel talks having occurred over the past year.
    *   P(E | ~H) is extremely high. The short timeline is a primary reason why the event will not occur.
    *   The likelihood ratio is extremely close to zero. This is the most powerful piece of evidence against a "Yes" resolution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with the Prior:** 0.1% (Odds: 1:999). This reflects the historical impossibility of such an event.
2.  **Update with Trump's Presidency:** This is a strong update in favor. Let's say it increases the odds 100-fold, acknowledging that he is a unique actor.
    *   Intermediate Odds ≈ 100 * (1/999) ≈ 1/10.
    *   Intermediate Probability ≈ 9%. This represents a hypothetical chance if Trump faced no external constraints.
3.  **Update with Opposition and Timeline:** The combination of total political opposition and the impossibly short timeline provides an enormous downward update. The likelihood ratio is extremely small. A conservative estimate for the combined negative update would be a factor of 1000 or more.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1/10) * (1/1000) = 1/10000.
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.01%.

This calculation shows the probability is extremely low. Rounding up to a more conventional "very low probability" forecast seems reasonable to account for unknown unknowns.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario for "Yes":** Could there be a massive, secret deal already in place, ready to be announced? For example, the US offers Denmark an unprecedented security guarantee and a financial package so large it changes their entire calculus, and this has been negotiated in secret all year. The announcement is just waiting for a politically opportune moment in the next month.
*   **Rebuttal:** This scenario is implausible. The political systems of Denmark and Greenland are transparent. A secret of this magnitude is almost impossible to keep, and the political backlash against the leaders who agreed to it would be career-ending and potentially destabilizing for their governments. There is no conceivable offer that would be worth this political cost.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast is very low, which can be a form of overconfidence. However, the structural barriers (political, legal, normative) combined with the severe time constraint make this a rare case where a very low probability is well-justified. The resolution criteria are strict, requiring a formal announcement from *both* governments on the specific topic of "transfer of sovereignty," leaving little room for a surprising resolution through semantic ambiguity. A 1% forecast is a standard way to express "extremely unlikely" while acknowledging that the future is never certain.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such a territorial transfer is effectively zero in the modern era. While the presidency of Donald Trump makes the proposition thinkable, the insurmountable political opposition in both Denmark and Greenland, combined with the now extremely short timeline of just over one month, makes the announcement of formal negotiations a virtual impossibility. The political cost to any Danish or Greenlandic leader for even entertaining the idea would be immense. The timeline alone precludes the complex diplomatic maneuvering required for such a monumental announcement. The probability is therefore extremely low.

Final: 1%
