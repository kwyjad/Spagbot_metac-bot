### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Mature Orbital Launch Vehicles (e.g., Atlas V, Soyuz-FG, Ariane 5):** This class includes rockets with a long history of operational flights and established reliability. Their failure rates are typically in the 1-3% range over their lifetimes. For example, the Atlas V has had over 90 launches with no full failures (a 0% failure rate, though one partial failure). The Soyuz-FG had 70 launches with one failure (1.4%). This class provides a conservative upper bound for a mature, reliable system.
2.  **All Falcon 9 Family Launches (2010-Present):** This includes all variants from the beginning of the program. As of late 2025, there have been over 380 launches with 2 in-flight failures (CRS-7 in 2015, Flight 4 in 2010), 1 on-pad failure (AMOS-6 in 2016), and 1 partial failure (CRS-1 in 2012). This gives a historical failure rate of approximately 1%. However, this rate is dominated by early program issues and is not representative of the current system's maturity.
3.  **Falcon 9 Block 5 Variant (2018-Present):** This is the most relevant reference class. The Block 5 is the current, mature iteration of the rocket, designed for high reusability and reliability. It has flown over 330 times consecutively without a single launch failure. Its demonstrated historical failure rate is effectively 0%. While the true probability is non-zero, this track record suggests a per-launch failure probability well under 0.5%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The forecast horizon is extremely short (to 2025-12-31), so the last 6 months are most relevant. The dominant recent development is the continuation of an unprecedentedly high and successful launch cadence.
- **[2025-11-23]** item — ↓ — SpaceX successfully launched its 100th mission of 2025. This milestone underscores the extreme operational tempo and reliability of the Falcon 9 system, reinforcing the maturity mechanism.
- **[2025-10-15]** item — ↓ — A Falcon 9 successfully launched the Crew-11 mission to the ISS. A nominal crewed flight is the highest demonstration of confidence in the system's reliability from both SpaceX and NASA.
- **[2025-09-01]** item — ↓ — SpaceX announced it had completed the 300th successful landing of a first-stage booster. This highlights the maturity and deep understanding of the reusability process, which was once considered a primary risk factor.
- **[2025-06-01 to 2025-11-26]** item — ↓ — Throughout this period, SpaceX has maintained an average launch cadence of approximately one launch every 3.5 days, with no reported significant anomalies or stand-downs, indicating a stable and predictable system.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **System Maturity & Learning Curve (Large, ↓):** With over 330 consecutive successes for the Block 5 variant, the system is deep into the flat part of the "bathtub curve" of reliability. Unknown design flaws have been engineered out, and operational processes are exceptionally refined.
2.  **Component Failure (Large, ↑):** This remains the primary driver for any potential failure. A random failure of a critical component (e.g., turbopump, valve, avionics) that was not caught in quality control could lead to a loss of vehicle. This is the classic "black swan" risk for mechanical systems.
3.  **Human Error (Moderate, ↑):** With a high launch tempo, the risk of error during booster processing, payload integration, or launch operations could increase due to personnel fatigue or process shortcuts. However, SpaceX's high degree of automation likely mitigates this.
4.  **High Cadence Data Flow (Moderate, ↓):** The high launch rate provides an unparalleled stream of flight and refurbishment data. This allows SpaceX to monitor fleet health, track component wear, and proactively retire hardware, turning a potential risk (reusability) into a reliability advantage.
5.  **Reusability-Induced Wear (Small, ↑):** There is a non-zero risk that a novel failure mode related to component fatigue from multiple re-flights could emerge. However, after hundreds of re-flights, this risk appears to be very well-managed and understood.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Unprecedented Success Streak:** The current streak of over 330 successes for the Block 5 variant is a significant outlier compared to any other launch vehicle in history. The base rate from "Mature LVs" (1-3% failure) does not account for this demonstrated hyper-reliability.
2.  **Extreme Launch Cadence:** Falcon 9's launch rate (~100-120 launches/year) is an order of magnitude higher than the reference class (e.g., Atlas V at ~5-10/year). This provides more opportunities for failure but also more data to prevent them.
3.  **Reusability at Scale:** Unlike the fully expendable rockets in the reference class, Falcon 9's core business model is reusability. This introduces different potential failure modes but also provides the data stream (Mechanism #4) that drives reliability up.
4.  **Vertical Integration:** SpaceX's control over design, manufacturing, and launch operations allows for much tighter feedback loops to address potential issues compared to traditional aerospace contractors, enabling rapid iteration and improvement.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the "Mature Orbital Launch Vehicles" class, suggesting a per-launch failure probability (p) of ~1% (e.g., Beta(1, 99)). This is a conservative starting point that acknowledges that rockets can fail.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **↓ (Large):** The evidence of >330 consecutive Block 5 successes is overwhelmingly strong. This should pull the posterior estimate of *p* down by orders of magnitude.
    - **↓ (Moderate):** The continued high operational tempo without incident in recent months confirms the system is stable and not degrading under strain.
    - **↑ (Small):** The residual, unobserved risk of "black swan" events or latent wear-out effects prevents the posterior from going to zero, but this is a weak counter-argument against the mountain of success data.
- **Net effect:** The posterior belief for the per-launch failure probability should be drastically updated downwards from the initial prior, to a value likely in the range of 0.1% - 0.3%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
The resolution period ends on 2025-12-31. There are approximately 35 days remaining. At the current cadence, this implies ~8-12 more launch opportunities.
- **UP indicators:**
    - Any launch abort after engine ignition (a "pad abort").
    - A launch delay of more than 72 hours for unspecified "technical issues."
    - Any statement from the FAA or Space Force regarding an investigation or anomaly.
    - A sudden, unexplained decrease in launch cadence.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Each successful launch between now and Dec 31, 2025.
    - A nominal launch and landing of a booster on a high-number re-flight (e.g., its 20th+ flight).
    - Public statements from SpaceX or NASA reaffirming confidence before a high-profile launch.

### Caveats & pitfalls
1.  **Resolution Source Dependency:** The outcome is tied strictly to the "Launch outcome" column on a specific Wikipedia page. A delay in updating this page or a dispute over the definition of "Failure" could affect resolution.
2.  **Black Swan Risk:** The entire forecast rests on the assumption that an extremely reliable system will continue to be reliable. Past performance is not a perfect guarantee of future results; a single unforeseen event invalidates the trend.
3.  **Information Asymmetry:** SpaceX is a private company and is not fully transparent about internal anomalies or near-misses. The public only sees catastrophic failures, not the issues that were caught and fixed.
4.  **Zero Failures to Date:** The current count for the 2022-2025 period is zero. The question is therefore entirely about the probability of a failure in the ~10 remaining launches of 2025.
5.  **Compounding Probabilities:** The final number of failures is a function of `(number of launches) * (per-launch failure probability)`. An error in estimating the number of remaining launches will impact the final probability distribution, though the extremely low failure rate is the dominant variable.

**Final Research Summary:**
The current number of failures in the resolution period is zero. Given

To forecast the number of Falcon 9 failures before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach outlined in the task.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the Falcon 9 Block 5 variant, which has flown over 330 times consecutively without a failure. This suggests a per-launch failure probability significantly below 0.5%.
- **Reasoning:** The Block 5 variant is the current and mature iteration of the Falcon 9, designed for high reliability and reusability. Its track record is the most pertinent indicator of future performance.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Given the historical performance, a conservative prior might assume a failure probability of 0.1% to 0.3%, reflecting the extremely low observed failure rate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The Falcon 9 Block 5's reliability is consistent with the mature stage of the "bathtub curve" for failure rates, similar to other mature launch vehicles.
- **Differences:** The unprecedented success streak and high launch cadence are unique, providing more data and opportunities to catch potential issues, which is not typical for other launch vehicles.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **High Success Rate:** The >330 consecutive successful launches strongly suggest a lower failure probability.
- **High Launch Cadence:** The high frequency of launches without incident further supports the system's reliability.
- **Potential Black Swan Events:** While unlikely, the possibility of unforeseen failures (e.g., component failure) cannot be entirely dismissed.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Assume a prior failure probability of 0.1% to 0.3%.
- **Evidence Impact:** The strong evidence of continued success and operational stability significantly reduces the likelihood of failure.
- **Posterior Adjustment:** The posterior distribution should reflect an even lower failure probability, potentially around 0.05% to 0.1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must account for the small but non-zero risk of unexpected failures.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider scenarios like a sudden technical issue or regulatory intervention that could increase failure risk.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative estimate might assume a slightly higher failure probability, but given the evidence, this seems less plausible.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecast for the number of Falcon 9 failures before 2026 is extremely low, with the following percentiles reflecting a very low likelihood of any failures:

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 0  
P60: 0  
P80: 0  
P90: 0

# Forecasting Falcon 9 Failures Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use the historical failure rate of the Falcon 9 rocket family:

- Total Falcon 9 launches to date (as of late 2025): ~380 launches
- Total failures: 3 (CRS-7 in 2015, Flight 4 in 2010, AMOS-6 in 2016)
- Historical failure rate: ~0.8%

However, this overall rate includes early development failures. For the Block 5 variant (2018-present):
- ~330 consecutive successful launches
- 0 failures
- Empirical failure rate: 0%

I'll use a conservative prior centered around 0.3% per-launch failure probability, which acknowledges both the maturity of the system while not assuming perfect reliability.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

Similarities to base rate:
- Same company, same core rocket design and engineering philosophy
- Same manufacturing facilities and quality control processes
- Same launch operations teams and procedures

Key differences:
- The current Block 5 variant is significantly more mature than earlier versions
- SpaceX now has extensive experience with reusability (>300 successful booster landings)
- Launch cadence is extremely high (~100 launches/year), providing more operational data
- The remaining time window is very short (only ~35 days left in 2025)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Key evidence:
1. **330+ consecutive successful Block 5 launches**: Very strong evidence for extremely low failure rates (likelihood ratio strongly favors 0 failures)
2. **Current launch cadence of ~1 launch every 3.5 days**: At this rate, only ~8-12 more launches remain in 2025
3. **Continued successful high-profile missions** (like Crew-11): Indicates NASA's confidence in reliability
4. **No reported anomalies or stand-downs**: Suggests no concerning trends in system performance

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a conservative prior of 0.3% failure probability per launch:
- With ~8-12 launches remaining, the probability of seeing at least one failure is:
  1 - (1 - 0.003)^10 ≈ 0.03 or 3%

However, the 330+ consecutive successful launches provides extremely strong evidence that the true failure rate is even lower than 0.3%. If we update based on this evidence:
- A more realistic per-launch failure probability might be closer to 0.1%
- With ~10 launches remaining: 1 - (1 - 0.001)^10 ≈ 0.01 or 1%

This suggests a ~99% chance of seeing 0 failures and ~1% chance of seeing 1 failure before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots:
- **Black swan events**: Rare, unforeseen failure modes could still occur despite the impressive track record
- **Complacency risk**: High success rates might lead to reduced vigilance
- **Component wear from reuse**: Novel failure modes might emerge from pushing reusability limits
- **High launch cadence pressure**: Might increase risk of human error or process shortcuts

Alternative view: The true failure rate could be higher (0.5-1%) if we consider that:
1. Rockets are inherently complex systems with thousands of potential failure points
2. Even mature systems like the Space Shuttle experienced catastrophic failures after many successful missions
3. The current streak of successes could be partly due to good fortune

However, the sheer number of consecutive successes makes this alternative view increasingly implausible.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the extremely short time remaining in 2025, the impressive reliability record, and the limited number of remaining launch opportunities, my distribution is heavily concentrated at 0 failures:

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 0
P90: 1

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question asks for the total number of Falcon 9 failures between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2025. As of today (November 26, 2025), there have been **zero** failures in this period. The forecast is therefore for the number of failures in the remaining ~35 days of 2025.

The key variable is the per-launch failure probability (`p`). The most appropriate reference class is the **Falcon 9 Block 5 variant**, which has flown over 350 consecutive successful missions since its introduction in 2018.

A Bayesian approach to estimate `p` from 0 failures in `N=352` trials, using a conservative uniform prior (Beta(1,1)), yields a posterior distribution of Beta(1, 353).
- **Mean:** The mean of this distribution is `1 / (1 + 353)` ≈ 0.28%.
- **Spread:** The 95% credible interval for `p` is approximately (0.01%, 0.85%).

The number of failures in the remaining period can be modeled as a Binomial distribution, `F ~ Bin(N_rem, p)`, where `N_rem` is the number of remaining launches. Given the current cadence of ~3.5 days/launch, and 35 days remaining, `N_rem` is estimated to be around **10 launches**.

Our prior distribution for the number of failures is thus centered on an expectation of `10 * 0.0028 = 0.028` failures, with the probability of zero failures being `(1 - 0.0028)^10 ≈ 97.2%`.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is a direct continuation of the reference class period. The same rocket variant, operational procedures, and teams are involved. There are no significant known differences that would invalidate the historical data. The primary difference is simply that each new launch is an independent trial where a failure, however unlikely, could occur. The high launch tempo is unusual compared to other rockets, but it has been the standard operating procedure for Falcon 9 for several years.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The research report provides several pieces of evidence, all of which are highly consistent with a very low failure probability.

-   **Evidence (Strongly ↓):** The continued high cadence of successful launches, including the 100th of 2025 and a recent crewed mission, provides overwhelming evidence that the system is exceptionally reliable and stable. This strongly supports a very low value for `p`.
-   **Mechanism (Moderately ↓):** The high launch rate provides a rich stream of flight and refurbishment data, allowing SpaceX to proactively manage fleet health. This turns the potential risk of reusability into a reliability advantage, suggesting `p` is not just low but potentially still decreasing.
-   **Counter-Evidence (Weakly ↑):** The generic risks of random component failure or human error always exist. These are the primary drivers for any potential failure. However, there is no specific evidence to suggest these risks are elevated right now. They simply prevent us from assuming `p` is zero.

The net effect of the evidence is to confirm that the per-launch failure probability `p` is extremely low, consistent with the base rate derived from the Block 5's perfect record.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

The prior distribution, based on the `p ~ 0.28%` estimate, already gives a ~97.2% chance of zero failures. The recent evidence in the report (100th launch, etc.) is just more of the same "success" data, which would shift the estimate for `p` slightly lower and the probability of zero failures slightly higher.

However, a simple statistical model can be overconfident. It doesn't fully account for "unknown unknowns" or information asymmetry (SpaceX may have non-public information about near-misses). To be more robust, I will adjust my estimate of `p` upward from the statistical mean (0.28%) to a more conservative value near the 95th percentile of its posterior distribution, around **`p = 0.83%`**. This builds in a buffer for unobserved risks.

Using this conservative failure probability:
-   Number of remaining launches, `N_rem` = 10
-   Per-launch failure probability, `p` = 0.0083
-   Probability of 0 failures: `P(F=0) = (1 - 0.0083)^10 ≈ 0.920` (92.0%)
-   Probability of 1 failure: `P(F=1) ≈ 10 * 0.0083 * (0.920) ≈ 0.077` (7.7%)
-   Probability of 2+ failures: `P(F≥2) ≈ 1 - 0.920 - 0.077 = 0.003` (0.3%)

My posterior distribution for the number of failures before 2026 is heavily concentrated on zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast implies a 92% chance of zero failures. Could this be wrong?
-   **Alternative Forecast:** One could use the base rate for all "mature launch vehicles" (~1.5% failure rate). This would give `P(F=0) = (1-0.015)^10 ≈ 86%`, implying a ~14% chance of failure.
-   **Rebuttal:** This alternative is less plausible because it ignores the massive, specific dataset of 350+ consecutive successes for the Falcon 9 Block 5. This vehicle has demonstrably outperformed its reference class, and it would be a mistake to ignore that data.
-   **Overconfidence Check:** The main risk is a "black swan" event—a novel failure mode that isn't represented in the historical data. My adjustment of `p` from 0.28% to 0.83% is a direct attempt to account for this model uncertainty and tail risk. This adjustment lowers the probability of zero failures from 97.2% to a more cautious 92%.
-   **Conclusion:** The distribution remains highly skewed. The probability of zero failures is very high, and even with conservative adjustments, it remains above 90%.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The posterior probability distribution is P(0) ≈ 92%, P(1) ≈ 7.7%, P(≥2) ≈ 0.3%. To find the percentiles, we look at the cumulative distribution:
-   P(F ≤ 0) = 92.0%
-   P(F ≤ 1) = 99.7%

The p-th percentile is the smallest value `x` for which the cumulative probability is at least `p`.
-   For P10, P(F ≤ 0) = 92% which is > 10%. So, P10 = 0.
-   This holds true for P20, P40, P60, P80, and P90, as all are less than 92%.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 0
P90: 0
