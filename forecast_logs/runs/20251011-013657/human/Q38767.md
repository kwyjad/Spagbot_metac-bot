### Reference class & base rates
1.  **SOTA Improvement on New, Difficult AI Benchmarks:** This is the most relevant class. When a new, challenging benchmark is introduced (e.g., MMLU, GPQA, MATH), there's typically a rapid improvement in the first 12-18 months as major labs focus their next-generation models and fine-tuning techniques on it.
    *   **Base Rate:** A 20-40 percentage point increase in the first year is common for difficult, reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Starting from a baseline of 26.6%, this reference class suggests a year-end 2025 score in the **45% to 65%** range.
    *   **Reasoning:** MMLU saw SOTA jump from ~40% to over 80% in about two years. GPQA, a harder benchmark more analogous to HLE, saw SOTA improve from ~35% (GPT-4) to over 50% (reported for Gemini 1.5-era models) in about a year. HLE is new, so we are likely in the steepest part of the improvement curve.
2.  **Generational Model-over-Model Performance Leaps:** This class considers the typical performance jump from one frontier model generation to the next (e.g., GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, Gemini 1.0 to 1.5).
    *   **Base Rate:** A new model generation often improves SOTA on a challenging benchmark by **15-25 percentage points**.
    *   **Reasoning:** GPT-4's release represented a significant leap over its predecessors on numerous benchmarks. If a true next-generation model (e.g., "GPT-5" or "Gemini 2") is released before 2026, a similar jump from the current 26.6% is expected. This would place the score in the **40% to 52%** range from a single model release.
3.  **Progress on Multimodal Scientific Reasoning:** This is a more specific, but less quantifiable, reference class. Progress here has been slower than in pure text domains.
    *   **Base Rate:** Slower, more incremental gains, perhaps **10-15 percentage points** over a year, driven by architectural improvements rather than just scale.
    *   **Reasoning:** HLE's heavy reliance on interpreting complex scientific diagrams, charts, and formulas is a known weakness of current models. This reference class acts as a conservative anchor, suggesting a year-end score around **35% to 42%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-02** Humanity May Achieve the Singularity Within the Next 3 Months, Scientists Suggest (Source) — ↑ (small) — While hyperbolic, this reflects the intense pace of development and high expectations for near-term breakthroughs, increasing the perceived likelihood of a major model release.
*   **2025-09-15** (Hypothetical) Google DeepMind publishes a technical blog post on "Project Astra," demonstrating real-time, multi-modal reasoning on complex, dynamic inputs. — ↑ (moderate) — Shows a key competitor to OpenAI is making significant, public progress on the core technical challenges posed by HLE, increasing the chance of a competitive SOTA push.
*   **2025-07-20** (Hypothetical) Anthropic releases Claude 3.5, showing only incremental gains on most benchmarks and no major architectural shifts for multimodal tasks. — ↓ (small) — Suggests that at least one major lab's current trajectory might not be sufficient for a massive leap on HLE, slightly lowering the overall probability of a huge score increase.
*   **2025-06-08** AGI Report Card™–June 2025 (Source) — ↑ (small) — General sentiment indicator showing steady progress towards AGI, with specific mention of improved multimodal integration in 2025 models. Reinforces the idea that the necessary components are advancing.
*   **2025-03-18** HLE benchmark is announced with an initial SOTA of 26.6% from OpenAI's "Deep Research". — (Baseline) — This establishes the starting point and, crucially, indicates that OpenAI is *specifically targeting* this benchmark with a specialized team, not just a base model.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Release of a Next-Generation Frontier Model:** The single most important driver. A release of a model widely considered "GPT-5" or "Gemini 2" would almost certainly cause a large jump in performance. (Effect: Large)
2.  **Architectural Innovations in Multimodal Reasoning:** HLE is designed to stress-test the integration of visual and textual understanding, especially for abstract scientific concepts. A breakthrough here could unlock significant gains, even without a full new model generation. (Effect: Moderate)
3.  **Benchmark-Specific Optimization:** OpenAI's "Deep Research" team is a clear signal that labs are not just evaluating base models but are actively building specialized methods (e.g., custom tool-use, search augmentation, chain-of-thought fine-tuning) for HLE. This targeted effort can extract much more performance. (Effect: Moderate)
4.  **Scaling of Compute and Data:** The underlying driver of AI progress. Continued massive investment in training runs on larger, more diverse datasets (especially scientific and technical data) will improve model capabilities. (Effect: Large, but continuous/background)
5.  **Competitive Pressure:** With HLE positioned as a "final exam," the reputational prize for topping the leaderboard is immense. This will drive intense, focused efforts from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others. (Effect: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit "Frontier" Design:** Unlike some past benchmarks that were quickly saturated, HLE was explicitly designed by AI safety researchers to be difficult and test knowledge at the edge of human scientific understanding, potentially making progress slower than the MMLU base rate.
*   **Intense, Concentrated Competition:** The race for SOTA is now dominated by 3-4 extremely well-funded labs. This concentration of resources could accelerate progress faster than in previous eras with more distributed academic efforts.
*   **Very Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in under 3 months (from 2025-10-11). Progress is not continuous; it is "lumpy," tied to discrete model releases. This makes the forecast a bet on the *timing* of a release, not just the rate of progress.
*   **Multimodality as a Core Challenge:** HLE is not a text-only benchmark that has had visuals tacked on. Its multimodality is central and complex (e.g., interpreting abstract diagrams, not just identifying objects). This is a harder problem than text-based reasoning.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on **55%** with a wide standard deviation seems appropriate, derived from the "SOTA Improvement on New Benchmarks" reference class (26.6% baseline + ~30pp gain). Equivalent n=10, reflecting moderate confidence in this base rate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The entire field anticipates a next-generation model release in late 2025/early 2026. The question's timeline is perfectly aligned with this high-stakes release window.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The existence of a dedicated "Deep Research" team at OpenAI targeting HLE suggests that significant resources are being applied to "solve" this specific benchmark, likely yielding more than off-the-shelf performance.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The very short (<3 months) timeline is a major constraint. Any minor delay in a planned model release pushes it past the resolution date, resulting in a score of 26.6% or only a minor incremental update.
    *   (↓ Small) The benchmark's inherent difficulty and focus on frontier multimodal reasoning may make it more resistant to simple scaling effects compared to prior text-based benchmarks.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to a significant jump, conditional on a model release. The high likelihood of such a release should push the posterior mean upwards from the prior. The posterior should be wide and perhaps bimodal, with a large peak around a new SOTA and a smaller peak at the current SOTA (if no model is released). I suggest shifting the posterior mean up towards **60-65%**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcements or credible leaks about a Q4 2025 release date for GPT-5, Gemini 2, or Claude 4.
    *   Publication of a new paper by a major lab demonstrating a breakthrough in scientific visual question answering (SciVQA).
    *   Any update to the HLE leaderboard before December.
    *   Major AI figures (e.g., Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis) making public statements about imminent, significant capability gains.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcements that next-generation models are delayed until Q1 2026 or later.
    *   Technical blog posts from major labs highlighting persistent, fundamental challenges in multimodal reasoning.
    *   No updates to the HLE leaderboard by mid-December 2025.
    *   Key researchers known for scaling leaving major labs.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Lumpiness of Progress:** The final score will likely be either very close to the current 26.6% (if no major model is released) or jump to a much higher number (if one is). The average of these outcomes may not be a likely outcome itself.
*   **Benchmark Contamination:** While the creators aimed to use novel questions, there is always a risk that parts of the test set or similar problems have been inadvertently included in the massive training corpora of next-gen models.
*   **Definition of "AI System":** The criteria allow for "post-training enhancements." This could include complex, multi-step reasoning processes involving tool use and web search, making the final score much higher than the base model's raw capability.
*   **S-Curve Uncertainty:** We are assuming we are on the steep part

To forecast the best score by an AI on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the "SOTA Improvement on New, Difficult AI Benchmarks" class. Historically, new benchmarks see rapid improvements, with a 20-40 percentage point increase in the first year. Starting from a baseline of 26.6%, this suggests a year-end 2025 score in the 45% to 65% range. The mean of this base rate is approximately 55%, with a wide variance reflecting the uncertainty and potential for rapid advancements.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that HLE is a new, challenging benchmark, and AI labs are intensely focused on improving performance. However, it differs because HLE's multimodal nature and the short timeline until resolution may slow progress compared to purely text-based benchmarks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Next-Generation Model Release (↑ Large):** Anticipated releases of models like GPT-5 or Gemini 2 could significantly boost scores.
- **OpenAI's "Deep Research" Team (↑ Moderate):** Dedicated efforts to optimize for HLE suggest potential for substantial gains.
- **Short Timeline (↓ Moderate):** The less than 3-month window is a constraint, as any delay in model release could result in minimal improvement.
- **Benchmark Difficulty (↓ Small):** The inherent difficulty of HLE, especially in multimodal reasoning, may resist simple scaling improvements.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered on 55%, the evidence suggests a significant potential increase, conditional on a model release. The likelihood of such a release is high, given the current AI landscape. Thus, the posterior mean shifts upwards, with a wide distribution reflecting the uncertainty and potential for a bimodal outcome (either a significant jump or minimal change).

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must consider the possibility of no major model release, which would keep the score near 26.6%.
- **Tail Risks:** The distribution should account for the unlikely but possible scenario of a breakthrough that exceeds expectations.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a score around 35-40% if improvements are more incremental. However, given the evidence, this is less likely.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Considering the evidence and potential scenarios, the forecast percentiles are as follows:

P10: 30  
P20: 40  
P40: 50  
P60: 60  
P80: 70  
P90: 75

# Forecasting the Best Score on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) by 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary Reference Class: Recent AI Benchmark Progress**
- MMLU: Improved from ~40% to 80%+ in about 2 years
- GPQA: Improved from ~35% to 50%+ in about 1 year
- GSM8K: Improved from ~55% to 90%+ in about 1.5 years

Given that HLE is a new, challenging benchmark with a current SOTA of 26.6%, and considering the typical trajectory of improvement on difficult benchmarks, a reasonable prior would be:
- Mean/Median: 55% (representing a ~30 percentage point improvement from current SOTA)
- Spread: Standard deviation of ~15 percentage points (reflecting uncertainty)

This prior assumes we're in the steep part of the S-curve for this benchmark, with major labs actively working to improve performance.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- HLE is a new benchmark that major labs (especially OpenAI) are actively targeting
- The question timeframe (by end of 2025) aligns with expected next-generation model releases
- Competitive pressure among major labs will drive focused efforts on this benchmark

**Key differences:**
- HLE is explicitly designed to be more difficult than previous benchmarks, testing frontier knowledge
- The multimodal nature of HLE (including complex scientific diagrams) presents additional challenges
- The timeframe is very short (less than 3 months from today's date of October 11, 2025)
- OpenAI already has a dedicated "Deep Research" team specifically targeting this benchmark

These differences suggest both upward pressure (dedicated teams, competitive landscape) and downward pressure (benchmark difficulty, short timeframe) on our prior.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher scores:**
1. OpenAI's dedicated "Deep Research" team suggests significant resources allocated to this benchmark (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher scores)
2. The competitive landscape with 3-4 well-funded labs racing for SOTA increases likelihood of breakthrough (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)
3. The timing aligns with expected next-generation model releases from major labs (likelihood ratio ~2:1)

**Evidence for lower scores:**
1. The extremely short timeframe (<3 months) increases the risk that major model releases might miss the deadline (likelihood ratio ~1:1.5)
2. HLE's multimodal scientific reasoning requirements are particularly challenging (likelihood ratio ~1:1.3)
3. The benchmark was explicitly designed to be difficult and test frontier knowledge (likelihood ratio ~1:1.2)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with our prior centered at 55% with SD of 15 percentage points, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**Update on timing constraints:**
- The short timeframe significantly increases the risk that no major new model will be released before the deadline
- This creates a bimodal distribution: either we see the current 26.6% (if no new model) or a significant jump (if a new model is released)
- Probability of no major release before deadline: ~30%
- Expected score if new model is released: ~65%
- Weighted average: (0.3 × 26.6%) + (0.7 × 65%) ≈ 53.5%

**Update on benchmark difficulty:**
- The multimodal scientific reasoning requirements make HLE harder than typical text benchmarks
- This shifts our expected improvement downward by ~5 percentage points
- New expected score: 53.5% - 5% ≈ 48.5%

**Update on dedicated research efforts:**
- OpenAI's "Deep Research" team and competitive pressure suggest targeted optimization
- This shifts our expected improvement upward by ~7 percentage points
- Final posterior mean: 48.5% + 7% ≈ 55.5%

The posterior distribution is bimodal with peaks around 26.6% (current SOTA) and 65-70% (if a next-gen model is released), with an expected value around 55.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be overestimating the likelihood of a major model release in the next 3 months
2. I might be underestimating how difficult HLE is compared to previous benchmarks
3. I could be overlooking the possibility of a specialized, benchmark-specific approach that achieves high scores without a full model release

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **No major release scenario:** If no next-gen model is released before January 2026, we might only see incremental improvements to 30-35%
2. **Breakthrough scenario:** A fundamental architectural innovation could lead to scores of 75-80%, similar to the jump seen with GPT-4
3. **Benchmark hacking scenario:** A specialized system designed specifically for HLE could achieve 50-60% without generalized improvements

**Adjustments:**
- Widening my distribution to account for these scenarios
- Slightly lowering my median estimate to 53% to reflect the significant risk of no major release
- Ensuring my tail estimates (P10/P90) properly capture both the "no release" and "breakthrough" scenarios

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 28.5%
P20: 35.0%
P40: 48.0%
P60: 58.0%
P80: 68.0%
P90: 75.0%

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate is the performance improvement on new, difficult AI benchmarks in the first year after their release. Historically, for benchmarks like MMLU or GPQA, state-of-the-art (SOTA) models have improved by 20-40 percentage points within the first 12-18 months. HLE was released in March 2025, and the question resolves at the end of 2025 (~9.5 months later). Applying this base rate to the current SOTA of 26.6% suggests a year-end score in the range of 42% to 59%.

A secondary, more specific base rate is the typical performance jump from one frontier model generation to the next (e.g., GPT-3.5 to GPT-4). This leap is often around 15-25 percentage points. This suggests that if a next-generation model is released, the score would jump from 26.6% to a range of roughly 42% to 52%.

Given that progress is not continuous but "lumpy" (tied to model releases), the forecast is best modeled as a mixture of two scenarios:
1.  **No major model release before 2026:** The score remains near the current SOTA, perhaps with minor incremental improvements (e.g., 27-35%).
2.  **A major model release before 2026:** The score jumps significantly, consistent with the base rates above (e.g., 45-65%).

My prior assigns a ~70% probability to a major model release occurring in the timeframe, leading to a bimodal distribution with a mean in the mid-40s.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to past benchmark races in that it involves intense, focused competition among a few well-funded labs. However, there are key differences:
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves in less than three months (from mid-October 2025). This makes the forecast highly sensitive to the exact timing of a model release. A delay of just a few weeks could push a release from December 2025 to January 2026, drastically changing the outcome.
*   **Benchmark Design:** HLE is explicitly designed to be at the frontier of scientific knowledge and to heavily test multimodal reasoning with abstract diagrams. This may make it more resistant to improvement than previous text-heavy benchmarks, potentially tempering the size of the performance jump.
*   **Targeted Effort:** The existence of a dedicated "Deep Research" team at OpenAI for this benchmark indicates that labs are applying specialized, post-training enhancements. This could lead to higher scores than a base model would achieve alone.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **(↓ Moderate) Short Timeline:** The most significant piece of evidence is the <3 month window. Major AI model releases are complex projects prone to delays. This short timeframe increases the probability of the "no release" scenario, as any slip from a planned Q4 2025 release would miss the deadline. I am adjusting the probability of a release *and* evaluation before Jan 1 down from my prior of 70% to 60%.
*   **(↑ Moderate) Intense Competition & Expectations:** The general environment is one of high anticipation for a next-generation model from OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic in late 2025. The competitive pressure to claim SOTA on a "final exam" benchmark is immense, making a year-end release a strong strategic goal for these labs. This supports the 60% likelihood of the "release" scenario.
*   **(↑ Small) Dedicated Optimization Teams:** The fact that OpenAI is already using a specialized team suggests that if a new model is released, it will be heavily optimized for this task. This pushes the likely score in the "release" scenario higher than the base rate alone would suggest.
*   **(↓ Small) Benchmark Difficulty:** The multimodal and frontier-knowledge nature of HLE acts as a counterweight, suggesting the jump might be impressive but perhaps not as dramatic as on simpler, older benchmarks.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My prior was a bimodal distribution based on a ~70% chance of a major model release. The evidence, particularly the very short timeline, forces me to be more conservative about the release timing.

*   **Posterior State:** I update my belief to a mixture model with a **60%** probability of a "release" scenario and a **40%** probability of a "no release" scenario.
*   **"No Release" Scenario:** I model this as a small improvement over the current 26.6%, centered around **30%**.
*   **"Release" Scenario:** Factoring in both the power of a new model generation and the difficulty of the benchmark, I model this with a distribution centered around **56%**.
*   **Resulting Distribution:** The final posterior is a bimodal distribution with two distinct peaks. The overall mean is `(0.4 * 30) + (0.6 * 56) = 12 + 33.6 = 45.6%`. The median will be higher, falling in the lower end of the "release" distribution, at approximately 48%. The distribution has a wide spread and is left-skewed due to the significant probability of the score remaining low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

The primary risk to this forecast is overestimating the probability of a model release before the deadline. A more conservative forecaster might argue that the history of software delays makes a release in the next ~11 weeks unlikely, placing the probability closer to 30-40%. This would shift the entire distribution downwards, with a median in the low 30s.

Conversely, I might be underestimating the impact of a new model. The leap from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 was massive. If a similar leap occurs, and the model is heavily optimized for HLE, scores could push into the high 60s or even 70s. My P90 of 64% accounts for a strong upside but treats a 70%+ score as a tail event, which seems appropriate given the benchmark's designed difficulty. The bimodal structure correctly captures the "lumpy" nature of progress, where the outcome is likely to be near one of two centers rather than in the middle.
