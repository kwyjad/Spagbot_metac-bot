### Reference class & base rates
*   **Incumbent presidents in Guinea-Bissau:** The most specific reference class. Since the introduction of multi-party elections in 1994, **no president of Guinea-Bissau has ever been re-elected after serving a full first term.** Most have been overthrown in coups, assassinated, or did not complete their term. This suggests a base rate of near 0%. This is a strong but potentially brittle prior, as the sample size is small and the political system is highly volatile.
*   **Incumbent presidents in West Africa (non-consolidated democracies):** A broader class including countries with similar levels of instability and institutional weakness. In these contexts, incumbents often leverage state resources to secure re-election. Over the last 20 years, incumbents in such states who run for re-election win more often than not, with success rates arguably in the **60-70% range**, often through elections of questionable fairness. This class captures the power of incumbency that the Guinea-Bissau-specific class misses.
*   **Incumbents who dissolve the legislature before an election:** This is a more specific behavioral class. Leaders who take such autocratic steps are signaling a strong intent to retain power, often succeeding. The base rate for this class is likely high, perhaps **>75%**, as the act itself filters for leaders willing to break norms and use state power to ensure victory.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-09-11** Embaló announces he will not seek a second term. ↓↓↓ — A stunning reversal that, if genuine, resolves the question. It dramatically lowers the probability, but its credibility is uncertain given his prior actions.
*   **2024-03-04** Embaló announces his candidacy for a second term. ↑↑ — This was the expected move for an incumbent consolidating power, signaling his intent to contest and win the 2025 election.
*   **2023-12-04** Embaló dissolves the opposition-controlled parliament for the second time. ↑↑ — A major step in consolidating executive power and removing legislative checks, significantly increasing his ability to control the electoral environment.
*   **2023-12-01** Embaló characterizes clashes between the National Guard and army as a coup attempt. ↑ — Provided the justification for dissolving parliament, framing his political opponents as threats to constitutional order and centralizing his control over the security narrative.
*   **2023-06-04** Opposition coalition (PAI-Terra Ranka) wins a majority in legislative elections. ↓ — Demonstrates significant and organized popular opposition to Embaló's rule, indicating he would face a major challenge in a free and fair election.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Control of State & Electoral Machinery:** Embaló has demonstrated a willingness to use the full power of the presidency, including dissolving parliament and influencing the judiciary. His ability to control the electoral commission, security forces, and state media is a primary driver of his potential success. (Size: Large)
*   **Military Loyalty & Cohesion:** Guinea-Bissau's history is defined by military intervention. Embaló's survival depends on maintaining the loyalty of key factions within the armed forces. The 2023 clashes show this is not guaranteed. A coup or a refusal by the military to enforce his will would be decisive. (Size: Large)
*   **Opposition Strength & Unity:** The PAIGC-led coalition proved its electoral strength in 2023. A unified and resilient opposition can mobilize popular discontent and challenge the legitimacy of a rigged election, both domestically and internationally. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Embaló's Personal Intentions:** The contradictory announcements about his candidacy are now a central mechanism. His decision to run or not—and the reasons behind it (e.g., a backroom deal, a strategic feint, genuine fatigue)—is the most direct lever on the outcome. (Size: Large/Decisive)
*   **International Pressure (ECOWAS):** As a former ECOWAS chairman, Embaló has regional connections. However, the bloc is sensitive to unconstitutional power grabs. Strong sanctions or refusal to recognize a fraudulent election could constrain his actions, though ECOWAS's recent effectiveness is questionable. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Power Consolidation:** While no Bissau-Guinean president has been re-elected, none have so systematically dismantled checks and balances by repeatedly dissolving an opposition-controlled parliament. Embaló's actions are an explicit attempt to break the historical pattern of presidential weakness.
*   **Survival of Multiple "Coups":** Embaló has weathered at least two significant coup attempts (Feb 2022, Dec 2023). His survival, unlike many predecessors, suggests he may have a more resilient grip on key security elements than is typical for the country.
*   **The Candidacy Reversal:** An incumbent who has gone to great lengths to consolidate power publicly declaring he will *not* run is highly anomalous. This is a stark deviation from the typical autocratic playbook and the primary puzzle in this forecast.
*   **Organized and Legitimated Opposition:** The opposition is not just a fragmented group; they are the democratically elected majority in the (now-dissolved) legislature. This gives them a strong claim to legitimacy that past oppositions may have lacked.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the Guinea-Bissau-specific reference class, suggesting a low prior (e.g., 10-15%) due to the historical precedent of no re-elections. The equivalent n is low, reflecting the chaotic nature of the country's politics.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Aggressive autocratic moves (dissolving parliament twice) strongly suggest an intent and capability to force a win, pushing probability up significantly from the historical base rate.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The demonstrated electoral success of the opposition in 2023 confirms a high barrier of popular resistance that must be overcome.
    *   (↑ Small) Survival of multiple coup attempts suggests a stronger-than-average hold on power compared to historical predecessors.
    *   (↓↓ Decisive) The September 2024 announcement that he will not run is the single most powerful piece of evidence. It is a massive downward update that overwhelms previous upward revisions, unless it is reversed.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence prior to September 2024 would have argued for a substantial upward revision from the low base rate. However, the announcement not to run is a powerful signal that craters the probability. The posterior should be very low, with the main uncertainty being the probability of him reversing this decision.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any public statement by Embaló or his party (MADEM G15) walking back his September announcement or "responding to popular demand" to run.
    *   Appointment of loyalists to head the National Electoral Commission (CNE).
    *   Prominent opposition leaders being arrested or disqualified from running on legal pretexts.
    *   Pro-Embaló rallies or media campaigns designed to create a pretext for his return to the race.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Embaló endorsing a successor candidate from his party.
    *   Continued silence or reaffirmation of his decision not to run as 2025 progresses.
    *   The emergence of a strong, unified opposition candidate without state harassment.
    *   Statements from key military leaders guaranteeing the neutrality of the armed forces in the election.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Credibility of Candidacy Announcement:** Embaló's September 2024 statement that he won't run is the pivotal variable. It could be a strategic ploy to wrong-foot the opposition, a temporary concession to international pressure, or genuine. The forecast hinges on interpreting this signal correctly.
*   **Risk of Pre-Election Coup:** The election itself is not a given. Given the country's history and recent instability, a military coup deposing Embaló before the election is a plausible scenario that would resolve the question to "No".
*   **Data Scarcity:** Reliable polling data or on-the-ground sentiment analysis is virtually non-existent. Analysis must rely on interpreting the actions of elite political and military actors.
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria include "official results." In a scenario where Embaló rigs the election, the official result would be "Yes," but it might not be recognized by credible international observers. The forecast must assume the official result is what matters.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast is dominated by two powerful, opposing forces: Embaló's aggressive consolidation of autocratic power, which would normally make his re-election likely, and his stunning public announcement that he will not seek a second term. The probability of his re-election is therefore low, contingent almost entirely on the small but real chance that he reverses his stated intention to step down.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most specific reference class is incumbent presidents in Guinea-Bissau, where no president has been re-elected after serving a full term. This suggests a base rate near 0%. However, given the small sample size and political volatility, this is a brittle prior.
   - A broader reference class is incumbents in West African non-consolidated democracies, where incumbents often win re-election, suggesting a base rate of 60-70%.
   - Considering Embaló's autocratic actions, a base rate for incumbents who dissolve the legislature before an election is >75%.
   - Given these considerations, I will start with a prior probability of 15%, reflecting the historical precedent in Guinea-Bissau but acknowledging the broader regional trends.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Embaló's situation is similar to past Guinea-Bissau presidents in terms of political instability and military influence.
   - Differences: Unlike past presidents, Embaló has aggressively consolidated power by dissolving parliament and surviving coup attempts, which could increase his chances of re-election.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Dissolution of Parliament (↑ Large):** This action suggests a strong intent to retain power, increasing the likelihood of re-election.
   - **Opposition Strength (↓ Moderate):** The opposition's electoral success in 2023 indicates a significant challenge, decreasing the likelihood.
   - **Survival of Coups (↑ Small):** Surviving coup attempts suggests a stronger hold on power, slightly increasing the likelihood.
   - **Announcement Not to Run (↓↓ Decisive):** This announcement dramatically decreases the likelihood unless reversed.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 15% = 0.1765 in odds form.
   - Likelihood ratio for dissolution of parliament: Assume 3:1 (increases probability).
   - Likelihood ratio for opposition strength: Assume 1:2 (decreases probability).
   - Likelihood ratio for survival of coups: Assume 2:1 (slightly increases probability).
   - Likelihood ratio for announcement not to run: Assume 1:10 (strongly decreases probability).
   - Posterior odds = 0.1765 × 3/1 × 1/2 × 2/1 × 1/10 = 0.05295.
   - Posterior probability = 0.05295 / (1 + 0.05295) ≈ 5%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast heavily relies on the credibility of Embaló's announcement not to run. If this is a strategic ploy, the probability could be underestimated.
   - Alternative scenario: Embaló reverses his decision, leveraging state resources to secure re-election. This scenario could increase the probability significantly.
   - Adjustments: Given the uncertainty around his announcement, consider a slight upward adjustment to account for potential reversal.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for reversal, I adjust the final probability slightly upward to account for uncertainty.

Final: 7%

# Will Umaro Sissoco Embaló be re-elected president of Guinea-Bissau in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I need to select an appropriate base rate for an incumbent president being re-elected in Guinea-Bissau.

The most specific reference class is incumbent presidents in Guinea-Bissau. Since the introduction of multi-party elections in 1994, no president of Guinea-Bissau has ever been re-elected after serving a full first term. This suggests a base rate of 0%.

However, this is a small sample size with high volatility. A broader reference class of incumbent presidents in similar West African non-consolidated democracies shows incumbents who run for re-election win at rates of 60-70%, often through elections of questionable fairness.

Given Embaló's autocratic tendencies and actions (dissolving parliament twice), I'll use a weighted approach:
- Guinea-Bissau-specific history: 0% (weight: 0.6)
- West African incumbents: 65% (weight: 0.4)

This gives a prior of: (0% × 0.6) + (65% × 0.4) = 26%

I'm starting with a prior of 26% that Embaló will be re-elected.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Guinea-Bissau remains politically unstable with weak democratic institutions
- Military influence continues to be significant in politics
- The country faces similar economic and social challenges as in previous electoral cycles

**Key differences:**
- Embaló has consolidated power more aggressively than previous presidents by dissolving parliament twice
- He has survived multiple coup attempts, showing stronger resilience than predecessors
- He has explicitly announced (September 2024) that he will not seek a second term
- The opposition won a clear majority in the 2023 legislative elections, demonstrating organized resistance

These differences suggest both upward pressure (power consolidation) and significant downward pressure (his announcement not to run) on the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Embaló's September 2024 announcement that he will not seek re-election**
- P(E|H): The probability of this announcement if he will be re-elected is very low, perhaps 0.1. It would be highly unusual for someone planning to run to announce the opposite.
- P(E|~H): The probability of this announcement if he will not be re-elected is very high, perhaps 0.9.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability of re-election.

**Evidence 2: Embaló's dissolution of parliament twice (most recently December 2023)**
- P(E|H): The probability of these actions if he plans to be re-elected is high, perhaps 0.8, as they consolidate his power.
- P(E|~H): The probability of these actions if he does not plan to be re-elected is lower, perhaps 0.3, as they would be unnecessary.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.3 = 2.67
- This evidence increases the probability of re-election.

**Evidence 3: Opposition coalition winning majority in 2023 legislative elections**
- P(E|H): The probability of this outcome if Embaló will be re-elected is moderate, perhaps 0.4, as strong incumbents can overcome opposition.
- P(E|~H): The probability of this outcome if Embaló will not be re-elected is higher, perhaps 0.7, as it indicates popular opposition.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.7 = 0.57
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability of re-election.

**Evidence 4: Embaló's survival of multiple coup attempts**
- P(E|H): The probability of surviving coups if he will be re-elected is high, perhaps 0.9, as it demonstrates control.
- P(E|~H): The probability of surviving coups if he will not be re-elected is also fairly high, perhaps 0.7, but with less implication of long-term control.
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.7 = 1.29
- This evidence slightly increases the probability of re-election.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with the prior odds: 26%/74% = 0.35

Updating with Evidence 1 (not seeking re-election):
Posterior odds = 0.35 × 0.11 = 0.0385
Posterior probability = 0.0385/(1 + 0.0385) = 3.7%

This is the most significant update, dramatically lowering the probability based on his explicit statement that he won't run.

Updating with Evidence 2 (dissolution of parliament):
Posterior odds = 0.0385 × 2.67 = 0.103
Posterior probability = 0.103/(1 + 0.103) = 9.3%

Updating with Evidence 3 (opposition electoral success):
Posterior odds = 0.103 × 0.57 = 0.059
Posterior probability = 0.059/(1 + 0.059) = 5.6%

Updating with Evidence 4 (coup survival):
Posterior odds = 0.059 × 1.29 = 0.076
Posterior probability = 0.076/(1 + 0.076) = 7.1%

After considering all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 7%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting Embaló's announcement not to run. Politicians frequently reverse such statements, especially in countries with weak democratic norms.
- The timing of his announcement (September 2024) is relatively recent, and there's ample time for him to change his mind before the 2025 election.
- I might be underestimating the power of incumbency in West African politics, where leaders often find ways to remain in power despite apparent obstacles.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Embaló could claim a "popular demand" to run again, reversing his decision.
- He might be planning to install a loyal proxy while maintaining de facto power.
- The election could be postponed again or canceled due to "security concerns."

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should increase my probability somewhat. The announcement not to run is significant but not definitive in this political context. I'll adjust from 7% to 12%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence related to Embaló's situation, and potential blind spots in my analysis, I arrive at a final probability of 12% that Umaro Sissoco Embaló will be re-elected president of Guinea-Bissau in 2025.

The dominant factor is his explicit announcement that he will not seek re-election, but this is partially offset by his pattern of autocratic behavior and the possibility that he could reverse his decision.

Final: 12%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most specific and relevant reference class is the history of incumbent presidents in Guinea-Bissau. Since the introduction of multi-party elections in 1994, **no president has ever been re-elected after serving a full first term**. The country's political system is characterized by extreme volatility, military coups, and assassinations, meaning incumbents rarely complete their terms, let alone win re-election. This historical pattern is exceptionally strong.

Therefore, I will select a low prior probability based on this reference class. A base rate of 0% would be too strong, as historical patterns can be broken. I will set the initial prior at **P(H) = 10%**, acknowledging the powerful historical precedent while allowing for the possibility of change. In odds form, this is 1:9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current political environment in Guinea-Bissau remains highly unstable, with a powerful military and a strong, organized opposition (the PAIGC-led coalition). These factors are consistent with the historical base case where presidents fail to consolidate power and win re-election.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is Umaro Sissoco Embaló himself. Unlike his predecessors, he has been uniquely aggressive in consolidating executive power. He has survived multiple alleged coup attempts (Feb 2022, Dec 2023) and has twice dissolved the opposition-controlled parliament. These actions suggest a concerted effort to break the historical mold of weak presidencies and secure re-election through autocratic means. This makes his situation significantly different from past presidents who were overthrown or defeated.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update the 10% prior with key evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Aggressive consolidation of power (dissolving parliament, surviving coups).**
    *   P(E | H: Re-elected): Very high. A leader intending to secure re-election in a hostile environment would take such measures to eliminate checks and balances.
    *   P(E | ~H: Not re-elected): Low. A leader expecting to lose or be overthrown is less likely to be able to successfully execute such power grabs.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (re-election). This evidence would significantly increase the probability from the 10% base rate, perhaps to the 30-40% range.

*   **Evidence 2: Opposition coalition wins a majority in the June 2023 legislative elections.**
    *   P(E | H: Re-elected): Low. This demonstrates significant popular opposition, which is a major hurdle for an incumbent to overcome, even with autocratic tools.
    *   P(E | ~H: Not re-elected): High. This is a clear signal of the incumbent's unpopularity and the opposition's strength.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Favors ~H (not re-elected). This evidence counteracts the effect of Evidence 1, pulling the probability back down.

*   **Evidence 3: Embaló announces in September 2024 that he will not seek a second term.**
    *   P(E | H: Re-elected): Extremely low. It is almost a direct contradiction. For this to happen, he would have to publicly reverse this clear statement and then go on to win.
    *   P(E | ~H: Not re-elected): Very high. This is the most direct and credible signal that he will not be re-elected, whether due to a backroom deal, military pressure, or a personal decision.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H. This is the most powerful piece of evidence and dominates all prior considerations.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The first two pieces of evidence are conflicting, suggesting a contested election where an aspiring autocrat faces a strong opposition. Before September 2024, one might have estimated his chances at around 25-30%.

However, the announcement that he will not run is a decisive update. The probability of re-election now becomes contingent on the probability that he reverses this decision and subsequently wins.

Let's model this:
*   P(Re-elected) = P(Reverses decision and runs) × P(Wins election | He runs)

1.  **P(Reverses decision and runs):** This is the key uncertainty. It could be a strategic ploy to demobilize the opposition, or he could be "drafted" back by his party. Given the high risks of such a maneuver in Guinea-Bissau's volatile political climate (it could be seen as weakness and invite a coup), I estimate the probability of a reversal is low, but not zero. I'll place it at **20%**.
2.  **P(Wins election | He runs):** If he reverses his decision, it would signal an all-in effort to retain power. Given his demonstrated willingness to dissolve parliament and use the state apparatus, his chances of engineering a victory would be high. I estimate this at **75%**.

*   **Posterior Probability:** P(Re-elected) = 0.20 × 0.75 = 0.15.
The resulting posterior probability is **15%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast hinges on the 20% estimate that Embaló's announcement is a strategic feint he will reverse.
*   **Why might this be too low?** Autocrats frequently use such tactics. Perhaps Embaló is more cunning than I'm giving him credit for, and a reversal is more likely (e.g., 40%). This would imply a 30% chance of re-election (0.40 * 0.75).
*   **Why might this be too high?** Guinea-Bissau's politics are dominated by the military. The announcement may not have been his choice; he could have been forced by military leaders who guaranteed his safety in exchange for stepping down. If so, the chance of reversal is near zero, and the true probability is <5%.
*   **Other factors:** The risk of a pre-election coup, which would resolve the question to "No," is significant and is implicitly captured in the model (a coup is one way he fails to win even if he runs).

My 15% forecast sits between these two alternative scenarios. It correctly identifies his announcement as the primary driver of the low probability, while still pricing in a non-trivial chance of autocratic maneuvering and a reversal.

### 6. Final Forecast
The historical base rate for re-election in Guinea-Bissau is near zero. While Embaló's autocratic actions initially suggested he might break this trend, his public announcement in September 2024 that he will not seek a second term is the single most important piece of evidence. The forecast is now a calculation of the probability that he reverses this statement and subsequently wins. I estimate this probability to be low but plausible.

Final: 15%
