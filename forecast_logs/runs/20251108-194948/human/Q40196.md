### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) Period (2008-Present):** This period represents a structurally higher uncertainty environment.
    *   **Mean:** ~135
    *   **Median:** ~110
    *   **Reasoning:** The GFC marked a regime shift towards more frequent and intense policy debates (stimulus, debt ceiling, QE). This is the most relevant long-term reference class for the current environment. Data derived from FRED series USEPUINDXM.
2.  **All Historical Data (1985-Present):** Provides the full long-term context, including periods of relative calm.
    *   **Mean:** ~115
    *   **Median:** ~95
    *   **Reasoning:** Useful for understanding the full range of the index but may understate the "new normal" level of uncertainty.
3.  **Periods of Major Policy Contention:** This class includes specific episodes like the 2011-13 debt ceiling crises, the 2016 election, the 2018-19 trade war, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
    *   **Range:** Spikes typically range from 200 to over 500.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class is relevant for estimating the potential peak if current tensions escalate significantly. The H1 2025 spike falls into this category.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-15** EPU index peaks at over 350 following the formal announcement and justification of broad new tariffs by the Trump administration, creating significant uncertainty about implementation and retaliation. (↑)
*   **2025-07-22** The administration provides clearer guidance on exemptions and timelines for the new tariffs, causing the EPU index to begin receding as some immediate questions are answered. (↓)
*   **2025-09-10** China announces retaliatory measures that are more targeted than initially feared, further reducing the index from its peak as the market prices in a contained, albeit tense, trade environment. (↓)
*   **2025-10-28** The latest monthly value (September) shows the index at 185. While down from the peak, it remains significantly elevated compared to the historical mean, reflecting persistent underlying trade friction. (↔)
*   **2025-11-04** Midterm election results produce a divided government, signaling potential for legislative gridlock on fiscal matters (e.g., budget, debt ceiling) heading into 2026, adding a new layer of uncertainty. (↑)

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Trade Policy Rhetoric & Action:** The primary driver in 2025. Statements, threats, or implementation of tariffs/sanctions, particularly concerning China, have a large and immediate upward effect on the index.
2.  **Fiscal Policy Deadlines:** Congressional negotiations around the budget and debt ceiling are a recurring source of major uncertainty. A government shutdown or debt ceiling crisis would cause a large spike.
3.  **Monetary Policy Surprises:** Unexpected signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates or quantitative easing can cause moderate shifts. With inflation still a concern, Fed-related uncertainty remains a factor.
4.  **Regulatory Changes:** The announcement or implementation of significant new regulations (or deregulation) in key sectors like energy, finance, or tech can moderately increase the index.
5.  **Geopolitical Shocks:** Major international events that directly implicate US economic policy (e.g., escalation in a major conflict, global supply chain disruptions) can have a large, rapid impact.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Single-Issue Dominance:** Unlike past periods of high uncertainty driven by multifaceted crises (GFC, COVID), the current elevation is overwhelmingly driven by a single, discretionary policy area: trade and tariffs. This makes the index highly sensitive to news on this specific topic.
*   **Divergence with Market Volatility:** As noted in early 2025 (Haver), EPU has remained high while financial market volatility (VIX) has been more subdued. This suggests markets may have priced in the tariff risk, but the *policy path* itself remains highly uncertain and widely discussed in the media, which directly impacts the EPU index.
*   **Intra-Party vs. Inter-Party Conflict:** The tariff policy is driven by the executive branch, representing a specific administration's agenda. This contrasts with past spikes driven by inter-party legislative standoffs (e.g., debt ceiling), creating a different dynamic of uncertainty.
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Policy:** The current uncertainty stems from proactive, chosen policy shifts (tariffs) rather than reactive responses to an external shock (like a pandemic or financial collapse). This may lead to a more persistent, elevated plateau of uncertainty rather than a sharp spike and rapid decline.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered on the post-GFC mean of ~135, with a wide tail to account for potential spikes (equivalent n of ~10, reflecting moderate confidence in the base rate).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The H1 2025 tariff shock established a new, higher baseline of tension that has not fully dissipated.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The index has fallen significantly from its peak, indicating some adaptation and clarification has occurred.
    *   (↑ Small) The recent midterm election results introduce the familiar prospect of future fiscal gridlock.
    *   (↔) The divergence with VIX suggests financial markets are not in panic mode, which may cap the upside of the EPU index barring new escalations.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should be significantly higher than the prior mean of 135. The decline from the peak pulls it down, but the persistence of the core issue keeps it elevated. A posterior centered in the 170-200 range seems plausible.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Administration officials' statements threatening new tariffs or expanding existing ones.
    *   Negative rhetoric or actions from China, signaling escalation.
    *   Contentious early negotiations or rhetoric regarding the upcoming 2026 budget or debt ceiling.
    *   A surprisingly hawkish statement from the December FOMC meeting.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of successful trade negotiations or a temporary truce with China.
    *   Quiet, routine passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.
    *   Statements from the administration focusing on domestic issues rather than trade.
    *   A dovish, "no surprises" Federal Reserve policy statement.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Media-Based Metric:** The index measures media coverage of uncertainty, not uncertainty itself. It can be influenced by media hype cycles or shifts in journalistic focus.
*   **Backward-Looking:** The index for a given month is released after the month is over. Real-time daily data is available but is much more volatile and less reliable for forecasting the final monthly figure.
*   **Non-Linear Spikes:** The index is not normally distributed. It features long periods of relative calm punctuated by sudden, massive spikes. A single event can dramatically alter the monthly value.
*   **Holiday Season Lull:** Newspaper coverage and policy announcements sometimes slow in late December. This could artificially depress the index value for that month, assuming no major crisis erupts.

**Final Research Summary:** The EPU index for December 2025 will likely remain significantly elevated above its post-2008 average due to persistent, unresolved trade policy tensions. While well below the peaks of early 2025, a forecast should center in the 170-200 range, with high sensitivity to any new tariff-related announcements.

To forecast the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index for the US for December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) Period (2008-Present)
- **Mean:** ~135
- **Variance:** Moderate, accounting for historical spikes.
- **Reasoning:** This period reflects a structurally higher uncertainty environment, relevant due to ongoing policy debates and economic conditions similar to the current situation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current environment shares the post-GFC period's elevated uncertainty due to ongoing economic policy debates.
- **Difference:** The current situation is dominated by trade policy uncertainty, particularly US-China relations, which is a more specific driver than the broader post-GFC factors.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Tariff Shock (↑ Large):** The H1 2025 tariff shock has established a higher baseline of tension.
- **Index Decline (↓ Moderate):** The index has decreased from its peak, suggesting some adaptation.
- **Midterm Elections (↑ Small):** Introduces potential fiscal gridlock, adding uncertainty.
- **Market Volatility (↔):** The divergence with VIX suggests limited panic, capping potential spikes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered on a mean of 135.
- **Evidence Impact:** The tariff shock and midterm results push the index higher, while the decline from the peak and market stability moderate this increase.
- **Posterior Mean:** Adjusted to center around 185, reflecting the persistent trade tensions and potential fiscal issues.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the potential for unexpected geopolitical or fiscal developments that could drastically alter the index.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden escalation in trade tensions or a fiscal crisis could push the index significantly higher.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A resolution in trade tensions or a calm fiscal environment could lower the index more than expected.
- **Adjustment:** Ensure the forecast accounts for these risks by maintaining a wide distribution.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- **P10:** 160
- **P20:** 170
- **P40:** 180
- **P60:** 190
- **P80:** 200
- **P90:** 210

These percentiles reflect a distribution centered around 185, with consideration for the potential for both upward and downward shifts due to the factors discussed.

# Forecasting the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for December 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Post-Global Financial Crisis (2008-Present)**
- Mean: ~135
- Median: ~110
- Standard deviation: ~60-70 (estimated from the visible spikes and baseline)

This is my primary reference class because it represents the modern era of heightened policy uncertainty, which is structurally different from pre-2008 periods. The post-GFC era features more frequent policy debates, partisan polarization, and economic interventions.

**Recent Elevated Periods (excluding extreme spikes)**
- Range: 150-200
- This represents periods of elevated but not crisis-level uncertainty, which seems most relevant to our current situation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The US continues to operate in a polarized political environment
- Trade tensions remain a persistent feature of US economic policy
- Media coverage of economic policy uncertainty follows similar patterns

**Differences from base rate:**
- The current situation features a specific, dominant source of uncertainty (tariffs and trade policy)
- Recent spike in H1 2025 was significant but has been declining
- The midterm election results creating a divided government introduces a new uncertainty factor
- December is typically a month with less policy activity due to holidays, which can dampen the index

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing the forecast upward:**
- The tariff shock in H1 2025 established a new baseline of tension that hasn't fully dissipated (strong upward push)
- The September 2025 value was 185, significantly above the historical average (moderate upward push)
- Recent midterm elections produced a divided government, signaling potential legislative gridlock (small upward push)
- Ongoing US-China tensions continue to create uncertainty (moderate upward push)

**Evidence pushing the forecast downward:**
- The index has been declining from its peak, suggesting adaptation to the new tariff environment (moderate downward push)
- December typically sees reduced policy activity due to holidays (small downward push)
- China's retaliatory measures were more targeted than feared, reducing uncertainty (small downward push)
- The administration has provided clearer guidance on tariff implementation (moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 135 (post-GFC mean), I'll update based on the evidence:

1. The September 2025 value of 185 is a strong signal. This suggests the distribution should shift upward significantly.
   - Update: Shift mean from 135 to ~170

2. The declining trend from the peak suggests some moderation:
   - Update: Adjust mean from ~170 to ~165

3. The seasonal December effect typically reduces policy activity:
   - Update: Adjust mean from ~165 to ~160

4. The divided government from midterms introduces new uncertainty:
   - Update: Adjust mean from ~160 to ~165

My posterior distribution is now centered around 165, with a wider spread than the prior to account for the multiple conflicting factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for a sudden crisis event in December (debt ceiling, government shutdown, or international incident)
- I might be overweighting the recent decline from peak values
- The seasonal December effect might be stronger than I've accounted for
- The index could be more sensitive to media coverage patterns than actual policy uncertainty

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Lower scenario (P10-P20 range)**: If trade tensions ease significantly and holiday news cycles focus elsewhere, we could see values drop to 120-140.
- **Higher scenario (P80-P90 range)**: A new trade escalation or fiscal policy crisis could push the index back up to 200-250.

**Adjustments needed:**
- I should widen my distribution to account for the index's tendency for non-linear spikes
- I need to ensure my lower bound isn't too optimistic given the elevated baseline

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 120
P20: 135
P40: 155
P60: 175
P80: 200
P90: 230

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the distribution of the US EPU index in the **post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) period (2008-Present)**. This period represents a "new normal" of structurally higher and more volatile policy uncertainty compared to the pre-2008 era.

*   **Reference Class:** Monthly US EPU Index data from January 2008 to the present.
*   **Reasoning:** This period captures the modern political and economic environment characterized by increased polarization, unconventional monetary policy, and recurring fiscal standoffs (e.g., debt ceiling debates), which are all relevant drivers today. Using the full 1985-present dataset would be less representative as it includes a long period of relative calm (the "Great Moderation") that seems structurally different from the current environment.
*   **Distribution:** This base rate is not normally distributed; it is strongly right-skewed.
    *   **Median:** Approximately 110
    *   **Mean:** Approximately 135
    *   **Spread:** High variance, with a history of sudden, large spikes (e.g., 2011 debt ceiling, 2016 election, COVID-19) often exceeding 300.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation in late 2025 involves drivers common to the post-GFC period, namely significant political division (a newly divided government after the midterms) and the potential for future fiscal conflict over budgets and the debt ceiling.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the dominant, single-issue driver of the current elevated uncertainty: the Trump administration's trade and tariff policies. Unlike the multi-faceted GFC or COVID crises, the current situation is driven by a proactive and discretionary policy choice. This could lead to a more persistent plateau of uncertainty rather than a sharp spike and fall, as the core issue remains unresolved. The index has already been at a high level for several months, suggesting a new, higher baseline has been established for the time being.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update the prior based on several key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **High Recent Value (Strong Upward Pressure):** The latest data point for September 2025 is 185. The EPU index exhibits significant autocorrelation (persistence). A high value in September makes a high value in December much more likely than the base rate median of 110. This is the strongest piece of evidence and anchors the forecast significantly higher than the prior.
*   **Persistent Trade Tensions (Moderate Upward Pressure):** The underlying cause of the H1 2025 spike—the tariff issue—remains salient. This suggests the elevated level is not a temporary anomaly and will likely persist, keeping the index well above its historical average.
*   **Midterm Election Results (Small Upward Pressure):** The creation of a divided government introduces a new, forward-looking source of uncertainty related to potential legislative gridlock and fiscal cliffs in 2026. While the direct impact may not be immediate in December 2025, media discussion about this new risk is likely to begin, adding to the EPU index.
*   **Decline from Peak (Downward Pressure, relative to the peak):** The index has fallen from over 350 to 185. This indicates that the most extreme uncertainty has subsided as the market and public gained some clarity on the initial tariff announcements. This suggests the forecast should be centered well below the previous peak.
*   **Potential Holiday Lull (Small Downward Pressure):** As noted in the caveats, policy news and media coverage can slow down in late December. All else being equal, this could slightly depress the final monthly value.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A right-skewed distribution with a median of ~110 and a mean of ~135.
*   **Update:** The evidence overwhelmingly pushes the distribution upwards. The strong anchor of the recent value (185) and persistent trade tensions are the dominant factors. I will shift the entire distribution significantly higher. My prior median was 110; my posterior median will be much closer to the recent value.
*   **Posterior Shape:** I will center my posterior distribution around a median of **175**. This is slightly below the last reading of 185, accounting for a potential continued (but slowing) decline from the peak and the holiday lull. However, it remains far above the historical base rate, reflecting the new upward pressure from the midterm results and persistent trade issues. The distribution will remain wide and strongly right-skewed to account for the significant risk of either a policy escalation (pushing the index back towards 250-300) or a surprise de-escalation.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Main Risk (Overconfidence):** Am I anchoring too heavily on the September value of 185? The index can be volatile. A continued sharp decline is possible, though less likely now that the initial shock has passed. A scenario where a surprise trade truce is announced could push the index down toward the 120-140 range. My lower percentiles (P10/P20) must account for this possibility.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Escalation):** Conversely, the post-midterm political environment could turn hostile immediately, or the administration could announce a new round of tariffs. This would cause the index to spike again. My upper percentiles (P80/P90) need to reflect this substantial upside risk, with values well into the 200s.
*   **Conclusion:** My proposed distribution, centered at 175 with a wide, right-skewed range from 125 (P10) to 270 (P90), seems to appropriately balance these competing risks. It acknowledges the current high level while allowing for significant movement in either direction.

### 6. Final Percentiles
P10: 125
P20: 145
P40: 160
P60: 190
P80: 220
P90: 270
