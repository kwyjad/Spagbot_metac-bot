### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All Months (1985-Present):** The long-term mean of the US EPU index is approximately 127, with a median of 103. This class shows a right-skewed distribution, where periods of low uncertainty are common, but punctuated by sharp, high-magnitude spikes. The 75th percentile is around 140. This provides the broadest possible base rate.
2.  **First Year of a New Presidential Administration (1989, 1993, 2001, 2009, 2017, 2021, 2025):** These periods often feature higher uncertainty as new policy agendas are introduced. The average EPU in the first 12 months of these administrations is roughly 145, moderately higher than the overall average. This class is relevant as 2025 is the first year of a new presidential term.
3.  **Periods of Active US-China Trade Disputes (2018-2019):** This is the most specific and relevant reference class given the background. During this period, the EPU index averaged approximately 205, with several months exceeding 250. This reflects a state of sustained, elevated uncertainty driven by tariff announcements and negotiations.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-15** Tariff spike peaks — ↑ — The index reached a multi-year high following the administration's announcement of broad new tariffs, setting a high-water mark for the year and anchoring expectations.
*   **2025-08-20** Partial implementation and exemptions — ↓ — The administration provided clarity on exemptions for certain goods, causing the EPU index to retreat from its peak as some industries saw their immediate risk reduced.
*   **2025-09-30** Fiscal Year 2026 budget talks begin contentiously — ↑ — Initial proposals and rhetoric from the White House and Congress signal a difficult negotiation process, adding fiscal uncertainty on top of existing trade tensions.
*   **2025-10-22** China announces retaliatory measures — ↑ — Beijing detailed its response to the US tariffs, renewing media focus on the economic fallout and the potential for a prolonged trade conflict.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Trade Policy Announcements:** White House or USTR announcements of new tariffs, negotiations, or retaliations are the primary driver. These events directly trigger the search terms used in the index methodology. (Size: Large)
2.  **Fiscal Policy Deadlines:** Congressional debates over the budget, continuing resolutions, or the debt ceiling create significant uncertainty. November/December is a critical period for these negotiations. (Size: Large)
3.  **Monetary Policy Response:** Federal Reserve statements and actions in response to the economic effects of tariffs (e.g., inflationary pressures, growth slowdown) can amplify or dampen uncertainty. Ambiguity about the Fed's reaction function is a key driver. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Geopolitical Tensions:** Escalations in US-China relations beyond trade (e.g., technology restrictions, military posturing in the South China Sea) can spill over and increase economic uncertainty. (Size: Moderate to Large)
5.  **Key Economic Data Releases:** Unexpectedly poor inflation, employment, or GDP data can increase uncertainty by raising questions about the resilience of the economy to the ongoing policy shocks. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Sustained Policy Shock:** Unlike a one-off event (e.g., a single debt ceiling crisis), the current situation is a sustained, rolling policy shock with an unclear endpoint, similar to 2018-2019 but potentially with a more aggressive administration.
*   **Concurrent Fiscal and Trade Uncertainty:** The confluence of a major trade dispute and a contentious budget cycle at year-end is relatively unusual and likely has a multiplicative effect on uncertainty.
*   **High Geopolitical Baseline:** Tensions with China are described as salient, suggesting a higher baseline of geopolitical risk than in many historical periods, which can make economic policy news more impactful.
*   **Economic Environment:** The global economic context (e.g., post-COVID supply chains, global inflation) is different from the 2018-19 period, potentially making the economy more fragile and reactive to policy uncertainty.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the 2018-2019 trade war period (mean ~205) seems most appropriate, reflecting a state of active trade conflict. This should be a reasonably strong prior (equivalent n ≈ 10) due to the strong analogy.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The administration is in its first year and actively using tariffs as a primary policy tool.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Contentious budget negotiations are occurring simultaneously, adding a second major source of policy uncertainty.
    *   (↓ Small) The index has already retreated from its H1 2025 peak, suggesting the initial shock has been partially absorbed by markets and media.
    *   (↑ Small) The November/December period is often characterized by lower legislative activity during holidays, but this can be offset by last-minute, high-stakes fiscal deadlines.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly supports a posterior well above the long-term average (~127) and the "first year of presidency" average (~145). The combined fiscal and trade drivers suggest the value will remain close to the 2018-2019 trade war average. The posterior should be centered in the **190-220 range**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   White House officials using aggressive rhetoric ("trade war," "decoupling") in speeches or on social media.
    *   Breakdown in talks between the administration and Congressional leadership on the budget.
    *   Threats of a government shutdown becoming a lead story in major newspapers.
    *   Negative pre-holiday retail sales forecasts explicitly blaming tariff-related price increases.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcements of high-level talks or a "truce" between the US and China.
    *   Reports of a potential bipartisan agreement on a continuing resolution to fund the government.
    *   Major industry groups reporting that they have successfully adapted supply chains to mitigate tariff impacts.
    *   The Federal Reserve signaling a clear, confidence-inspiring policy path in its November meeting minutes.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Index Construction:** The index is based on keyword counts in a fixed set of newspapers. It measures media *coverage* of uncertainty, which may not perfectly reflect the true level of uncertainty among economic actors.
*   **Fat-Tailed Nature:** The index is prone to sudden, unpredictable spikes from exogenous events (e.g., geopolitical crises, natural disasters) that are not captured in this analysis.
*   **Scenario Dependence:** This forecast is highly dependent on the fictional background provided. The actual composition of Congress and the specific state of the economy in this scenario are unknown and could significantly alter the outcome.
*   **Mean Reversion Lag:** While the index tends to mean-revert, it can stay elevated for many months during a persistent crisis. Assuming a quick return to the long-term average would be a mistake.

**Final Research Summary:** The situation in late 2025 strongly mirrors the 2018-2019 US-China trade war, suggesting a high baseline for the EPU index. The addition of a contentious end-of-year budget negotiation cycle will likely keep the index elevated, with a probable value in the high 100s to low 200s for November.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index in this context is the period of active US-China trade disputes (2018-2019), where the average EPU was approximately 205. This period is relevant due to the current trade tensions and tariff announcements in 2025.
   - The mean of this base rate is 205, with a variance reflecting the spikes seen during that period.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors the 2018-2019 period with active trade disputes and tariff announcements, making this a strong reference class.
   - Differences: The addition of contentious fiscal policy negotiations and a high geopolitical baseline with China suggests a potentially higher level of uncertainty than in 2018-2019.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Trade Policy Announcements: The administration's active use of tariffs increases the likelihood of higher EPU values (↑ Large).
   - Fiscal Policy Deadlines: Contentious budget negotiations add another layer of uncertainty (↑ Moderate).
   - Retreat from Peak: The index has decreased from its peak earlier in 2025, suggesting some absorption of initial shocks (↓ Small).
   - November/December Period: Typically lower legislative activity, but offset by fiscal deadlines (↑ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 205, the evidence from trade and fiscal policy suggests maintaining a high level of uncertainty.
   - The posterior distribution remains centered in the 190-220 range, reflecting the sustained uncertainty from both trade and fiscal issues.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Risk: The forecast could underestimate the potential for a sudden resolution or escalation in trade talks.
   - Tail Risks: Geopolitical events or unexpected economic data could cause significant deviations.
   - Alternative Forecast: A scenario where trade tensions ease significantly could lower the EPU index, but current evidence does not strongly support this.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the sustained uncertainty and the evidence, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect a high baseline with potential for spikes.

P10: 180  
P20: 190  
P40: 200  
P60: 210

# Forecasting the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for November 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

- **Long-term average (1985-present)**: Mean ~127, median ~103, with a right-skewed distribution
- **First year of new presidential administrations**: Mean ~145
- **Periods of active US-China trade disputes (2018-2019)**: Mean ~205, with several months exceeding 250

Given the background information about ongoing trade tensions with China and the Trump administration's tariff announcements, the 2018-2019 trade dispute period provides the most relevant base rate. This period featured similar policy dynamics and trade tensions that we're seeing in 2025. I'll use a prior centered around 205 with a relatively wide variance to account for uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to 2018-2019 trade dispute period:**
- Active trade tensions with China
- Tariff implementation as a key policy tool
- Media focus on economic impacts of trade policy

**Differences from the base case:**
- The index has already spiked and then decreased in 2025, suggesting some adaptation
- We have concurrent fiscal policy uncertainty with contentious budget negotiations
- This is the first year of a new presidential administration, which typically brings higher policy uncertainty
- The November timing places us in a period where fiscal year-end issues often come to a head

These differences suggest the value might be somewhat lower than the peak trade war periods but still substantially above the long-term average.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing the forecast upward:**
- China announced retaliatory measures in October 2025, which likely renewed media attention and uncertainty (+20%)
- Contentious FY2026 budget talks began in September, adding fiscal uncertainty on top of trade tensions (+15%)
- November is typically when budget deadlines create pressure, potentially amplifying policy uncertainty (+10%)
- First year of a new administration typically features higher policy uncertainty (+10%)

**Evidence pushing the forecast downward:**
- The index has decreased from its peak in early 2025, suggesting some adaptation to the initial shock (-15%)
- Partial implementation and exemptions announced in August provided some clarity (-10%)
- November sometimes sees reduced legislative activity due to holidays (-5%)

The net effect of this evidence suggests a value that remains elevated but somewhat below the peak trade war levels.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with our prior centered at 205 (2018-2019 trade war average):

- The upward factors collectively suggest about a +55% pressure
- The downward factors collectively suggest about a -30% pressure
- Net adjustment: +25% relative likelihood of being in the upper range of our prior

This suggests a posterior distribution with:
- Mean: ~190 (slightly below the trade war average)
- More mass in the 170-220 range than our prior
- Less probability in the extreme tails (>250 or <150)

The posterior is still right-skewed, reflecting the possibility of sudden spikes due to unexpected policy announcements or escalations.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the 2018-2019 trade war analogy; the current administration might handle trade policy differently
- I haven't fully accounted for potential exogenous shocks (geopolitical crises, natural disasters)
- The index measures media coverage, which could be distracted by other major news events
- I might be underestimating the adaptation of markets and media to ongoing trade tensions

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center the forecast closer to 150, arguing that:
1. The initial shock has largely been absorbed
2. Media attention might shift to other topics by November
3. Markets have had time to adapt to the new tariff regime

Rebuttal: While adaptation does occur, the combination of active trade tensions AND fiscal policy uncertainty in November makes a value below 170 unlikely. The EPU index tends to remain elevated during sustained policy conflicts.

After this consideration, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for greater uncertainty.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 145
P20: 160
P40: 180
P60: 200
P80: 225
P90: 250

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the period of the US-China trade disputes from 2018-2019. The background scenario for November 2025 describes a situation dominated by tariff announcements and US-China tensions, making this a strong historical analogue.

*   **Reference Class:** US Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index, January 2018 - December 2019.
*   **Distribution:** During this period, the index had a mean of approximately 205 and a median of 202. It was highly volatile, with a standard deviation of about 65 and values ranging from 100 to over 340. This establishes a prior distribution centered in the low 200s, with significant right-skewed variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The primary driver of uncertainty is an active trade dispute with China, involving tariffs and retaliatory measures, directly mirroring the 2018-2019 dynamic.
*   The situation is described as a "sustained policy shock," not a brief event, which was also characteristic of the 2018-2019 period.

**Differences:**
*   **Concurrent Fiscal Crisis:** The key difference is the addition of "contentious" Fiscal Year 2026 budget negotiations happening in the same timeframe (Nov/Dec). Major fiscal deadlines (e.g., government shutdown threats, debt ceiling debates) are powerful, independent drivers of the EPU index. Their confluence with a trade war is unusual and likely has a multiplicative effect on media coverage and uncertainty.
*   **First Year of a New Administration:** While 2025 is the first year of a new presidential term (which typically has higher EPU), this effect is largely captured by the aggressive tariff policy that defines the base case. It reinforces the high-uncertainty environment rather than being a separate additive factor.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **(↑ Large) Active Trade and Fiscal Disputes:** The timeline shows a tariff spike in May, exemptions in August, and Chinese retaliation in October, confirming the trade issue is ongoing. The report explicitly adds a contentious budget cycle. This combination makes high EPU values (200+) much more likely than a return to the historical mean (~127). The dual sources of uncertainty suggest the outcome will likely be higher than the 2018-2019 average.
*   **(↓ Small) Retreat from Peak:** The index retreated from its H1 2025 peak after some tariff exemptions were clarified. This shows that the index can fall even during a trade dispute if clarifying information is released. This evidence slightly dampens the extreme upside risk, suggesting that a full-blown panic is not the only possible outcome.
*   **(↑ Moderate) November/December Timing:** This period is often when fiscal negotiations come to a head, creating last-minute, high-stakes deadlines that generate significant media coverage. This timing reinforces the likelihood that the fiscal uncertainty driver will be potent in November.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around ~205, based on the 2018-2019 trade war.
*   **Update:** The most significant piece of new evidence is the concurrent contentious budget negotiation. Historically, government shutdown threats alone can push the EPU index into the 250-350 range. Combining this with an active trade war should shift the entire distribution upwards.
*   **Posterior:** I will shift the median of my distribution from the prior's ~205 up to ~225. This reflects the significant added pressure from the fiscal front, without assuming a full-blown crisis has peaked in November. The variance of the distribution should also increase, particularly on the upside, to account for a "perfect storm" scenario where both crises escalate simultaneously. The posterior will be strongly right-skewed.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Main Risk:** My forecast assumes both the trade and fiscal issues will be major news drivers in November. A key alternative is that Congress passes a short-term continuing resolution to fund the government, "kicking the can" to December or later. If this happens, the fiscal uncertainty would largely evaporate for November, and the EPU would likely fall back into the 180-210 range, closer to the 2018-2019 average.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** An alternative forecast might center around 200, arguing that the fiscal issue won't come to a head until December, and November will just be a standard "trade war" month.
*   **Rebuttal & Adjustment:** While plausible, the prompt describes the talks as "contentious," and the run-up to a deadline often generates significant uncertainty even if a last-minute deal is reached. My upward adjustment from the 205 baseline seems justified, but I have kept the median at 225 (rather than 250+) to account for the possibility that the crisis doesn't fully peak in this specific month. The wide P10-P90 range (150 to 330) is intended to capture these alternative scenarios of either de-escalation or a "perfect storm."

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is centered at 225, reflecting an environment more uncertain than the 2018-2019 trade war due to the addition of a fiscal showdown. The tails are wide to account for the high volatility and the possibility of either a temporary resolution or a severe escalation of both issues.

P10: 150
P20: 170
P40: 205
P60: 245
P80: 285
P90: 330
