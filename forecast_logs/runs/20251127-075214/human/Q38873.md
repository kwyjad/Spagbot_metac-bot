### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Appeals of CAS awards to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT):** This is the most direct reference class. The SFT is the only body that can overturn a CAS award. Historically, the success rate is exceptionally low. The provided background states that between 1984 and 2010, the success rate was ~0.3% of all awards and ~1% of appeals filed. More recent analyses confirm this trend, with success rates typically cited in the 1-3% range.
    *   **Base Rate:** **1-3%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the direct procedural path being followed. The SFT does not re-evaluate the facts of a case, only very narrow procedural grounds (jurisdiction, violation of right to be heard, public policy). This high bar explains the low success rate.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a general rate across all types of sports disputes (doping, contracts, etc.), not specific to Olympic medal reallocations, which might attract more intense legal scrutiny.

2.  **High-profile Olympic eligibility/medal disputes at CAS/SFT:** This class includes cases like those of Sun Yang (swimming) or Kamila Valieva (figure skating). These cases often involve significant legal resources and novel arguments. While still very low, the success rate for getting a *hearing* or a procedural review might be slightly higher than for routine cases. Sun Yang's first CAS ban was successfully appealed to the SFT on grounds of panelist bias.
    *   **Base Rate:** **<5%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** These cases attract the best legal teams who are adept at identifying and arguing the narrow procedural flaws the SFT will consider. The successful Sun Yang appeal provides a modern precedent.
    *   **Limitations:** The number of such cases is too small for a robust statistical base rate. Furthermore, a successful appeal (like Sun Yang's) doesn't guarantee an ultimate victory, though it would satisfy this question's resolution criteria.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-09-17** Appeal filed with Swiss Federal Tribunal — ↑ — This action formalizes the challenge, moving it from a threat to a concrete legal process. The stated grounds (procedural deficiency, conflict of interest) are appropriate for the SFT's jurisdiction.
*   **2024-08-13** CAS announces it will not reconsider its ruling — ↓ — This confirmed that the only remaining path was the SFT appeal, closing off any simpler or faster route to reversal and reinforcing the finality of the CAS decision from CAS's perspective.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **SFT's Strict Standard of Review:** The SFT's mandate is extremely narrow. It will not re-weigh evidence or second-guess the sporting rules. This structural feature is the primary driver keeping the probability of an overturn low. (Large, ↓)
2.  **Strength of the "Right to be Heard" Argument:** The claim that CAS failed to consider video evidence is a classic procedural argument. Its success depends entirely on whether Chiles' team can prove this evidence was timely, relevant, and improperly excluded in a way that fundamentally violated her rights. (Large, ↑/↓ depending on unknown facts)
3.  **Substance of the "Conflict of Interest" Claim:** This is a powerful charge and one of the few clear grounds for an SFT overturn. If Chiles' team can substantiate that a CAS panelist had a demonstrable bias, the odds of success increase significantly. If the claim is weak, it will be dismissed. (Large, ↑/↓ depending on unknown facts)
4.  **Legal Resources and Expertise:** USA Gymnastics has the financial and legal resources to mount a top-tier challenge. Their lawyers will be specialists in SFT/CAS appeals, maximizing the chances of finding and exploiting a valid procedural error. (Moderate, ↑)
5.  **SFT Deference to Sporting Bodies:** Swiss law and SFT precedent show a strong deference to the autonomy of international sporting federations and their arbitral bodies like CAS. The court is reluctant to intervene unless a fundamental legal principle has been violated. (Moderate, ↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Targeted Procedural Grounds:** Unlike many appeals that are thinly veiled attempts to re-argue the facts, this appeal's stated grounds ("right to be heard," "conflict of interest") are precisely the kind of procedural issues the SFT is mandated to review. This makes it a more credible attempt than a generic appeal.
*   **Specific Evidence at Core of Dispute:** The dispute centers on a specific piece of evidence (video of the inquiry timing). This provides a concrete focal point for the "right to be heard" argument, which may be more compelling than a general claim of unfairness.
*   **High-Stakes Olympic Context:** The case concerns an Olympic medal, the pinnacle of athletic achievement. This ensures maximum legal and media scrutiny, but also means the SFT will be exceptionally cautious before intervening in the "field of play" results.
*   **Public Nature of the Dispute:** The initial inquiry and reversal happened in the full glare of the Olympic spotlight. While the SFT is insulated from public pressure, the high visibility ensures all parties are acting with maximum diligence.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered at **2%** is appropriate, reflecting the historical base rate of successful SFT appeals against CAS awards, with an equivalent n of ~50-100 to represent a reasonably strong belief in this historical data.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑, Moderate) The appeal is not a frivolous re-argument of the facts, but a targeted challenge on valid procedural grounds (right to be heard, conflict of interest), making it a stronger-than-average candidate for success.
    *   (↑, Small) The involvement of a well-resourced body like USA Gymnastics ensures a high-quality legal challenge.
    *   (↓, Large) The institutional hurdles remain immense. The SFT's standard of review is exceptionally high, and its deference to CAS is the dominant factor in almost all cases.
    *   (↔, Net) The core of the case—the actual substance of the procedural claims—is currently unknown to the public, representing a major source of uncertainty.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence suggests this is a more serious and well-aimed appeal than the average case that makes up the 1-3% base rate. The posterior should be revised upwards from the prior, but remain low given the formidable structural barriers. A posterior in the **5-15%** range seems justifiable.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The SFT requests a full evidentiary hearing on the procedural claims (most appeals are decided on written submissions alone).
    *   Credible leaks or reports detailing a strong, previously undisclosed conflict of interest for a CAS panelist.
    *   The SFT issues an interim order or preliminary statement critical of the CAS procedure in this case.
    *   Any respected third-party sports law expert publicly stating the appeal has strong merit based on the filings.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The SFT issues a swift dismissal of the appeal without a detailed hearing.
    *   USA Gymnastics or Chiles' legal team withdraws the appeal.
    *   The full legal filings are made public and legal experts deem the procedural claims to be weak or speculative.
    *   The IOC or FIG issues a strong statement of confidence in the CAS process and finality of the result.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The full legal briefs submitted to the SFT are not public. The true strength of the procedural arguments is unknown and is the single most important variable.
*   **"Overturned" Nuance:** A successful appeal would likely vacate the CAS decision and remand the case for a new hearing before a different CAS panel. While this resolves the question as "Yes," the new panel could theoretically reach the same conclusion, meaning Chiles might not ultimately regain the medal.
*   **Base Rate Limitations:** The ~1-3% base rate includes many weaker cases. The true base rate for well-funded appeals based on specific procedural grounds might be slightly higher, but data is insufficient to quantify this.
*   **Timeline Uncertainty:** While a decision is expected well before 2026, complex procedural arguments could extend the timeline. However, the SFT generally handles these cases expeditiously.

**Final Research Summary:**
The appeal faces a formidable institutional headwind, with the Swiss Federal Tribunal overturning only 1-

To forecast the probability of the decision to reallocate the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics being overturned before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the success rate of appeals against CAS awards to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT), which is historically low. The success rate is approximately 1-3% for appeals filed, based on historical data from 1984 to 2010 and more recent analyses.
   - Initial prior probability: 2% (reflecting the lower end of the base rate due to the high bar for overturning CAS decisions).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: The appeal is being made to the SFT, which is the only body that can overturn a CAS decision, aligning with the reference class.
   - Difference: This case involves a high-profile Olympic medal dispute, which might attract more legal scrutiny and resources than typical cases. The appeal is based on specific procedural grounds (right to be heard, conflict of interest), which are valid for SFT consideration.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Procedural Grounds**: The appeal is based on procedural issues, which are the types of issues the SFT reviews. This increases the probability slightly compared to a generic appeal.
   - **Legal Resources**: USA Gymnastics has significant legal resources, which increases the probability slightly as they can mount a strong legal challenge.
   - **SFT's Strict Standard**: The SFT's narrow mandate and deference to CAS decisions decrease the probability significantly.
   - **Unknown Strength of Claims**: The actual strength of the procedural claims is unknown, adding uncertainty.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 2% = 0.02 / 0.98 = 0.0204
   - Likelihood ratio: Given the procedural focus and legal resources, let's assume a modest increase in likelihood, say a factor of 2.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0204 × 2 = 0.0408
   - Posterior probability = 0.0408 / (1 + 0.0408) ≈ 3.92%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence: The base rate is very low, and while the procedural focus is promising, the SFT's deference to CAS is a significant barrier.
   - Tail risks: If new evidence or a strong procedural flaw is revealed, the probability could increase.
   - Alternative forecast: A forecast of 5-10% could be plausible if the procedural claims are stronger than currently known.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential unknowns, a calibrated probability of approximately 4% seems reasonable.

Final: 4%

# Will the decision to reallocate the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise at the 2024 Paris Olympics from the US to Romania be overturned before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate for this question is the success rate of appeals against Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decisions to the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT), which is the only body that can overturn a CAS award.

According to the provided background information:
- Only 5 appeals against CAS arbitral awards succeeded from 1984-2010
- The success rate was approximately 1% of appeals in 2009-2010
- Overall success rate was 0.3% of all CAS arbitral awards from 1984-2010

More recent data suggests success rates remain in the 1-3% range for appeals to the SFT. This is my starting base rate.

**Prior probability: 2%** (representing the historical success rate of appeals against CAS decisions)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This follows the standard procedural path of appealing a CAS decision to the Swiss Federal Tribunal
- The SFT has a very limited scope of review (jurisdiction, procedural fairness, public policy)
- The appeal faces the same institutional barriers as other CAS appeals

**Differences from base case:**
- This is a high-profile Olympic medal dispute with significant media attention
- USA Gymnastics has substantial resources to mount a sophisticated legal challenge
- The appeal appears to be based on specific procedural grounds (right to be heard, conflict of interest) that align with the SFT's jurisdiction
- The dispute centers on concrete evidence (video of inquiry timing) rather than subjective judgment

These differences suggest this appeal may have somewhat better chances than the average case reflected in the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Appeal filed on specific procedural grounds**
- P(E|H): If the appeal will succeed, it's very likely (95%) it would be filed on proper procedural grounds
- P(E|~H): Even if the appeal will fail, it would still likely (70%) be filed on proper procedural grounds
- Likelihood ratio: 95%/70% ≈ 1.36
- This moderately increases the probability of success

**Evidence 2: CAS announced it will not reconsider its ruling**
- P(E|H): If the appeal will succeed, we would expect CAS to maintain its position (95%)
- P(E|~H): If the appeal will fail, we would also expect CAS to maintain its position (95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 95%/95% = 1
- This is neutral evidence

**Evidence 3: USA Gymnastics has significant resources for legal challenge**
- P(E|H): If the appeal will succeed, we would expect strong legal resources (90%)
- P(E|~H): Even if the appeal will fail, USA Gymnastics would still deploy strong resources (80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 90%/80% = 1.13
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: The extremely narrow grounds for SFT review**
- P(E|H): If the appeal will succeed, it must overcome these narrow grounds (100%)
- P(E|~H): If the appeal will fail, these narrow grounds are the likely reason (95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 100%/95% ≈ 1.05
- This very slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 2%/98% = 0.0204

Updating with Evidence 1:
- Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 1.36 = 0.0277
- Posterior probability = 0.0277/(1 + 0.0277) ≈ 2.7%

Updating with Evidence 3:
- Posterior odds = 0.0277 × 1.13 = 0.0313
- Posterior probability = 0.0313/(1 + 0.0313) ≈ 3.0%

Updating with Evidence 4:
- Posterior odds = 0.0313 × 1.05 = 0.0329
- Posterior probability = 0.0329/(1 + 0.0329) ≈ 3.2%

After incorporating the available evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 3.2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the strength of USA Gymnastics' procedural arguments since the full legal briefs are not public
- The "conflict of interest" claim could be stronger than publicly known
- The high-profile nature of this case might lead to more thorough scrutiny by the SFT

**Alternative scenarios:**
- If there is compelling video evidence that was improperly excluded, the "right to be heard" argument could be stronger than typical appeals
- If a genuine conflict of interest is proven, success rates could jump significantly, as this is one of the few grounds the SFT takes seriously

**Counterarguments:**
- Even with strong arguments, the SFT's extreme deference to CAS remains the dominant factor
- Most appeals, even those that appear strong initially, ultimately fail
- The SFT is particularly reluctant to intervene in "field of play" decisions related to sporting events

Considering these factors, I should adjust my estimate slightly upward to account for the possibility that this case has stronger procedural grounds than the average appeal, but still maintain a low overall probability given the institutional barriers.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and potential blind spots, I estimate the probability that the decision to reallocate the bronze medal will be overturned before 2026 at 5%.

This reflects:
1. The historically low success rate of appeals against CAS decisions (1-3%)
2. The specific procedural grounds that align with SFT jurisdiction
3. The resources and motivation of USA Gymnastics
4. The still-formidable institutional barriers to overturning CAS decisions

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the overturning of a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decision by a higher authority. The only body with the authority to do this is the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT), Switzerland's supreme court. Therefore, the most appropriate reference class is the historical success rate of appeals of CAS awards to the SFT.

The provided background and research report state that this success rate is exceptionally low. A 2011 CAS bulletin reported a success rate of ~1% for appeals filed in 2009-2010, and an overall success rate of 0.3% of all awards between 1984 and 2010. More recent analyses confirm this trend, with success rates typically cited in the 1-3% range.

I will select a base rate (prior probability) of **2%**. This reflects the strong historical evidence that successful appeals are very rare. In odds form, this is 2:98, or 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The legal pathway is the standard one: an appeal from CAS to the SFT.
- The SFT's jurisdiction remains strictly limited to narrow procedural grounds (e.g., lack of jurisdiction, violation of the right to be heard, conflict with public policy). The SFT will not re-evaluate the facts of the case.

**Differences:**
- **High Profile & Resources:** This is not a routine case. It involves an Olympic medal and is backed by USA Gymnastics, a well-funded national governing body. This ensures a top-tier legal team that is more likely to identify and effectively argue a valid procedural flaw compared to the average appellant in the reference class. This suggests the probability should be higher than the base rate.
- **Specific Procedural Grounds:** The appeal is reportedly based on the "right to be heard" (alleging CAS failed to consider video evidence) and "conflict of interest." These are precisely the types of arguments the SFT is mandated to review, making this a more credible appeal than one that attempts to re-litigate the facts. This also points to a higher probability than the base rate.
- **"Field of Play" Decision:** The case concerns an Olympic medal awarded based on events during competition. Courts, including the SFT, are historically even more reluctant to interfere with "field of play" decisions than with other matters like doping sanctions or eligibility. This is a strong factor suggesting the probability should be lower than for an average appeal.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the decision is overturned, and ~H be the event that it is not.

- **Evidence 1: The appeal is well-funded and argues specific, valid procedural grounds.**
    - P(E1 | H): Very high. A successful appeal almost certainly requires these characteristics.
    - P(E1 | ~H): High, but lower than P(E1 | H). Many unsuccessful appeals are also well-argued, but the base rate of 1-3% includes many weaker, less-resourced, or improperly framed appeals. This evidence filters our case into a stronger subset of all appeals.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability from the base rate.

- **Evidence 2: The appeal concerns an Olympic medal ("field of play" result).**
    - P(E2 | H): Low. It is exceptionally rare for the SFT to take an action that results in changing a medal allocation.
    - P(E2 | ~H): High. The SFT's deference to the autonomy of sporting bodies is a primary reason most appeals, especially on-field ones, fail.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence decreases the probability.

- **Evidence 3: The resolution requires the decision to be "overturned," not necessarily that the medal is ultimately re-awarded to Chiles.**
    - A successful appeal would likely vacate the CAS decision and remand the case for a new hearing before a different CAS panel. This is a less drastic step for the SFT than directly re-awarding a medal. This procedural nuance makes the SFT's intervention more plausible.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence increases the probability of a "Yes" resolution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1:49 (2% probability).
- **Update Step:** The evidence suggests this is a more serious and credible appeal than the average case that makes up the 1-3% base rate. The combination of a strong legal team, appropriate grounds for appeal, and the lower bar of simply vacating the decision (rather than re-awarding the medal) significantly increases the chances from the initial prior. Let's estimate these factors collectively increase the odds by a factor of 4.
    - Intermediate Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1:49) × 4 = 4:49 ≈ 1:12.25
    - Intermediate Probability ≈ 1 / (1 + 12.25) ≈ 7.5%
- The main counteracting force is the SFT's reluctance to touch "field of play" results. However, the successful Sun Yang appeal (though about eligibility, not a medal) shows that the SFT is willing to intervene in high-profile cases if a clear procedural flaw (like panelist bias) is found. The positive factors seem to slightly outweigh this negative one. The final probability should therefore be a modest but clear upward revision from the 2% base rate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be too high if I am underweighting the sheer force of the 1-3% base rate. The institutional inertia and deference of the SFT are the dominant factors in almost every case, and this one may be no different. The claims of procedural error could be weak or standard legal maneuvering without real substance.

Conversely, my forecast could be too low. The legal arguments submitted by USA Gymnastics are not public. There could be a "smoking gun"—an undeniable conflict of interest or a blatant violation of Chiles' right to be heard—that would make a successful appeal highly likely. The Sun Yang case was overturned on the basis of an arbitrator's racist social media posts, a clear-cut example of bias. If a similarly strong piece of evidence exists here, my 7% forecast would be far too conservative.

Given the information asymmetry, a forecast in the high single digits seems to appropriately balance the very low base rate against the case-specific factors that make this appeal stronger than average.

### Final Forecast
The final probability reflects a significant upward adjustment from the 2% historical base rate, driven by the fact that this is a well-resourced appeal on specific, appropriate procedural grounds. The resolution criteria—requiring only that the CAS decision be vacated—also makes a "Yes" more plausible. While the SFT's high bar for intervention, especially in "field of play" matters, keeps the probability low in absolute terms, this case has a notably higher chance of success than a typical appeal.

Final: 7%
