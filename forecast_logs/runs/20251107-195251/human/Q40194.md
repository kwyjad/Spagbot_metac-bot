### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Initial phase of new UK resettlement schemes:** Programs like the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) or the Dubs scheme for unaccompanied minors often start slowly due to administrative setup, vetting, and logistical hurdles. The VPRS resettled 1,602 people in its first full year (2015-2016), implying a rate of ~130/month, but the initial months were much slower. A base rate for the first 3-4 months of a new, complex scheme might be in the range of **50-200 people**.
2.  **Government pilot programs:** This agreement is explicitly a "pilot" until June 2026. Pilot programs are designed to be small-scale to test feasibility and identify problems. They rarely process large volumes. A plausible base rate for a politically sensitive pilot program over ~4 months would be very low, likely in the **dozens to low hundreds**.
3.  **Bilateral migrant return/transfer agreements:** Agreements like the EU-Turkey deal or other intra-EU transfers (e.g., under Dublin regulations) are often fraught with legal challenges and implementation delays. The number of people actually transferred is frequently a small fraction of those eligible. This suggests a base rate skewed towards the **low end of any estimate**.

*Limitations:* The core 1-for-1 swap mechanism (one return for one admission) is novel for the UK, making direct comparisons difficult. The dependency on successful returns is a unique and significant constraint not present in typical resettlement schemes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-06] Agreement comes into force. — (↑) — Establishes the mechanism for admissions, starting the clock.
*   [2025-09-19] Home Office confirms first removals have taken place. — (↑) — Fulfills the prerequisite for the UK to begin accepting people from France.
*   [2025-09-24] First family of three admitted to the UK. — (↑) — The program is operational and processing people, albeit slowly.
*   [2025-10-09] Total admitted reaches 18 people. — (↑) — Shows continued operation. The rate over the 15 days since the first report is 15 people, or exactly 1 person/day.
*   [2025-10-24] Total admitted reaches 23 people. — (↓) — The rate over the subsequent 15 days has slowed to 5 people, or 0.33 people/day. This deceleration is a strong signal of low throughput.
*   [2025-10-24] RFI reports the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting. — (↓) — Lack of deterrent effect may reduce political capital and operational focus on the "admissions" side of the deal, as the primary goal is not being met.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Administrative Capacity (Large ↓):** The primary bottleneck. Vetting online applicants, processing visas, and arranging travel is a slow, bureaucratic process for a new scheme. The observed low, decelerating rate points to this being the dominant factor.
2.  **Number of Successful Returns (Large ↓):** Admissions are contractually linked to returns. The number of returns is likely low due to legal challenges, operational friction, and the difficulty of locating and detaining individuals. This creates a hard cap on admissions.
3.  **Winter Weather (Moderate ↓):** The resolution period (Nov-Dec) sees the worst weather in the Channel. This typically reduces crossing attempts, which in turn reduces the number of potential individuals to be returned, further lowering the cap on admissions.
4.  **Political Imperative (Moderate ↔):** The government needs to show the policy is working. This could create pressure to accelerate admissions before year-end for a "win." Conversely, if the policy is seen as a failure, resources may be quietly diverted, and the pilot may be allowed to languish.
5.  **French Cooperation (Moderate ↓):** The scheme's success depends on active French participation in facilitating both returns and the processing of online applicants. Any friction or de-prioritization on their part will slow the process.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Conditional Mechanism:** Unlike standard resettlement schemes (VPRS, Dubs), admissions are strictly conditional on an equivalent number of returns. This creates a two-sided dependency that severely constrains the rate.
*   **Extremely Short Timeframe:** The question resolves at the end of 2025, covering only the first ~4 months of a brand-new pilot. The "slow start" phase, typical of any new government program, will constitute the entire observation period.
*   **"Pilot" Designation:** The scheme is explicitly a pilot. This signals an intentional small scale to manage risk and test processes, unlike a full-scale national program intended for high volume from day one.
*   **High Political Scrutiny:** The policy is a central plank of the government's immigration strategy. This intense focus can make officials risk-averse and meticulous, slowing down processing to avoid errors that could be politically damaging.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the initial months of pilot resettlement schemes seems appropriate, perhaps a log-normal distribution centered around 75, with significant spread to account for uncertainty (e.g., 90% confidence interval of 25 to 250). Equivalent n should be low.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The observed admission rate is not only low (~0.77 people/day over the first month) but is also *decelerating* significantly in the most recent period.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The program is a "pilot" and is constrained by a novel 1-for-1 returns mechanism, both of which strongly suggest low volume.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The resolution period is during winter, when crossings (the trigger for the mechanism) are at a seasonal low.
    *   (↔ Small) Political pressure for a year-end "success story" could lead to a small batch of admissions, but this is speculative and unlikely to overcome the structural bottlenecks.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the posterior downwards. The decelerating rate is the most powerful piece of new information, suggesting that initial logistical hurdles are not being overcome quickly. The final number is very likely to be in the low double digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official Home Office or French Interior Ministry press release announcing an "acceleration" of the scheme.
    *   Reports of a successful, large-scale return operation (e.g., a boat of 50 people returned in one day).
    *   Announcements of simplified or fast-tracked visa processing for this specific route.
    *   A sudden, unexplained gap in reporting followed by a large batch announcement (suggesting a politically timed release).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continued silence or no new official numbers released through November and December.
    *   Reports of legal challenges in the UK or France specifically targeting the returns agreement.
    *   Statements from French officials expressing frustration or lack of cooperation.
    *   Sustained periods of bad weather in the English Channel.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Batch Reporting:** The data (3, 18, 23) may reflect administrative batching, not a smooth daily flow. A large batch could be processed and announced at once, causing a sudden jump.
*   **Political Manipulation:** The government has a strong incentive to present the scheme as a success. It could arrange a single, highly publicized flight of 30-50 people just before Christmas to generate positive headlines, even if the underlying rate is near zero.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria is "visas received." This is likely tracked internally but may not be the number reported publicly. Public statements might refer to "people arrived" or "people approved," which could differ slightly.
*   **Data Scarcity:** We are extrapolating from only three data points over a 30-day period. This is a very small sample, and the trend could reverse, although the underlying mechanisms suggest it won't.

**Final Research Summary:** The program is a small-scale pilot with a restrictive 1-for-1 mechanism. The observed data from its first month shows a very low and decelerating rate of admissions, suggesting significant administrative bottlenecks that, combined with the onset of winter, will keep the final number very low, likely not much higher than double the last reported figure.

To forecast the number of people admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, we'll follow a Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is informed by initial phases of similar UK resettlement schemes and pilot programs. Given the slow start typical of such schemes and the pilot nature of this agreement, a base rate of 50-200 people over the first few months is reasonable. The mean is around 75, with a wide spread to account for uncertainty.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Like other pilot programs, this scheme is small-scale and faces initial administrative hurdles.
   - Differences: The 1-for-1 swap mechanism is novel, creating a dependency on successful returns, which is a significant constraint.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The observed admission rate is low and decelerating, suggesting administrative bottlenecks and a slow start.
   - The winter season will likely reduce crossings, further limiting admissions.
   - Political pressure might slightly increase admissions, but this is speculative.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Log-normal distribution centered around 75.
   - Evidence strongly suggests a lower outcome due to decelerating admissions and winter constraints.
   - Posterior mean shifts downward, with a tighter distribution reflecting the low likelihood of high admissions.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as a politically motivated batch of admissions, is necessary but unlikely to significantly alter the overall low trend.
   - Alternative forecast: A sudden increase in admissions due to political pressure, but this is countered by structural bottlenecks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian updating, the forecasted percentiles are:

P10: 25  
P20: 30  
P40: 40  
P60: 50  
P80: 60  
P90: 70

# Forecasting: UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use data from similar UK immigration pilot programs and resettlement schemes in their initial phases:

- The Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) resettled approximately 1,602 people in its first full year (2015-2016), averaging ~130/month, but with much slower initial months
- New immigration pilot programs typically process dozens to low hundreds of people in their first 3-4 months
- The current scheme has processed 23 people in approximately 2.5 months (Aug 6 - Oct 24, 2025)

Given these reference points, I'll use a log-normal distribution with a median of approximately 75 people and a 90% confidence interval of roughly 25-250 people for my prior. This reflects the typical slow start of immigration programs while accounting for significant uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Like other UK immigration pilots, this is a new program with administrative setup requirements
- It involves complex vetting and processing procedures
- It requires bilateral cooperation (UK-France)

**Key differences:**
- The 1-for-1 swap mechanism is novel and creates a strict dependency: admissions can only equal returns
- This is explicitly designated as a "pilot" program, suggesting intentionally limited scale
- The resolution timeframe (Aug-Dec 2025) covers only the initial 4-5 months of implementation
- The program operates during winter months when Channel crossings typically decrease
- The scheme appears to be failing its primary objective (deterring crossings), potentially reducing political will

These differences suggest a significantly lower expected outcome than typical resettlement schemes.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- Observed admission rate is extremely low: 23 people over ~80 days (0.29 people/day)
- The rate is decelerating: 15 people in the first 15 days after initial admissions (1/day), then only 5 people in the next 15 days (0.33/day)
- RFI reports the deal is not deterring crossings, reducing political incentives to accelerate admissions
- Winter weather (Nov-Dec) will likely reduce crossing attempts, limiting the pool of potential returns and thus admissions
- The 1-for-1 mechanism creates a hard ceiling on admissions based on successful returns

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- Political pressure to demonstrate success before year-end could lead to expedited processing
- The program is operational and has successfully admitted people, proving the mechanism works
- The UK government has invested political capital in this agreement and may want to show results

The likelihood ratio strongly favors lower outcomes, perhaps by a factor of 3:1 or more.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 75 people, I'll update based on the observed data:

- The observed rate of 0.29 people/day, if continued until December 31, would yield approximately 16 more people (55 days × 0.29), bringing the total to around 39 people
- The deceleration in the rate suggests even this may be optimistic
- The 1-for-1 constraint means admissions cannot exceed returns, which are likely to be limited by legal challenges, operational friction, and winter weather

After updating, my posterior median shifts downward to approximately 45 people, with increased confidence (narrower distribution) based on the observed data. The posterior distribution is right-skewed, reflecting the possibility of a late surge in admissions but a low probability of exceeding 100 people.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the UK government's ability to accelerate processing for political reasons
- Data reporting could be delayed or batched, making the current slowdown appear worse than reality
- A single large-scale return operation could enable a corresponding batch of admissions
- The agreement might be modified or implementation procedures streamlined in response to criticism

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might center around 75-100 people, arguing that:
- Initial administrative hurdles will be overcome
- Political pressure will drive increased processing in December
- The UK government might arrange a symbolic large batch of admissions before year-end

However, this alternative seems less plausible given:
- The strict 1-for-1 mechanism limits flexibility
- The observed deceleration suggests worsening, not improving, implementation
- Winter conditions will further constrain the process
- The program's failure to deter crossings reduces political incentives

I'll widen my confidence intervals slightly to account for these considerations.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the total number of people admitted under a new, pilot-stage, bilateral migration agreement in its first ~4.5 months. An appropriate reference class is the initial phase of other novel UK government resettlement or migration schemes.

*   **Reference Class:** The initial months of new, complex government programs. For example, the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) resettled people, but started slowly due to administrative and logistical setup. Pilot programs, by design, operate at a small scale to test feasibility.
*   **Reasoning:** This agreement is a "pilot" and involves complex coordination between two countries (UK and France), plus a novel 1-for-1 swap mechanism. This suggests a very slow start is highly likely, similar to or even slower than other new schemes.
*   **Distribution:** A reasonable prior distribution for the first 4-5 months of such a program would be centered low, perhaps with a median of **~100 people**, but with a very wide spread to account for high uncertainty. A log-normal distribution would be appropriate, with a 90% confidence interval spanning from perhaps 20 to 500, reflecting the possibility of either near-total failure or unexpected initial success.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like other new government schemes, this program is subject to bureaucratic friction, vetting delays, and the need to establish new operational procedures.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the **1-for-1 conditionality**. Admissions are strictly capped by the number of successful returns to France. Returns are legally and logistically difficult, creating a severe bottleneck that does not exist in standard resettlement schemes. Furthermore, the program's primary stated goal is deterrence. If it fails to deter crossings (as early reports suggest), the political will to make the *admissions* side work may decrease, unlike a purely humanitarian scheme where the goal is simply to resettle people. These differences strongly suggest the outcome will be at the lower end of, or even below, the base rate distribution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The primary evidence comes from the three data points on admissions provided in the background.

*   **Data Point 1 (Sep 24): 3 people.** The program is operational.
*   **Data Point 2 (Oct 9): 18 people.** This implies 15 people were processed in the 15 days since the first report, a rate of **1 person/day**.
*   **Data Point 3 (Oct 24): 23 people.** This implies only 5 people were processed in the subsequent 15 days, a rate of **0.33 people/day**.

This is the most crucial piece of evidence. The rate of admissions is not just low, it is **decelerating significantly**. This strongly suggests that initial, easier cases may have been processed first, and the program is now encountering the predicted administrative friction. This evidence makes much higher outcomes (e.g., >100) significantly less likely and provides strong support for a very low final number.

*   **Other Evidence (downward pressure):**
    *   **RFI Report:** States the deal is not deterring crossings and criticism is mounting. This reduces the political incentive to accelerate the admissions side of the deal.
    *   **Seasonality:** The remaining period (Nov-Dec) is winter, when bad weather typically reduces Channel crossings. Fewer crossings mean fewer potential returns, which in turn lowers the hard cap on admissions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered around ~100 people.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence of a low and decelerating rate (from 1/day to 0.33/day) is highly consistent with a low final outcome and highly inconsistent with a high one.
*   **Update Step:** Starting with a prior median of 100, the evidence of a 0.33/day rate forces a massive downward revision. A simple extrapolation from the most recent rate over the remaining 68 days (Oct 25 - Dec 31) would be: 23 (current total) + (68 days * 0.33 people/day) ≈ 23 + 22 = **45 people**.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution's central tendency shifts dramatically downwards from ~100 to ~45. The variance also reduces, as we now have concrete data on the program's low throughput. The distribution becomes right-skewed, with a hard floor at 23 and a tail that accounts for the possibility of a politically motivated batch release.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk for Underestimation:** The government, facing criticism that the program is failing, could push through a single, large "PR batch" of 50-75 people just before the end of the year to claim success. This is a plausible scenario that could cause a sudden jump in the numbers, independent of the underlying daily rate. My upper percentiles must account for this possibility.
*   **Main Risk for Overestimation:** The program could stall almost completely. Mounting criticism, lack of French cooperation, or legal challenges could halt returns, and therefore admissions. The final number might not be much higher than the last reported figure of 23. My lower percentiles should reflect this "fizzle-out" scenario.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered around 80-100 would assume the "political batch" scenario is the most likely outcome. However, this seems less probable than the "muddling through" scenario implied by the data, as political will cannot easily overcome the deep-seated administrative and legal hurdles of a bilateral agreement, especially when its primary goal (deterrence) is not being met.
*   **Adjustment:** My central estimate of ~45, based on the most recent data, seems robust. I will ensure the P80 and P90 are high enough to capture the "political batch" risk, creating a right-skewed distribution.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered on the low, decelerating rate observed in the data, but includes a right-skewed tail to account for the plausible scenario of a politically motivated batch of admissions before year-end, and a lower tail that reflects the possibility of the program stalling.
