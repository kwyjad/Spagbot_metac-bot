### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical behavior of the 10-Year Treasury (10Y) yield over short, biweekly periods?** This will establish a baseline for typical volatility and movement, forming the reference class.
*   **Q2: What is the current state of the 10Y yield and the macroeconomic environment as of the forecast date (November 10, 2025)?** This involves synthesizing the provided source snippets to determine the starting point, recent trends, and prevailing market narratives.
*   **Q3: What are the primary causal drivers (mechanisms) that influence the 10Y yield?** This requires identifying the key economic and policy factors that the market is reacting to.
*   **Q4: What are the dominant expert forecasts for the near-to-medium term?** This involves extracting the directional and quantitative predictions from the provided sources (UBS, Trading Economics).
*   **Q5: How does the current situation (a potential pre-easing environment) differ from a "typical" period for the 10Y yield?** This helps to adjust the base rate expectation based on the specific context.
*   **Q6: What key events or data releases are scheduled between the forecast date and the resolution period (Nov 10 - Dec 5, 2025)?** These are the potential catalysts for significant price movement.

**2. Search Queries (Simulated for each question):**

*   **Q1:**
    *   `historical daily volatility US 10-year treasury yield`
    *   `statistical distribution of biweekly changes in DGS10 FRED`
    *   `average 10-year treasury yield change during US federal holidays` (to account for Thanksgiving in the period)
*   **Q2:**
    *   (Synthesize provided sources directly, as they give the current state.)
*   **Q3:**
    *   `main drivers of US 10-year treasury yield`
    *   `impact of federal reserve policy on bond yields`
    *   `relationship between inflation expectations and treasury yields`
*   **Q4:**
    *   (Extract directly from provided UBS and Trading Economics sources.)
*   **Q5:**
    *   `10-year treasury yield behavior before fed easing cycle`
    *   `yield curve inversion as predictor of fed policy`
    *   `market pricing of fed rate cuts vs actual cuts history`
*   **Q6:**
    *   `US economic data release calendar November 2025`
    *   `FOMC meeting schedule 2025`
    *   `US Treasury auction schedule November December 2025`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   **Current State:** As of Nov 10, 2025, the 10Y yield is 4.11%.
*   **Prevailing Narrative:** The market anticipates the Federal Reserve will begin a rate-cutting cycle. This is the dominant theme driving forecasts.
*   **Expert Forecasts:** Both UBS and Trading Economics project lower yields. UBS sees 3.75% by mid-2026, and Trading Economics forecasts 4.06% by end of Q4 2025 and 3.84% in a year. The direction is consistently downward.
*   **Historical Volatility:** Biweekly changes are typically modest but can be significant. A standard deviation of roughly 15-25 basis points over a 10-day trading period is a reasonable starting point for a base rate.
*   **Key Drivers:** The forecast is highly sensitive to upcoming inflation (CPI, PCE) and labor market (Non-Farm Payrolls) data, as these will directly inform the Fed's decision on when to start cutting rates.
*   **Contextual Difference:** Unlike a random period, the current environment has a strong directional bias due to the widely held expectation of monetary easing. The market is "leaning" in one direction, making it highly sensitive to confirming or contradictory evidence.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

With the synthesized information, I will now populate the required sections of the brief, ensuring a logical flow from the general (base rates) to the specific (current evidence and indicators).

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Biweekly Yield Volatility:** Historically, the 10-year Treasury yield exhibits significant daily volatility. Over a typical 10-day trading period (approx. biweekly), a change of +/- 20 basis points (0.20%) from the starting value is common, with a 95% confidence interval historically falling within approximately +/- 45 basis points. This class assumes a random walk, which is a useful but incomplete baseline.
*   **Pre-Easing Cycle Behavior:** A more specific reference class is the period 1-3 months before the first rate cut in a Federal Reserve easing cycle. In these periods, the 10Y yield tends to drift lower as the market prices in future cuts, though with significant volatility as traders react to data that confirms or delays the expected policy shift. The base rate here is a modest downward drift.
*   **Year-End Trading:** The resolution period (late Nov/early Dec) often sees reduced market liquidity due to holidays (Thanksgiving) and portfolio adjustments before year-end. This can sometimes lead to exaggerated price movements on lower volumes or, conversely, a quiet drift. This effect is generally secondary to major macroeconomic drivers.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-10:** UST 10Y yield holds at 4.11%, consolidating recent moves as markets await fresh catalysts. (↔) — Establishes the current baseline for the forecast.
*   **2025-11-07:** October jobs report (hypothetical) indicated a cooling labor market with moderating wage growth. (↓) — Strengthens the case for the Fed to begin cutting rates sooner, putting downward pressure on yields.
*   **2025-11-06:** UBS Global Wealth Management reiterates its forecast for yields to decline, targeting 3.75% by mid-2026. (↓) — Reinforces the dominant institutional narrative of a pending Fed easing cycle.
*   **2025-10-16:** September CPI data (hypothetical) came in slightly below consensus expectations. (↓) — Provided further evidence of disinflation, a necessary precondition for the Fed to pivot to rate cuts.
*   **2025-09-18:** The Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting (hypothetical) held rates steady but adopted a more dovish tone in its statement. (↓) — Signaled to markets that the peak of the tightening cycle was in, shifting focus to the timing of future cuts.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Federal Reserve Policy Expectations:** The market's anticipation of the timing and pace of Fed rate cuts is the single largest driver. Dovish signals or data supporting cuts push yields down. (Size: Large)
*   **Inflation Data (CPI, PCE):** Higher-than-expected inflation would challenge the rate-cut narrative and push yields up. Lower-than-expected inflation would accelerate the decline. (Size: Large)
*   **Economic Growth Data (Jobs, GDP, PMIs):** Weaker data suggests a slowing economy, increasing the likelihood of Fed easing and pushing yields down. Strong data has the opposite effect. (Size: Moderate-to-Large)
*   **Global Risk Sentiment:** A major "risk-off" event (e.g., geopolitical crisis, financial instability) would increase demand for safe-haven US Treasuries, pushing yields down sharply. (Size: Moderate, but can be Large)
*   **Treasury Issuance/Supply:** The size of Treasury auctions can have a short-term impact. Very large issuance can put temporary upward pressure on yields, though this is usually secondary to macro factors. (Size: Small-to-Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Strong Directional Bias:** Unlike a typical period of random fluctuation, the market has a clear and strong expectation of future Fed easing. This creates a powerful downward gravitational pull on yields, which will persist unless contradicted by strong data.
*   **Heightened Data Sensitivity:** With the Fed being "data-dependent," the market's reaction to key releases like CPI and Non-Farm Payrolls is amplified. The forecast is less about the long-term trend and more about the reaction to specific, imminent data points.
*   **Flat/Inverted Yield Curve:** The yield curve is likely flat or inverted, a classic signal of tight monetary policy and market expectation of future cuts. This is a distinct regime from a "normal" upward-sloping curve.
*   **Forward Guidance as a Key Variable:** The market is parsing every word from Fed officials for clues about the timing of the first cut. This makes Fedspeak a more potent driver than in more stable policy periods.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior would be a normal distribution centered on the current yield of **4.11%**, with a standard deviation of ~20-25 bps, reflecting the historical biweekly volatility (the base rate).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Overwhelming consensus from analysts (UBS, Trading Economics) and market pricing for a near-term Fed easing cycle.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Recent (hypothetical) inflation and labor market data have been soft, supporting the disinflationary/slowing growth narrative.
    *   (↔ Small) The yield has been

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of November 24 to December 5, 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The historical behavior of the 10-Year Treasury yield over biweekly periods suggests a typical change of +/- 20 basis points (0.20%) with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 45 basis points. This reflects the random walk nature of yields in normal conditions.
   - **Mean/Median:** Starting at the current yield of 4.11%.
   - **Variance:** Standard deviation of approximately 20-25 basis points, reflecting typical biweekly volatility.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation shares the typical volatility characteristics of the base rate.
   - **Difference:** The market is anticipating a Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycle, creating a downward bias not present in the base rate. This expectation is driven by recent dovish signals and soft economic data.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Dovish Fed Signals:** Recent FOMC statements and market expectations strongly suggest a rate-cutting cycle, increasing the likelihood of lower yields.
   - **Soft Economic Data:** Recent hypothetical data (jobs report, CPI) supports a slowing economy, reinforcing the downward pressure on yields.
   - **Expert Forecasts:** UBS and Trading Economics project lower yields, with targets around 3.75% to 4.06% by mid-2026 and end of Q4 2025, respectively.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Normal distribution centered at 4.11% with a standard deviation of 20-25 basis points.
   - **Likelihood:** Strong downward pressure from dovish Fed expectations and soft economic data.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Likely shifted downward from the prior mean, reflecting the strong consensus and recent data.
   - **Posterior Variance:** May be slightly reduced due to the strong directional bias, but still reflecting typical volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Risk:** The strong consensus on a rate-cutting cycle could lead to overconfidence in a downward forecast. Unexpected strong economic data or geopolitical events could push yields higher.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A scenario where inflation unexpectedly rises or economic data strengthens, delaying Fed cuts, could lead to higher yields.
   - **Adjustment:** Consider a wider range of outcomes to account for potential surprises.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast percentiles are adjusted to reflect the downward bias while considering potential tail risks.

P10: 3.85
P20: 3.92
P40: 4.00
P60: 4.08
P80: 4.15
P90: 4.22

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the current 10Y yield of 4.11% (as of Nov 10, 2025) as the central value, with historical biweekly volatility informing the spread.

Historical data suggests that over a 10-day trading period, the 10Y yield typically exhibits changes of ±20 basis points, with a 95% confidence interval of approximately ±45 basis points. This gives us a reasonable starting distribution centered at 4.11% with a standard deviation of about 20-25 basis points.

I'm selecting this base rate because:
- It incorporates the current market price, which already reflects all publicly available information
- The biweekly volatility pattern provides an appropriate reference class for the forecast horizon
- It's a standard approach for short-term interest rate forecasting

The mean of this prior is 4.11% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.22%.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- The forecast period is a standard biweekly trading period
- Markets continue to be driven by the same fundamental factors (Fed policy, inflation, growth)
- Normal market functioning with no obvious structural breaks

**Key differences:**
- The forecast period includes the Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27, 2025), which typically reduces market liquidity
- We're in what appears to be a pre-easing cycle environment, creating a downward bias compared to a random period
- The market has a strong directional consensus (downward) based on Fed easing expectations
- Year-end portfolio adjustments may begin during this period, potentially affecting market dynamics

These differences suggest we should adjust our prior to have a slight downward skew rather than being perfectly symmetric around 4.11%.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for lower yields:**
1. Expert forecasts unanimously point downward - UBS targets 3.75% by mid-2026, and Trading Economics forecasts 4.06% by end of Q4 2025. This suggests approximately 5-35 basis points of decline over the next several months, with some portion likely occurring during our forecast period. (Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring lower yields)

2. Recent economic data (hypothetical October jobs report, September CPI) indicates cooling inflation and moderating growth - classic preconditions for Fed easing. This strengthens the case for the Fed to begin cutting rates soon. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring lower yields)

3. The Fed's recent communications have adopted a more dovish tone, signaling that the peak of the tightening cycle is behind us. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 favoring lower yields)

**Evidence for higher yields:**
1. Treasury issuance remains elevated, which could put some upward pressure on yields, especially if auctions see weak demand. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring higher yields)

2. The market may have already priced in significant easing expectations, creating the potential for disappointment if data comes in stronger than expected. (Likelihood ratio: ~1.1:1 favoring higher yields)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with our prior centered at 4.11% with σ = 0.22%, I'll update based on the strongest evidence: the expert forecasts and recent economic data.

First update (expert forecasts):
- Prior: μ = 4.11%, σ = 0.22%
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring lower yields
- Posterior: This shifts the distribution downward by approximately 5-10 basis points
- Updated distribution: μ ≈ 4.03%, σ ≈ 0.20%

Second update (economic data and Fed signals):
- Prior: μ = 4.03%, σ = 0.20%
- Combined likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring lower yields
- Posterior: This further shifts the distribution downward by about 3-5 basis points
- Updated distribution: μ ≈ 3.99%, σ ≈ 0.19%

The posterior distribution has:
1. A lower mean (3.99% vs. 4.11%)
2. Slightly reduced variance (market consensus has increased)
3. A negative skew (more probability mass below the mean than above)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be overweighting the consensus view of Fed easing. If inflation proves stickier than expected or growth rebounds, yields could rise sharply.

2. The forecast period includes Thanksgiving, which could lead to unusual market dynamics due to low liquidity. This increases the risk of unexpected volatility.

3. I haven't accounted for potential geopolitical shocks that could drive a flight-to-safety (lowering yields) or inflation concerns (raising yields).

4. Year-end positioning by institutional investors could create technical pressures not captured in my model.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would be a higher yield forecast (4.15-4.25%) based on the argument that markets have already priced in significant easing and could be disappointed by stronger-than-expected economic data. This would be consistent with the "buy the rumor, sell the news" pattern sometimes seen around Fed policy shifts.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The weight of evidence from expert forecasts, recent economic data, and Fed communications all point to a downward trajectory. While short-term reversals are possible, the dominant trend appears downward.

**Adjustment:**
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these considerations, particularly the holiday-related liquidity issues and potential for data surprises. I'll also ensure my lower tail adequately captures the possibility of a more rapid yield decline if markets become convinced of imminent Fed action.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll provide my calibrated forecast for the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025:

P10: 3.70%
P20: 3.80%
P40: 3.93%
P60: 4.05%
P80: 4.18%
P90: 4.28%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My prior distribution is based on the historical volatility of the 10-Year Treasury (10Y) yield over a similar forecast horizon (approximately 25 calendar days, or 18 trading days).

*   **Reference Class:** The distribution of 18-trading-day changes in the DGS10 series.
*   **Rationale:** This "random walk" approach provides a neutral starting point based on typical market volatility before incorporating specific, forward-looking information.
*   **Parameters:** The research report notes a typical biweekly (10-day) standard deviation of 15-25 bps. I will use 20 bps as a midpoint. Scaling this to an 18-day period (`sqrt(18/10) * 20 bps`) gives a standard deviation of approximately 27 bps.
*   **Prior Distribution:** A normal distribution centered on the current yield of **4.11%** with a standard deviation of **0.27%**. This implies a 68% probability that the yield will end between 3.84% and 4.38%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental market mechanics and the types of data that influence yields (inflation, employment) are consistent with the historical reference class.
*   **Differences:** The current situation is markedly different from a "typical" period. There is a strong, consensus directional bias in the market. The prevailing narrative, supported by expert forecasts and recent (hypothetical) data, is that the Federal Reserve is on the cusp of an easing cycle. This creates a strong downward gravitational pull on yields, making a simple random walk model insufficient. The forecast period also contains major, scheduled economic data releases (October CPI, November NFP), which could increase volatility beyond the historical average.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the prior based on several key pieces of evidence from the research report.

*   **Evidence 1: Expert Forecasts & Market Narrative (Strong Downward Pressure):**
    *   UBS forecasts 3.75% by mid-2026, and Trading Economics forecasts 4.06% by the end of Q4 2025. This consensus for lower yields is the most significant factor.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment:** This evidence makes outcomes below the current 4.11% much more likely than outcomes above it. It strongly suggests shifting the central tendency of my distribution downwards. The Trading Economics forecast of 4.06% provides a powerful anchor for the new median.

*   **Evidence 2: Recent Macroeconomic Data (Moderate Downward Pressure):**
    *   The report describes a context of a cooling labor market and below-consensus inflation. This provides the fundamental justification for the dovish market narrative.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment:** This reinforces the downward shift in the median. It confirms the trend that experts are forecasting.

*   **Evidence 3: Imminent High-Impact Data Releases (Increased Variance & Skew):**
    *   The forecast period (Nov 10 - Dec 5) contains the October CPI release and, crucially, the November Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report on the likely resolution date (Dec 5).
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment:** These events increase the probability of a large move. Because the market is already positioned for dovish data, a surprisingly "hot" (inflationary/strong) report would cause a disproportionately large upward move as positions are unwound. A "soft" report would confirm the trend but might produce a smaller move. This widens the overall distribution and introduces a positive (right) skew, where the upside tail is fatter than the downside tail.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior(Normal, μ=4.11, σ=0.27) × Likelihood(Lower yields >> Higher yields, fat tails).
*   **Step 1: Shift the Median:** I move the center of my distribution from the prior's mean of 4.11% down to **4.05%**. This incorporates the strong dovish narrative and the specific end-of-quarter forecast from Trading Economics (4.06%).
*   **Step 2: Widen the Distribution:** I increase the spread to account for the high event risk from the CPI and NFP reports. The standard deviation of the prior (~27 bps) is likely too small. My final P10-P90 range will be wider than the prior's implied range.
*   **Step 3: Introduce Skew:** I will make the distribution positively skewed. The distance from the median to the upper percentiles (P80, P90) will be greater than the distance to the lower percentiles (P20, P10). This reflects the risk of a sharp upward repricing on strong economic data.

My posterior is a right-skewed distribution with a median of 4.05% and fatter tails than a simple historical volatility model would suggest.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Primary Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating the "sticky inflation" scenario? If both the October CPI and November NFP come in hot, the entire dovish narrative could unravel, sending yields sharply higher, potentially toward 4.40% or 4.50%. My P90 must adequately capture this significant risk.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is that markets enter a holding pattern, awaiting more definitive signals from the Fed in the December FOMC meeting (which is after the resolution date). In this case, the yield might simply oscillate around the current 4.11% level with no clear direction.
*   **Rebuttal & Adjustment:** While the "holding pattern" is possible, the presence of two major data releases makes a quiet period less likely. The risk of a sharp move is real. The "sticky inflation" scenario is the most potent risk to the forecast. I have accounted for this by setting a P90 at 4.40%, a nearly 30 bps rise from the current level, which represents a significant repricing event. The P10 at 3.78% accounts for the less likely but still possible "hard landing" scenario where data is exceptionally weak. The distribution feels appropriately wide and skewed.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.78
P20: 3.88
P40: 4.00
P60: 4.10
P80: 4.28
P90: 4.40
