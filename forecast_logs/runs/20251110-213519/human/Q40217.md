### Reference class & base rates
-   **Long-Term Historical Average (1997-Present):** The full history of the FRED series BAMLH0A0HYM2 shows a mean/median spread of approximately 5.2-5.4% (520-540 bps). This class includes multiple recessions and crises (e.g., 2001, 2008, 2020) where spreads spiked dramatically. This serves as a broad, all-regime upper-bound reference.
-   **Post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) Non-Recessionary Periods (2010-2019, 2021-2023):** In periods of economic expansion and relatively stable monetary policy, the average spread is significantly lower, typically ranging from 3.5% to 4.5% (350-450 bps). This class is more representative of the current economic regime (expected slow growth, no recession) than the full history.
-   **Recent Volatile Period (2025 YTD):** The market in 2025 has seen significant two-way action, with spreads trading between a low of 2.79% and a high of 4.76% (per NY Life Investments). The average for the year is likely in the mid-3% range (approx. 3.50-3.75%). This class reflects current market dynamics and investor sentiment, making it the most relevant reference.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-07** Spread at 3.13% (313 bps) — (↓) — The most recent data point is well below historical averages, indicating strong risk appetite and benign credit conditions heading into the forecast period.
*   **2025-11-03** Nomura reports October spreads widened modestly by 14 bps to 2.94% — (↑) — This suggests some minor risk-off sentiment in the prior month, though the more recent 3.13% reading indicates this was either short-lived or data points differ.
*   **2025-07-18** NY Life Investments notes spreads retracted to 3.21% (321 bps) after a Q2 spike — (↓) — This establishes that the market has been in a relatively tight and stable range in the low 3% area for several months, following earlier volatility.
*   **2025-06-24** Lord Abbett highlights market resilience and tight spreads — (↓) — Reinforces the narrative of healthy underlying fundamentals and strong investor demand for high-yield debt throughout mid-2025.
*   **2025-04-XX** Spreads widened to a peak of 4.76% (476 bps) — (↑) — An important reminder from earlier in the year that sentiment can shift rapidly, even if the market has since recovered. This shows the potential for volatility.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Corporate Default Rate Expectations:** The primary driver. Lower expected defaults, driven by strong corporate earnings and a healthy economy, allow investors to demand a lower risk premium. (Large impact)
-   **Macroeconomic Growth (GDP):** Stronger economic growth supports corporate revenues and profitability, reducing default risk and tightening spreads. A slowdown or recession is the biggest risk for wider spreads. (Large impact)
-   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** A dovish or paused Fed is generally supportive, encouraging a "search for yield." A hawkish turn or unexpected tightening would likely cause spreads to widen. (Moderate impact)
-   **Investor Risk Appetite & Market Volatility (VIX):** In "risk-on" environments (low VIX), investors move into higher-risk assets like junk bonds, compressing spreads. A "risk-off" shock causes a flight to safety (Treasuries), widening spreads. (Moderate-to-Large impact, especially during shocks)
-   **Treasury Yields & Term Premium:** The OAS is a spread *over* Treasuries. If Treasury yields rise sharply due to inflation or fiscal concerns (as noted by ICE), it can pressure high-yield spreads wider as the total compensation is re-evaluated. (Small-to-Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Significantly Tighter Spreads:** The current spread of 3.13% is far below the long-term historical average (~5.25%) and also below the post-GFC non-recessionary average (~4.0%). The market is already pricing in a very positive outcome.
-   **Below-Average Default Forecasts:** Multiple sources (AXA, Nomura) explicitly forecast default rates for 2025-2026 to remain in a low 1-3% range, well below the historical average of ~4%. This is a key structural support.
-   **Improved Issuer Credit Quality:** The composition of the high-yield index has improved over the last decade (as noted by Lord Abbett), with better fundamentals and more resilient issuers. This may justify structurally tighter spreads than in past cycles.
-   **Post-Hike Fed Stance:** Unlike many periods in the reference class that involved Fed tightening cycles, the consensus is that the Fed has completed its hikes for this cycle and is now on pause (per BofA's 2024 outlook). This removes a major headwind.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior centered on the recent H2 2025 average seems appropriate, suggesting a mean around **3.25% (325 bps)**. Given the relative stability since the Q2 volatility, this prior should have moderate strength (equivalent n of ~10-15).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) Consensus economic outlook is for continued, albeit slow, growth, supporting corporate health. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) Explicit forecasts for below-average default rates provide a strong anchor. (Large)
    *   (↓) The Fed is on a stable/paused policy footing, which is supportive for risk assets. (Moderate)
    *   (↔/↑) Spreads are already historically tight, limiting the potential for significant further compression and making them sensitive to negative news. (Small ↑)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the conditions that have led to the current tight spreads. The posterior should shift slightly lower from the 3.25% prior, towards the most recent reading of 3.13%, suggesting a final distribution centered in the **3.10% to 3.25%** range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    *   Weekly jobless claims ticking up unexpectedly, signaling labor market weakness.
    *   A spike in the VIX index above 20.
    *   Hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials pushing back against market easing expectations.
    *   Negative pre-announcements for Q4 corporate earnings, especially from cyclical sectors.
    *   Unexpected geopolitical flare-ups.
-   **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten):**
    *   Stronger-than-expected retail sales or manufacturing PMI data.
    *   Core CPI/PCE inflation data coming in below expectations, confirming the Fed can remain on hold.
    *   Continued strong fund flows into high-yield bond ETFs and mutual funds.
    *   Upgrades from credit rating agencies outnumbering downgrades.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Event Risk:** The forecast is for a very short horizon, making it highly susceptible to any sudden market-moving news (e.g., geopolitical events, major corporate failure). The April 2025 spike is a case in point.
-   **Consensus Complacency:** The provided sources show a strong consensus for a benign outcome. If this consensus is wrong, the repricing could be sharp and swift as crowded positions unwind.
-   **Illiquidity:** The forecast period (late Nov - early Dec) can be characterized by lower trading liquidity due to holidays, which can sometimes exaggerate price movements on little news.
-   **Data Discrepancy:** Note the minor difference between Nomura's end-of-October figure (2.94%) and YCharts' early-November figure (3.13%), highlighting potential for data noise or very short-term volatility.
-   **Tail Risk:** Bank of America's "surprise" of a "bond buyers' strike" is a low-probability, high-impact tail risk that is not captured in the base case but remains a possibility.

**Final Research Summary:**
The current economic environment of stable growth, low default expectations, and a paused Fed strongly supports high-yield spreads remaining near their current historically tight levels. The base case points to continued stability, with the primary risk being an unexpected negative shock to the optimistic consensus.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the period Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the recent average spread for 2025, which has been in the mid-3% range (3.50-3.75%). This reflects the current market dynamics and investor sentiment.
   - The mean of this base rate is approximately 3.25%, with a moderate variance reflecting the stability observed in the latter half of 2025.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution because the market has been stable with spreads in the low 3% range for several months.
   - Differences include the recent reading of 3.13%, which is slightly below the base rate, indicating stronger risk appetite and benign credit conditions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent spread at 3.13% suggests strong risk appetite (↓).
   - October spreads widened modestly, indicating minor risk-off sentiment (↑).
   - Market resilience and tight spreads noted in mid-2025 (↓).
   - Potential for volatility as seen in April 2025 (↑).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 3.25%, the evidence of strong risk appetite and stable economic conditions suggests a slight downward adjustment.
   - The posterior distribution is centered around 3.10% to 3.25%, reflecting the recent reading and ongoing stability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks such as geopolitical events or unexpected economic data that could widen spreads.
   - Alternative scenario: a sudden economic downturn or Fed policy shift could lead to wider spreads.
   - Adjustments made to account for potential volatility and data noise.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS are as follows:

P10: 3.05
P20: 3.10
P40: 3.15
P60: 3.20
P80: 3.25
P90: 3.30

# Forecast: ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Nov 24-Dec 5, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use multiple reference classes:

- **Recent 2025 Range (most relevant)**: The spread has traded between 2.79% and 4.76% in 2025, with a mid-range of approximately 3.50-3.75%. The most recent reading is 3.13%.
- **Post-GFC Non-Recessionary Periods**: During economic expansions from 2010-2019 and 2021-2023, spreads typically ranged from 3.5% to 4.5%.
- **Long-Term Historical Average (1997-Present)**: Approximately 5.2-5.4%, but includes multiple crises.

Given the current economic environment and recent stability, I'll center my prior on the recent 2025 average with emphasis on the most recent data point, suggesting a prior centered at **3.25%** with moderate variance (roughly ±0.75% for 90% confidence).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The economy continues to show growth without immediate recession signals
- The Federal Reserve appears to be on a stable policy path
- Corporate fundamentals remain relatively strong

**Differences from base rate:**
- Current spreads (3.13%) are already historically tight, below both long-term and post-GFC averages
- Market consensus appears unusually optimistic about low default rates (1-3% vs. historical 4%)
- The high-yield index composition has improved over time with better credit quality
- The forecast period (late Nov-early Dec) may have lower liquidity due to holidays

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting tighter spreads:**
- Recent data shows spreads at 3.13%, well below historical averages, indicating strong risk appetite
- Multiple sources (AXA, Nomura) forecast default rates to remain low at 1-3% through 2025-2026
- Lord Abbett highlights market resilience and improved issuer credit quality
- The Fed has completed its hiking cycle and is on pause

**Evidence supporting wider spreads:**
- Spreads are already historically tight, limiting further compression potential
- NY Life notes a Q2 2025 spike to 4.76%, showing vulnerability to shocks
- The forecast period may have holiday-related liquidity constraints
- Bank of America mentions a potential "bond buyers' strike" as a tail risk

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 3.25% (325 bps), I'll update based on the evidence:

- The most recent reading of 3.13% suggests the distribution should shift slightly lower
- The consensus for continued low default rates provides strong support for tight spreads
- The stable Fed policy stance removes a major headwind
- However, the already-tight spreads create a floor effect, limiting further compression

After incorporating this evidence, my posterior distribution shifts slightly lower to center around **3.15%** (315 bps), with a slightly narrower variance than my prior due to the consistency of recent data.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

- **Complacency risk**: The market consensus appears strongly optimistic, which could make any negative surprise more impactful
- **Liquidity effects**: The late November/early December period often has thinner trading, which could exaggerate moves in either direction
- **Tail risks**: While the base case is stability, the April 2025 spike to 4.76% demonstrates that rapid widening can occur with little warning
- **Mean reversion**: Spreads this tight historically tend to widen over time, not tighten further

Alternative forecast: A case could be made for a wider spread (3.50-3.75%) based on mean reversion and the holiday liquidity constraints. However, the strong consensus on fundamentals and recent stability make this less likely in the short forecast window.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my tails slightly to account for these risks while maintaining the central tendency.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 2.85%
P20: 2.95%
P40: 3.10%
P60: 3.20%
P80: 3.40%
P90: 3.65%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for a short period in late 2025. I will select a prior based on the most relevant reference class, which is the recent market behavior in 2025.

*   **Reference Class:** Market conditions in the second half of 2025. The research report indicates that after a spike to 4.76% in Q2, spreads have stabilized in a lower range, with readings like 3.21% in July and 3.13% in early November. This period reflects the current macroeconomic regime of slow growth, below-average default risk, and a paused Federal Reserve.
*   **Prior Distribution:** Based on this reference class, I will set a prior distribution centered slightly above the most recent reading to account for some mean reversion from historically tight levels. I'll establish a prior with a median of approximately **3.25%**. The volatility in the short term is expected to be moderate, but with potential for sharp moves. I'll model this as a right-skewed distribution, as negative surprises tend to have a larger impact than positive ones when spreads are already tight.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The forecast period (Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025) is very close to the present (Nov 10, 2025), so the situation is highly similar to the H2 2025 base case.

*   **Similarities:** The underlying drivers—slow GDP growth, strong corporate balance sheets, low expected default rates, and a stable Fed policy—are all expected to persist over the next few weeks.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Asymmetric Risk:** The primary difference is the starting point. At 3.13%, spreads are already pricing in a very optimistic scenario. This creates an asymmetric risk profile where the potential for spreads to widen (increase) due to negative news is significantly greater than the potential for them to tighten (decrease) further.
    *   **Holiday Liquidity:** The forecast period includes the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which can lead to lower trading volumes. Thinner liquidity can sometimes exaggerate price movements on any given news catalyst.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence and their likely impact on the prior distribution.

*   **(↓) Low Default Rate Forecasts:** Evidence from AXA and Nomura projects default rates to remain well below the historical average (1-3% vs. ~4%). This is a strong fundamental anchor and is highly consistent with spreads remaining in the low 3% range. This evidence strongly pushes down the probability of spreads moving towards the long-term average of 5%+.
*   **(↓) Stable Monetary Policy:** The consensus view is that the Federal Reserve has completed its hiking cycle and is on hold. This removes a major headwind for risk assets like high-yield bonds and supports continued investor demand, which is consistent with tight spreads.
*   **(↑) Historically Tight Spreads:** The current level of 3.13% is significantly below the post-GFC non-recessionary average of ~4.0%. This suggests the market may be complacent. This evidence makes higher outcomes (widening spreads) relatively more likely than further significant tightening. It acts as a force to skew the distribution to the right (upside).
*   **(↑) Memory of Volatility:** The spike to 4.76% in April 2025 serves as a potent reminder of how quickly sentiment can shift. This evidence increases the likelihood of the upper tail of the distribution, suggesting that a sharp move upwards, while not the base case, is a non-trivial possibility.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   **Initial Prior:** Median at 3.25%, right-skewed.
*   **Update Step:** The strong evidence of low default rates and a stable Fed confirms the appropriateness of a low median. It anchors the central tendency of the forecast firmly in the low 3s. The most recent data point of 3.13% pulls the distribution slightly lower than the 3.25% prior median. However, the evidence of already-tight spreads and past volatility provides a strong counter-argument against overconfidence and suggests a fat tail on the upside.
*   **Posterior Distribution:** I will adjust my prior to have a median of **3.25%**. This is slightly higher than the most recent 3.13% reading, reflecting a slight upward drift or mean-reversion tendency. The key adjustment is to make the distribution strongly right-skewed. The distance between the 50th and 90th percentiles will be much larger than the distance between the 10th and 50th percentiles, reflecting the asymmetric risk of a "risk-off" event.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The consensus for a "soft landing" is wrong, and a sharp economic downturn is imminent. In this case, the market would begin to price this in rapidly, and spreads could gap out towards 5.0% or higher, well beyond my P90.
*   **Rebuttal:** For this to happen within the next 3-4 weeks, there would need to be a major, unambiguous economic shock. Given the current data trajectory, this is a low-probability event for this specific short-term forecast, but it justifies a wide P50-P90 range. My P90 of 4.05% represents a significant widening of nearly 100 basis points from the current level, which would require a notable negative catalyst.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** Am I too anchored to the current 3.13% level? My median of 3.25% is close, which is appropriate for a short-term forecast. The main risk is underestimating the variance. The right-skewed nature of my distribution is a direct attempt to counter this by assigning significant probability to a widening event.
*   **Structural Shift Argument:** A counter-argument is that the high-yield index's improved credit quality justifies permanently tighter spreads. In this view, the "fair value" might be closer to 3.00%, and my forecast is too high. While quality has improved, credit spreads are inherently cyclical. I will maintain a P10 and P20 that allow for some further tightening but view it as less likely than a move higher. My final distribution places about a 35-40% chance on spreads ending below the current 3.13% level, which seems reasonable.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final forecast reflects a distribution centered slightly above the current market level, with a significant skew towards higher values to account for the asymmetric risk profile of an already-tight credit market.

P10: 2.95
P20: 3.05
P40: 3.15
P60: 3.40
P80: 3.65
P90: 4.05
