### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Maximum Intraday VIX for the same biweekly period (approx. last week of Nov / first week of Dec) in non-crisis years (2010-2019, 2021-2023).** This period often includes the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which can lead to lower trading volumes and potentially subdued volatility.
    -   **Base Rate:** Analysis of historical data for this specific calendar window shows a median maximum intraday VIX of approximately **22**. The 75th percentile is around **28**. Spikes above 30 are uncommon but not unprecedented, often tied to specific news events (e.g., sovereign debt concerns in the early 2010s).
    -   **Reasoning:** This class is highly specific to the calendar period, capturing seasonal effects like holiday trading.
    -   **Limitations:** The sample size is small (12 years), and the market structure has evolved, particularly with the growth of options-based strategies.

-   **Reference Class 2: Maximum Intraday VIX for any biweekly period in a moderate-to-high uncertainty environment.** This includes periods characterized by Federal Reserve policy shifts, slowing growth, or persistent inflation concerns, but excluding acute crises (e.g., March 2020, late 2008).
    -   **Base Rate:** The median maximum intraday VIX in these periods is higher, in the range of **25-30**. There is a significant right tail, with a ~25% chance of the maximum exceeding **35**.
    -   **Reasoning:** This class better reflects the macroeconomic conditions described in the provided sources for late 2025, rather than relying purely on seasonality.
    -   **Limitations:** Defining a "moderate-to-high uncertainty environment" is subjective and requires careful selection of historical analogues.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-10** VIX at 19.50, reflecting moderate unease ahead of key CPI data and bond auctions. (↑) — Establishes a higher-than-average starting point for volatility heading into the forecast period.
-   **2025-11-07** VIX spiked 25% to a two-week high on Fed comments casting doubt on a December rate cut and tech valuation concerns. (↑) — Demonstrates high market sensitivity to Fed communication and sector-specific risks.
-   **2025-11-05** Article highlights rising VIX due to geopolitical tensions, interest rate expectations, and tech sector concerns. (↑) — Confirms multiple, concurrent drivers are elevating investor caution.
-   **2025-07-15** J.P. Morgan's mid-year outlook anticipated increased macro volatility in H2 2025 from policy uncertainty and slower central bank easing. (↑) — This long-range forecast correctly anticipated the current environment of heightened uncertainty.
-   **2025-06-20** St. Louis Fed noted that policy uncertainty from the new presidential administration contributed to market volatility in early 2025. (↑) — Suggests that policy-related uncertainty remains a background risk factor for the market.
-   **2024-11-27** J.P. Morgan strategists predicted a subdued 2025 VIX (median 16) due to a large supply of short-dated volatility from quantitative strategies. (↓) — This structural factor may be acting as a persistent cap on VIX spikes, even if current events are pushing it higher.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Federal Reserve Communications & Policy:** Hawkish statements or data that delay expected rate cuts are the primary driver of uncertainty. A surprise comment or speech could cause a rapid spike. (Size: Large)
-   **Key Economic Data Releases:** The period may include releases like PCE inflation (the Fed's preferred measure) or early jobs data for November. A significant deviation from expectations, particularly an upside inflation surprise, would sharply increase volatility. (Size: Moderate to Large)
-   **Geopolitical Events:** Unforeseen escalations in existing global conflicts or new events can trigger a flight to safety, spiking the VIX. This is a constant, unpredictable risk. (Size: Large)
-   **Market Structure & Option Hedging:** The large supply of short-volatility products (as noted by JPM in 2024) can dampen VIX moves. However, a rapid market drop could force these strategies to unwind, creating a feedback loop that amplifies volatility (a "gamma squeeze"). (Size: Moderate, but Large if feedback loop triggers)
-   **Holiday Trading Liquidity:** Thin trading around Thanksgiving can either lead to quiet markets or, conversely, allow a smaller-than-usual event to cause an outsized price move due to a lack of counter-orders. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Elevated Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** Unlike a typical holiday period, late 2025 is characterized by a confluence of slowing GDP growth, persistent inflation, and high valuations, creating a more fragile market environment.
-   **Heightened Fed Policy Ambiguity:** The market is highly focused on a potential December rate cut. The recent Fed comments have injected significant doubt, making any related news or data release more impactful than in a period of clear Fed policy.
-   **Higher Starting VIX Level:** The VIX is entering this period around 19.5, already elevated compared to the low-to-mid teens often seen in quiet market phases. This provides a higher launchpad for a potential spike.
-   **Structural Volatility Supply:** The significant presence of option-selling ETFs and strategies, as highlighted by JPM, is a structural feature of the modern market that was less dominant in the early part of the reference class period. This may act as a suppressor on the VIX, keeping it from spiking as high as it might have otherwise.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior distribution for the maximum intraday VIX centered on the historical base rate (Reference Class 1), perhaps a Lognormal or Gamma distribution with a median around 22-24 and significant right skew. Equivalent n should be low-to-moderate, reflecting that seasonality provides a weak anchor in the current macro environment.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) Fed policy uncertainty is unusually high, with the market on a knife's edge regarding a December rate cut.
    -   (↑ Moderate) The broader macroeconomic backdrop (slowing growth, inflation) is more fragile than in a typical year.
    -   (↑ Small) The VIX is starting from an elevated level (~19.5), suggesting higher baseline anxiety.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Structural supply of volatility from systematic strategies may be dampening the VIX's reaction function.
    -   (↓/↑ Small) Holiday liquidity is a wildcard; it could suppress volatility or amplify a shock.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision from the seasonal base rate. The posterior distribution should be shifted to the right, centered in the high 20s (e.g., 27-30), with a thicker right tail to account for the increased probability of a spike above 35.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Hawkish Fedspeak from governors in the run-up to the December FOMC meeting.
    -   November CPI/PCE data (released late Nov/early Dec) coming in hotter than expected.
    -   A major negative pre-announcement from a bellwether company (e.g., in tech or retail).
    -   Any sudden escalation in geopolitical hotspots.
    -   A sharp, unexpected rise in credit spreads (e.g., CDX IG/HY).
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Dovish Fedspeak that puts a December rate cut firmly back on the table.
    -   Softer-than-expected inflation or labor market data.
    -   Stronger-than-expected Black Friday/Cyber Monday retail sales figures, easing growth concerns.
    -   A de-escalation of a key geopolitical tension.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Intraday Maximum vs. Closing Value:** The resolution is on the *intraday high*. This can be a fleeting, news-driven spike that occurs in minutes and is much harder to predict than the daily closing level.
-   **Holiday Liquidity Risk:** Low liquidity around Thanksgiving can create unpredictable market behavior. A small piece of news could be amplified, or the market could be unusually quiet. This dual nature makes it a key uncertainty.
-   **Source Timeliness:** The JPM analysis on structural volatility supply is from late 2024. While likely still relevant, the magnitude of this effect may have changed over the past year.
-   **"Unknown Unknowns":** The VIX is highly sensitive to sudden, unpredictable shocks (e.g., natural disasters, corporate defaults, geopolitical events) that are not captured in any economic model. A single such event would override all other factors.

Final Research Summary: The historical base rate for this holiday period suggests a maximum VIX in the low-to-mid 20s, but the current environment of high macroeconomic uncertainty and acute sensitivity to Fed policy points toward a significantly higher peak, likely in the high 20s or low 30s, with a notable risk of a spike towards 40 on a negative surprise.

To forecast the maximum intraday value of the VIX for the period from November 24 to December 5, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Maximum intraday VIX for the same biweekly period in non-crisis years (2010-2019, 2021-2023) shows a median of approximately 22, with the 75th percentile around 28.
   - **Reference Class 2:** Maximum intraday VIX for any biweekly period in a moderate-to-high uncertainty environment has a median of 25-30, with a ~25% chance of exceeding 35.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the current macroeconomic environment, Reference Class 2 is more appropriate. We will use a prior centered around 27-30 with a significant right skew.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current period shares characteristics with moderate-to-high uncertainty environments due to macroeconomic and policy factors.
   - **Differences:** The starting VIX level is higher than usual for this period, and there is heightened sensitivity to Fed policy, suggesting a higher potential for spikes.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Fed Policy Uncertainty (↑ Large):** Increases likelihood of higher VIX values.
   - **Macroeconomic Fragility (↑ Moderate):** Supports higher VIX values.
   - **Elevated Starting VIX (↑ Small):** Suggests a higher baseline.
   - **Volatility Supply (↓ Moderate):** Dampens potential spikes.
   - **Holiday Liquidity (↓/↑ Small):** Adds uncertainty, could amplify or suppress volatility.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Lognormal distribution with median ~27-30.
   - **Update:** Incorporate evidence, shifting the distribution rightward, increasing the mean and variance, and thickening the right tail.
   - **Posterior:** Centered in the high 20s to low 30s, with increased probability of exceeding 35.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider tail risks and alternative scenarios, such as geopolitical shocks or unexpected economic data.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with dovish Fed signals and subdued economic data could keep VIX lower, but current evidence supports a higher forecast.
   - **Adjustment:** Maintain a cautious approach, ensuring the distribution reflects potential for both high spikes and dampening effects.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution, the forecast percentiles are as follows:

P10: 24  
P20: 26  
P40: 28  
P60: 30  
P80: 34  
P90: 38

# Forecasting Maximum Intraday VIX Value for Nov 24 - Dec 5, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish my prior:

**Reference Class 1: Maximum Intraday VIX for late Nov/early Dec periods (2010-2023)**
- This captures the specific seasonal pattern around Thanksgiving
- Median maximum intraday VIX: ~22
- 75th percentile: ~28
- Distribution is right-skewed with occasional spikes above 30

**Reference Class 2: Maximum Intraday VIX during moderate-to-high uncertainty periods**
- Median: 25-30
- 75th percentile: ~35
- Right tail extends significantly higher

Given the current environment, I'll weight Reference Class 2 more heavily, creating a prior with:
- Median: ~26
- Shape: Right-skewed (lognormal-like)
- Significant probability mass in the 20-35 range, with a tail extending to 45+

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The period includes Thanksgiving, which typically has lower trading volumes
- The market follows similar structural patterns with options-driven mechanics
- The VIX remains responsive to the same fundamental drivers (Fed policy, economic data, geopolitics)

**Differences from base rate:**
- Current VIX is already elevated at 19.50, higher than typical starting points
- Heightened Fed policy uncertainty specifically around a potential December rate cut
- Recent 25% spike shows market is particularly sensitive to Fed communications
- Multiple concurrent risk factors (geopolitical tensions, interest rates, tech sector concerns)
- More developed options market with greater supply of short volatility products than in earlier years

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing distribution higher:**
- Recent 25% VIX spike on Fed comments (Strong evidence, +3-5 points to median)
- Current VIX already at 19.50 vs. typical teens level (Moderate evidence, +2-3 points)
- Multiple concurrent risk factors cited in recent articles (Moderate evidence, +2-3 points)
- J.P. Morgan's mid-year outlook anticipating increased H2 2025 volatility (Weak evidence, +1 point)
- St. Louis Fed noting policy uncertainty from new administration (Weak evidence, +1 point)

**Evidence pushing distribution lower:**
- J.P. Morgan strategists predicted subdued 2025 VIX (median 16) due to large supply of short-dated volatility (Moderate evidence, -2-3 points)
- Thanksgiving holiday period can reduce trading activity (Weak evidence, -1 point)

**Net likelihood ratio:** The evidence collectively suggests a distribution shifted higher than the base rate, with a likelihood ratio of approximately 2:1 favoring outcomes above the base rate median.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at ~26, I'll update based on the evidence:

- The strongest evidence is the recent 25% spike and elevated starting point, suggesting markets are primed for volatility
- The structural factors (volatility supply) provide some dampening effect
- The net update shifts my distribution rightward by ~3-4 points

**Posterior distribution:**
- Median: ~29-30
- Shape: Still right-skewed but with more mass in the 25-40 range
- P10-P90 range approximately 22-42

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent volatility that could mean-revert by late November
- The "holiday effect" might be stronger than I'm accounting for
- I haven't fully considered how a potential market rally could suppress volatility
- The structural dampening from volatility supply might be more powerful than historical data suggests

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would center the distribution lower (median ~24-25) based on:
- The holiday period typically seeing subdued trading
- The structural volatility supply creating a persistent cap
- Mean reversion from current elevated levels

**Tail risks:**
- Upside: A major geopolitical shock or Fed policy surprise could drive VIX above 45
- Downside: A clear Fed signal on December cuts plus positive economic data could suppress VIX below 20

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my distribution slightly downward to account for the holiday effect and structural dampening, but maintain a thick right tail for risk scenarios.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 22.5
P20: 24.8
P40: 28.3
P60: 31.7
P80: 36.5
P90: 41.2

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is the maximum intraday VIX for the same biweekly period (late November/early December) in previous years. This period includes the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which can affect trading volume and volatility. Analyzing historical data from 2010-2023 (excluding the acute COVID crisis year of 2020) for this specific calendar window yields a distribution with a median of approximately 21. This distribution is heavily right-skewed, with notable spikes to ~35 during periods of specific stress (e.g., the 2011 Eurozone crisis, the 2021 Omicron variant emergence). A secondary, more context-appropriate reference class is any biweekly period during a "moderate-to-high uncertainty environment," which suggests a higher median of 25-30. My prior will be a blend of these, starting with a median around 24 to account for both the seasonal tendency for lower volatility and the current high-uncertainty macro environment.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in late 2025 differs significantly from the average year in the seasonal reference class.
*   **Similarities:** The forecast period includes the Thanksgiving holiday, which typically involves lower market liquidity.
*   **Differences:** The macroeconomic backdrop is far more uncertain. The research report highlights persistent inflation, slowing growth, and, most critically, high uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's upcoming December interest rate decision. The VIX is also starting from a higher baseline (~19.5 on Nov 10) than in many historical low-volatility years, indicating elevated pre-existing anxiety. A structural difference is the increased prevalence of systematic volatility-selling strategies, which may act to dampen spikes compared to a decade ago.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update my prior based on several key pieces of evidence:
*   **(↑ Large) Fed Policy Uncertainty:** The market is described as highly sensitive to Fed communications regarding a potential December rate cut. This is the most significant factor pushing the forecast upward, as any data release (e.g., PCE inflation) or official comment during this period could trigger a sharp VIX move. This evidence makes a spike above 30 much more likely than the base rate suggests.
*   **(↑ Moderate) General Macroeconomic Fragility:** The combination of slowing growth, geopolitical tensions, and tech sector valuation concerns creates a fragile environment where shocks can have an amplified effect. This makes very low outcomes (e.g., a max VIX below 20) less likely.
*   **(↓ Moderate) Structural Volatility Supply:** A J.P. Morgan report from late 2024 noted a large supply of short-dated volatility from quantitative strategies. This acts as a persistent headwind against VIX spikes, potentially capping the peak of a volatility event. This evidence suggests the far-right tail of the distribution may be thinner than in past crises.
*   **(↔ Widens Variance) Holiday Liquidity:** Thin trading can either lead to a quiet market or amplify the price impact of a news event. I treat this not as a directional push, but as a factor that widens the overall distribution, increasing the probability of both lower-than-expected and higher-than-expected outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior distribution was centered around a median of 24. The evidence of acute Fed uncertainty and general macro fragility provides a strong upward update. This shifts the median of my posterior distribution significantly higher, into the high 20s. The evidence of structural volatility supply provides a counterweight, primarily by tempering the extreme right tail (e.g., making a spike to 50 less probable than it might have been in 2011). The net effect is a posterior distribution with a median around 28, a truncated left tail (as a quiet period is unlikely), and a fat right tail representing the significant risk of a spike into the 30s.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider potential blind spots.
*   **Overestimation of Volatility:** The market may have already priced in the Fed uncertainty. The Thanksgiving holiday could simply be quiet, with no major catalysts, causing the VIX to drift sideways. In this scenario, the maximum VIX might struggle to exceed 25. My distribution accounts for this, with roughly a 30-40% chance of the peak being below 26.
*   **Underestimation of Tail Risk:** Conversely, the combination of a major negative surprise (e.g., a hot inflation report) and low holiday liquidity is a recipe for a "gamma squeeze," where volatility-selling strategies are forced to rapidly buy back their hedges, amplifying the VIX spike. The fact that the question resolves on the *intraday* maximum makes such a flash spike highly relevant. This justifies keeping a thick right tail, with a non-trivial chance of exceeding 35.
*   **Structural Dampening is Overstated:** The effect of vol-selling strategies might be less potent than assumed, or they could become the source of instability in a true panic.

Balancing these risks, my proposed distribution seems reasonable. It is centered on a significantly elevated level of volatility but avoids predicting an extreme crisis-level spike, while still acknowledging it as a tail risk.
