### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   **Virginia:**
        *   How strong and reliable is the historical pattern of Virginia electing a governor from the party opposite the U.S. President? What were the conditions during the one exception?
        *   What are the political profiles and relative strengths/weaknesses of Abigail Spanberger (D) and Winsome Earle-Sears (R)?
        *   What is the current political environment in Virginia, including the approval of outgoing Governor Glenn Youngkin (R) and key voter issues?
        *   What do current polls and non-polling forecasts (e.g., Cook Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball) indicate?
    *   **New Jersey:**
        *   What is the base rate for Democratic gubernatorial wins in New Jersey, particularly in open-seat elections?
        *   What factors contributed to Jack Ciattarelli's (R) unexpectedly strong performance in 2021, and are those factors still present?
        *   What are the political profiles and relative strengths/weaknesses of Mikie Sherrill (D) and Jack Ciattarelli (R)?
        *   What is the current political environment in New Jersey, including the approval of outgoing Governor Phil Murphy (D) and key voter issues (e.g., property taxes)?
        *   What do current polls and non-polling forecasts indicate?
    *   **Combined/National:**
        *   What is the national political environment (e.g., Presidential approval, generic ballot)? How does this typically influence off-year gubernatorial races?
        *   How correlated are the outcomes of these two races likely to be?

2.  **Propose Search Queries:**
    *   `"Virginia gubernatorial election results vs presidential party since 1977"`
    *   `"Terry McAuliffe 2013 Virginia governor election analysis"`
    *   `"Abigail Spanberger vs Winsome Earle-Sears polling 2025"`
    *   `"Cook Political Report 2025 Virginia governor rating"`
    *   `"Abigail Spanberger fundraising reports 2025"`
    *   `"Winsome Earle-Sears policy positions"`
    *   `"New Jersey gubernatorial election results since 2000"`
    *   `"Mikie Sherrill vs Jack Ciattarelli polling 2025"`
    *   `"analysis of 2021 New Jersey governor election results"`
    *   `"Jack Ciattarelli 2021 vs 2025 campaign strategy"`
    *   `"Sabato's Crystal Ball 2025 New Jersey governor rating"`
    *   `"Presidential approval rating October 2025"`
    *   `"generic congressional ballot October 2025"`

3.  **Synthesize Key Findings:**
    *   **Virginia:** The "opposite party" trend is exceptionally strong (11 of the last 12 elections). The 2013 exception (McAuliffe-D win under Obama-D) featured a particularly weak and scandal-plagued GOP candidate (Ken Cuccinelli). The current background implies a Republican president was elected in 2024, making this trend a powerful tailwind for Spanberger. Spanberger has a moderate profile from a competitive congressional district, which is a strong fit for a statewide candidate. Earle-Sears is the sitting LG but is more closely aligned with the conservative base, which could be a liability in populous, moderate Northern Virginia. Polling confirms a Spanberger lead.
    *   **New Jersey:** The state is fundamentally blue, but voters have shown a willingness to elect Republican governors (Christie, Whitman), often as a check on the Democratic-controlled legislature, especially on fiscal issues. Ciattarelli's 2021 near-win was fueled by suburban dissatisfaction with Murphy on taxes and COVID-19 policies, in a national environment that favored Republicans. Ciattarelli is a known quantity and a strong campaigner. Sherrill, like Spanberger, has a strong profile for a modern Democrat (veteran, former prosecutor) from a key suburban district. Polling gives Sherrill the edge, but it's likely to be closer than a generic D vs. R race.
    *   **National:** The national environment is the key correlated variable. An unpopular Republican president would create strong headwinds for both Earle-Sears and Ciattarelli. A popular one could make both races highly competitive. Given the post-presidential election timing, these races are often the first major test of the new administration.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Virginia's "Opposite Party" Rule:** In the 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections since 1977, the party not holding the White House has won 11 times (~92%). The single exception was in 2013. Assuming a Republican won the 2024 presidential election, this historical pattern creates a very strong base rate in favor of a Democratic victory. The small sample size (n=12) is a limitation, but the consistency is remarkable.
*   **Modern New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections:** Since 2001, there have been six gubernatorial elections in New Jersey. Democrats have won four (67%). In the two open-seat races during this period, the result is split 1-1 (Democrat Jon Corzine in 2005, Republican Chris Christie in 2009). This suggests a ~60-70% base rate for a Democratic win, but with significant variance in open-seat contests.
*   **Off-Year Gubernatorial Elections in Politically-Aligned States:** In off-year elections, the party aligned with the state's presidential leanings (NJ is blue, VA is purple-to-blue) typically wins, unless strong countervailing forces are present (e.g., a very unpopular incumbent or a national wave). This provides a general prior favoring the Democrats in NJ and a slight edge in VA, independent of the "opposite party" rule.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)

To forecast the outcomes of the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Virginia:** Historically, Virginia has elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting U.S. President in 11 of the last 12 elections (~92%). Assuming a Republican president was elected in 2024, this creates a strong base rate favoring a Democratic victory.
- **New Jersey:** Democrats have won four of the last six gubernatorial elections (~67%). However, open-seat races have been split, suggesting a base rate of ~60-70% for a Democratic win.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Virginia:** The current situation aligns with the historical pattern, as Spanberger is a Democrat running in a state that typically elects a governor from the opposite party of the president. The difference is that Spanberger is a moderate candidate with a strong profile, which could enhance her chances.
- **New Jersey:** Although New Jersey is a blue state, Ciattarelli's strong performance in 2021 and the state's history of electing Republican governors suggest a competitive race. Sherrill's moderate profile and current polling advantage align with the base rate but indicate a closer race.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Virginia:**
  - **Spanberger's Polling Lead:** Likely if Spanberger is to win (P(E | H) high), less likely if she is not (P(E | ~H) low).
  - **Historical Pattern:** Strong evidence for a Democratic win (P(E | H) high).
  - **Spanberger's Debate Performance and Endorsements:** Increase likelihood of her winning (P(E | H) high).
  
- **New Jersey:**
  - **Sherrill's Polling Edge:** Likely if Sherrill is to win (P(E | H) high), less likely if not (P(E | ~H) low).
  - **Ciattarelli's Known Strengths:** Suggests a competitive race, reducing certainty of a Democratic win (P(E | H) moderate).
  - **Fundraising Advantage for Sherrill:** Supports a Democratic win (P(E | H) high).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Virginia:** Start with a prior of 92% for a Democratic win. The polling lead, debate performance, and endorsements further increase this probability. Posterior probability for Spanberger winning is very high.
- **New Jersey:** Start with a prior of 67% for a Democratic win. Sherrill's polling lead and fundraising advantage increase this probability, but Ciattarelli's strengths and the state's history of electing Republican governors in open-seat races temper this increase. Posterior probability for Sherrill winning is moderate to high.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Virginia:** Consider the possibility of polling errors or a late surge for Earle-Sears. However, the historical pattern and current evidence strongly favor Spanberger.
- **New Jersey:** Acknowledge the potential for a Republican upset given Ciattarelli's strengths and the state's history. Adjust probabilities to reflect this risk.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Both elections: 70%  
Only Virginia: 20%  
Only New Jersey: 5%  
Neither election: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the strong likelihood of Democratic wins in both states, with Virginia being more certain than New Jersey.

# Forecasting the 2025 Virginia and New Jersey Gubernatorial Elections

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Option: Both elections**
- Virginia base rate: 92% chance of electing a governor from the opposite party of the President (11/12 since 1977). Assuming a Republican president in 2025, this strongly favors the Democrat.
- New Jersey base rate: Democrats have won 4/6 (67%) gubernatorial elections since 2001.
- Combined prior: 0.92 × 0.67 = 0.62 or 62%

**Option: Only Virginia**
- Virginia favors Democrat (92%) × New Jersey favors Republican (33%) = 0.92 × 0.33 = 0.30 or 30%

**Option: Only New Jersey**
- Virginia favors Republican (8%) × New Jersey favors Democrat (67%) = 0.08 × 0.67 = 0.05 or 5%

**Option: Neither election**
- Virginia favors Republican (8%) × New Jersey favors Republican (33%) = 0.08 × 0.33 = 0.03 or 3%

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Virginia's "opposite party" pattern remains remarkably consistent over decades
- New Jersey maintains its Democratic-leaning status in statewide elections
- Both states have open seats (term-limited incumbents) which matches our reference classes

**Differences from base rate scenarios:**
- Virginia: Spanberger has a particularly strong profile as a moderate Democrat from a competitive district, potentially stronger than typical Democratic candidates
- New Jersey: Ciattarelli nearly won in 2021 (48%), suggesting he's a stronger-than-average Republican for NJ
- The specific national environment in 2025 may differ from historical averages

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Virginia evidence:**
- Polling shows Spanberger leading (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.8, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.2)
- Spanberger's debate performance was strong (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.7, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.4)
- Spanberger has a fundraising advantage (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.7, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.4)
- Major newspaper endorsement for Spanberger (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.6, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.3)

**New Jersey evidence:**
- Polling shows Sherrill leading but by less margin than in Virginia (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.7, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.3)
- Ciattarelli's strong 2021 performance (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.4, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.8)
- Sherrill's fundraising advantage (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.7, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.4)
- Debate was a draw (P(E|Dem wins) = 0.5, P(E|Dem loses) = 0.5)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Virginia update based on polling:**
- Prior odds: 92:8 = 11.5:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 11.5 × 4 = 46:1
- Posterior probability: 46/(46+1) = 0.979 or ~98%

After incorporating all Virginia evidence (debate performance, fundraising, endorsement), I estimate the Democrat's chance in Virginia at approximately 95%.

**New Jersey update based on polling:**
- Prior odds: 67:33 = 2.03:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 2.03 × 2.33 = 4.73:1
- Posterior probability: 4.73/(4.73+1) = 0.825 or ~83%

After incorporating Ciattarelli's 2021 performance (negative factor for Democrats), fundraising (positive), and the neutral debate, I estimate the Democrat's chance in New Jersey at approximately 75%.

**Combined probabilities:**
- Both elections: 0.95 × 0.75 = 0.7125 or ~71%
- Only Virginia: 0.95 × 0.25 = 0.2375 or ~24%
- Only New Jersey: 0.05 × 0.75 = 0.0375 or ~4%
- Neither election: 0.05 × 0.25 = 0.0125 or ~1%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting Virginia's "opposite party" pattern, which could break if national conditions are unusual
- Late campaign developments could shift either race significantly
- Turnout patterns in off-year elections can be volatile and hard to predict
- Correlation between the races may be higher than I've modeled if there's a strong national environment

**Alternative scenarios:**
- If there's a late Republican surge nationally, both races could tighten significantly
- Ciattarelli's experience from 2021 might make him more effective than typical challengers
- Earle-Sears could benefit from being a historic candidate (first Black woman elected LG in Virginia)

**Adjustments:**
- Reduce Virginia Democrat probability slightly to account for potential pattern-breaking (95% → 92%)
- Increase correlation between races, which slightly reduces "Only Virginia" and "Only New Jersey" probabilities
- Increase "Neither election" probability slightly to account for potential systematic polling errors

## 6. Final Normalization

After adjustments:
- Both elections: 68%
- Only Virginia: 23%
- Only New Jersey: 5%
- Neither election: 4%
- Sum: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Both elections: 68%  
Only Virginia: 23%  
Only New Jersey: 5%  
Neither election: 4%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

First, I will establish individual base rates for a Democratic win in each state, assuming the races are independent.

*   **Virginia:** The most relevant base rate is the "Virginia Rule," where the party not holding the White House wins the governorship. The background text notes this has happened in 11 of the last 12 elections (since 1977). The text also implies a Republican won the 2024 presidential election ("bodes well for Spanberger"). This creates a very strong prior probability.
    *   **P(D win VA) ≈ 11/12 ≈ 92%**. Given the small sample size, I will start with a slightly more conservative prior of **P(D win VA) = 85%**.

*   **New Jersey:** New Jersey is a blue-leaning state. In the six gubernatorial elections since 2001, Democrats have won four (67%). This serves as a reasonable starting point.
    *   **P(D win NJ) ≈ 4/6 ≈ 67%**. I will use a prior of **P(D win NJ) = 65%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Virginia:** The current case is very similar to the base rate scenario: an off-year, open-seat election where the electorate can register its opinion on the new presidential administration. The one exception to the rule (2013) involved a uniquely weak Republican candidate. While the current Republican, Winsome Earle-Sears, is the sitting Lieutenant Governor, the research notes she is more aligned with the conservative base than the popular outgoing Governor Youngkin, which could be a liability in a general election. The Democratic candidate, Abigail Spanberger, has a moderate profile well-suited for a statewide race. These factors align well with the historical base rate.

*   **New Jersey:** The state's blue lean is the base case. However, the Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, is a significant differentiating factor. He is not a generic Republican; he came within 2 points of winning in 2021 against an incumbent. This demonstrates his strength as a candidate. The key difference from 2021 is the national environment. The 2021 election occurred under a Democratic president (a headwind for NJ Democrats), while the 2025 election is assumed to be under a Republican president (a tailwind for NJ Democrats). This environmental shift is a major factor pushing the situation back towards the Democratic-favoring base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will assess the probability of the evidence given a Democratic win (H) versus a Republican win (~H).

*   **Evidence 1: National Environment (assumed GOP President):** This is a powerful tailwind for Democrats in both states. P(GOP President | D wins in VA/NJ) is much higher than P(GOP President | R wins in VA/NJ). This strongly reinforces the priors.

*   **Evidence 2: Candidate Quality:**
    *   In Virginia, Spanberger's moderate profile from a competitive district is a strong asset. P(Strong D candidate | D win) > P(Strong D candidate | R win).
    *   In New Jersey, both candidates are strong. Sherrill has a compelling background, and Ciattarelli is a proven vote-getter. This evidence is more neutral but Ciattarelli's proven strength slightly lowers the likelihood of a Democratic win compared to a generic opponent.

*   **Evidence 3: Polling:** The background states Democrats are leading in the polls in *both* states. This is strong evidence. P(D leads in polls | D win) >> P(D leads in polls | R win).

*   **Evidence 4: Recent Events (from research):** The research report indicates Democratic candidates have stronger debate performances (in VA), significant fundraising advantages (in both), and key endorsements (in VA). This evidence consistently favors the Democrats.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will first update my individual probabilities for each state and then combine them, accounting for correlation.

*   **Virginia:** The initial prior was P(D win VA) = 85%. The evidence (strong candidate, polling lead, fundraising advantage) all strongly supports this prior. The main counterpoint is that Virginia can be competitive (as seen in 2021). To account for this inherent electoral uncertainty, I will slightly temper my confidence.
    *   **Final marginal probability: P(D win VA) = 80%**

*   **New Jersey:** The initial prior was P(D win NJ) = 65%. Ciattarelli's proven strength in 2021 is a major factor that pulls this probability down. However, the reversal of the national environment from a Republican tailwind in 2021 to a Democratic tailwind in 2025 is a powerful counterforce. Combined with Sherrill's polling and fundraising leads, the evidence pushes the probability back up.
    *   **Final marginal probability: P(D win NJ) = 65%**

**Combining Probabilities (with Correlation):** The outcomes are positively correlated due to the shared national environment. A very unpopular GOP president would boost Democrats in both states, while a popular one would help Republicans in both. Assuming independence would underestimate the "Both" and "Neither" scenarios.

*   P(D win VA) = 0.80
*   P(D win NJ) = 0.65

Calculating the four outcomes while accounting for positive correlation (as modeled in the thought process):
*   **P(Both) = P(D win VA) * P(D win NJ) + correlation_factor**
*   **P(Neither) = P(R win VA) * P(R win NJ) + correlation_factor**
*   The split outcomes ("Only VA", "Only NJ") will be less likely than in a simple independent calculation.

Based on a simple two-state correlation model, the updated probabilities are:
*   **Both elections:** ~54%
*   **Only Virginia:** ~26%
*   **Only New Jersey:** ~12%
*   **Neither election:** ~8%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast hinges heavily on the assumption of a Republican president and the historical patterns of off-year elections. The biggest risk is that state-specific issues or candidate performance overwhelm the national trend. For instance, Ciattarelli's 2021 near-miss shows he can significantly outperform expectations in New Jersey. In Virginia, Earle-Sears is an incumbent statewide officeholder, which should not be underestimated. My downward adjustment of the initial probabilities (from 85/70 to 80/65) is an attempt to account for this uncertainty and avoid overconfidence in the historical trends. The resulting 8% chance of Republicans winning both races feels like a plausible "upset" scenario.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities have been calculated and adjusted to sum to 100%.

*   Both elections: 54%
*   Only Virginia: 26%
*   Only New Jersey: 12%
*   Neither election: 8%
*   **Total: 100%**

The distribution reflects that a Democratic win in Virginia is more certain than in New Jersey (P(Only VA) > P(Only NJ)), and that the most likely single outcome is Democrats winning both races due to a favorable national environment.
