### Reference class & base rates
-   **Post-Cold War Major Nuclear Reduction Treaties (US-Russia):** Since the end of the Cold War (~1991), there have been three major bilateral treaties that resulted in agreed-upon stockpile reductions: START I (signed 1991), SORT/Moscow Treaty (signed 2002), and New START (signed 2010). This suggests a base rate of roughly one major reduction treaty per decade. The probability of such a complex treaty being finalized in a specific 3-month window is extremely low, likely **<1%**.
-   **Inclusion of a Third Major Nuclear Power in Reduction Treaties:** There is no historical precedent for a trilateral nuclear arms reduction treaty involving the US, Russia, and China. China has consistently refused to join bilateral US-Russia frameworks, citing the vast disparity in arsenal size. The base rate for this class of event is **0%**.
-   **Last-Minute Arms Control Extensions:** Major powers sometimes agree to extend existing treaties shortly before expiration to avoid a strategic vacuum. New START itself was extended in the final days of the Trump administration and the first days of the Biden administration in 2021. This is a more common event, but an *extension* of current limits does not meet the resolution criteria of a *decrease*.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-06] Kremlin welcomes Trump's comments on extending New START for one year. — ↓ — Signals that the focus of high-level discussion is on a simple extension to maintain the status quo, not on negotiating new, lower limits.
-   [2025-10-01] Russia proposes observing New START limits for one year post-expiration. — ↓ — This is a unilateral/reciprocal offer to freeze, not a mutual agreement to decrease. It lowers the urgency for a new, complex reduction treaty.
-   [2025-08-25] Analysis highlights Russian suspension of New START participation post-Ukraine war. — ↓ — The underlying geopolitical tensions that caused the suspension remain, making the trust required for a new reduction treaty exceptionally low.
-   [2025-02-13] Trump administration expresses intent to engage Russia and China on limiting arsenals. — ↑ — High-level political will is a prerequisite for any agreement. However, this statement is nine months old and has been superseded by talks of a simple extension.
-   [2025-01-01] Report notes China's continued resistance to arms control talks. — ↓ — Reinforces the high barrier to any trilateral agreement, a key pathway mentioned by the US administration.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Geopolitical Tensions (US-Russia/US-China):** High tensions, particularly related to the war in Ukraine, severely erode the political trust and diplomatic capital needed for complex negotiations on national security. This is the primary driver against an agreement. (Large ↓)
-   **Technical and Bureaucratic Inertia:** Negotiating, drafting, and ratifying a new arms control treaty is a multi-year process involving technical experts, lawyers, and legislators. The <3 month timeline to resolution makes a new, formal agreement to decrease stockpiles nearly impossible. (Large ↓)
-   **China's Strategic Calculus:** China is in the midst of a significant nuclear modernization and expansion program. It perceives its arsenal as a minimum deterrent and has no strategic incentive to agree to decreases while it is still building up to what it considers peer status. (Large ↓)
-   **Fear of a Strategic Vacuum:** The looming expiration of New START (Feb 2026) creates pressure to act. However, this pressure is channeled towards the simplest solution: a short-term extension or informal freeze, not a complex new reduction treaty. This makes the resolution of "NO" more likely. (Moderate ↓)
-   **Presidential Summitry/Initiative:** A sudden, high-stakes summit between leaders (e.g., Trump and Putin) could theoretically produce a breakthrough political agreement. However, turning this into a formal, verifiable agreement to *decrease* stockpiles in weeks is a monumental task. (Small ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Tripolar vs. Bipolar Dynamics:** Unlike the Cold War and post-Cold War eras where negotiations were bilateral (US-Russia), the current US objective of including China fundamentally changes the negotiation landscape, adding complexity that has no historical precedent for success.
-   **Active Major Power Conflict:** Previous successful treaties were negotiated in periods of relative détente. The current context includes Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, which has led to the suspension of New START inspections and communication, creating an environment of deep hostility.
-   **Extremely Compressed Timeline:** The question resolves before 2026, leaving less than three months. Historical reduction treaties took years to negotiate. The current discussions (per the sources) are focused on stopgap measures (one-year extensions), not new treaties.
-   **Nature of the "Ask":** The resolution requires a *decrease*, not a freeze or extension. The current diplomatic chatter is entirely focused on the latter, which is a far lower bar to clear but does not satisfy the resolution criteria.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A very low prior, perhaps 2-5%, is warranted, derived from a base rate of ~0 successful major reduction treaties being concluded in any given 3-month window. (Equivalent n: low, e.g., 20).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   Recent high-level US-Russia talks explicitly focus on a one-year *extension* of New START, not a reduction. (↓ Large)
    -   The geopolitical environment remains exceptionally hostile due to the war in Ukraine, crippling the trust needed for such a deal. (↓ Large)
    -   The timeline to resolution (<3 months) is insufficient for the technical and political work required for a new treaty. (↓ Large)
    -   China remains steadfast in its refusal to join trilateral talks, eliminating one of the two possible pairings for an agreement. (↓ Moderate)
    -   Stated interest from President Trump provides a slight counterweight, but actions and context point elsewhere. (↑ Small)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the low prior. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward, approaching a floor near 0%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Announcement of an emergency, in-person summit between any two of the three leaders with "strategic arms reductions" explicitly on the agenda.
    -   A joint statement from any two parties announcing a "new framework for strategic stability" that includes lower numbers.
    -   Leaked reports of secret back-channel negotiations that have been ongoing for months.
    -   A sudden, major de-escalation in the war in Ukraine.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A formal joint announcement by the US and Russia that they will extend New START for one year.
    -   Public statements from senior officials (e.g., US National Security Advisor, Russian Foreign Minister) describing a reduction treaty as "unrealistic" in the current environment.
    -   Further escalation of rhetoric or military posturing between the US, Russia, or China.
    -   Official Chinese statement reiterating its refusal to negotiate as long as US/Russian arsenals are vastly larger.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The term "agreement to decrease" could be exploited. A non-binding political declaration or a re-categorization of systems could be argued to meet the criteria, though this is unlikely. The resolution likely requires a formal, signed agreement.
-   **"October Surprise" Risk:** The short timeline and political context (fictional Trump presidency) could incentivize a dramatic, unexpected foreign policy announcement. However, the substance of such an announcement is more likely to be symbolic than a verifiable reduction treaty.
-   **Information Asymmetry:** The most critical negotiations would occur in secret. Public sources may not reflect the true state of play until a deal is announced, though the lack of preparatory work by lower-level officials would be a telling sign.
-   **Misinterpretation of "Extension":** The most likely outcome is some form of extension or agreement to observe existing limits. It is critical to remember this resolves to NO. The core of the question is the *decrease*.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a new agreement to decrease nuclear stockpiles before 2026 is exceptionally low. The combination of a historically unprecedented trilateral dynamic, severe geopolitical tensions, an impossibly short timeline, and diplomatic efforts focused on a simple extension of current limits creates overwhelming obstacles.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a major nuclear reduction treaty involving the US and Russia is approximately one per decade since the end of the Cold War. However, there is no historical precedent for a trilateral treaty involving China. Therefore, the base rate for such an event is effectively 0%. Given the complexity and lack of precedent, a prior probability of around 2-5% is reasonable for any new agreement to decrease stockpiles before 2026.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The US and Russia have historically engaged in bilateral arms reduction treaties. Current discussions involve high-level political interest, which is a necessary precursor to any agreement.
   - Differences: The inclusion of China adds unprecedented complexity. The geopolitical environment is hostile, with ongoing conflicts and tensions, particularly involving Russia. The timeline is extremely compressed, with less than three months remaining.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent US-Russia talks focus on extending New START, not reducing stockpiles. This decreases the probability of a new reduction agreement (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Large).
   - Geopolitical tensions, especially due to the Ukraine conflict, make trust and cooperation unlikely (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Large).
   - The short timeline is insufficient for negotiating a new treaty (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Large).
   - China's refusal to join trilateral talks further decreases the likelihood (Likelihood ratio: ↓ Moderate).
   - Trump's stated interest in engaging Russia and China provides a slight increase, but is outweighed by other factors (Likelihood ratio: ↑ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior probability: 3% (odds: 3/97)
   - Given the strong negative evidence, the likelihood ratios significantly decrease the probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (combined effect is strongly negative)
   - Posterior probability is adjusted downward, approaching a floor near 0%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis might underestimate the potential for a dramatic political move or misinterpret the resolution criteria.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden de-escalation in geopolitical tensions or a breakthrough summit could change the dynamics, but this remains unlikely.
   - Adjustments: Given the overwhelming evidence against a new treaty, the probability remains very low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unforeseen developments, the final probability is set at a very low level.

Final: 1%

# Will at least two of the United States, Russia or China mutually agree to decrease their nuclear stockpiles before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for major nuclear powers agreeing to decrease their stockpiles within a short timeframe (less than 3 months from now until the end of 2025).

Looking at historical precedents:
- Since 1991, there have been three major bilateral treaties resulting in stockpile reductions: START I (1991), SORT/Moscow Treaty (2002), and New START (2010)
- This suggests approximately one major reduction treaty per decade
- There is no historical precedent for a trilateral agreement including China
- The timeline for negotiating and finalizing such agreements typically spans years, not months

Given these factors, a reasonable base rate would be extremely low - perhaps 2-3% for any agreement to decrease stockpiles materializing in a specific 3-month window.

**Prior probability: 3%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The New START treaty is approaching expiration (February 2026), creating a natural decision point
- There is stated high-level interest from the US in engaging with Russia and China on nuclear limitations
- Previous treaties have often been negotiated around expiration deadlines

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented geopolitical tensions due to the ongoing Ukraine conflict
- Russia has suspended participation in New START inspections and communication channels
- China has consistently refused to join nuclear reduction frameworks
- The extremely compressed timeline (less than 3 months) is far shorter than typical negotiation periods
- Current diplomatic discussions focus on extensions/freezes, not reductions
- The tripolar dynamic (attempting to include China) has no successful historical precedent

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent US-Russia talks focus on extension, not reduction**
- P(E|H): If a reduction agreement were imminent, extension talks would likely be superseded by reduction negotiations = 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no reduction agreement is coming, extension talks would be the logical focus = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Russia's proposal to observe New START limits for one year post-expiration**
- P(E|H): If reduction agreement were coming, Russia would likely focus on that instead = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If no reduction agreement is coming, this stopgap measure makes sense = 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 3: China's continued resistance to arms control talks**
- P(E|H): If China were about to join a reduction agreement, we'd see signals of softening = 0.1
- P(E|~H): If China remains opposed to joining, this is exactly what we'd expect = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.95 = 0.105 (very strong evidence against)

**Evidence 4: Trump administration's stated intent to engage Russia and China**
- P(E|H): If a reduction agreement were coming, we'd expect such statements = 0.9
- P(E|~H): Even without an imminent agreement, such statements are common = 0.6
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.6 = 1.5 (weak evidence for)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3/97 = 0.031

First update (US-Russia extension talks):
Posterior odds = 0.031 × 0.22 = 0.0068
Posterior probability = 0.0068/(1+0.0068) = 0.0068/1.0068 = 0.0067 or 0.67%

Second update (Russia's one-year proposal):
Posterior odds = 0.0068 × 0.375 = 0.00255
Posterior probability = 0.00255/(1+0.00255) = 0.00255/1.00255 = 0.0025 or 0.25%

Third update (China's resistance):
Posterior odds = 0.00255 × 0.105 = 0.00027
Posterior probability = 0.00027/(1+0.00027) = 0.00027/1.00027 = 0.00027 or 0.027%

Fourth update (Trump's stated intent):
Posterior odds = 0.00027 × 1.5 = 0.0004
Posterior probability = 0.0004/(1+0.0004) = 0.0004/1.0004 = 0.0004 or 0.04%

This extremely low probability reflects the overwhelming evidence against an agreement to decrease stockpiles before 2026.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a surprise diplomatic breakthrough
- Secret negotiations could be occurring that aren't reflected in public sources
- A symbolic or limited reduction agreement could be easier to achieve than a comprehensive treaty
- The Trump administration might prioritize a foreign policy "win" before year-end

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A bilateral US-Russia agreement could emerge as a confidence-building measure to restart broader talks
- A crisis could prompt emergency diplomacy leading to a quick agreement
- China might reconsider its position if offered significant concessions

However, even accounting for these possibilities, the timeline remains extremely compressed, and the technical/verification work required for a reduction agreement (as opposed to a simple extension) is substantial.

Given these considerations, I should adjust my estimate slightly upward to account for low-probability but plausible scenarios, but the probability remains very low.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of at least two of the United States, Russia, or China mutually agreeing to decrease their nuclear stockpiles before 2026 is extremely low.

The overwhelming evidence points to, at most, an extension of current limits rather than a new agreement to decrease stockpiles. The compressed timeline, geopolitical tensions, and China's consistent refusal to participate make a new reduction agreement highly improbable.

Final: 1%

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The appropriate reference class is the frequency of major nuclear arms reduction treaties between great powers. Since the end of the Cold War (~1991), the United States and Russia have signed three such treaties: START I (1991), SORT (2002), and New START (2010). This equates to roughly one major reduction treaty per decade.

The question asks for the probability of such an event occurring within a specific, short timeframe (October 7, 2025, to December 31, 2025, i.e., less than three months). A simple base rate calculation, assuming treaties are signed at random times, would be (3 months / 120 months per decade) ≈ 2.5%.

However, this period is not random; it immediately precedes the expiration of the New START treaty in February 2026, which acts as an action-forcing event. This might slightly increase the probability of *some* action compared to a random 3-month window. Conversely, there is no historical precedent for a trilateral (US-Russia-China) reduction treaty, making the base rate for that specific outcome 0%.

Given these factors, a generous initial prior probability P(H) for a new reduction agreement being finalized in this window is **3%**. This corresponds to prior odds of approximately 1:32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation differs critically from the historical periods when previous treaties were signed:

*   **Geopolitical Hostility:** The relationship between the US and Russia is at a post-Cold War nadir, primarily due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Russia has suspended its participation in New START verification and inspections. This contrasts sharply with the periods of relative détente or "resets" that facilitated past agreements. The level of trust required for a new reduction treaty is absent.
*   **Negotiation Complexity:** The stated US goal of including China adds a layer of complexity that has no successful precedent. China is expanding its arsenal and has consistently rejected trilateral talks, making this path a near-impossibility.
*   **Compressed Timeline:** Major arms control treaties are the result of years of technical and political negotiations. The sub-3-month window to resolution is insufficient to negotiate, draft, and agree upon a new treaty from the current state of affairs.
*   **Alternative Outcomes:** The diplomatic focus, as reported, is on a simple one-year extension of New START or a reciprocal freeze. This is a much simpler, more plausible outcome that serves the immediate goal of preventing a strategic vacuum. This alternative directly competes with the more difficult path of negotiating new reductions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that "at least two of the US, Russia, or China will mutually agree to decrease their nuclear stockpiles before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Diplomatic discussions are focused on a one-year extension of New START, not new reductions.**
    *   P(E | H): The likelihood of public discourse focusing on an extension if a secret reduction deal were imminent is very low. An extension is the off-ramp from failed or stalled negotiations for reductions.
    *   P(E | ~H): The likelihood of this focus if no reduction deal is reached is very high. The extension is the most probable alternative.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The extremely hostile US-Russia relationship, including Russia's suspension of New START participation.**
    *   P(E | H): It is extremely unlikely that two nations would agree to new, verifiable cuts to their most sensitive weapons while in a state of deep mutual distrust and suspended cooperation.
    *   P(E | ~H): This hostility is a primary cause for the failure to negotiate a new treaty.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) << 1.** This evidence also strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The sub-3-month timeline.**
    *   P(E | H): A successful agreement in this timeframe is historically unprecedented and would require a nearly complete secret deal to already be in place, for which there is no evidence.
    *   P(E | ~H): The lack of time is a major reason why an agreement is unlikely to be reached.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) << 1.** This evidence also strongly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 1:32 (3% probability), we update with the evidence. The combined likelihood ratio of the evidence is overwhelmingly negative.

Let's perform a conceptual update using the strongest piece of evidence: the diplomatic focus on a simple extension. Let's estimate its likelihood ratio is approximately 1/10 (i.e., it's 10 times more likely that talks would focus on an extension if no reduction deal is happening than if one is).

*   **Posterior Odds** = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
*   **Posterior Odds** ≈ (1/32) × (1/10) = 1/320

A probability corresponding to 1/320 odds is approximately 0.3%. The other powerful negative evidence (hostility, timeline) would push this probability even lower, towards a floor near zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

The strongest argument for a "YES" resolution involves a low-probability "October surprise" scenario. An unconventional leader like President Trump might seek a dramatic foreign policy achievement by convening a last-minute summit with President Putin. In this scenario, they could bypass their bureaucracies and announce a surprise political agreement to make token reductions. The goal would be the headline, not the substance.

However, this scenario faces significant obstacles. Arms control is a technically complex field where verification is paramount. A purely political declaration without a clear implementation and verification framework would be met with immense skepticism and resistance from the national security establishments in both countries. Furthermore, the current diplomatic signals point strongly toward the much safer and more pragmatic option of a simple extension. While the "surprise" scenario cannot be entirely ruled out, its probability is extremely low. It serves to keep the forecast from being 0%, but it does not significantly alter the conclusion.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate of 3% is dramatically reduced by the overwhelming evidence. The geopolitical climate is exceptionally poor, the timeline is pragmatically impossible for a standard treaty, and the observable diplomatic efforts are directed at an outcome (extension) that resolves to NO. The only plausible, albeit remote, path to a YES resolution is a highly unconventional, last-minute political deal, which remains a tail risk. The evidence strongly suggests the final probability is very close to zero. I will set the forecast at 1% to account for the small possibility of an unpredictable political event.

Final: 1%
