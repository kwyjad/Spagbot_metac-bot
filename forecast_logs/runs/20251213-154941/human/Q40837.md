### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical base rate for snow days in NYC during the specific period of December 11 - January 10?** This involves analyzing the provided 10-year data and potentially longer-term climatological data to establish a prior distribution.
*   **Q2: What are the dominant large-scale climate patterns expected for the Winter 2025-2026 season?** This requires investigating forecasts for major climate oscillators like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
*   **Q3: What does the recent weather activity (Fall/early Winter 2025) imply for the forecast period?** Specifically, does the early November polar vortex event have predictive power for the establishment of a colder, snow-conducive pattern?
*   **Q4: How do the expected conditions for Winter 2025-2026 compare to the conditions during the 10-year reference period?** This will identify key differences and help justify deviations from the simple historical average.
*   **Q5: What are the key short-term meteorological factors that determine whether a storm produces snow, rain, or nothing in NYC?** This will inform the "Indicators to Watch" section.

**2. Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1 (Base Rate):**
    *   The provided data is the primary source. No external search is needed for the 10-year base rate.
    *   For a longer-term view: `"NYC Central Park daily snow data December January"`, `"NOAA climatological data NYC snowfall"`, `"average number of snow days NYC December"`.
*   **Q2 (Climate Patterns):**
    *   `"NOAA CPC winter outlook 2025-2026"`
    *   `"ENSO forecast winter 2025-2026"`
    *   `"long-range forecast Arctic Oscillation winter 2025"`
    *   `"seasonal forecast North Atlantic Oscillation 2026"`
*   **Q3 (Recent Activity):**
    *   `"polar vortex displacement effects northeast US winter"`
    *   `"impact of early season polar vortex on winter forecast"`
    *   `"NYC weather patterns fall 2025"`
*   **Q4 (Comparison):**
    *   `"historical ENSO status by year"` (to map ENSO state to each of the last 10 winters)
    *   `"sea surface temperature anomalies North Atlantic December 2025"`
*   **Q5 (Meteorological Factors):**
    *   `"meteorological setup for nor'easter snowstorm NYC"`
    *   `"role of 50/50 low in NYC snow"`
    *   `"impact of NAO AO on northeast US storm track"`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   The 10-year data provides a strong, recent base rate centered around 1.9 days. The distribution is wide, with 0 days being the most common single outcome (40% of the time).
*   The key mechanisms are the major climate oscillators (ENSO, AO, NAO) which control the availability of cold air and the storm track. A negative AO/NAO phase is highly favorable for snow. La Niña winters tend to be colder and snowier for NYC than El Niño winters.
*   The November 2025 polar vortex event is a significant early indicator. It suggests a weakened, unstable polar jet stream, which increases the likelihood of arctic air masses plunging into the eastern US during the forecast period.
*   Comparing 2025-26 to the past decade, a key difference would be the specific ENSO state. The 2015-16 season, a strong El Niño, had 0 snow days in this period. If 2025-26 is a La Niña or even a strong neutral year, the probability of snow would be higher than the 10-year average suggests.
*   The final outcome will depend on the precise timing of individual storm systems and the availability of sub-freezing air, which is only predictable on a much shorter timescale (3-10 days).

**4. Drafting the Comprehensive Answer:**

Following the synthesis, I will structure the information into the required headings, ensuring each section is concise and directly addresses the needs of the statistician.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasters**

**To:** Bayesian Forecasting Panel
**From:** Lead Researcher
**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Subject:** Forecast Update: Number of Snow Days in NYC (Dec 11, 2025 - Jan 10, 2026)

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Last 10 Years (2015-16 to 2024-25):** This is the most relevant reference class due to recent climate trends.
    *   **Mean:** 1.9 days
    *   **Median:** 2 days
    *   **Distribution:** 0 days (40%), 1 day (10%), 2 days (20%), 3 days (20%), 4 days (20%), ≥5 days (0%).
    *   **Reasoning:** This period captures recent variability and potential warming signals. Its primary limitation is the small sample size (n=10), which makes it sensitive to outliers.
2.  **30-Year Climatology (1991-2020):** For the period Dec 11 - Jan 10, NYC averages approximately 2.5-3.0 days with measurable snow.
    *   **Reasoning:** A more stable, larger sample that smooths out year-to-year volatility. However, it may overstate the probability of snow relative to the most recent, warmer decade.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-11** Early season polar vortex blasts upstate NY. — **↑** — Indicates an unstable polar jet stream, increasing the odds of significant cold air outbreaks in the Northeast during the forecast window.
*   **2025-12-05** No measurable snow in Central Park for the season to date. — **→** (Neutral) — This is not historically unusual. The median date for the first measurable snow in NYC is in early-to-mid December.
*   **2025-12-10** Long-range models show persistent troughing over the eastern US. — **↑** — This pattern is conducive to drawing cold air south from Canada and supports an active storm track along the East Coast.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **ENSO (El Niño/La Niña):** La Niña conditions (cooler Pacific waters) tend to favor a colder, snowier pattern for NYC. El Niño often results in milder, rainier winters. (Moderate impact)
*   **Arctic Oscillation (AO) / North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO):** Strongly negative phases of these indices are the primary driver for sustained arctic air in the eastern US. A negative NAO often creates a "blocking" high near Greenland, forcing storms south and slowing them down, which is a classic setup for major Northeast snow. (Large impact)
*   **Storm Track:** For snow, a storm system (often a "Nor'easter") must track near the coast (e.g., the "40/70 benchmark"). A track too far east means a miss; too far west pulls in warm air, causing rain. (Large impact)
*   **Pacific-North American (PNA) Pattern:** A positive PNA pattern features a ridge in the west and a trough in the east, which helps deliver cold air to NYC. (Moderate impact)
*   **Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs):** Warmer-than-average SSTs in the Atlantic can provide extra moisture and energy to developing coastal storms, potentially leading to heavier precipitation (snow or rain). (Small impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Early Polar Vortex Instability:** The significant polar vortex event in November is a strong indicator of a high-amplitude jet stream pattern, which is more conducive to major snow events than a flatter, zonal flow. This differs from several of the quieter winters in the 10-year base rate period.
*   **Likely La Niña or Strong Neutral ENSO:** The 10-year reference period includes the 2015-16 super El Niño, which produced 0 snow days. Current long-range forecasts suggest a weak La Niña or ENSO-neutral state for Winter 2025-26, which favors colder and snowier outcomes than El Niño, thus pushing expectations above the 1.9-day average.
*   **Warm Atlantic SSTs:** Sea surface temperatures off the East Coast remain anomalously high. While this can sometimes favor rain, if a strong cold air mass is in place (as suggested by the vortex behavior), this extra energy could fuel a more powerful snowstorm than would otherwise occur.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A discrete distribution based on the last 10 years (n=10), with a mean of 1.9 days. The highest probability is on 0 days (40%), with significant weight on 2, 3, and 4 days as well.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** Early polar vortex activity suggests a favorable pattern for cold air delivery.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The likely absence of El Niño (and potential for La Niña) removes a key driver of mild winters and contrasts with low-snow years in the reference class.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Anomalously warm Atlantic SSTs could enhance any storm that does form, slightly increasing the chance that a marginal event produces measurable snow.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward revision from the base rate. The posterior should be shifted away from the 0-day outcome and more heavily weighted towards the 2, 3, and 4-day options. The mean should move from ~1.9 towards ~2.5-3.0.

To forecast the number of snow days in New York City between December 11, 2025, and January 10, 2026, we will apply Bayesian reasoning using the steps outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **0 days:** 40% (4 out of 10 years had 0 snow days)
- **1 day:** 10% (1 out of 10 years had 1 snow day)
- **2 days:** 20% (2 out of 10 years had 2 snow days)
- **3 days:** 20% (2 out of 10 years had 3 snow days)
- **4 days:** 20% (2 out of 10 years had 4 snow days)
- **≥5 days:** 0% (0 out of 10 years had ≥5 snow days)

These base rates are derived from the historical data provided for the last 10 years.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to the base rate scenario in terms of the general climate and seasonal patterns. However, the early polar vortex and the potential La Niña conditions suggest a higher likelihood of snow compared to some of the milder winters in the base period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Polar Vortex:** Increases the likelihood of cold air outbreaks, making snow more probable. This evidence suggests a higher likelihood of snow days than the base rate.
- **ENSO Conditions:** The absence of El Niño and potential for La Niña suggest a colder, snowier pattern, increasing the likelihood of snow days.
- **Warm Atlantic SSTs:** Could enhance storm systems, slightly increasing the likelihood of snow.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Using the prior probabilities and the evidence, we adjust the probabilities:

- **0 days:** The evidence suggests a lower likelihood than the base rate due to favorable conditions for snow.
- **1 day:** Slightly increased likelihood due to the potential for at least one snow event.
- **2 days:** Increased likelihood given the evidence of favorable conditions.
- **3 days:** Increased likelihood due to the potential for multiple snow events.
- **4 days:** Increased likelihood, but less so than 2 or 3 days.
- **≥5 days:** Still unlikely, but slightly more probable than the base rate suggests.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a sudden warming trend or a shift in weather patterns, could reduce the likelihood of snow. However, the evidence strongly supports an increase in the probability of snow days.

### 6. Final Normalization

Adjust probabilities to ensure they sum to approximately 100%:

- **0 days:** 20%
- **1 day:** 15%
- **2 days:** 25%
- **3 days:** 20%
- **4 days:** 15%
- **≥5 days:** 5%

### 7. Output Format

Option_0: 20%  
Option_1: 15%  
Option_2: 25%  
Option_3: 20%  
Option_4: 15%  
Option_≥5: 5%  

These probabilities reflect the increased likelihood of snow due to the current meteorological conditions and climate patterns.

# Forecasting NYC Snow Days (Dec 11, 2025 - Jan 10, 2026)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Looking at the provided 10-year historical data for NYC snow days during Dec 11-Jan 10:
- 0 days: 3 occurrences (30%)
- 1 day: 1 occurrence (10%)
- 2 days: 2 occurrences (20%)
- 3 days: 2 occurrences (20%)
- 4 days: 2 occurrences (20%)
- ≥5 days: 0 occurrences (0%)

The mean is 1.9 days, and the distribution appears somewhat bimodal with peaks at 0 days and 3-4 days.

This 10-year period (2015-2025) provides a good reference class as it captures recent climate patterns and variability in NYC winter weather. I'll use this distribution as my prior.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- We're looking at the exact same time period (Dec 11-Jan 10)
- Same geographical location (NYC/Central Park)
- Same measurement criteria (measurable snowfall)

**Differences from base rate scenario:**
- Current climate conditions: The early polar vortex in November 2025 suggests potential instability in the polar jet stream
- No measurable snow as of December 5, 2025, which is consistent with some years in our reference class
- The research report suggests a likely La Niña or ENSO-neutral state for Winter 2025-26, which differs from some years in our reference period (particularly the 2015-16 El Niño year that had 0 snow days)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Early polar vortex in November 2025**
- P(E|H="more snow days"): High - Early polar vortex events often indicate jet stream instability that can lead to more cold air intrusions
- P(E|H="fewer snow days"): Low - Early polar vortex events rarely lead to consistently mild winters in NYC

**Evidence 2: No measurable snow as of December 5, 2025**
- P(E|H="more snow days"): Medium - This is not unusual; many snowy winters don't see measurable snow until mid-December
- P(E|H="fewer snow days"): Medium - Could indicate a pattern that delays snow onset, but not strongly predictive

**Evidence 3: Likely La Niña or ENSO-neutral conditions**
- P(E|H="more snow days"): Medium-High - La Niña conditions tend to favor colder, snowier patterns for NYC compared to El Niño
- P(E|H="fewer snow days"): Low-Medium - La Niña reduces the likelihood of consistently mild, snow-free periods

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on the early polar vortex evidence:

For the "0 days" option:
- Prior probability: 30%
- Likelihood ratio: P(polar vortex|0 days)/P(polar vortex|not 0 days) ≈ 0.6
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (30/70) × 0.6 ≈ 0.257
- Posterior probability = 0.257/(1+0.257) ≈ 20.4%

This represents a decrease from 30% to about 20% for the "0 days" option.

For the "3 days" option:
- Prior probability: 20%
- Likelihood ratio: P(polar vortex|3 days)/P(polar vortex|not 3 days) ≈ 1.5
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (20/80) × 1.5 ≈ 0.375
- Posterior probability = 0.375/(1+0.375) ≈ 27.3%

This represents an increase from 20% to about 27% for the "3 days" option.

Qualitatively updating for the other evidence:
- The La Niña/neutral ENSO conditions further decrease probability for "0 days" and increase for "2-4 days"
- The lack of snow by December 5 has minimal impact as it's not unusual

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the predictive power of the early polar vortex event
- Climate change trends could make historical patterns less reliable
- Individual storm tracks matter tremendously and are highly variable
- The 10-year sample size is relatively small

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden pattern shift could establish a persistent ridge over the eastern US, blocking storm systems
- Borderline temperature scenarios could lead to more rain than snow events
- A single major snowstorm could account for multiple snow days, making the distribution more "chunky"

**Adjustments:**
- I should ensure I'm not underestimating the "0 days" probability given climate warming trends
- I should maintain reasonable probability for "≥5 days" despite its absence in the 10-year record

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, here's my normalized distribution:

0 days: 18%
1 day: 12%
2 days: 22%
3 days: 26%
4 days: 17%
≥5 days: 5%

This distribution:
- Reduces probability for "0 days" compared to the base rate due to the polar vortex and La Niña evidence
- Increases probability for "2-3 days" as the most likely outcomes
- Maintains some probability for "≥5 days" despite its absence in the reference period
- Has a mean of approximately 2.3 days (up from the base rate of 1.9 days)

## 7. Final Forecast

0: 18%
1: 12%
2: 22%
3: 26%
4: 17%
≥5: 5%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of snow days in New York City (Central Park) for the exact period of December 11th to January 10th over the last 10 years (2015-16 to 2024-25), as provided in the background.

Based on the 10 data points:
- **0 days:** 3 times
- **1 day:** 1 time
- **2 days:** 2 times
- **3 days:** 2 times
- **4 days:** 2 times
- **≥5 days:** 0 times

This gives the following prior probability distribution:
- P(0) = 30%
- P(1) = 10%
- P(2) = 20%
- P(3) = 20%
- P(4) = 20%
- P(≥5) = 0% (I will assign a minimal 1% chance to this tail outcome to account for small sample size, and normalize the rest slightly).

The mean of this historical data is 1.9 days. This distribution serves as our starting point before considering this year's specific conditions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The forecast is for the same location and time of year as the base rate data.
- **Differences:** The primary differences are the large-scale atmospheric patterns forecasted for the 2025-26 winter, which are not captured by a simple historical average. The research report highlights an early polar vortex event, a likely La Niña or neutral ENSO state, and persistent troughing over the eastern US. These factors suggest a departure from the average conditions of the last decade.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report:

*   **Evidence 1: Early Polar Vortex & Persistent Eastern Trough:** The report notes an early polar vortex event in November and long-range models showing a persistent trough over the eastern US. This pattern is highly conducive to cold air outbreaks and an active storm track along the East Coast. The likelihood of seeing this evidence is much higher if a snowy winter is coming (P(E | H_snowy) >> P(E | H_not_snowy)). This is strong evidence to shift probabilities towards higher snow day counts.
*   **Evidence 2: La Niña or Neutral ENSO State:** The report indicates a likely La Niña or neutral winter. This is significant because the 10-year base rate includes the 2015-16 "super El Niño" winter, which had 0 snow days in this period and biases the average downwards. The absence of El Niño makes a low-snow outcome less likely (P(E | H_low_snow) is lower than the base rate). This evidence also pushes probabilities towards higher snow counts.
*   **Evidence 3: Warm Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs):** Warmer SSTs can provide more moisture and energy for coastal storms. If cold air is in place (as other evidence suggests), this could fuel more powerful storms, slightly increasing the chance of significant snowfall. This is a minor piece of evidence that slightly increases the probability of higher totals.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
The combined evidence strongly points towards a winter that is colder and snowier than the 10-year average. I will perform a conceptual Bayesian update.

*   **Prior Odds:** The prior probability of a low-snow period (0 or 1 day) is 30% + 10% = 40%. The prior for a higher-snow period (≥2 days) is 60%. The prior odds are 60:40 or 1.5 to 1 in favor of a higher-snow period.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The combined evidence (favorable jet stream, no El Niño) makes a higher-snow period significantly more likely. I estimate a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 2.5, meaning this evidence package is about 2.5 times more likely to be observed in a winter that will have ≥2 snow days than in one that will have <2.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 1.5 × 2.5 = 3.75.
*   **Posterior Probability:** The new probability for a higher-snow period (≥2 days) is 3.75 / (1 + 3.75) ≈ 79%. The probability for a low-snow period (0 or 1 day) is now ~21%.

This justifies a significant shift of probability mass away from the "0 days" option and distributing it across the higher options. I will reduce P(0) from 30% to 10%. The 20 percentage points removed will be redistributed to options 1 through ≥5, with the largest increases in the 2 and 3-day bins.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on long-range atmospheric forecasts, which have inherent uncertainty. A sudden shift in the AO/NAO to a positive phase could block cold air and lead to a "rainout" or "miss" scenario where storms are either too warm or track out to sea. My updated forecast for 0 or 1 day is 10% + 16% = 26%. This is a significant reduction from the 40% base rate but still represents a substantial probability of a relatively snow-free period, accounting for this key uncertainty. Furthermore, while the pattern is favorable, achieving 5 or more snow days in a single month is historically rare, so I am keeping the probability for this tail outcome low at 4%.

### 6. Final Normalization
I have adjusted the probabilities to reflect the analysis above, ensuring they sum to 100%. The final distribution is shifted towards a higher number of snow days compared to the 10-year base rate, with a mean of approximately 2.4 days (up from 1.9).

0: 10%
1: 16%
2: 26%
3: 24%
4: 20%
≥5: 4%
