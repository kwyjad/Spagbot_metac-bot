### Reference class & base rates
*   **Challenger Social Network vs. Established Incumbent:** This is the primary reference class. Historically, the base rate for a new entrant displacing a well-established network with strong network effects is low, perhaps 10-20%. Failures are common (e.g., Google+, Clubhouse's decline), while successes (e.g., Facebook vs. MySpace, TikTok vs. Vine) often involve a significant technological or demographic shift.
*   **Feature-Cloning by a Platform Giant:** A narrower class is a large tech company cloning a competitor's core feature or app. The success rate here is higher, perhaps 30-50%. Instagram Stories successfully blunted Snapchat's growth, and YouTube Shorts is competing effectively with TikTok. This class is relevant due to Meta's backing of Threads.
*   **Limitations:** Neither class fully captures the unique context of an established incumbent undergoing significant, self-inflicted turmoil, which is a primary factor in this specific case. The ability to bootstrap a user base directly from a sister network of over 2 billion users (Instagram) is also a historical anomaly.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-25** Threads surpasses X in daily active users (DAUs) worldwide for the first time, averaging 130.2M to X's 130.1M. — ↑ — A critical milestone. While DAU is not MAU, it is a powerful leading indicator that the MAU crossover is imminent or has already occurred.
*   **2025-09-16** Multiple outlets report Threads reached 400 million monthly active users (MAUs) in Q3 2025. — ↑ — This figure represents a doubling from the previous year and places Threads well above X's last reliable public MAU figure from 2022 (368M) and subsequent estimates suggesting decline.
*   **2025-08-21** Reports confirm Threads' mid-2025 MAU at 400 million and project its U.S. user base will surpass X's in 2026. — ↑ — Reinforces the 400M MAU figure and indicates sustained momentum and positive analyst sentiment.
*   **2025-05-01** eMarketer releases a forecast projecting significant and sustained user growth for Threads through the end of the decade. — ↑ — Indicates long-term confidence from market analysts in the platform's trajectory, suggesting current growth is not a temporary spike.
*   **2024-10-31** Meta's Q3 2024 earnings call reveals Threads reached 275 million MAUs, an acceleration of 100 million users in just three months. — ↑ — Demonstrates that the platform's growth rate was increasing significantly heading into 2025, setting the stage for the recent crossover.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Instagram Integration (Large):** Threads leverages Instagram's massive user base for seamless, low-friction sign-ups. This is the single largest driver, allowing it to overcome the cold-start problem that dooms most new social networks.
*   **Incumbent Instability (Large):** X's erratic leadership, controversial policy changes (e.g., verification, content moderation), and deteriorating user experience have created a large, motivated pool of users actively seeking an alternative. This "push" factor from X is as important as the "pull" from Threads.
*   **Feature Development & Parity (Moderate):** Threads has been methodically adding key features that users expect from a Twitter-like platform (e.g., a robust web app, post-editing, improved search, API access). This reduces the switching costs for users leaving X.
*   **Network Effects (Large):** As more high-profile users, journalists, and brands establish a presence on Threads, the incentive for others to join and remain active grows exponentially. The recent DAU crossover suggests Threads may have reached a critical mass where its network effect becomes self-sustaining.
*   **Brand Safety & Advertiser Flight from X (Moderate):** Advertisers' concerns about brand safety on X have led them to seek alternatives. Their presence and ad spend on Threads lend the platform legitimacy and resources, creating a more vibrant ecosystem.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented User Base Bootstrap:** No previous challenger has been able to port a social graph and user identity from a 2 billion+ user network (Instagram) with a single click. This fundamentally changes the growth dynamic compared to the reference class.
*   **Self-Inflicted Wounds of the Incumbent:** Unlike MySpace, which was primarily out-innovated by Facebook, X is actively alienating its core users and advertisers through deliberate, top-down strategic shifts. This is an unforced error of a magnitude rarely seen.
*   **Mature Market Dynamics:** The market for public, text-based conversation is well-defined and its users are highly habituated. Threads is not creating a new market but rather capturing an existing one from a faltering leader, which is a different and potentially faster process.
*   **Meta's Strategic Patience:** Unlike Google with Google+, Meta has a proven track record of patiently investing in and scaling competitors (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp) and features (e.g., Stories). They are likely to commit resources for the long haul.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from a "challenger vs. incumbent" base rate, a reasonable prior might be ~15% (equivalent n≈10), reflecting the historical difficulty of unseating a network-effect-driven incumbent.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Threads' reported growth to 400M MAUs by Q3 2025, a number already exceeding X's likely current MAU.
    *   ↑ (Large): The recent report of Threads surpassing X in daily active users, a direct and powerful signal that the MAU crossover has likely occurred.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The clear and sustained pattern of user/advertiser dissatisfaction with X, providing a continuous "push" of users toward alternatives.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Meta's consistent feature rollouts and public commitment, signaling this is a strategic priority, not a fleeting experiment.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly positive and strong. The posterior probability should move dramatically upward from the low prior to a position of very high confidence (e.g., >95%).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Meta's official Q4 2025 earnings call (early 2026, but may be anticipated) explicitly stating MAUs > 400M.
    *   Major news organizations or data intelligence firms (e.g., Similarweb, Sensor Tower) publishing new estimates showing a definitive MAU lead for Threads.
    *   Another major, controversial policy change or extended outage at X.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Meta issuing a correction or restatement of its user numbers (highly unlikely).
    *   A major data privacy or censorship scandal specifically involving Threads.
    *   Credible third-party data showing a sudden and sharp reversal in user engagement trends for Threads.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting Asymmetry:** The resolution hinges on Meta *publicly reporting* its MAU. Meta controls the timing and definition of this metric. X is a private company and no longer reports official figures, so the comparison number will be a "best public estimate," which could be contentious.
*   **MAU vs. Engagement:** While the question is strictly about MAU, a large MAU number could mask low engagement. However, the recent DAU data suggests engagement is also competitive.
*   **Definition of "Active User":** Meta's definition of a monthly active user for Threads might differ from how Twitter historically defined it or how estimators currently model it for X.
*   **Short-Term Reversal:** While highly unlikely given the momentum, a massive event (e.g., a U.S. government ban on a Meta product) could theoretically reverse trends, though there is no current indication of this.

**Final Research Summary:** Threads' explosive growth, directly fueled by Instagram's user base and X's persistent turmoil, has already propelled it past X in daily active users. With reported MAUs at 400 million as of Q3 2025, it is overwhelmingly likely that Meta will report a higher MAU figure than X before the year-end deadline.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a new social network displacing an established incumbent is historically low, around 10-20%. However, given the context of a large tech company cloning a competitor's core feature, the success rate is higher, around 30-50%. Considering the unique situation with Threads leveraging Instagram's user base and Twitter's instability, a prior probability of around 30% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Threads is a challenger to an established incumbent, similar to past scenarios where new entrants have attempted to displace existing social networks.
   - Differences: Threads benefits from Instagram's massive user base and Twitter's self-inflicted issues, which are not typical in most historical cases. These differences suggest a higher probability of success for Threads compared to the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Threads surpassing X in daily active users and reaching 400 million MAUs by Q3 2025 are strong indicators that Threads is on track to surpass Twitter in MAUs. The likelihood of these events occurring if Threads surpasses Twitter is high, while the likelihood of these events occurring if Threads does not surpass Twitter is low. This results in a high likelihood ratio, increasing the probability.
   - The ongoing dissatisfaction with Twitter and Meta's strategic commitment to Threads further support the likelihood of Threads surpassing Twitter.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 30% probability translates to odds of 0.3 / 0.7 = 0.4286.
   - Given the strong evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1, suggesting a substantial increase in probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio. Assuming a likelihood ratio of 10 (reflecting strong evidence), the posterior odds become 4.286.
   - Posterior probability = 4.286 / (1 + 4.286) ≈ 81.1%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: While the evidence is strong, there is a risk of overconfidence due to potential reporting asymmetries and differences in MAU definitions.
   - Alternative scenarios: A major scandal or policy change could impact Threads' growth, but current trends suggest this is unlikely.
   - Adjustments: Given the overwhelming positive evidence, the probability remains high, but a slight reduction to account for potential uncertainties is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential uncertainties, the final calibrated probability is 95%.

Final: 95%

# Will Threads report more monthly active users than Twitter before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate base rate for a challenger social network overtaking an established incumbent.

The most relevant reference class is "challenger social networks vs. established incumbents with strong network effects." Historically, this has a low success rate (10-20%), as seen with failures like Google+ and Clubhouse. However, there's a more specific reference class: "feature-cloning by a platform giant," which has a higher success rate (30-50%), as seen with Instagram Stories vs. Snapchat.

Given the unique circumstances (Meta's backing, Instagram integration, Twitter/X's self-inflicted issues), I'll start with a prior of 30%, leaning toward the higher end of the challenger success rate but still acknowledging the historical difficulty of displacing established social networks.

**Prior probability: 30%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Network effects still apply - users go where other users are
- Switching costs exist (rebuilding followers, learning new interface)
- The core use case (public text-based conversation) remains the same

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented bootstrap advantage: Threads leveraged Instagram's 2B+ user base with one-click sign-ups
- Incumbent instability: X/Twitter has experienced significant self-inflicted turmoil under Elon Musk
- Meta's strategic patience and resources far exceed typical challengers
- The recent DAU crossover (Threads surpassing X) is a critical milestone rarely seen in failed challenger cases

These differences significantly increase the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Threads reached 400M MAUs by Q3 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If Threads will overtake X, we'd expect to see this level of growth
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.05) - If Threads won't overtake X, reaching 400M would be surprising
- Likelihood ratio: ~19:1 in favor of H
- This strongly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Threads surpassed X in daily active users (130.2M vs 130.1M) in September 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.98) - DAU crossover is a natural precursor to MAU crossover
- P(E|~H): Very low (~0.02) - Extremely unlikely to see DAU crossover without eventual MAU crossover
- Likelihood ratio: ~49:1 in favor of H
- This dramatically increases probability

**Evidence 3: Threads' growth acceleration (100M new MAUs in just 3 months in Q3 2024)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - Consistent with a platform on track to overtake
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.1) - Rapid acceleration is rare for platforms that don't eventually overtake
- Likelihood ratio: ~9:1 in favor of H
- This substantially increases probability

**Evidence 4: X's continued instability and advertiser exodus**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - We'd expect to see this if X is vulnerable to being overtaken
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Could occur without leading to MAU overtaking
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.7:1 in favor of H
- This moderately increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 30:70 (0.43:1)

After Evidence 1 (400M MAUs):
Posterior odds = 0.43 × 19 = 8.17:1
Posterior probability = 8.17/(1+8.17) = 89.1%

After Evidence 2 (DAU crossover):
Posterior odds = 8.17 × 49 = 400.33:1
Posterior probability = 400.33/(1+400.33) = 99.8%

This is extremely high, but I should be cautious about overconfidence. Let me consider additional factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- MAU reporting definitions might differ between platforms
- Meta could delay reporting official numbers until after 2025
- X could implement dramatic changes to regain users
- The question requires official reporting, not just the reality of user numbers

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 80-85%, arguing that while Threads has likely surpassed X in users, there's uncertainty about whether Meta will officially report this before the end of 2025. However, given the September 2025 DAU crossover and Q3 2025 MAU reports of 400M (already exceeding X's last known figure of 368M), this seems overly cautious.

**Tail risks:**
- Major regulatory action against Meta
- A catastrophic data breach or scandal specific to Threads
- X implementing a revolutionary feature that dramatically reverses trends

After considering these factors, I should adjust my extremely high 99.8% downward slightly to account for reporting uncertainties and tail risks.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, particularly the recent DAU crossover and the 400M MAU figure (which already exceeds X's last known MAU), along with the strong growth trajectory and X's continued challenges, the probability is very high. However, I'll adjust slightly for uncertainty in official reporting timing and potential tail risks.

Final: 98%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is whether a new social network (Threads) will surpass an established incumbent (Twitter/X) in Monthly Active Users (MAUs) within approximately 2.5 years of its launch. A suitable reference class is "challenger social networks launched by established tech giants."

Historically, most new social networks fail to displace incumbents due to strong network effects (e.g., Google+). However, when a tech giant with a massive existing user base launches a direct competitor, the odds are better (e.g., Instagram Stories successfully competing with Snapchat). A reasonable starting prior, considering both the difficulty of the task and Meta's significant advantages (bootstrapping from Instagram's 2B+ users), would be around **25%**. This reflects a higher-than-average chance of success for a challenger, but still acknowledges that unseating an incumbent like Twitter is a formidable challenge.

In odds form, a 25% probability is 0.25 / (1 - 0.25) = **1:3 odds**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case in two critical ways, both of which strongly favor the challenger, Threads:

*   **Unprecedented User Onboarding:** Threads leveraged Instagram's user base for one-click signups, allowing it to overcome the "cold start" problem more effectively than any challenger in history. It reached 100 million sign-ups in its first week, a feat that demonstrates a fundamental difference from the typical growth trajectory of a new network.
*   **Incumbent Instability:** Twitter/X has undergone a period of significant turmoil since its acquisition by Elon Musk. This includes erratic policy changes, technical issues, brand safety concerns leading to an advertiser exodus, and alienation of its core user base. This creates a powerful "push" factor, driving users to seek alternatives, a dynamic not present in many historical incumbent-challenger scenarios.

These factors suggest that the initial 25% prior was likely conservative and the true *a priori* odds were higher.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several recent and decisive pieces of evidence. The current date is November 20, 2025, with the resolution deadline at the end of the year.

*   **Evidence 1: Threads reported to have 400 million MAUs in Q3 2025 (reported August/September 2025).**
    *   Twitter's last publicly reported MAU was 368M in late 2022, and most subsequent estimates show a decline. Therefore, a 400M MAU figure for Threads means it has almost certainly already surpassed X's current MAU.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of seeing this report if Threads is to surpass X before 2026 is very high. This is the expected state of affairs.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing this report if Threads does *not* surpass X is extremely low. It would require X to have secretly grown to over 400M MAU, which contradicts all other information.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large, strongly increasing the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Threads surpassed X in daily active users (DAUs) worldwide (reported September 25, 2025).**
    *   DAU is a strong leading indicator of MAU and a measure of core user engagement. A DAU crossover makes an MAU crossover either imminent or an accomplished fact.
    *   P(E | H): Extremely likely. This is a key milestone on the path to surpassing X in MAU.
    *   P(E | ~H): Extremely unlikely. It is very difficult to construct a plausible scenario where a platform has more daily users but fewer monthly users than its direct competitor over a sustained period.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large, strongly increasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's update the initial 1:3 odds using the combined weight of the recent evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:3 (for "Yes")
*   **Evidence:** Threads has reportedly reached 400M MAU and surpassed X in DAU.
*   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** Let's estimate the LR for this combined evidence. The probability of seeing these reports if Threads will surpass X (H) is very high, P(E|H) ≈ 0.95. The probability of seeing these reports if Threads will *not* surpass X (~H) is exceedingly low, as it would imply the reports are wrong or X's user base is secretly much larger. Let's be generous and set P(E|~H) ≈ 0.01. This gives an LR of 0.95 / 0.01 = 95.
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × LR = (1/3) × 95 ≈ 31.7:1.
*   **Posterior Probability:** 31.7 / (1 + 31.7) ≈ 0.969, or **97%**.

The evidence is so strong that it overwhelmingly swamps the initial prior, moving the probability to a very high level of confidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary reason this forecast could be wrong is not related to user numbers but to the specific wording of the resolution criteria: "if, before Dec 31, 2025, Meta **publicly reports** Threads has a Monthly Active User number higher than the **best public estimates** of Twitter's MAUs".

1.  **Failure to Report:** The biggest risk is that Meta, for some strategic reason, does not issue a formal public report with a specific MAU number before the deadline. However, the research report indicates that the 400M MAU figure for Q3 2025 was already reported by multiple outlets, likely stemming from Meta's Q3 earnings call in October 2025. Companies typically boast about such milestones, making a failure to report unlikely.
2.  **Ambiguous "Best Estimate" for X:** Since X is private, its MAU is an estimate. If a reputable source were to publish an unexpectedly high estimate for X (e.g., >400M), it could complicate the resolution. This is highly improbable given the consistent narrative of X's decline.
3.  **Market Discrepancy:** The Manifold market shows a surprisingly low 5.5%. This is a massive disconnect from the evidence. This could be due to an illiquid market, traders anchored to old data, or a niche interpretation of the resolution criteria. Given the strength of the evidence in the provided report (DAU crossover, 400M MAU), the market appears to be wrong.

The procedural risk of Meta not reporting is the only plausible, albeit small, risk remaining. This warrants a slight reduction from the calculated 97%.

### Final Forecast
The evidence as of late November 2025 is overwhelming. Multiple reports indicate Threads has already surpassed 400 million MAUs and has more daily active users than X. This means the core condition has likely already been met. The only remaining uncertainty is the procedural requirement of a public report from Meta before the deadline, which is highly likely to have already occurred or to occur with the next official communication. The risk of this not happening, or of X's estimated user base being secretly much larger, is minimal.

Final: 95%
