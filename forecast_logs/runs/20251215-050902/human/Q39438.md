### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential Emergency/Foreign Affairs Powers:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in matters of national security and foreign affairs. In cases like *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), which also involved IEEPA, the Court upheld broad executive action. A base rate derived from this class suggests a **65-75% probability of the President's actions being upheld (i.e., "Lawful" or "Mixed")**. This is based on the long-standing tradition of judicial restraint in this domain. Limitation: This historical deference has been challenged by the current Court's focus on textualism and separation of powers.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Questions of Economic/Domestic Policy (Major Questions Doctrine):** In recent years, the Court has increasingly used the "Major Questions Doctrine" (MQD) to invalidate executive actions that have vast economic and political significance without exceptionally clear authorization from Congress. Cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) are archetypal. Using IEEPA to fundamentally restructure U.S. trade policy arguably falls into this category. The base rate for the government losing a major questions case is high, suggesting a **60-70% probability of the tariffs being struck down ("Unlawful")**. Limitation: The Court has not explicitly applied the MQD in a national security context like this, creating uncertainty.
3.  **Supreme Court Affirmance Rate of Federal Appellate Courts:** The Supreme Court affirms the judgment of the court of appeals in roughly 30-40% of cases, reversing or vacating in the majority. Here, the Federal Circuit affirmed the lower court's ruling against the tariffs. A simple application of this base rate would suggest a **60-70% chance of reversal or vacatur**. However, this is a weak prior because the Court grants certiorari specifically to resolve important issues or correct perceived errors, not to randomly sample appellate cases.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** Federal Circuit affirms (7-4) that tariffs exceed IEEPA authority. (↓ Unlawful) — A major appellate court, with bipartisan dissent, found the tariffs illegal, strengthening the legal case against them.
*   **2025-09-03** The government petitions the Supreme Court for review of *V.O.S. Selections*. (↑ Lawful/Mixed) — Signals the executive branch's confidence in its legal position and ensures the Court will hear its arguments.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court grants certiorari and consolidates cases on an expedited schedule. (↑ No 2025 ruling is less likely) — The Court's speed confirms the issue's national importance and makes a ruling before the Jan 1, 2026 deadline highly probable.
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held before the Supreme Court. (↔ Neutral/Slightly ↓ Unlawful) — While transcripts are not provided, arguments in similar recent cases often reveal skepticism from a majority of justices regarding broad executive authority claims, particularly on economic matters.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Statutory Interpretation (Textualism vs. Purposivism):** The core legal question. The text of IEEPA does not explicitly mention "tariffs." A textualist reading, favored by the Court's conservative majority, would likely find the authority lacking. A purposive reading, focusing on the act's goal of giving the President broad tools, might support the tariffs. Driver direction: Textualism pushes toward **Unlawful**. Size: **Large**.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The Court's current 6-3 conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming transformative power over the economy without a clear statement from Congress. Imposing tariffs on nearly all trade partners is a textbook "major question." Driver direction: Pushes strongly toward **Unlawful**. Size: **Large**.
3.  **National Security Deference:** The traditional counterweight. The government will argue that the "emergency" (cartels, fentanyl) is a matter of national security where the President's authority is at its apex. Some justices (e.g., Roberts, Kavanaugh) may be hesitant to curb presidential power in this sphere. Driver direction: Pushes toward **Lawful**. Size: **Moderate**.
4.  **Severability of the Tariffs:** The Court may analyze the "trafficking tariffs" (Mexico, Canada, China) and the "reciprocal tariffs" (trade deficits) separately. The trafficking tariffs have a more plausible (though still debatable) link to a traditional national security threat. The reciprocal tariffs, based on trade deficits, are on much weaker legal ground as an "unusual and extraordinary threat." Driver direction: Pushes strongly toward **Mixed ruling**. Size: **Large**.
5.  **Judicial Restraint/Procedural Off-Ramps:** The Court could seek a narrow ruling, avoiding a sweeping precedent. It could dismiss the case as improvidently granted or find a procedural issue (e.g., standing), though this is less likely given the expedited review. Driver direction: Pushes toward **Other ruling**. Size: **Small**.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scale of IEEPA Use:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions (e.g., freezing assets of specific regimes or entities), this application imposes broad-based tariffs on the entire U.S. economy. This pushes the action from the "foreign affairs" reference class toward the "major domestic policy" class.
*   **Ascendancy of the Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's composition and jurisprudence have shifted dramatically since key deference precedents like *Dames & Moore*. The current Court is far more willing to enforce strict separation of powers and rein in the executive branch than its predecessors.
*   **Dual Justifications for Tariffs:** The case presents two distinct types of tariffs. The "trafficking" tariffs have a national security flavor, while the "reciprocal" tariffs are purely economic. This dual nature makes a simple binary outcome (lawful/unlawful) less likely than in a case with a single, unified executive action.
*   **Conflicting Lower Court Rationales:** While both lower courts found the tariffs unlawful, they did so for different reasons (*exceeded* authority vs. *no authority at all*). This gives the Supreme Court a menu of options for how to rule against the government, increasing the complexity and potential for a fractured or mixed opinion.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the "Presidential Deference" reference class, but temper it due to the economic nature of the action. A plausible prior might be centered on **Mixed ruling**, with smaller probabilities for Lawful and Unlawful. (e.g., Lawful 25%, Unlawful 30%, Mixed 40%, Other/No Ruling 5%). Equivalent n≈4 (moderate uncertainty).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) Unanimous lower court outcomes against the tariffs: **Large** update away from "Lawful."
    *   (↓) The current Court's robust application of the Major Questions Doctrine: **Large** update away from "Lawful."
    *   (↑ Mixed) The clear distinction between the trafficking and reciprocal tariffs: **Large** update toward "Mixed ruling."
    *   (↓) The weakness of "trade deficits" as a national emergency justification under IEEPA: **Moderate** update toward "Unlawful" or "Mixed."
    *   (↓ No 2025 ruling) The Court's expedited schedule: **Large** update away from "No 2025 ruling."
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes away from a clean victory for the government ("Tariffs lawful"). The MQD and weak legal basis for the reciprocal tariffs make that outcome highly improbable. The key tension is whether the Court invalidates all the tariffs ("Unlawful") or salvages the more security-related ones ("Mixed"). The posterior should be heavily concentrated on **"Unlawful" and "Mixed ruling"** as the most likely outcomes.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Lawful/Mixed):**
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting Chief Justice Roberts is seeking a narrow, deferential majority.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars arguing for broad presidential emergency powers in this specific context.
    *   Any public statements from the administration linking the tariffs to a new, acute security threat.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Unlawful):**
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting a solid conservative majority (e.g., Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett) is coalescing around an MQD-based rejection.
    *   Unusual delays in issuing the opinion, which can sometimes signal deep divisions or difficulty writing a majority opinion.
    *   Publication of concurring or dissenting opinions from the Federal Circuit decision that gain traction in legal commentary.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Imminent Resolution:** The decision is expected before December 31, 2025. There is very little time for new information to emerge. The forecast relies heavily on interpreting established legal doctrine and judicial philosophy.
*   **Plurality Risk:** The Court could be highly fractured, leading to a 4-1-4 or similar split. If no single rationale commands a majority of five justices, the outcome could be a narrow judgment that resolves as "Other ruling" under the resolution criteria.
*   **Definition of "Merits Holding":** The resolution criteria for "Other ruling" are specific. A decision that vacates and remands for further consideration without explicitly holding a measure lawful or unlawful (e.g., remanding to reconsider the emergency declaration itself) would resolve as "Other." This is a plausible outcome.
*   **Fictional Premise:** This analysis is based on a detailed but hypothetical scenario. It assumes the justices behave consistently with their established jurisprudential records when faced with these specific fictional facts.

### Final Research Summary
The Supreme Court is highly likely to rule against at least some of President Trump's IEEPA tariffs before year-end. The modern Court's skepticism of broad executive power on major economic issues (the Major Questions Doctrine) weighs heavily against the tariffs, especially the "reciprocal tariffs" justified by trade deficits, making a "Mixed ruling" or a complete "Tariffs unlawful" determination the most probable outcomes.

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful:** Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential authority in national security and foreign affairs, suggesting a base rate of around 25% for this outcome. However, the Court's recent trend towards textualism and the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) reduces this likelihood.
  
- **Tariffs unlawful:** The MQD and recent rulings against executive overreach in economic matters suggest a base rate of about 30% for this outcome. The Court's skepticism of broad executive power without clear congressional authorization supports this probability.

- **Mixed ruling:** Given the dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) and the possibility of the Court distinguishing between them, a base rate of 40% is reasonable. This reflects the complexity and potential for a nuanced decision.

- **Other ruling:** The possibility of procedural outcomes or a fractured decision suggests a base rate of 5%.

- **No 2025 ruling:** Given the expedited schedule and the Court's agreement to hear the case, the probability of no ruling by the end of 2025 is very low, around 0%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The case involves presidential powers under IEEPA, similar to past cases where the Court has shown deference.
  
- **Differences:** The unprecedented scale of the tariffs and the Court's current composition, which favors the MQD, make this case distinct. The dual nature of the tariffs (national security vs. economic) adds complexity.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs:** Strong evidence against "Tariffs lawful," increasing the likelihood of "Unlawful" or "Mixed ruling."

- **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's recent application of the MQD in economic matters strongly supports "Tariffs unlawful."

- **National security argument:** Provides some support for "Tariffs lawful" but is weaker given the economic nature of the tariffs.

- **Severability of tariffs:** Increases the likelihood of a "Mixed ruling" as the Court may differentiate between the types of tariffs.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Initial Prior Odds:**
  - Tariffs lawful: 25%
  - Tariffs unlawful: 30%
  - Mixed ruling: 40%
  - Other ruling: 5%
  - No 2025 ruling: 0%

- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - Evidence from lower courts and MQD strongly favors "Unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."
  - National security arguments provide moderate support for "Lawful."

- **Posterior Calculation:**
  - Adjust probabilities based on evidence:
    - Tariffs lawful: Decrease to 15%
    - Tariffs unlawful: Increase to 35%
    - Mixed ruling: Increase to 45%
    - Other ruling: Remain at 5%
    - No 2025 ruling: Remain at 0%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a procedural outcome or a narrow ruling that doesn't fit neatly into the main categories.
  
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A fractured decision or procedural dismissal could lead to "Other ruling."

- **Adjustments:** Slightly increase "Other ruling" to account for procedural risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:
  - Tariffs lawful: 15%
  - Tariffs unlawful: 35%
  - Mixed ruling: 40%
  - Other ruling: 10%
  - No 2025 ruling: 0%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 35%  
Mixed ruling: 40%  
Other ruling: 10%  
No 2025 ruling: 0%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish a prior based on relevant reference classes:

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 15%)**
- Historical deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs/national security (IEEPA cases)
- However, this is tempered by the current Court's skepticism of broad executive power
- The unprecedented scale of these tariffs makes them distinct from traditional IEEPA applications

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 40%)**
- The Court's recent Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) jurisprudence strongly limits executive authority on major economic issues without clear congressional authorization
- Both lower courts ruled against the tariffs (albeit with different reasoning)
- The Federal Circuit affirmed 7-4 that the tariffs exceed IEEPA authority

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 30%)**
- The dual nature of the tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) creates a natural dividing line
- The trafficking tariffs have a stronger national security nexus than the reciprocal tariffs
- The Court often seeks compromise positions that partially satisfy both sides

**Other ruling (Prior: 10%)**
- The Court sometimes avoids definitive rulings on politically charged issues
- Procedural off-ramps (standing, ripeness, etc.) are always possibilities
- The complex nature of the case could lead to a fractured opinion with no clear majority

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 5%)**
- The Court has expedited the schedule, signaling intent to rule before year-end
- Only 16 days remain in 2025, but the Court is aware of the timeline

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major executive power cases, this involves tension between presidential authority and congressional delegation
- The Court has previously addressed IEEPA's scope (e.g., Dames & Moore v. Regan)
- The case fits the pattern of the Court's recent scrutiny of executive overreach

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented scale: These tariffs affect the entire U.S. economy, not just targeted sanctions
- Dual justification: The trafficking and reciprocal tariffs have distinct legal foundations
- Current Court composition: The 6-3 conservative majority has shown strong commitment to textualism and separation of powers
- Expedited review: The Court's unusual speed signals recognition of the issue's importance

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence: Both lower courts ruled the tariffs unlawful**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Very low (~10%) - It would be unusual for the Court to completely reverse unanimous lower court rulings
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%) - The Court often affirms when lower courts agree
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~40%) - The Court might partially affirm while carving out exceptions

**Evidence: Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 with bipartisan composition in majority and dissent**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Low (~20%) - Bipartisan agreement against the tariffs weakens partisan explanations
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = Moderate-high (~70%) - Bipartisan majority suggests legal rather than political reasoning
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~50%) - The dissent provides some foundation for a partial upholding

**Evidence: Court's recent Major Questions Doctrine jurisprudence**
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = Very low (~5%) - MQD strongly disfavors executive claims to vast economic power
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = High (~80%) - MQD provides a ready-made framework to invalidate the tariffs
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = Moderate (~50%) - MQD might apply differently to different tariff categories

**Evidence: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = Very low (~10%) - The Court wouldn't expedite without intending to rule promptly
- P(E|Any ruling in 2025) = Very high (~90%) - Expedition signals intent to resolve before year-end

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the evidence that both lower courts ruled the tariffs unlawful:

For "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior probability: 15%
- Likelihood ratio: 10%/90% = 0.11
- Posterior odds = 0.15/0.85 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability ≈ 1.9%

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior probability: 40%
- Likelihood ratio: 80%/20% = 4
- Posterior odds = 0.4/0.6 × 4 = 2.67
- Posterior probability ≈ 72.7%

For "Mixed ruling":
- Prior probability: 30%
- Likelihood ratio: 40%/60% = 0.67
- Posterior odds = 0.3/0.7 × 0.67 = 0.29
- Posterior probability ≈ 22.3%

Now updating on the Court's Major Questions Doctrine jurisprudence:

For "Tariffs unlawful" (starting from 72.7%):
- Likelihood ratio: 80%/20% = 4
- Posterior odds = 0.727/0.273 × 4 = 10.66
- Posterior probability ≈ 91.4%

For "Mixed ruling" (starting from 22.3%):
- Likelihood ratio: 50%/50% = 1
- Posterior odds = 0.223/0.777 × 1 = 0.287
- Posterior probability ≈ 22.3% (unchanged)

For "Tariffs lawful" (starting from 1.9%):
- Likelihood ratio: 5%/95% = 0.053
- Posterior odds = 0.019/0.981 × 0.053 = 0.001
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.1%

This is too extreme. Let me adjust for the fact that the Court granted certiorari, which suggests they see some merit in the government's position. Also, the distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs creates a natural path for a mixed ruling.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the Major Questions Doctrine. While relevant, IEEPA explicitly grants emergency powers, unlike some other MQD cases.
- The Court's national security deference might be stronger than I've accounted for, especially for the trafficking tariffs.
- The Court might find a narrow procedural path that avoids the merits entirely.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs while striking down the reciprocal tariffs, creating a mixed ruling.
- The Court might issue a fractured opinion with no clear majority, resulting in an "Other ruling."
- The Court could remand for further factual development on the emergency declaration itself.

**Adjustments needed:**
- Increase probability of "Mixed ruling" - The distinct nature of the two tariff types makes this more likely
- Increase probability of "Other ruling" - The complexity could lead to a fractured Court
- Decrease probability of "Tariffs unlawful" - Too extreme given the Court's grant of certiorari

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis:

**Tariffs lawful: 5%**
- The textual basis in IEEPA is weak
- The Major Questions Doctrine strongly disfavors this outcome
- Both lower courts ruled against the tariffs

**Tariffs unlawful: 45%**
- Strong support from lower court rulings
- Aligns with the Court's recent limitations on executive power
- The reciprocal tariffs especially lack statutory foundation

**Mixed ruling: 35%**
- The trafficking and reciprocal tariffs have different justifications
- The Court often seeks compromise positions
- National security deference might apply differently to different tariffs

**Other ruling: 12%**
- Complex case could produce a fractured opinion
- The Court might find a procedural off-ramp
- Political sensitivity might encourage a narrow ruling

**No 2025 ruling: 3%**
- The expedited schedule makes this unlikely
- Only 16 days remain in 2025, but the Court is aware of the timeline
- The Court recognizes the economic importance of resolving quickly

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 45%  
Mixed ruling: 35%  
Other ruling: 12%  
No 2025 ruling: 3%  
(sum 100%)

This is a careful probabilistic forecast. My reasoning is as follows:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will consider two primary reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

1.  **Deference to Presidential Power in Foreign Affairs/National Security:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. Cases involving emergency powers, like those under IEEPA (*Dames & Moore v. Regan*), often result in victories for the executive branch. This base rate would suggest a high probability (perhaps 60-70%) of the tariffs being upheld in some form, favoring the "Lawful" or "Mixed ruling" options.
2.  **The Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** A more recent and highly relevant base rate comes from the current Court's jurisprudence. In cases with vast economic and political significance, the Court requires "clear congressional authorization" for executive action (*West Virginia v. EPA*). Using IEEPA to impose economy-wide tariffs is a textbook "major question." This base rate suggests a high probability (perhaps 60-70%) of the tariffs being struck down, favoring the "Unlawful" option.

Given the current Court's composition and demonstrated preference for enforcing separation of powers via the MQD, the second base rate is more informative. However, the national security justification cannot be ignored. Therefore, I will start with a blended prior that leans towards the MQD but acknowledges the deference argument: P(Unlawful) at 45%, P(Mixed) at 30%, P(Lawful) at 15%, and small probabilities for procedural outcomes (P(Other)=5%, P(No 2025 ruling)=5%).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This case is unusual and differs from the base cases in key ways:

*   **Novelty and Scale:** This is an unprecedented use of IEEPA. While IEEPA has been used for targeted sanctions, applying it to impose broad tariffs on most of the world's trade is a fundamental shift. This pushes the case out of the traditional "national security deference" bucket and squarely into the "major questions" bucket.
*   **Severability:** The case presents two distinct sets of tariffs. The "trafficking tariffs" (on Mexico, Canada, China) have a colorable, if debatable, link to a national security threat. The "reciprocal tariffs" (based on trade deficits) are a purely economic measure with a very weak link to an IEEPA-style "emergency." This structure makes a "Mixed ruling" a highly plausible outcome, as the Court could easily treat the two sets of tariffs differently.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the scenario:

*   **Evidence:** Two separate federal courts (the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court) have ruled the tariffs unlawful, and a major appellate court (the Federal Circuit) affirmed one of those rulings.
    *   **Assessment (P(E|H)):** This evidence is highly likely if the tariffs are indeed "Unlawful" or if a "Mixed" outcome is correct (as lower courts might not sever the issues). It is very unlikely if the tariffs are "Lawful." This evidence strongly disfavors the "Tariffs lawful" option. The 7-4 split in the Federal Circuit, rather than a unanimous decision, shows the issue is legally contestable, but the majority holding is still strong evidence against the government's position.

*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court granted review on an expedited schedule.
    *   **Assessment (P(E|H)):** This is extremely likely under the "Lawful," "Unlawful," or "Mixed" scenarios, as the Court recognizes the issue's immense national importance. However, it is extremely *unlikely* if there were to be "No 2025 ruling."
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence provides a massive update against the "No 2025 ruling" option, reducing its probability to near zero.

*   **Evidence:** The tariffs are split into two distinct legal and factual justifications (trafficking vs. trade deficits).
    *   **Assessment (P(E|H)):** This structure is highly conducive to a "Mixed ruling." It provides the Court with a clear line to draw, allowing it to strike down the more legally tenuous "reciprocal tariffs" while potentially upholding the "trafficking tariffs" out of deference to national security.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence significantly increases the probability of a "Mixed ruling" relative to the binary "Lawful" or "Unlawful" outcomes.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
1.  **Initial Prior:** P(Unlawful)=45%, P(Mixed)=30%, P(Lawful)=15%, P(Other)=5%, P(No 2025 ruling)=5%.
2.  **Update for Expedited Schedule:** The probability of "No 2025 ruling" drops to ~1%. The freed-up 4% is redistributed, slightly increasing the other options.
3.  **Update for Lower Court Losses:** The consistent rulings against the tariffs make a full government victory ("Lawful") highly improbable. I will drastically reduce the odds of "Lawful," from ~15% down to ~6%, and redistribute that probability mass primarily to "Unlawful" and "Mixed."
4.  **Update for Severability:** The existence of two distinct tariff types with different legal strengths is the most crucial factor. The "reciprocal tariffs" are on very weak ground (likely violating the MQD), while the "trafficking tariffs" are more defensible. This makes a "Mixed ruling" a very attractive and judicially prudent path. I will shift significant probability mass from "Unlawful" (a clean sweep) to "Mixed" (a split decision).

After these updates, my posterior distribution places the highest probabilities on "Mixed ruling" and "Tariffs unlawful," as they represent the most plausible outcomes given the Court's current jurisprudence and the facts of the case.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk is underestimating the appeal of a bright-line rule. A majority of justices (especially the textualists like Gorsuch and Thomas) might prefer a simple, sweeping holding that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs *at all*, regardless of the emergency. This would lead to a "Tariffs unlawful" outcome, not a "Mixed" one. This alternative is highly plausible. My forecast reflects this by placing "Unlawful" as a very close second to "Mixed." Another risk is underestimating the possibility of a procedural punt ("Other ruling") to avoid a politically charged merits decision, which is a known tendency of the Roberts Court. I have assigned a non-trivial 8% to this possibility. A full win for the government ("Lawful") seems very unlikely as it would require the Court to ignore its own recently developed Major Questions Doctrine.

### 6. Final Normalization
I will finalize my probabilities, ensuring they sum to 100%. The core of the forecast is the tension between a "Mixed ruling" (which splits the difference) and a complete "Unlawful" ruling (based on a clean textualist argument).

*   **Mixed ruling (45%):** This allows the Court to curb the most significant executive overreach (the reciprocal tariffs) via the MQD while still showing some deference on the more plausible national security claim (the trafficking tariffs).
*   **Tariffs unlawful (40%):** This reflects the strong possibility that a textualist majority will hold that IEEPA simply does not grant the power to set tariffs, period, invalidating all of them.
*   **Other ruling (8%):** A non-trivial chance the Court finds a procedural off-ramp to avoid a direct ruling on the merits.
*   **Tariffs lawful (6%):** A small chance the Court grants broad deference to the President on all measures, though this runs contrary to recent trends.
*   **No 2025 ruling (1%):** Extremely unlikely given the expedited schedule.

The sum is 100%.

Tariffs lawful: 6%
Tariffs unlawful: 40%
Mixed ruling: 45%
Other ruling: 8%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
