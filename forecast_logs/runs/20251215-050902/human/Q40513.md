### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Appropriations Bills Enacted by January 1 (All Fiscal Years):** Historically, Congress frequently fails to pass all 12 appropriations bills by the October 1 deadline. Action often slips into December. In the last 20 fiscal years (FY2006-FY2025), the number of regular appropriations bills enacted by January 1 has varied widely, from 0 to all 12. However, a common outcome is for a large package (an omnibus or several "minibuses") to be passed in late December, often enacting many or all of the remaining bills at once. The median number of bills enacted by Jan 1 is likely high (e.g., >8), but this is usually driven by a pre-holiday deadline.
2.  **Appropriations Bills Enacted in Divided Government:** During periods of divided government (different parties controlling the House, Senate, or White House), appropriations are more contentious and prone to delays. In these years, the probability of relying on multiple CRs and pushing final action later into the fiscal year increases. The base rate of bills completed by Jan 1 in these years is lower than the overall average.
3.  **Appropriations Bills Enacted in Late December *After* a Stopgap Bill is Already in Place:** This is the most relevant reference class. It is highly unusual for Congress to pass additional full-year appropriations bills between mid-December and Jan 1 *after* having already passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) that funds the government past that period (in this case, to Jan 30). Once deadline pressure is removed and the holiday recess begins, legislative momentum for major bills typically ceases until the new year. The base rate for passing any additional, non-emergency bills in this specific window is near zero.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-01] FY2026 begins with no appropriations bills enacted, triggering a government shutdown. (↓) — Establishes a baseline of extreme partisan gridlock and dysfunction.
*   [2025-11-08] (approx.) Shutdown ends with a deal to pass a CR and a "minibus." (↓) — The CR funds remaining agencies until Jan 30, 2026, critically removing any deadline pressure before the end of the calendar year.
*   [2025-11-09] (approx.) President signs a package enacting three FY2026 bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA). (↓) — This clears the least controversial bills, leaving the nine most difficult ones for future negotiation. The incentive to compromise further before the holidays is now lower.
*   [2025-12-15] Current date. Congress is expected to adjourn for the holiday recess shortly, if it has not already. (↓) — With no deadline and the holidays imminent, there is virtually no political will or logistical capacity to negotiate, conference, and pass complex funding bills.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Deadline Pressure:** The need to avoid a government shutdown or the expiration of a CR is the single most powerful driver of appropriations action. The current CR extends to Jan 30, 2026, completely removing this lever for the remainder of 2025. (Large effect)
2.  **Congressional Calendar & Holiday Recess:** Members of Congress are strongly incentivized to return to their districts for the holidays. Leadership lacks the leverage (like a pending shutdown) to hold them in Washington for difficult negotiations. (Large effect)
3.  **Partisan Polarization:** The background notes the "longest federal government shutdown in US history," indicating that the policy and funding disagreements on the remaining nine bills are severe. This makes quick compromise nearly impossible. (Large effect)
4.  **Complexity of Remaining Bills:** The three passed bills are often the easiest. The remaining nine include contentious bills like Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, and Homeland Security, which require extensive, time-consuming negotiations that cannot be completed in the short time remaining. (Moderate effect)
5.  **Political Will for a "Win":** A party might desire to pass another bill to claim a legislative victory before year's end. However, this is a very weak driver compared to the overwhelming force of the holiday recess and lack of a deadline. (Small effect)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Deadline Has Been Pushed:** Unlike a typical December where a shutdown looms before Christmas, the key deadline is now January 30, 2026. The immediate pressure that forces late-December omnibus bills is absent.
*   **"Easy" Bills Are Already Done:** The three enacted bills are typically among the least controversial. This situation is different from a scenario where all 12 bills are pending, as the remaining legislative lift is disproportionately heavy.
*   **Post-Shutdown Exhaustion:** Coming off a historically long and damaging shutdown, there is likely significant political exhaustion and animosity, reducing the appetite for immediate, good-faith negotiations on the toughest issues.
*   **Short Time Window:** Only 16 days remain until January 1. This is an insufficient amount of time to conference, draft, and pass floor votes in both chambers for any of the complex, remaining bills, especially with the holidays intervening.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Given that 3 bills are already enacted, the question concerns the remaining 9. A reasonable prior, based on the general difficulty of the appropriations process, might be a Poisson distribution with a low mean (e.g., λ=1) for the number of *additional* bills passed by Jan 1.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   CR funding until Jan 30 (↓, Large): This is the knockout blow, removing the primary mechanism (deadline pressure) for any action in December.
    *   Imminent Holiday Recess (↓, Large): This removes the key actors (legislators) from the process.
    *   Extreme Partisanship (evidenced by historic shutdown) (↓, Moderate): This confirms that the remaining bills are subject to deep disagreements, not easily resolved.
    *   Least Controversial Bills Already Passed (↓, Moderate): This increases the average difficulty of the remaining work, making a quick deal on any of them less likely.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides an extremely strong downward update. The posterior probability should be overwhelmingly concentrated on **zero additional bills** being passed.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Emergency session of Congress called by leadership.
    *   Public statements from House/Senate leaders announcing a breakthrough deal on one of the remaining nine bills.
    *   A major, unforeseen national crisis (e.g., war, economic collapse) that compels immediate legislative action.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official House/Senate adjournment for the Christmas/New Year's holiday recess.
    *   Press releases from leadership framing the next deadline as January 30, 2026.
    *   Key committee chairs or party leaders appearing on television from their home states.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Unforeseen Crisis:** A "black swan" event could theoretically force Congress to return and act, potentially attaching a funding bill to an emergency package. This is a very low-probability risk.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution rests on the CRS appropriations table. A bill could theoretically pass on Dec 31 but not be officially recorded by CRS until Jan 1 or later. However, this is moot if no bills pass.
*   **Hypothetical Scenario Interpretation:** The background is a hypothetical future scenario. The analysis assumes the political dynamics described (e.g., "longest shutdown") accurately reflect an environment of extreme gridlock.
*   **"Clean" Bill Possibility:** There is a tiny chance leadership could agree to pass one more relatively non-controversial bill "clean" (without poison pill amendments), but the political environment makes this highly improbable.

### Final Research Summary
Three of the twelve FY2026 appropriations bills have already been enacted. The passage of a continuing resolution funding the government until January 30, 2026, has removed all deadline pressure for further action before the end of the calendar year. Given the imminent holiday recess and the extreme partisan gridlock evidenced by the recent historic shutdown, it is exceptionally unlikely that any of the nine remaining (and more contentious) bills will be passed before 2026. The final number should resolve at 3.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the number of additional appropriations bills enacted before January 1, 2026, a Poisson distribution is appropriate given the discrete nature of the event (number of bills). Historically, when a CR is in place extending past the end of the year, the number of additional bills passed is near zero. Thus, a Poisson distribution with λ=0.5 is a reasonable starting point, reflecting a low expectation of additional bills being passed.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the base case where a CR extends past the end of the year, removing deadline pressure. However, it is different due to the extreme partisanship and recent long shutdown, which further reduce the likelihood of additional bills being passed.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - CR funding until Jan 30 (↓, Large): Strongly decreases the likelihood of additional bills.
   - Imminent Holiday Recess (↓, Large): Further decreases likelihood as Congress is unlikely to act during recess.
   - Extreme Partisanship (↓, Moderate): Reduces likelihood due to deep disagreements.
   - Least Controversial Bills Already Passed (↓, Moderate): Decreases likelihood as remaining bills are more contentious.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a Poisson(λ=0.5), the evidence suggests a strong downward adjustment. The likelihood of zero additional bills is significantly increased, shifting the distribution towards zero. The posterior distribution is heavily skewed towards zero additional bills.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of unforeseen crises or political maneuvers that could lead to additional bills being passed is important but remains low probability. The most plausible alternative scenario involves a single additional bill being passed, but this is unlikely given the current evidence.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong evidence against additional bills being passed, the percentiles reflect a high concentration at zero additional bills.

P40: 3  
P60: 3

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use a base rate focused on the number of appropriations bills enacted after a CR has been passed extending funding well beyond the immediate timeframe.

The most relevant prior is: When Congress has already passed a CR extending funding past January 1st, how many additional appropriations bills typically get enacted before January 1st?

Based on historical patterns in the appropriations process:
- Mean: Approximately 0-1 additional bills
- Variance: Very low (most cases cluster at 0)

This base rate reflects that once deadline pressure is removed via a CR, the legislative momentum for passing appropriations bills before the next deadline dramatically decreases.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- A CR has been passed extending funding until January 30, 2026, removing immediate deadline pressure
- Congress typically enters holiday recess in late December
- Some bills (3) have already been enacted, typically the least controversial ones

**Differences from base rate:**
- The situation follows "the longest federal government shutdown in US history," indicating extreme partisan gridlock
- Only 16 days remain until January 1st, with the holiday recess imminent
- The remaining 9 bills are likely the most contentious ones (since the easier ones were passed first)

These differences generally suggest even less likelihood of additional bills passing compared to the typical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing forecast down:**
- **CR extending to January 30, 2026**: This removes the primary driver of December appropriations action (likelihood ratio ≈ 0.1 for additional bills vs. no additional bills)
- **Imminent holiday recess**: With Congress likely to adjourn soon, the practical window for action is even smaller (likelihood ratio ≈ 0.2)
- **Post-historic shutdown environment**: Indicates extreme partisan division making compromise difficult (likelihood ratio ≈ 0.5)
- **Only the "easy" bills already passed**: The remaining 9 bills are likely more contentious (likelihood ratio ≈ 0.7)

**Evidence pushing forecast up:**
- **Three bills already enacted**: Demonstrates some capacity for compromise, albeit limited (likelihood ratio ≈ 1.2)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered around 0-1 additional bills (beyond the 3 already enacted):

**First update - CR extending to January 30:**
- Prior: P(additional bills) = low but non-zero
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1 (strongly favors zero additional bills)
- Posterior: P(additional bills) becomes extremely low

**Second update - Holiday recess and timing:**
- Prior: Updated P(additional bills) = extremely low
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2 (strongly favors zero additional bills)
- Posterior: P(additional bills) becomes nearly zero

The combined evidence overwhelmingly suggests that no additional bills will be enacted before January 1, 2026. The posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at exactly 3 total bills (the ones already enacted).

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a last-minute breakthrough on a single additional bill
- An unforeseen national emergency could force Congress back into session
- Political incentives to show productivity before year-end might be stronger than typical

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be to assign some probability to 4 bills (3 existing + 1 more). The best argument for this would be that sometimes a single additional bill can move through if it's nearly complete and relatively uncontroversial.

However, given the extreme partisan environment described, the timing constraints, and most importantly the lack of a deadline before January 30, this alternative seems highly unlikely.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the overwhelming evidence that no additional bills will be passed before January 1, 2026, my distribution is heavily concentrated at exactly 3 bills (the ones already enacted), with minimal probability assigned to higher values to account for unforeseen circumstances.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

Answering the question: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks for the total number of appropriations bills enacted by January 1, 2026. We know that 3 of the 12 bills have already been enacted. Therefore, the core of the forecast is to determine how many *additional* bills (from the remaining 9) will be enacted between today (December 15, 2025) and the end of the year.

The most relevant base rate is not the general historical passage of appropriations bills, but rather the frequency of legislative action on major bills in a specific context: **after a continuing resolution (CR) has already been passed that funds the government past the holiday season.**

In such situations, the primary driver for legislative action—an impending deadline—is removed. Congress has a very strong tendency to recess for the holidays and cease substantive work once deadline pressure is off. The base rate for passing additional, complex appropriations bills in the last two weeks of December under these conditions is extremely low, near zero.

My prior distribution for the number of *additional* bills passed is therefore heavily skewed:
- P(0 additional bills) ≈ 95%
- P(1 additional bill) ≈ 4%
- P(>1 additional bills) ≈ 1%

This translates to a prior for the *total* number of enacted bills being overwhelmingly concentrated at 3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is not just a typical example of the base case; it is an extreme one.
- **Similarities:** A CR is in place until January 30, 2026, removing any year-end deadline pressure. The holiday recess is imminent.
- **Differences that strengthen the base case:**
    1.  **Extreme Partisanship:** The background notes the "longest federal government shutdown in US history" just ended. This indicates that the political divisions are exceptionally deep, making compromise on the remaining, more difficult bills even less likely than usual.
    2.  **Remaining Bills are the Hardest:** The three bills already passed (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are typically among the least controversial. The nine remaining bills (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security) are the locus of major partisan fights. There are no "easy wins" left to be had.

These factors suggest the current environment is even more prone to inaction than the historical base rate would imply.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Each piece of evidence strongly points toward zero additional bills being enacted.
- **Evidence:** CR funding until Jan 30, 2026.
  - **Impact:** Strongly negative (↓). This is the most critical piece of evidence. It removes the primary mechanism (deadline pressure) that forces Congress to act. This evidence makes the "no more bills" outcome vastly more likely than any other.
- **Evidence:** Imminent Congressional holiday recess.
  - **Impact:** Strongly negative (↓). This is the practical consequence of the lack of a deadline. Legislators will not be in Washington to negotiate, draft, and vote on complex legislation.
- **Evidence:** Recent "longest government shutdown."
  - **Impact:** Strongly negative (↓). This confirms that the disagreements over the remaining nine bills are not trivial. They require significant political capital and time to resolve, neither of which is available in the next 16 days.
- **Evidence:** The three easiest bills are already done.
  - **Impact:** Negative (↓). This increases the average difficulty of the remaining legislative work, making a quick, last-minute deal on any single bill highly improbable.

All evidence is directionally consistent and mutually reinforcing, arguing for no further legislative action on appropriations this year.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
- **Prior:** Very high confidence (>95%) that the total will be 3.
- **Likelihood:** All available evidence is highly consistent with a total of 3 and highly inconsistent with a total greater than 3.

The overwhelming and concordant evidence serves to confirm and strengthen the prior. The likelihood ratio of this evidence given "0 additional bills" versus "1+ additional bills" is extremely high. The update moves my posterior probability for the total being 3 from ~95% to over 99%. The posterior distribution is now an even sharper spike at the value of 3.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where I might be wrong.
- **Alternative Scenario 1: A "Christmas Miracle" Deal.** Leadership could push through one more of the less-controversial remaining bills to claim a final legislative win for the year.
  - **Rebuttal:** This is highly implausible given the political exhaustion after a historic shutdown and the lack of any motivating deadline. The "win" was ending the shutdown; there is likely no appetite for another major fight before the holidays.
- **Alternative Scenario 2: Emergency Legislation.** A major unforeseen crisis (e.g., natural disaster, national security event) could force Congress to pass an emergency supplemental bill, to which a regular appropriations bill is attached.
  - **Rebuttal:** This is a low-probability tail risk. The probability of such a crisis occurring in the next 16 days is low, and even if it did, it is not guaranteed that an appropriations bill would be attached.
- **Overconfidence Check:** The calibration guidance advises against overconfidence. However, the dynamics of the congressional calendar around major holidays and in the absence of deadlines are one of the most reliable and predictable patterns in US politics. The confluence of factors in this scenario makes a high-confidence forecast appropriate. The probability of any additional bills passing is in the low single digits at best.

My conclusion remains that the final number of enacted bills will be 3. A probability distribution where >90% of the mass is on the integer 3 means that the 10th through 90th percentiles will all be 3.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated on the outcome of 3. The probability of any additional bills passing before the new year is exceedingly small, well under 10%. Therefore, the central 80% of my probability mass falls on the single value of 3.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3
