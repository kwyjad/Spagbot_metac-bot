### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. agricultural import suspensions for major animal diseases (e.g., BSE, Avian Influenza, Foot-and-Mouth Disease).** These events are driven by biosecurity concerns and require rigorous scientific evidence for reversal. Suspensions often last for many months, if not years. The base rate for a suspension of this nature being lifted within ~8 months (May 2025 to Jan 2026) is low, perhaps **10-20%**. This is derived from historical cases like the BSE ban on Canadian cattle (2 years for partial reopening) and various avian flu bans which, even when regionalized, often last 6+ months.
2.  **Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) eradication efforts.** The 2016 NWS outbreak in the Florida Keys provides a more specific analogue. The time from first detection to the official declaration of eradication was approximately 6 months. The current suspension has already been in place for over 7 months (since May 2025). This reference class suggests resolution is plausible within this general timeframe, but the failed reopening in July is a complicating factor. Base rate for resolution within 8 months might be slightly higher, perhaps **30-40%**.
3.  **U.S.-Mexico cross-border trade disputes/suspensions.** These events can be influenced by political factors beyond the stated technical reasons. However, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues like this one are generally governed by established protocols. Quick resolutions are rare once a significant biological risk is confirmed. The base rate for resolving a major SPS suspension in under a year is low.

*Limitations:* Each disease and geopolitical context is unique. NWS is eradicable with known technology (Sterile Insect Technique), unlike BSE, which may suggest a shorter timeline. However, the cross-border nature adds complexity compared to the domestic Florida outbreak.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-13] USDA opens a new sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico. — ↑ — A significant, concrete step in the eradication effort, showing commitment and enhancing capability. However, its impact is medium-term, not immediate.
*   [2025-11-04] USDA Secretary states U.S. is "not ready" to lift the ban but is "pleased with Mexico's efforts." — ↓ — The "not ready" language signals that as of early November, the necessary conditions for reopening had not been met. The positive framing is standard diplomatic language.
*   [2025-07-09] U.S. re-imposes the full suspension after a brief reopening. — ↓ — This "false start" significantly increases the caution level at USDA. It indicates the problem was not under control and raises the burden of proof for any future reopening.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Biological Eradication Progress:** The core driver. Reopening requires a sustained period (likely 60-90 days, or 3-4 screwworm life cycles) with zero new NWS detections in the relevant export zones. This is the primary gatekeeper. (Size: Large)
2.  **APHIS Bureaucratic Process:** USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must conduct a formal risk assessment and verify Mexico's control measures. This is a deliberative, evidence-based process not designed for speed, especially over the holiday period. (Size: Large)
3.  **Economic Pressure from U.S. Industry:** U.S. feedlots, particularly in border states, rely on Mexican feeder cattle. The prolonged ban creates significant financial hardship, generating pressure for a swift resolution. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Political & Diplomatic Relations:** High-level engagement between the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and their Mexican counterpart can accelerate the process, but cannot bypass the core scientific requirements. (Size: Small to Moderate)
5.  **Risk of NWS Re-establishment in the U.S.:** This is the countervailing pressure. The cost of a new NWS infestation in the U.S. would be astronomical, far outweighing the economic losses from the import ban. This strongly incentivizes extreme caution from USDA. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The "False Start" Reopening:** The failed reopening on July 7-9 is highly unusual and indicates a significant misjudgment of the situation at the time. This will have damaged credibility and forced USDA to adopt a much more stringent, "no-mistakes" posture, likely prolonging the current suspension beyond a typical timeline.
*   **Short Resolution Horizon:** The question resolves in just over two weeks (Dec 15 to Jan 1), which includes the Christmas and New Year holiday period when government agency work typically slows. This is an extremely compressed timeframe for any significant policy reversal.
*   **Known Eradication Technology:** Unlike diseases with no clear cure or control method, NWS can be defeated with the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). The recent opening of a new SIT facility is a powerful tool, but its effects are not instantaneous. The question is whether enough progress was made *before* this facility came online.
*   **Proximity and Volume:** The U.S.-Mexico cattle trade is massive and integrated. The economic stakes are higher than for many other agricultural bans, creating intense, conflicting pressures on policymakers.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior from the reference classes, perhaps centered around 20-30%, reflecting that lifting a major animal disease ban within ~8 months is possible but not common. An equivalent n of ~10 historical cases seems reasonable.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The failed reopening in July strongly suggests the initial problem was underestimated and will lead to extreme institutional caution.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The USDA's "not ready" statement as of early November makes a December resolution highly improbable, as the required 60-90 day zero-detection window could not have started much before then.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The very short time remaining (<3 weeks) combined with the holiday season makes the completion of necessary bureaucratic steps unlikely.
    *   (↑ Small) The new sterile fly facility is positive news, but its impact on the ground will not be felt and verified in time to meet the deadline.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The prior should be revised significantly lower. The combination of the failed reopening, the recent "not ready" statement, and the holiday-shortened timeline are powerful negative indicators.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A high-level joint announcement from the U.S. and Mexican Secretaries of Agriculture setting a firm date for reopening.
    *   Official USDA/APHIS publication of a new risk assessment concluding the NWS risk is mitigated.
    *   Reports from cattle industry groups (e.g., NCBA) citing private briefings from USDA about an imminent reopening.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Any official report or media leak of a new NWS detection in northern Mexico.
    *   Official statements from either government that mention a 2026 timeline for key milestones (e.g., "fully operational" facilities, "joint review in Q1 2026").
    *   Silence. With only two weeks remaining, a lack of any official announcement is a strong signal that the deadline will be missed.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The true state of the eradication effort in Mexico is known by only a few officials. Public statements are managed and may not reflect the complete reality.
*   **Political Wildcard:** While unlikely to override a clear biological risk, an unexpected high-level political deal could be struck, though this is a low-probability event for an SPS issue.
*   **Holiday Slowdown:** Standard bureaucratic timelines may not apply during the late-December holiday period, likely slowing any potential progress toward reopening.
*   **Definitional Nuance:** "Reopen" could theoretically mean a partial or conditional reopening (e.g., only for cattle from NWS-free certified regions), which might meet the resolution criteria. However, the prompt implies a general resumption.

**Final Research Summary:**
The reopening of U.S. cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is highly unlikely. The combination of a failed prior attempt, the long surveillance periods required to prove pest freedom, and the extremely short, holiday-constrained timeline create formidable barriers to a reversal of the current policy.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for lifting a major animal disease ban within ~8 months is low, around 20-30%, based on historical cases of similar suspensions. This is informed by the typical duration of such bans and the complexity involved in resolving biosecurity concerns.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a biosecurity concern (NWS) similar to past cases like BSE or avian flu, which typically require extensive evidence and time to resolve.
   - Differences: The presence of a known eradication method (Sterile Insect Technique) and the economic importance of U.S.-Mexico cattle trade could potentially expedite the process, though the failed reopening in July suggests increased caution.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Failed reopening in July: Strongly decreases probability. Indicates initial underestimation of the problem and increased caution.
   - USDA's "not ready" statement: Decreases probability. Suggests that necessary conditions for reopening have not been met.
   - New sterile fly facility: Slightly increases probability. Shows commitment to eradication, but impact is not immediate.
   - Short timeframe and holiday period: Decreases probability. Makes completion of necessary steps unlikely.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 20-30% (0.25 odds)
   - Likelihood ratio for failed reopening and "not ready" statement: Strongly negative, suggesting a significant decrease in probability.
   - Posterior odds: Adjusted downward significantly due to strong negative evidence.
   - Posterior probability: Likely below 10% after considering all evidence.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: Consider the possibility of a partial reopening or unexpected political intervention, though these remain low-probability events.
   - Alternative forecast: A partial reopening could occur, but the evidence strongly suggests a full reopening is unlikely before 2026.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong negative indicators, maintain a low probability estimate.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Based on the base rate, evidence evaluation, and Bayesian updating, the probability of the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 is very low.

Final: 5%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the U.S. reopening cattle imports from Mexico within the next ~2 weeks (from Dec 15, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026).

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Historical agricultural import suspensions due to animal diseases
- Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) eradication efforts
- U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade dispute resolutions

Looking at these reference classes:
- Major animal disease import bans typically last many months to years
- The 2016 NWS outbreak in Florida took about 6 months to eradicate
- The current ban has already been in place for 7 months (since May 2025)
- There was a failed reopening attempt in July 2025

Given these factors, I'll set a prior of **20%** that the ban will be lifted before January 1, 2026. This reflects that while some disease-related bans are resolved within this timeframe, the failed reopening attempt suggests this case may take longer than average.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a standard agricultural import suspension based on a specific biological threat
- The disease (NWS) has known eradication methods (Sterile Insect Technique)
- There are economic pressures to resume trade

**Key differences:**
- The failed reopening in July 2025 is unusual and suggests the problem was more persistent than initially thought
- We have only ~2 weeks remaining until the resolution date, which includes the holiday season when government processes typically slow down
- The USDA Secretary's November 4 statement indicated they were "not ready" to lift the ban, suggesting significant hurdles remained at that time
- A new sterile fly dispersal facility was opened in November, which is positive but may not have had sufficient time to demonstrate effectiveness

These differences, particularly the failed reopening and the very short timeframe remaining, suggest the probability should be adjusted downward from the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Failed reopening in July 2025**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted by Jan 1, how likely was a failed reopening? Moderately unlikely (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If the ban will not be lifted by Jan 1, how likely was a failed reopening? Quite likely (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.30/0.80 = 0.375
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: USDA Secretary's "not ready" statement on Nov 4, 2025**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted by Jan 1, how likely was this statement? Somewhat unlikely (~40%)
- P(E|~H): If the ban will not be lifted by Jan 1, how likely was this statement? Very likely (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.40/0.90 = 0.444
- This evidence decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: New sterile fly facility opened in November 2025**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted by Jan 1, how likely was this development? Quite likely (~80%)
- P(E|~H): If the ban will not be lifted by Jan 1, how likely was this development? Moderately likely (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.80/0.60 = 1.333
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Short timeframe remaining with holiday season**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted by Jan 1, how likely is this timing constraint? Very unlikely (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If the ban will not be lifted by Jan 1, how likely is this timing constraint? Not relevant (100%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.20/1.0 = 0.20
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on failed reopening:**
- Prior odds: 0.20/(1-0.20) = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.375 = 0.09375
- Posterior probability: 0.09375/(1+0.09375) ≈ 8.6%

**Update on "not ready" statement:**
- Prior odds: 0.086/(1-0.086) ≈ 0.094
- Likelihood ratio: 0.444
- Posterior odds: 0.094 × 0.444 ≈ 0.042
- Posterior probability: 0.042/(1+0.042) ≈ 4.0%

**Update on new sterile fly facility:**
- Prior odds: 0.040/(1-0.040) ≈ 0.042
- Likelihood ratio: 1.333
- Posterior odds: 0.042 × 1.333 ≈ 0.056
- Posterior probability: 0.056/(1+0.056) ≈ 5.3%

**Update on short timeframe remaining:**
- Prior odds: 0.053/(1-0.053) ≈ 0.056
- Likelihood ratio: 0.20
- Posterior odds: 0.056 × 0.20 ≈ 0.011
- Posterior probability: 0.011/(1+0.011) ≈ 1.1%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 1.1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the political pressure to resume trade, especially if there are economic impacts on U.S. cattle producers
- There could be unpublicized progress in the eradication efforts that would allow for a surprise announcement
- The USDA might implement a partial reopening for cattle from specific regions of Mexico that are certified NWS-free

**Alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might put the probability at 10-15%, arguing that:
- The sterile fly facility could have had immediate impact
- High-level diplomatic negotiations might accelerate the process
- The economic impact on U.S. producers might force a faster resolution

**Rebuttal:**
While these factors could increase the probability somewhat, they don't overcome:
1. The need for scientific verification of NWS eradication (typically requiring 60-90 days of monitoring)
2. The extremely short timeframe remaining (less than 2 weeks)
3. The holiday season slowdown in government operations
4. The caution induced by the failed July reopening

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for potential political factors and unpublicized progress, but not substantially.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that there is a very low probability that the United States will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026.

The combination of the failed reopening attempt, the recent "not ready" statement from the USDA Secretary, the scientific requirements for verifying eradication, and the extremely short timeframe remaining (which includes the holiday season) all point to a resolution date beyond January 1, 2026.

I'll adjust my final probability slightly upward from 1.1% to 3% to account for potential unpublicized developments and political factors.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is the lifting of a major international agricultural import suspension due to a serious animal disease. I will consider two reference classes:
1.  **General Major Animal Disease Suspensions:** Historical cases like BSE (mad cow disease) or Avian Influenza often involve suspensions lasting many months or even years. The research report notes the BSE ban on Canadian cattle took two years for even a partial reopening. The base rate for lifting such a ban within an 8-month timeframe (May 2025 to Dec 2025) is low. I'd estimate this at **P(H) = 15%**.
2.  **Specific New World Screwworm (NWS) Eradications:** The 2016 NWS outbreak in Florida was eradicated in about 6 months. This suggests that with focused effort and known technology (Sterile Insect Technique), a resolution within the 8-month timeframe is plausible. This reference class would suggest a higher base rate, perhaps **P(H) = 35%**.

The current situation is a hybrid: it involves the specific, technically "solvable" NWS problem but adds the complexity of cross-border verification and diplomacy, which aligns it more with the general class of major suspensions. I will therefore select a prior that blends these two, leaning towards the more cautious general case.

**Initial Prior: 20%**. This reflects that while technically possible within the timeframe, the cross-border nature makes it less likely than a purely domestic issue. In odds, this is 0.20 / 0.80 = 1:4.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The situation involves a scientifically-validated biosecurity risk, a cautious regulatory body (USDA/APHIS), and significant economic pressure from industry. This is typical for such events.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **The "False Start":** The most significant difference is the failed reopening in July. A ban was lifted and then reimposed within 48 hours. This is highly unusual and indicates the initial assessment of the risk was flawed. This event dramatically increases the level of caution and the burden of proof required from Mexico for any subsequent reopening.
    *   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves by January 1, 2026. As of December 15, 2025, only 16 days remain. This period includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays, during which government agency work, especially major policy announcements, typically slows down or halts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that the U.S. reopens cattle imports from Mexico before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Failed reopening in July 2025.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The likelihood of a "false start" *if* the issue is ultimately resolved quickly (by Dec 2025) is low. It suggests a chaotic process, not a smooth, rapid resolution.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The likelihood of a "false start" *if* the issue is protracted and not resolved by Dec 2025 is high. It's a strong signal that the problem was underestimated and will take a long time to fix.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: USDA Secretary's statement on Nov 4, 2025: "not ready" to lift the ban.**
    *   Eradicating NWS requires a surveillance period of several pest life cycles (e.g., 60-90 days) with zero detections to prove it is gone. If the USDA was "not ready" on November 4, it is almost biologically and bureaucratically impossible for this required surveillance period to have started and been completed in time for a pre-2026 reopening.
    *   P(E2 | H): The likelihood of this statement if a reopening is imminent is very low.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): The likelihood of this statement if the reopening is *not* imminent is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This is another piece of very strong negative evidence.

*   **Evidence 3: The remaining time is 16 days, including major holidays.**
    *   P(E3 | H): The likelihood of a major, scientifically-vetted agricultural policy being reversed and implemented in the last two weeks of December is extremely low.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): The likelihood of inaction during this period if the ban is not being lifted is extremely high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This is a third piece of very strong negative evidence.

*   **Evidence 4: A new sterile fly facility opened in Mexico on Nov 13.**
    *   This is positive news for the medium-to-long term eradication effort. However, its impact is not immediate. It does not change the fact that the required surveillance window could not have been completed by the deadline.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio ≈ 1.** This evidence has a negligible impact on the short-term forecast.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 20% (1:4 odds).

1.  **Update for the "False Start":** This event significantly increases the required burden of proof. I'll apply a likelihood ratio of 1/4.
    *   Posterior Odds = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.
    *   New Probability ≈ 6%.

2.  **Update for the Nov 4 "not ready" statement & timeline:** This is the most conclusive evidence. It makes a 2025 resolution almost impossible from a process standpoint. The combination of this statement and the holiday-shortened timeline is devastating to the "Yes" case. I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio of 1/10 for this.
    *   Posterior Odds = (1/16) * (1/10) = 1/160.
    *   New Probability = 1 / 161 ≈ 0.6%.

The formal update drives the probability to well below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Could I be wrong? The primary way this forecast fails is if a purely political decision overrides the scientific and bureaucratic process. For example, immense economic pressure from U.S. ranchers could lead to a high-level deal announced as a "Christmas gift" to the industry. This might involve a partial reopening for states certified as NWS-free.

However, the reputational and biological risk of a *second* failed reopening would be catastrophic for the USDA. After the July failure, the institutional incentive is to be excessively cautious, not to rush. The lack of any recent "leading indicators" (e.g., positive rumors, preparatory statements) makes a surprise announcement highly improbable. The most likely scenario is that the process continues into Q1 2026. My low probability already accounts for the small chance of a political "wildcard" event.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial base rate of 20% is overwhelmed by three powerful pieces of evidence: the failed July reopening, which necessitates extreme caution; the USDA's "not ready" status as of early November, which makes the required surveillance timeline impossible to meet before 2026; and the extremely short, holiday-constrained time remaining. These factors make a reopening before January 1, 2026, extraordinarily unlikely. The probability is not zero, but it is very close to it.

Final: 2%
