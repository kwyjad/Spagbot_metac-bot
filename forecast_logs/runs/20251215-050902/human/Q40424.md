### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Judicial Resignations During Major Pakistani Constitutional Crises:** The most relevant reference class is the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement, when President Musharraf suspended the Chief Justice and imposed a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO). While dozens of judges were removed for not taking the PCO oath, outright "resignations" in protest were less common than non-compliance. However, the event established a precedent for a large-scale judicial standoff. **Base Rate:** A crisis of this magnitude could plausibly see 5-15 judges from the superior courts either resign or be removed. This is a weak prior due to different mechanisms (dismissal vs. structural change).
2.  **"Normal" Attrition from Pakistan's Superior Judiciary:** In non-crisis years, resignations are extremely rare. Judges typically serve until the mandatory retirement age of 65 (Supreme Court) or 62 (High Courts). Unprompted resignations for personal or political reasons are almost unheard of. **Base Rate:** <1 resignation per year across all superior courts. This class serves as a lower bound, but is not representative of the current situation.
3.  **Judicial Responses to Power-Stripping Legislation Globally:** In other countries where executives have moved to curb judicial power (e.g., Poland, Hungary), the response is typically a mix of protest, legal challenges, and international condemnation. Mass resignations are rare; a few high-profile judges may resign on principle, but most tend to remain, either to fight from within or due to a lack of alternatives. **Base Rate:** 2-5 high-profile resignations, with the majority of judges remaining in their posts.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-13** Passage of the 27th Amendment, fundamentally altering the judiciary. — ↑ (Large) — This is the primary causal event triggering the crisis and potential resignations.
*   **2025-11-13** Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resign in protest. — ↑ (Large) — Sets a powerful precedent from two of the most senior and respected judges, establishing a floor of 2 and signaling the gravity of the situation.
*   **2025-11-15** Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns, citing the amendment. — ↑ (Moderate) — Shows the protest extends beyond the Supreme Court to the High Courts, increasing the chance of a broader movement. The total is now 3.
*   **~2025-11-25** (Inferred) Major Bar Associations (e.g., Supreme Court Bar Association) condemn the amendment and support the resigning judges but stop short of calling for mass resignations, instead focusing on nationwide protests and legal challenges. — ↓ (Moderate) — The organized legal community is channeling resistance into protest rather than a resignation cascade, providing cover for judges to remain.
*   **2025-11-16 to 2025-12-14** A full month passes since the initial wave of resignations with no further public announcements of resignations from the superior courts. — ↓ (Large) — This is strong evidence that a widespread, immediate cascade of resignations has not materialized. The window for resignations as a primary form of protest may be closing.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand on Judicial Independence:** The amendment is a direct assault on the judiciary's power and autonomy. Judges with a strong commitment to constitutionalism and the rule of law are the most likely to resign. (Driver for initial resignations; Large effect).
2.  **Solidarity and Peer Effects:** The resignations of highly respected senior judges like Shah and Minallah create pressure on others to follow suit to avoid being seen as complicit. A "resignation cascade" is a plausible mechanism. (Potential for large effect, but appears to have stalled).
3.  **Government Co-option and Coercion:** The government can use both carrots and sticks. The threat of punitive transfers (now constitutional) or being sidelined is a powerful deterrent. Conversely, appointments to the new, powerful Federal Constitutional Court could be offered as an incentive to remain compliant. (Driver against resignations; Large effect).
4.  **Pressure from Bar Associations:** Strong, unified calls from the country's powerful bar associations for judges to resign would significantly increase the likelihood of more departures. The absence of such a call provides judges with a rationale to stay. (Currently a neutral/dampening factor; Moderate effect).
5.  **Personal Career and Financial Considerations:** Resignation entails the loss of a prestigious position, salary, and pension. For many judges, especially those further from retirement, this is a significant personal cost that weighs against a principled resignation. (Driver against resignations; Large effect).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Structural vs. Direct Attack:** Unlike the 2007 crisis which began with the dismissal of a single judge, this is a fundamental, legislative restructuring of the entire judicial system. This may be perceived as more insidious, potentially leading to fewer immediate, reactive resignations and more calculated, long-term responses.
*   **Creation of a New Power Center:** The establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court creates a new institutional path. This differs from past crises where the choice was binary (accept the new order or leave). Now, there is a third option: aspire to a position in the new court, which may encourage compliance among the ambitious.
*   **Initial Resignations from the Top:** The first to resign were among the most senior and respected judges. This could either inspire a mass movement (a cascade) or, conversely, be seen as a sufficient symbolic sacrifice, allowing other judges to feel the "protest has been registered" while they remain to "fight from within." The latter seems to be occurring.
*   **Civilian Government Facade:** While the changes are widely seen as military-backed, they were passed by an elected parliament. This provides a veneer of legitimacy that a direct military decree (like the 2007 PCO) lacks, making the decision to resign more complex for some judges.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on historical crises, a prior centered on 5-10 resignations seems plausible, reflecting the amendment's severity. A Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution centered around 6 with high variance (equivalent n of ~4) would capture this initial belief.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Three resignations (2 SC, 1 HC) occurred immediately, confirming the crisis is real and setting a hard floor of 3 for the Nov-Dec period.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The resignations came from highly respected, senior judges, increasing the potential for a cascade.
    *   (↓↓ Large) A full month has passed since the initial resignations with no follow-on. This is the most powerful piece of evidence, suggesting the cascade has failed and a new, tense equilibrium has been reached.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The focus of organized resistance (bar associations, opposition parties) is on street protests and legal challenges, not a campaign for mass judicial resignations.
*   **Net effect:** The initial evidence confirmed a crisis, but the subsequent lack of new resignations strongly pulls the forecast down. The posterior should be heavily anchored on the 3 resignations that have already occurred, with a rapidly decaying probability for higher numbers. The posterior mean should shift significantly downward from the initial prior of ~6 to a value just above 3 (e.g., 3.5-4.5).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Another high-profile judge, particularly a Chief Justice of a High Court, resigns.
    *   The Supreme Court Bar Association or Pakistan Bar Council explicitly calls for judges to resign.
    *   The government uses its new transfer powers punitively against a dissenting judge, triggering a backlash.
    *   Mass protests escalate dramatically, leading to a broader breakdown of state authority.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The current Chief Justice of Pakistan makes a public statement urging judges to remain in their posts to safeguard the institution from within.
    *   The government announces the first slate of appointments to the Federal Constitutional Court, including sitting judges from the High Courts (signaling co-option).
    *   The period until December 31 passes with no further resignations.
    *   Protests organized by the opposition TTAP fail to gain significant traction.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Lag:** A resignation may not be made public immediately. There is a risk of a delay between a judge's decision and the media report.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria specify "resign." This excludes judges who may be transferred against their will, effectively sidelined, or who refuse to hear cases but do not formally resign. The forecast is strictly for formal resignations.
*   **Volatility:** The political situation is extremely tense. A single unpredictable event, such as a violent crackdown or a key political assassination, could dramatically alter the calculations of every judge in the country overnight.
*   **Fictional Scenario:** This analysis is based on a provided fictional scenario and sources. The dynamics are modeled on real-world Pakistani politics, but the specific events are not real.

**Final Research Summary:** The 27th Amendment created a constitutional crisis severe enough to trigger the immediate, principled resignations of three senior judges. However, the subsequent month of inaction is strong evidence that a wider resignation cascade is not materializing, as most judges appear to be opting for a "wait-and-see" approach or internal resistance over departure.

To forecast the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate 1:** Historical crises like the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement suggest 5-15 judges could resign or be removed. However, this is a weak prior due to different mechanisms (dismissal vs. structural change).
   - **Base Rate 2:** In non-crisis years, resignations are rare, typically <1 per year. This serves as a lower bound but is not representative of the current situation.
   - **Base Rate 3:** Global examples of judicial responses to power-stripping legislation suggest 2-5 high-profile resignations, with most judges remaining.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** A combination of Base Rate 1 and Base Rate 3, centered around 5-10 resignations, reflecting the amendment's severity and the initial wave of resignations.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation is a significant constitutional crisis, similar to past events that led to judicial resignations.
   - **Difference:** The structural nature of the amendment and the creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court provide alternative paths for judges, potentially reducing the number of resignations.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Three resignations (2 SC, 1 HC) occurred immediately:** Confirms the crisis and sets a floor of 3 resignations. (↑ Large)
   - **No further resignations in a month:** Strong evidence against a widespread resignation cascade. (↓↓ Large)
   - **Focus on protests and legal challenges by bar associations:** Dampens the likelihood of more resignations. (↓ Moderate)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 6 resignations with high variance.
   - **Evidence:** The lack of further resignations strongly pulls the forecast down.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Shifts to just above 3, reflecting the 3 confirmed resignations and the reduced likelihood of more.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider tail risks like a sudden political event triggering more resignations.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A new wave of resignations if the government takes punitive actions against judges.
   - **Adjustment:** Slightly widen the distribution to account for these risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted number of resignations is centered around 3-4, with a slight chance of more due to unforeseen events.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 4  
P80: 5  
P90: 6

# Forecasting: How many judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts will resign during late 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll consider several reference classes:

1. **Recent Pakistani judicial crisis resignations**: We already have 3 resignations (2 Supreme Court, 1 High Court) in direct response to the 27th Amendment.

2. **Historical Pakistani judicial crises**: During the 2007-2009 Lawyers' Movement, while many judges were removed, voluntary resignations were rare. Most judges either complied or were dismissed for non-compliance.

3. **Global judicial power-stripping events**: In countries like Poland, Hungary, and Turkey, when executive branches curtailed judicial independence, typically only a small number (2-5) of high-profile judges resigned in protest, while most remained.

Given these reference classes, I'll use a prior centered around 5 resignations, with significant uncertainty (standard deviation of ~3). This reflects that judicial resignations are rare events, but the current constitutional crisis is severe enough to trigger some principled stands.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases:**
- Like previous crises, this involves a fundamental restructuring of judicial power
- The amendment has clear political motivations to consolidate power
- There's organized opposition from legal communities and political parties

**Key differences:**
- The amendment creates a new power center (Federal Constitutional Court) rather than just removing judges
- The first resignations came from highly respected senior judges, potentially creating cascade effects
- The amendment was passed by an elected parliament, giving it a veneer of democratic legitimacy
- The amendment includes mechanisms (like forced transfers) that could pressure judges without requiring resignation

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers:**
- Three judges have already resigned, establishing a floor of 3 (strong evidence)
- The resigning judges are highly respected, potentially inspiring others (moderate evidence)
- The amendment fundamentally alters judicial independence, a core principle for many judges (strong evidence)

**Evidence supporting lower numbers:**
- A full month has passed since the initial resignations with no new ones reported (very strong evidence)
- Opposition has focused on protests rather than calling for mass judicial resignations (moderate evidence)
- Personal career and financial considerations create strong incentives to remain (moderate evidence)
- The new Federal Constitutional Court creates opportunities for ambitious judges (moderate evidence)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 5 resignations, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **Update on initial resignations**: The immediate resignation of 3 judges confirms the severity of the crisis and establishes a hard floor. This shifts my distribution rightward slightly.

2. **Update on the month of inaction**: The lack of additional resignations for a full month strongly suggests that a cascade effect is not materializing. This significantly pulls my distribution leftward and concentrates it near the current count of 3.

3. **Update on opposition strategy**: The focus on protests rather than judicial resignations provides judges with an alternative way to express opposition. This further reduces the likelihood of many more resignations.

My posterior distribution is now centered around 4 resignations (down from my prior of 5), with much less variance. The distribution is right-skewed, reflecting the possibility of a few more resignations while acknowledging the strong evidence that a mass exodus is unlikely.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the lag between decisions to resign and public announcements
- The situation remains volatile; a single triggering event could cause a sudden wave of resignations
- There could be behind-the-scenes pressure or negotiations not visible in public reporting
- I might be overweighting the significance of the one-month gap without resignations

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 6-8 resignations, arguing that the initial three resignations represent early adopters, and more judges will follow as the implications of the amendment become clearer. However, the month-long gap without new resignations strongly contradicts this view.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: If the government begins using its transfer powers punitively, it could trigger a wave of resignations (10+ judges)
- Lower tail: The 3 resignations we've seen might be the complete set if the government successfully co-opts remaining judges

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 4
P60: 5
P80: 6
P90: 7

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
The target variable is the number of judicial resignations during a major constitutional crisis in Pakistan. I will use two reference classes to form a prior:
- **2007 Pakistani Lawyers' Movement:** This crisis saw dozens of judges defy the executive, though most were removed rather than resigning. The research report suggests a base rate of 5-15 judges leaving their posts in a crisis of this magnitude.
- **Global Responses to Judicial Power-Stripping:** In countries like Poland or Hungary, such events typically lead to a few (2-5) high-profile resignations, but not a mass exodus.
Blending these, I will establish a prior distribution centered around 6 resignations, with a wide tail to account for the possibility of a resignation cascade. This prior reflects the severity of a Pakistan-specific crisis but is tempered by the global norm where mass resignations are rare.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**
The current situation differs from the 2007 crisis in key ways that suggest a lower number of resignations:
- **Legislative Mechanism:** The changes were passed via a constitutional amendment, which provides a veneer of legitimacy that a direct military order (like the 2007 PCO) lacks. This makes the decision to resign more complex.
- **Creation of a New Power Center:** The establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court creates an incentive for ambitious judges to remain in the system, hoping for an appointment to this new, powerful body. This acts as a strong deterrent against resigning.

These factors suggest that while the crisis is severe, the ultimate number of resignations might be lower than in the 2007 precedent.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
I will evaluate three key pieces of evidence:
1.  **Initial Resignations (↑ Large):** Three senior judges (two from the Supreme Court, one from a High Court) resigned immediately after the amendment's passage in mid-November. This confirms the crisis is severe enough to trigger resignations and sets a hard floor of 3 for the final count. This evidence strongly pushes the forecast up from a non-crisis baseline.
2.  **One Month of Inaction (↓↓ Large):** A full month has passed from the initial resignations (Nov 15) to the present (Dec 15) with no further announcements. This is the most powerful piece of evidence. A "resignation cascade" relies on momentum. The loss of momentum for a month is strong evidence that other judges have considered their options and decided to stay. This evidence makes high numbers (10+) extremely unlikely and dramatically pulls the forecast down.
3.  **Stance of Bar Associations (↓ Moderate):** The major bar associations have condemned the amendment but have focused resistance on protests and legal challenges, not on calling for mass resignations. This provides political cover for judges to remain in their posts, arguing they are "fighting from within." This removes a key potential driver for more resignations.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
- **Prior:** A distribution centered around 6 (e.g., median of 6, P90 of 15).
- **Update 1 (Evidence of 3 resignations):** The prior is truncated at 3. The probability mass shifts towards numbers slightly higher than 3, as the crisis is confirmed to be real. The median might shift to 7.
- **Update 2 (Evidence of one month's silence):** This is a powerful update. The likelihood of observing a month of silence is very high if the final number is 3, but very low if the final number is 15. Applying Bayes' Rule (`Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood`), the probability mass is overwhelmingly pulled back down towards the current floor of 3.
- **Posterior:** The resulting posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at 3. The median is now 3. The mean is slightly above 3 (perhaps 3.3) to account for the small but non-zero probability of one or two more resignations before the end of December.

**5. Red Team Thinking**
My forecast is heavily reliant on the "month of silence" being a definitive signal that the resignation cascade has failed.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A new triggering event could occur in the final two weeks of December. For example, the government could use its new powers to punitively transfer a judge, sparking a new, reactive resignation.
- **Critique:** This is a plausible tail risk. While a mass cascade is now very unlikely to restart, a one-off resignation in response to a new provocation is possible. My forecast should reflect this.
- **Adjustment:** I will keep the median firmly at 3, as this is the most likely outcome. However, I will assign a non-trivial probability to the final number being 4 or 5 to account for the tail risk of a new triggering event. My P80 and P90 will reflect this possibility, ensuring the forecast is not overconfident in the number remaining exactly 3.

**6. Final Percentiles**
My final distribution is heavily skewed, with most of the probability mass on 3, and a rapidly decaying tail for higher numbers.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 4
P90: 5
