### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Iran-IAEA Access Disputes (2002-Present):** This class includes numerous instances where Iran has restricted, delayed, or denied IAEA access to sites, personnel, or data, often followed by protracted negotiations leading to a resolution. In most cases, a deal is eventually reached, but typically over months or years, not weeks. The base rate for reaching an agreement *within a single month* of a major dispute is very low, estimated at **5-10%**. This is derived from observing negotiation cycles that typically involve multiple rounds of talks and IAEA Board of Governors meetings.
2.  **Post-Military Strike Nuclear Inspections:** This class includes cases where a country's nuclear facilities were attacked by a foreign power (e.g., Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981, Syria's Al Kibar facility in 2007). In these cases, voluntary and timely cooperation with the IAEA post-strike was non-existent. Access was typically only granted after a significant geopolitical realignment or regime change. The base rate for voluntary cooperation within a year, let alone weeks, is near **0%**.
3.  **High-Stakes Diplomatic "Deals" on Short Deadlines:** This class considers major international agreements finalized under extreme time pressure. While such deals happen, they almost always follow months of preparatory back-channel talks. A deal emerging "cold" in under three weeks is exceptionally rare. The base rate for a new, public agreement of this magnitude materializing with so little lead time is likely **<5%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-12-12** IISS analysis notes the suspension of IAEA inspections has rendered Iran's nuclear program status "unclear," deepening regional security concerns. — **(↓)** — Highlights that the information vacuum created by denying access is a known, ongoing state of affairs, reducing the urgency for Iran to change course.
*   **2025-11-12** IAEA Board of Governors report (GOV/2025/65) is issued. (Content not specified, but these reports typically detail non-compliance). — **(↓)** — Formalizes Iran's non-cooperation, likely hardening positions on both sides and making a quick, amicable resolution less probable before the new year.
*   **2025-10-20** Iran announces the September deal with the IAEA is "void," scrapping the agreement to resume inspections. — **(↓↓)** — This is the most significant recent event. It's a direct reversal, indicating that internal forces (likely hardliners) are strongly opposed to cooperation and have won the policy debate.
*   **2025-09-09** Iran and the IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections at the bombed nuclear sites. — **(↑)** — Showed that a faction within Iran was, at least briefly, willing and able to negotiate a compromise, establishing a possible template for a future deal.
*   **2025-06-25** Iranian lawmakers overwhelmingly vote to suspend cooperation with the IAEA following the US/Israeli strikes. — **(↓)** — Demonstrates a strong, unified political reaction against cooperation, driven by nationalistic and security concerns, setting a high political barrier to reversal.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Domestic Political Pressure (Hardliners vs. Pragmatists):** Following a direct military attack, hardline factions (e.g., IRGC, conservative clerics) are politically ascendant. They will frame any cooperation as capitulation. Reaching a deal requires pragmatists to overcome this intense opposition. **Effect size: Large (↓)**
2.  **Bargaining Leverage:** Iran perceives the ambiguity around its 400kg stockpile of 60% enriched uranium as a powerful deterrent and a crucial bargaining chip. Allowing inspections would reveal the status of this material (damaged, intact, moved) and surrender that leverage. **Effect size: Large (↓)**
3.  **Desire for De-escalation & Sanctions Relief:** Iran's economy is fragile, and the regime may wish to avoid another, potentially more devastating, military conflict. Allowing inspections could be a key step to signal a desire for de-escalation and open a path toward sanctions relief. **Effect size: Moderate (↑)**
4.  **Technical & Safety Imperatives:** The bombed sites may pose radiological risks. Iran might need IAEA technical assistance for assessment, containment, and cleanup, providing a non-political rationale for granting access. **Effect size: Small (↑)**
5.  **International Pressure & Legitimacy:** Iran may seek to avoid further censure or referral to the UN Security Council. A minimal cooperative gesture could be a low-cost way to placate international actors (excluding the US/Israel) and appear reasonable. **Effect size: Small (↑)**
6.  **The Short Timeline:** The resolution window is only ~16 days and includes the Christmas/New Year holiday period in the West, a time when high-level diplomacy slows. Negotiating the complex modalities of such a sensitive inspection is nearly impossible in this timeframe. **Effect size: Large (↓)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Post-Attack Humiliation:** Unlike past disputes over undeclared activities, this is about inspecting the rubble of facilities destroyed in a direct military attack. National pride and the "resistance" narrative make cooperation politically toxic in a way that previous standoffs were not.
*   **Known High-Value Stockpile:** The IAEA's specific estimate of 400kg of 60% HEU at the sites raises the stakes immensely. This isn't a theoretical or historical issue; it's about a near-weapons-grade stockpile whose status is a top-tier global security concern.
*   **US Administration Stance:** The context mentions a Trump administration, which historically favored a "maximum pressure" campaign over the patient diplomacy that characterized the JCPOA era. Iran likely perceives little chance of receiving significant concessions from the US in exchange for inspections, reducing their incentive to cooperate.
*   **Recent Deal Reversal:** The explicit scrapping of the September deal in October is a powerful and recent signal. The reference class of "access disputes" doesn't typically feature such a rapid, public agreement-and-reversal cycle, suggesting current internal dynamics are exceptionally volatile and tilted against cooperation.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior, informed by the base rate of resolving major access disputes on a sub-one-month timeline (~5-10%). Given the post-attack context, a prior of **~10%** seems reasonable, with a low "equivalent n" due to the unique circumstances.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The October 20th scrapping of the September inspection deal is the most powerful recent evidence, showing anti-cooperation forces are in control.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The overwhelming parliamentary vote in June established a strong domestic political baseline against cooperation that is difficult to reverse.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The extremely short (~16 day) timeline makes the logistics of a diplomatic breakthrough exceptionally difficult.
    *   (↑ Small) The September 9th deal, though reversed, proves that a technical agreement is possible and a faction exists that supports it.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The recent, high-salience reversal of a prior agreement should significantly lower the initial prior. The posterior probability should be substantially lower than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Reports of secret back-channel talks, likely mediated by Oman or Qatar.
    *   A major speech by the Supreme Leader or President softening rhetoric and emphasizing the need for "technical cooperation" with the IAEA.
    *   A significant, public de-escalatory gesture from the US/E3 (e.g., easing specific sanctions).
    *   Leaked reports of radiological concerns at one of the bombed sites.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Public statements from IRGC commanders or hardline politicians vowing to never allow inspectors access to the sites.
    *   Iran beginning to move rubble or equipment from the sites without IAEA supervision.
    *   New threats or military posturing from Iran, Israel, or the US.
    *   An announcement of a new round of sanctions by the US.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Ambiguity:** The question resolves on an "announcement of an agreement." This could be a vague, non-binding "agreement in principle" that Iran has no intention of honoring, but which would still resolve the question as "Yes."
*   **Deception & Misinformation:** Both sides may use leaks and public statements to posture. A reported "deal" could be a trial balloon or a deliberate misdirection.
*   **Black Swan Events:** The situation is highly volatile. A domestic crisis in Iran, a new military incident, or a major political event in the US could dramatically alter the calculus in a very short time.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** We have no insight into the true state of the damaged facilities or the internal debates within the Iranian regime. Our analysis is based on external observation of a highly opaque system.

**Final Research Summary:** An agreement before 2026 is highly improbable. The combination of a post-military strike political environment hostile to perceived capitulation, the strategic value of keeping the uranium stockpile's status ambiguous, and the recent, decisive reversal of a previous inspection deal creates formidable obstacles that are unlikely to be overcome in the ~16-day timeframe.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate for this event is derived from historical instances of Iran-IAEA access disputes and post-military strike nuclear inspections. Given the context of a recent military strike and the subsequent political environment, the base rate for Iran allowing inspections within a short timeframe is extremely low. Historical data suggests a base rate of **5-10%** for resolving such disputes quickly, but given the post-strike context, a more conservative prior of **5%** is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Historical reluctance of Iran to allow inspections post-dispute.
- The strategic value of enriched uranium stockpiles as a bargaining chip.

**Differences:**
- The recent military strike adds a layer of national pride and resistance narrative, making cooperation politically toxic.
- The explicit reversal of a prior agreement indicates strong internal opposition to inspections.

These differences suggest a lower probability than the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **October 20th Reversal:** The scrapping of the September deal is a strong indicator of internal opposition, decreasing the likelihood of cooperation. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **June Parliamentary Vote:** Demonstrates a strong political baseline against cooperation, further decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Short Timeline:** The logistical difficulty of negotiating a deal in ~16 days is high, decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **September 9th Deal:** Indicates that a faction within Iran is open to negotiation, slightly increasing the probability. Likelihood ratio slightly more than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 5%, the overwhelming evidence against cooperation (October 20th reversal, June vote, short timeline) suggests a significant downward adjustment. The September 9th deal provides minimal upward pressure.

Using a conceptual Bayesian update:
- Prior odds = 5% / 95% = 0.0526
- Likelihood ratio (combined evidence) is significantly less than 1, suggesting a downward adjustment.
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
- Posterior probability = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds)

Given the strong downward evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted to approximately **1%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The unique post-strike context and recent deal reversal justify a low probability, but we must consider potential diplomatic surprises.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden geopolitical shift or internal Iranian crisis could alter the situation, but these are low-probability events.
- **Rebuttals:** The September deal shows some willingness to negotiate, but the reversal and political climate heavily outweigh this.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 1%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for Iran allowing IAEA inspections in the specific context of post-military strike conditions with a very short timeframe (only about 16 days remaining in 2025).

Looking at historical patterns of Iran-IAEA relations, particularly after significant confrontations:

- Iran has a history of restricting IAEA access during periods of heightened tension
- Negotiations for renewed access typically take months or years, not days
- The specific context (post-bombing of nuclear facilities) is unprecedented in Iran-IAEA relations
- The extremely short timeframe (16 days) severely limits diplomatic possibilities

The most relevant reference class is "Iran allowing IAEA inspections shortly after major confrontations or sanctions." In such cases, Iran typically takes a hardline stance initially, followed by protracted negotiations before any concessions.

Given these factors, I'll set a low prior probability of **8%** that Iran will allow IAEA inspections before January 1, 2026.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran is in a confrontational stance with Western powers
- The IAEA is seeking access to verify nuclear activities
- Iran's leadership faces domestic political pressure to resist external demands

**Key differences that matter:**
- The facilities in question were directly bombed by the US and Israel, creating unprecedented national humiliation
- Iran explicitly reversed a previous inspection agreement (September deal scrapped in October)
- The timeline is extremely compressed (only 16 days remain)
- The stakes are unusually high (400kg of 60% enriched uranium)
- The Iranian parliament overwhelmingly voted to suspend IAEA cooperation

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of Iran allowing inspections compared to the base case. The direct military attack on sovereign territory creates a much stronger political imperative to resist cooperation than typical diplomatic disputes.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran scrapped the September inspection deal in October**
- P(E|H): If Iran were going to allow inspections by year-end, it's unlikely they would have explicitly voided a previous agreement so recently
- P(E|~H): If Iran does not intend to allow inspections, publicly voiding the agreement is exactly what we'd expect
- Likelihood ratio: Very low (approximately 0.2)
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Only 16 days remain in 2025**
- P(E|H): If inspections were to be allowed, we would expect to see preliminary diplomatic signals by now
- P(E|~H): The short timeframe is consistent with no agreement being reached
- Likelihood ratio: Low (approximately 0.5)
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: The facilities were directly bombed by the US and Israel**
- P(E|H): If Iran were to allow inspections after such an attack, it would represent an extraordinary diplomatic concession
- P(E|~H): Refusing inspections after a military attack is the expected nationalist response
- Likelihood ratio: Very low (approximately 0.3)
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Iran previously agreed to inspections in September**
- P(E|H): This demonstrates that some faction within Iran was willing to consider inspections
- P(E|~H): The subsequent reversal suggests this faction lost the internal debate
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly above 1 (approximately 1.2)
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 8% (odds of 1:11.5), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on Evidence 1 (deal scrapped in October):**
- Prior odds: 0.08 ÷ 0.92 = 0.087
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 0.2 = 0.0174
- Posterior probability: 0.0174 ÷ (1 + 0.0174) = 1.7%

**Update on Evidence 3 (facilities bombed):**
- Prior odds: 0.017 ÷ 0.983 = 0.0173
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3
- Posterior odds: 0.0173 × 0.3 = 0.00519
- Posterior probability: 0.00519 ÷ (1 + 0.00519) = 0.52%

**Update on Evidence 2 (short timeframe):**
- Prior odds: 0.0052 ÷ 0.9948 = 0.00522
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.00522 × 0.5 = 0.00261
- Posterior probability: 0.00261 ÷ (1 + 0.00261) = 0.26%

**Update on Evidence 4 (previous agreement):**
- Prior odds: 0.0026 ÷ 0.9974 = 0.00261
- Likelihood ratio: 1.2
- Posterior odds: 0.00261 × 1.2 = 0.00313
- Posterior probability: 0.00313 ÷ (1 + 0.00313) = 0.31%

After considering all key evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 0.3%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of secret negotiations already in progress
- Iran might see a strategic advantage in a last-minute concession to reset relations
- Technical concerns about radiation leakage might create urgent practical reasons for cooperation
- The question resolves on "announcement of an agreement" - this could be a non-binding statement of intent rather than actual inspections

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran might announce a very limited, symbolic inspection agreement as a diplomatic gesture
- A third-party mediator (Russia, China, or EU) might broker a face-saving compromise
- Iran might allow inspections of only one site as a partial concession

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability estimate. The possibility of a symbolic or limited agreement that technically satisfies the resolution criteria deserves more weight. However, the fundamental constraints (timeframe, political context) remain extremely limiting.

## 6. Final Forecast

After careful consideration of the base rate, specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess there is a very low probability that Iran will allow IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile before 2026. The combination of national pride after a military attack, the recent explicit rejection of inspections, and the extremely short timeframe make an agreement highly unlikely.

Final: 1%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is a high-stakes diplomatic agreement between Iran and the IAEA on a very short timeline. I will consider two reference classes:
1.  **Iran-IAEA Access Disputes:** Historically, Iran and the IAEA have had numerous disputes over access. Resolutions, when they occur, typically take many months or even years of protracted negotiation. The base rate for resolving a major dispute and announcing a deal within a one-month timeframe is very low, estimated from the research report at 5-10%.
2.  **Post-Military Strike Inspections:** The more specific reference class involves countries granting nuclear inspections after a military attack on their facilities (e.g., Iraq 1981, Syria 2007). In these cases, voluntary cooperation in the short term is virtually non-existent (near 0%).

Given the severity of the current situation, the second reference class is more salient. However, to avoid starting at zero, I will select a conservative prior from the first class, acknowledging that some form of deal is not impossible.
**Initial Prior: 5%** (or 1-in-20 odds) for an agreement to be reached in such a short period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from a standard Iran-IAEA dispute in several critical ways, all of which make an agreement less likely:
*   **Post-Attack Humiliation:** The inspections concern sites recently destroyed in a war. For the Iranian regime, allowing access can be framed internally by hardliners as a capitulation to the enemy, making it politically toxic.
*   **Heightened Stakes:** The issue is not a minor discrepancy but the status of a known, large stockpile (400kg) of near-weapons-grade (60%) enriched uranium. The ambiguity surrounding this stockpile is a significant source of strategic leverage for Iran, which would be surrendered upon inspection.
*   **Recent Policy Reversal:** Iran agreed to a deal in September and then publicly and explicitly scrapped it in October. This is not a simple failure to agree; it is a demonstrated reversal, indicating that anti-cooperation factions have recently won the internal political debate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence against the hypothesis (H) that "Iran will announce an agreement before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: The October 20th scrapping of the September deal.**
    *   This is much more likely to have occurred if Iran does *not* intend to make a new deal soon (P(E|~H) is high) than if it does (P(E|H) is low). This is a strong piece of evidence against H.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)): << 1 (Decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence 2: The extremely short timeline (~16 days) including Western holidays.**
    *   Complex diplomatic agreements are rarely concluded this quickly without extensive prior back-channel work. The holiday period further complicates logistics. This timeline is much more consistent with the default outcome of no agreement.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Decreases probability).**

*   **Evidence 3: The existence of the now-defunct September 9th deal.**
    *   This is the primary evidence *for* H. It demonstrates that a technical agreement is possible and that a faction within Iran is willing to make one. It provides a template for a future deal.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio: > 1 (Increases probability).** However, its positive weight is heavily counteracted by the fact it was reversed.

The net effect of the evidence is strongly negative. The recent, deliberate act of scrapping a deal is a more powerful signal of current intent than the fact that a deal was once possible.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I start with a prior of 5% (1:19 odds).

1.  **Prior Odds:** 1:19
2.  **Update on Evidence:** The most significant evidence is the October deal reversal, which signals that hardliners are in control. This is a very strong negative update. Combined with the post-attack political toxicity and the short timeline, the initial odds should be reduced by at least an order of magnitude. For instance, a combined likelihood ratio of 1/10 for all the negative evidence would change the odds.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1:19) × (1/10) = 1:190.
3.  **Posterior Probability:** A 1:190 odds ratio corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 190) ≈ 0.5%.

This formal update results in a very low probability. I will adjust this slightly based on red-teaming.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis might be underestimating the possibility of a "cheap talk" resolution. The question resolves "Yes" on the *announcement* of an agreement, not its implementation. Iran could be motivated by a sudden external threat or a desire to de-escalate tensions to make a vague, non-binding "agreement in principle." This would cost them little in practice but would satisfy the resolution criteria. This scenario represents the most plausible path to a "Yes" outcome. This possibility suggests that a probability below 1% might be too low, as it doesn't sufficiently account for strategic maneuvering and the low bar for resolution. Therefore, I will adjust my final probability upward from the strict Bayesian calculation to account for this tail risk.

### Final Forecast
The political environment in Iran following the military strikes is extremely hostile to cooperation with the IAEA. The recent, explicit cancellation of a previous inspection deal is a powerful signal that hardline factions are in control of this policy. Combined with the extreme time pressure, the chances of a genuine diplomatic breakthrough are minuscule. However, the possibility of a purely symbolic "announcement" to manage international pressure or de-escalate a new crisis cannot be entirely dismissed. This small possibility is the only factor keeping the probability from being near-zero.

Final: 3%
