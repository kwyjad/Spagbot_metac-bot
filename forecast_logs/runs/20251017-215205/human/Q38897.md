### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Aggressive Inflation Stabilization Programs ("Shock Therapy"):** This class includes countries that implemented rapid, drastic fiscal and monetary reforms to quell very high inflation or hyperinflation (e.g., Israel 1985, Bolivia 1985, Poland 1990). Success is not guaranteed, but when it works, inflation can fall dramatically within 12-24 months. Getting YoY inflation from >200% to <30% within two years is ambitious but has historical precedent. **A ballpark base rate for success in this class might be 30-40%.** Limitation: The political and institutional context of each case is highly unique.
2.  **Argentine Stabilization Attempts (Post-1980s):** Argentina has a long history of failed attempts to control inflation, often due to an inability to sustain fiscal discipline, leading to policy reversals and a collapse in credibility. This reference class is extremely pessimistic. **The base rate for achieving sustained, low inflation is near 0%.** Limitation: This historical pattern may not apply if the current political regime and policy mix are fundamentally different.
3.  **Recent High-Inflation Emerging Markets (non-hyperinflation):** This class includes countries like Turkey that have struggled with persistent high inflation (e.g., 50-80%) but have not implemented a full-scale shock therapy program of the Milei variety. These cases typically show inflation being sticky and difficult to reduce without a major policy regime shift. This class is less relevant as Argentina's policy shift has already occurred.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The resolution is ~2 months away; this timeline emphasizes the last 6 months based on the provided (hypothetical) sources.

-   **2025-04-01** YoY inflation reported at 47.3%. — ↑ — Confirms the disinflationary trend is strong and continuing well into 2025, making the sub-30% target more plausible.
-   **2025-04-24** World Bank upgrades Argentina's 2025 growth forecast to 5.5%. — ↑ — Signals external confidence in the economic program's viability, suggesting the painful recession is ending, which may increase political sustainability.
-   **2025-07-07** OECD report praises fiscal consolidation and forecasts strong 2025 growth. — ↑ — Provides strong third-party validation of the core mechanism (fiscal surplus) driving the disinflation.
-   **2025-10-14** IMF revises its 2025 year-end inflation forecast up to 41.3%. — ↓ — A key institutional forecaster and creditor sees significant headwinds, suggesting the "last mile" of disinflation will be difficult and the target may be missed.
-   **2025-10-17** GIS report notes Milei's continued focus on the economic plan. — ↑ — Indicates that policy commitment from the executive, the primary driver of the program, remains unwavering despite challenges.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Fiscal Consolidation:** (Large ↑) The government's "no deficit" rule, enforced via the "motosierra" (chainsaw) spending cuts, has eliminated the primary reason for monetary emission. Sustaining this is the central pillar of the entire program.
2.  **Exchange Rate Anchor:** (Large ↑) After the initial large devaluation, the central bank has managed a slow "crawling peg." This serves as a powerful anchor for tradable goods prices and inflation expectations. Its stability is crucial.
3.  **Credibility and Expectations:** (Moderate ↑) By consistently beating pessimistic inflation forecasts, the government has built significant credibility. This helps anchor public and business expectations, creating a self-reinforcing disinflationary cycle.
4.  **Political & Social Sustainability:** (Large ↓) The program's austerity has caused a severe recession and increased poverty. The primary risk is that social unrest or political opposition forces a populist reversal of fiscal or monetary policy.
5.  **Relative Price Adjustment:** (Moderate ↓) The ongoing removal of energy and transport subsidies creates periodic upward price pressures. These adjustments can make the final descent of headline inflation to below 30% stickier than anticipated.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
This case is compared to the "Shock Therapy" reference class.

-   **Severity of Fiscal Adjustment:** Argentina's fiscal turnaround from a ~3% deficit to a ~2% primary surplus in one year is exceptionally rapid and severe, arguably more so than many historical precedents.
-   **Political Structure:** Unlike many past reformers who commanded legislative majorities, President Milei governs with a very small minority in Congress. He relies heavily on executive decrees and popular support, a potentially less stable foundation for long-term reform.
-   **Lack of External Financing:** The program was initiated without significant new external financing, relying almost entirely on domestic fiscal cuts and reserve accumulation. This "autarkic" approach is unusual and demonstrates extreme initial discipline.
-   **Starting Point:** Argentina began with deeply negative central bank reserves and zero access to international credit markets, making its starting position significantly worse than many other countries that underwent shock therapy.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Starting from the "Shock Therapy" reference class, a prior of **~35% (equivalent n=10)** seems appropriate, acknowledging that such programs are difficult and more likely to fail than succeed.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Large) The speed and magnitude of the observed disinflation (from 292% to 47% YoY) has dramatically outperformed expectations.
    -   (↑ Large) The core mechanism—achieving and maintaining a primary fiscal surplus—has been successfully implemented and validated by external bodies like the OECD.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The recent IMF forecast revision to 41.3% is a significant piece of negative evidence from a highly credible source, suggesting potential for sticky inflation.
    -   (↓ Small) The underlying social and political risks, while not having derailed the plan yet, remain a persistent background threat.
    -   (↑ Moderate) Optimistic forecasts from private sector analysts (Moody's, Santander) provide a counterweight to the IMF's pessimism.
-   **Net effect:** The overwhelming weight of the observed data (dramatic disinflation) and the successful implementation of the core causal mechanism (fiscal surplus) should drive a very large upward update to the posterior, despite the IMF's cautionary note.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (probability of YES increases):**
    -   October and November 2025 monthly inflation prints come in at or below 2.0%.
    -   Government continues to report a primary fiscal surplus in its monthly reports.
    -   The gap between the official and parallel ("blue") exchange rates remains narrow.
    -   Central Bank continues to accumulate foreign reserves.
-   **DOWN indicators (probability of YES decreases):**
    -   Monthly inflation re-accelerates to 3.0% or higher.
    -   Major legislative defeats for the government's 2026 budget or key reforms.
    -   Significant labor strikes or social protests that disrupt economic activity.
    -   A sharp, unexpected devaluation of the official exchange rate.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Sharp Cutoff:** The question resolves on "strictly less than 30.0%". An outcome of 30.0% or 30.1% resolves as "No". Forecasts like Moody's (projecting 30% exactly) fall on the "No" side of this line.
-   **Policy Volatility:** The entire forecast is contingent on policy continuity. A political crisis, cabinet reshuffle, or loss of public support could lead to a rapid policy reversal, making all current data irrelevant.
-   **Data Lag:** The resolution data for December 2025 will only be released by INDEC in mid-January 2026. The question will resolve after the period in question has passed.
-   **"Last Mile" Problem:** The dynamics of reducing inflation from 50% to 30% can be very different and more difficult than reducing it from 200% to 50%, due to wage pressures and inertia.
-   **External Shocks:** A sudden spike in global commodity prices or a sharp global downturn could negatively impact Argentina's trade balance and fiscal accounts, complicating the disinflationary effort.

### Final Research Summary
The Milei administration's orthodox shock therapy has engineered a disinflation far faster than most observers expected, lending strong support to a "Yes" resolution. The forecast hinges on a simple trade-off: the powerful, observed momentum of fiscal consolidation and falling inflation versus the persistent risk of political instability or "last mile" stickiness flagged by the IMF.

To forecast whether Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** We start with the "Shock Therapy" reference class, which has a base rate of success in reducing inflation to below 30% at around 30-40%. Given the aggressive fiscal and monetary reforms implemented by the Milei administration, this reference class is appropriate.
- **Initial Prior:** Let's choose a prior probability of 35%, reflecting the historical success rate of similar aggressive stabilization programs.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Argentina's current situation is similar to past successful shock therapy cases in terms of the rapid and severe fiscal adjustments and the implementation of a crawling peg exchange rate.
- **Differences:** The political context is less stable, with Milei governing without a legislative majority, and the starting economic conditions were more severe, with deeply negative reserves and no external financing.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Disinflation Trend:** The reduction from 292% to 47.3% YoY inflation by April 2025 is a strong indicator of successful policy implementation. This evidence strongly increases the probability of achieving sub-30% inflation.
- **Fiscal Surplus:** The achievement of a primary fiscal surplus is a key mechanism for disinflation, validated by external bodies like the OECD. This evidence also increases the probability.
- **IMF Forecast:** The IMF's revision to a 41.3% forecast for year-end inflation suggests challenges in reaching the target, decreasing the probability.
- **Political Risks:** Ongoing social and political risks could derail the program, slightly decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 35% probability translates to odds of 0.35 / 0.65 = 0.538.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong disinflation trend and fiscal surplus (large positive evidence), let's assume a likelihood ratio of 2.0. The IMF forecast and political risks (negative evidence) might have a likelihood ratio of 0.7.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.538 × 2.0 × 0.7 = 0.753.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.753 / (1 + 0.753) ≈ 43%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be optimistic given the IMF's caution and the potential for political instability.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A political crisis or external economic shock could rapidly change the outlook. Conversely, continued policy adherence and positive economic indicators could further improve the probability.
- **Adjustment:** Considering these factors, a slight downward adjustment to account for tail risks is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is adjusted to reflect a balanced view of the situation.

Final: 40%

# Will Argentina's year-over-year inflation be below 30% for December 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the "Aggressive Inflation Stabilization Programs" reference class as my primary base rate. These are cases where countries implemented rapid fiscal and monetary reforms to address very high inflation, similar to what Argentina is currently doing under Milei.

Historical examples in this reference class include:
- Israel 1985
- Bolivia 1985
- Poland 1990
- Brazil 1994 (Real Plan)

In these cases, when such programs work, inflation can fall dramatically within 12-24 months. The success rate for bringing inflation from >200% to <30% within two years appears to be around 30-40% based on historical precedents.

However, I need to adjust this base rate by considering Argentina's specific history with inflation stabilization attempts, which has been poor. Argentina has a long history of failed attempts to control inflation due to inability to sustain fiscal discipline.

Given these considerations, I'll start with a prior probability of 35% that Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025.

Prior odds: 35/65 = 0.538

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- Argentina is implementing a classic "shock therapy" approach with rapid fiscal consolidation
- The program includes a strong exchange rate anchor after initial devaluation
- There's a clear focus on eliminating fiscal deficits as the root cause of inflation
- The starting inflation rate (211-292%) is comparable to other cases in the reference class

**Key differences:**
- Argentina's fiscal adjustment has been exceptionally rapid and severe (from ~3% deficit to ~2% primary surplus in one year)
- President Milei governs with a very small minority in Congress, making the political foundation potentially less stable
- The program was initiated without significant external financing, relying almost entirely on domestic fiscal cuts
- Argentina began with deeply negative central bank reserves and zero access to international credit markets

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Rapid disinflation already achieved**
- Argentina's inflation has already fallen from 292% (April 2024) to 47.3% (April 2025)
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If inflation will end up below 30%, we would expect to see this rapid decline
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if inflation stalls above 30%, we might still see initial rapid decline
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.3 = 3.0
- This evidence significantly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Fiscal consolidation success**
- The government has achieved and maintained a primary fiscal surplus
- OECD report (July 2025) validates the fiscal consolidation
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Fiscal discipline is essential for achieving <30% inflation
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.2) - Without fiscal discipline, <30% inflation is nearly impossible
- Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.2 = 4.75
- This evidence strongly increases probability

**Evidence 3: IMF forecast revision to 41.3%**
- IMF recently (October 2025) revised its year-end inflation forecast up to 41.3%
- P(E|H): Low (~0.15) - If inflation will be <30%, the IMF would likely forecast closer to that target
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If inflation will remain >30%, the IMF forecast would reflect this
- Likelihood ratio: 0.15/0.8 = 0.1875
- This evidence significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Economic growth returning**
- World Bank upgraded Argentina's 2025 growth forecast to 5.5% (April 2025)
- P(E|H): Moderately high (~0.7) - Economic recovery supports disinflation
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Growth can occur even with inflation >30%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.4 = 1.75
- This evidence moderately increases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.538 (35% probability)

First update (rapid disinflation):
Posterior odds = 0.538 × 3.0 = 1.614
Posterior probability = 1.614/(1+1.614) = 0.617 or 61.7%

Second update (fiscal consolidation):
Posterior odds = 1.614 × 4.75 = 7.667
Posterior probability = 7.667/(1+7.667) = 0.885 or 88.5%

Third update (IMF forecast):
Posterior odds = 7.667 × 0.1875 = 1.438
Posterior probability = 1.438/(1+1.438) = 0.590 or 59.0%

Fourth update (economic growth):
Posterior odds = 1.438 × 1.75 = 2.517
Posterior probability = 2.517/(1+2.517) = 0.716 or 71.6%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the recent disinflation success and underestimating the "last mile" problem
- The IMF's forecast of 41.3% should be taken very seriously as they have expertise and access to detailed data
- Political sustainability remains a major risk that could derail the program
- The December 2025 cutoff is tight - even if the trend is right, timing might be off

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Inflation could stall in the 35-45% range due to wage pressures and relative price adjustments
- Political opposition could force policy compromises in late 2025
- External shocks (global recession, commodity price spikes) could disrupt the disinflation path

**Adjustments needed:**
- The Bayesian calculation may have overshot due to the multiplicative effect of updates
- Need to account for the "last mile" problem and the IMF's expertise more heavily
- Should consider the precise 30% threshold and timing issues

Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast downward from the 71.6% calculated above. The IMF forecast of 41.3% is particularly concerning, as they have expertise and access to detailed information. The "last mile" of disinflation is often the hardest.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the base rate, and the red team analysis, I believe the probability that Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025 is 60%.

Final: 60%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "Aggressive Inflation Stabilization Programs" or "shock therapy." These are radical attempts to curb very high inflation through drastic fiscal and monetary reforms. Historical examples include Israel (1985), Bolivia (1985), and Poland (1990). These programs have a mixed record of success; they are high-risk, high-reward endeavors. The research report suggests a success rate of 30-40% for achieving significant disinflation within a two-year timeframe. I will select the midpoint of this range as my prior.

*   **Prior Probability P(H):** 35%
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.35 / (1 - 0.35) = 0.54 to 1.

This prior reflects that, at the outset of such a program, failure is more likely than success.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in Argentina under President Milei fits the "shock therapy" model well. However, there are key differences:
*   **Similarities:** The policy mix of eliminating the fiscal deficit ("no deficit" rule), halting monetary financing of the government, and using an exchange rate anchor is classic shock therapy.
*   **Differences (Pro):** The fiscal adjustment has been exceptionally severe and rapid, arguably more so than in many historical cases. This strengthens the core mechanism for disinflation. The program has also succeeded thus far without significant new external financing, demonstrating remarkable domestic discipline.
*   **Differences (Con):** President Milei governs with a small minority in Congress, making the political foundation of the reforms potentially fragile and reliant on executive power and popular support. Argentina's starting point, with deeply negative reserves and no market access, was also worse than many precedents.

On balance, the extreme success of the fiscal consolidation so far is a strong positive differentiator, while the political fragility remains a key vulnerability.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The current date is October 17, 2025, so we are evaluating evidence very close to the resolution period.

*   **Evidence 1: Rapid Disinflation (Strong Positive):** Year-over-year (YoY) inflation has fallen dramatically from a peak of 292% to 47.3% by April 2025. This is a powerful signal that the program is working as intended. The likelihood of observing such a rapid fall if the program were on track to succeed (P(E|H)) is very high, while the likelihood if it were failing (P(E|~H)) is very low. This gives a **high likelihood ratio (>1)**.
*   **Evidence 2: Sustained Fiscal Surplus (Strong Positive):** The government has successfully implemented its "motosierra" (chainsaw) cuts and maintained a primary fiscal surplus, which has been praised by external bodies like the OECD. This is the core causal driver of the disinflation. Its successful implementation is strong evidence for H. This also has a **high likelihood ratio (>1)**.
*   **Evidence 3: IMF Forecast Revision (Strong Negative):** On October 14, 2025, the IMF revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast *up* to 41.3%. This is a significant negative signal from a credible, data-rich institution, made very close to the resolution date. It suggests that the "last mile" of disinflation will be difficult and that the target will be missed. The likelihood of the IMF making this specific forecast if inflation were truly headed below 30% (P(E|H)) is low, whereas it's much more plausible if inflation is set to remain above 30% (P(E|~H)). This gives a **low likelihood ratio (<1)**.
*   **Evidence 4: History of Beating Forecasts (Moderate Positive / Negative Attenuator):** The background material explicitly notes that forecasts for Argentina's inflation under Milei have "consistently been wrong to the high side." This suggests a systematic pessimistic bias in conventional models. This evidence doesn't directly support H, but it significantly weakens the negative impact of the IMF forecast. It effectively increases the likelihood ratio of the IMF's forecast, making it less impactful.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will start with the prior and update based on the evidence.

1.  **Prior Odds:** 0.54 (35% probability).
2.  **Update with Strong Positive Evidence:** The combined evidence of massive, faster-than-expected disinflation and the successful implementation of the underlying fiscal mechanism is overwhelming. This suggests Argentina is firmly in the "successful shock therapy" part of the reference class. This would dramatically increase the odds. A conservative 4x multiplier on the odds seems appropriate.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.54 × 4 = 2.16
    *   Implied Probability ≈ 68%
3.  **Update with IMF's Negative Forecast (attenuated):** The IMF's forecast of 41.3% is a strong negative signal. However, given the documented history of pessimistic forecast errors, we should not take it at face value. Instead of a very strong downward update, it should be a moderate one. Let's model this with a likelihood ratio of 0.7, which reduces the odds but doesn't reverse the overall positive picture.
    *   Final Odds = 2.16 × 0.7 = 1.51
    *   **Final Probability** = 1.51 / (1 + 1.51) ≈ 60.2%

This final probability reflects that success is now the more likely outcome, but the IMF's warning about "last mile" stickiness and the sharp <30.0% cutoff introduce significant uncertainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~60% could be wrong for several reasons.
*   **Too High:** I might be underestimating the "last mile" problem. Reducing inflation from 50% to 30% is often harder than from 200% to 50% due to sticky wages and regulated prices. The IMF's forecast might be accurately capturing this dynamic, and my discounting of it might be a mistake. The sharp cutoff at <30.0% means an outcome of 30.1% (which is very plausible) resolves as "No".
*   **Too Low:** I might be giving too much credit to a single IMF forecast, which is just one data point against a powerful 18-month trend of disinflation that has consistently outperformed expectations. The disinflationary momentum, driven by a firm fiscal and monetary anchor, could continue unabated, pushing inflation well below 30%.

The Manifold market forecast of 61.2% provides a good sanity check and aligns closely with my reasoning. My final number should be in this vicinity. I will adjust slightly higher to 63% to put a little more weight on the powerful demonstrated trend of beating pessimistic expectations.

### 6. Final Forecast
My final probability is based on a 35% prior derived from historical shock therapy programs. This prior is strongly updated upwards by the exceptional success of Argentina's fiscal consolidation and the resulting rapid disinflation over the past 18 months. This positive evidence is tempered by a recent pessimistic IMF forecast, but the impact of that forecast is itself dampened by the program's consistent history of outperforming such predictions. The balance of evidence suggests that achieving the sub-30% target is now more likely than not, but significant risks related to policy sustainability and "last mile" inflation stickiness remain.

Final: 63%
