### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What are the stated policies and public stances of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic regarding AI safety and potential pauses?** This involves looking for official documents like safety frameworks, responsible scaling policies, and key leadership statements.
*   **Q2: What are the primary incentives and disincentives for these companies to announce a pause?** Incentives include managing existential risk, pre-empting regulation, and public relations. Disincentives include intense competitive pressure, commercial obligations to investors (like Microsoft and Google), and the belief that continued development is necessary for national competitiveness.
*   **Q3: What would constitute a plausible trigger for a pause before 2026?** This requires understanding what kind of "dangerous capability" would be severe enough to overcome the strong disincentives to pausing. This could be an internal red-teaming discovery or a public AI-related incident.
*   **Q4: What do recent events and statements (within the last 6 months, given the Nov 2025 date) indicate about their current trajectory?** This involves analyzing the provided sources and other recent news to gauge whether the companies are leaning more towards acceleration or caution.

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **For Q1:**
    *   `OpenAI Preparedness Framework details`
    *   `Anthropic Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) triggers`
    *   `Google DeepMind AI safety principles OR policy on pauses`
    *   `Sam Altman OR Dario Amodei OR Demis Hassabis on pausing AI training`

    *   `AI Safety Summit Seoul OR France outcomes 2025`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The provided sources paint a picture of a fundamental conflict. On one hand, there is an intense, commercially-driven race to achieve more powerful AI, with OpenAI's CEO predicting significant scientific breakthroughs by 2026 and the company forecasting massive revenue growth. This creates enormous momentum *against* any pause. On the other hand, OpenAI has, in November 2025, issued stark public warnings about "potentially catastrophic" risks, explicitly stating that capabilities are advancing faster than public perception. This rhetoric, combined with pre-existing safety frameworks (like OpenAI's Preparedness Framework and Anthropic's RSP), creates a plausible mechanism and justification for a pause. The core tension is whether a latent risk will manifest in a concrete, undeniable way that is sufficient to overcome the immense competitive and financial inertia before the deadline. The very short time horizon (today is Nov 14, 2025; resolution is Jan 1, 2026) makes this a high bar to clear.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

The brief will be structured according to the required format, integrating the synthesized findings. The base rate will be established as very low. Recent developments will highlight the conflicting signals from the November 2025 OpenAI announcements versus the competitive landscape. Mechanisms will focus on the "dangerous capability discovery" trigger versus the "competitive pressure" blocker. The Bayesian update will start from a low prior and be nudged slightly upward by the recent explicit risk warnings, but heavily constrained by the short timeline and commercial realities.

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Voluntary industry-wide moratoria on powerful technologies:** The 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA is a key example. A group of scientists agreed to a temporary pause on certain experiments out of safety concerns. This occurred once in a field-defining way. **Base rate: Extremely low (<1% per year for a given tech sector).** Limitation: Asilomar was a collective, pre-commercial action, whereas the AI race is a hyper-competitive, commercial sprint.
*   **Major corporations halting a flagship R&D project for safety:** Examples include Boeing grounding the 737 MAX or pharmaceutical companies halting a late-stage drug trial. These actions are almost always reactive to a clear, public disaster or undeniable negative data, not proactive concerns about future risk. **Base rate: Very low (<5% for a specific flagship project over a 2-year period).** Limitation: The risks in AI are more abstract and existential than a plane crash, making a proactive pause harder to justify.
*   **Past behavior of these specific AI labs:** In the ~10 years of their existence as major AI players, none of the three labs have ever announced a formal pause on training runs for safety reasons, despite numerous calls to do so (e.g., the 2023 Future of Life letter). **Base rate: 0% to date.** Limitation: Past performance is not indicative of future results, especially as models approach potentially critical capability thresholds.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-06-16] OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicts AI will generate "novel insights" by 2026. (↓) — Signals a clear focus on accelerating capabilities and hitting future milestones, not on slowing down.
*   [2025-11-06] OpenAI forecasts AI making minor discoveries by 2026 and proposes safety policies. (↔) — A dual message: reinforces the push for capability milestones while simultaneously laying the political and procedural groundwork (a safety framework) that would enable a pause.
*   [2025-11-09] OpenAI issues a public warning about "potentially catastrophic" risks from AI. (↑) — This is a significant shift in public rhetoric, potentially preparing stakeholders and the public for drastic action if a safety threshold is breached. It makes a safety-based pause more justifiable.
*   [2025-11-14] A survey reveals insiders predict $30B revenue for OpenAI by 2026 but favor investing in Anthropic. (↓) — Highlights the immense commercial and competitive pressures. A pause would directly threaten revenue growth and cede ground to rivals, making it an extremely costly action.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Discovery of a critical unmanageable capability:** An internal red team discovers a model can autonomously replicate, acquire resources, or exhibit other dangerous emergent behaviors that cannot be patched. This is the most likely direct cause for a pause. (Large)
*   **Intense competitive and commercial pressure:** The race to be first to AGI and capture a multi-trillion dollar market creates a powerful, continuous incentive to train the next, larger model without delay. (Large)
*   **External political pressure:** A government or key regulator (e.g., US AI Safety Institute) threatens imminent, harsh regulation, prompting a lab to "voluntarily" pause to demonstrate responsibility and shape the rules. (Moderate)
*   **A limited, near-miss incident:** A deployed model causes a significant, but not catastrophic, public incident (e.g., a large-scale social engineering attack), forcing a lab to pause to investigate and appear responsible. (Moderate)
*   **Internal governance dynamics:** A company's internal safety board (like OpenAI's Safety Advisory Group) could gain influence and successfully argue for a pause, overcoming the commercial pressures. (Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit "pause" mechanisms exist:** Unlike most industries, both OpenAI (Preparedness Framework) and Anthropic (Responsible Scaling Policy) have pre-defined, albeit untested, frameworks that explicitly include pausing training as a potential outcome.
*   **Existential risk as a stated concern:** The leaders of these companies publicly and frequently discuss the existential risks of their own technology, which is highly unusual compared to leaders in other industries (e.g., aviation, pharma).
*   **Unprecedented speed of capability gains:** The rate of progress is exponential, meaning the jump from a "safe" to a "dangerous" model could be a single training run, increasing the odds of a sudden, unforeseen discovery that necessitates a halt.
*   **Dual-use nature and immediate scalability:** A dangerous AI capability could be weaponized and scaled globally almost instantly, a risk profile far more acute than a faulty aircraft model or a bad drug.

To forecast the probability of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announcing a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection**: The base rate for a major corporation voluntarily pausing a flagship R&D project for safety reasons is very low. Historical examples, such as the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, suggest a base rate of less than 1% per year for a given tech sector. For specific flagship projects, such as Boeing grounding the 737 MAX, the base rate is also low, around 5% over a two-year period.
- **Chosen Base Rate**: Given the competitive and commercial pressures in the AI industry, and the lack of precedent for such a pause, a base rate of 1% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The situation is similar to the base case in that it involves high-stakes technology with potential safety concerns. The AI industry, like aviation or pharmaceuticals, faces significant risks if something goes wrong.
- **Differences**: Unlike past cases, AI companies have explicit frameworks (e.g., OpenAI's Preparedness Framework) that could justify a pause. The existential risk of AI is more abstract and future-oriented, making proactive pauses less likely without a clear trigger.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **OpenAI's Public Warning (↑)**: OpenAI's recent warning about "potentially catastrophic" risks increases the likelihood of a pause. This suggests a higher probability of a pause if such risks are deemed imminent.
- **Competitive Pressure (↓)**: The intense race to develop AI capabilities and achieve commercial milestones decreases the likelihood of a pause. The forecasted $30B revenue for OpenAI by 2026 highlights the financial stakes.
- **Existence of Pause Mechanisms (↔)**: The presence of frameworks that allow for a pause is neutral but provides a mechanism if a significant risk is identified.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds**: 1% base rate translates to odds of 0.01.
- **Likelihood Ratio**: Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is slightly above 1 due to OpenAI's warning but heavily countered by competitive pressures.
- **Posterior Odds**: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.01 × 1.1 (approximate) = 0.011.
- **Posterior Probability**: 0.011 / (1 + 0.011) ≈ 1.1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast might underestimate the potential for a sudden, unforeseen discovery that necessitates a pause. However, the short timeline and commercial realities make this unlikely.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A significant AI-related incident could force a pause, but this is speculative without current evidence.
- **Adjustment**: Given the short time frame and strong disincentives, the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability**: Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability of a pause being announced before 2026 is approximately 1.1%.

Final: 1%

# Will OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announce a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for major AI labs voluntarily pausing frontier model training for safety reasons.

Looking at historical precedents:
- None of these three companies (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic) have ever announced a formal pause on training runs specifically for safety reasons.
- In 2023, there was the "Pause Giant AI Experiments" open letter from the Future of Life Institute, which these companies did not sign or comply with.
- Voluntary industry-wide moratoria on powerful technologies are extremely rare (e.g., the 1975 Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA).
- Major corporations typically only halt flagship R&D projects reactively after public incidents, not proactively.

Given these considerations, I'll set a very low base rate of 3%. This reflects:
- The unprecedented nature of such an action (0% historical occurrence for these specific companies)
- The extremely short timeframe (less than 2 months from today's date of November 14, 2025, to the resolution date of January 1, 2026)
- The general rarity of voluntary technology moratoria in competitive industries

**Prior probability: 3%** (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The competitive dynamics remain intense, with OpenAI forecasting $30B in revenue by 2026
- All three companies have commercial obligations to investors and partners
- There's a strong first-mover advantage in AI that disincentivizes pausing

**Differences from base case:**
- Unlike most industries, both OpenAI and Anthropic have explicit frameworks (Preparedness Framework and Responsible Scaling Policy) that include pausing as a potential action
- OpenAI has recently (November 9, 2025) issued unusually stark warnings about "potentially catastrophic" risks
- The capability gains are accelerating, potentially increasing the likelihood of discovering a dangerous capability that would trigger safety protocols
- The timeframe is extremely short (less than 2 months until resolution)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: OpenAI's November 9, 2025 warning about "potentially catastrophic" risks**
- P(E|H): If they were planning to announce a pause, they would very likely issue such warnings first (90%)
- P(E|~H): Even if not planning a pause, they might issue warnings for regulatory positioning or PR (30%)
- Likelihood ratio: 90%/30% = 3
- This evidence increases the probability of a pause

**Evidence 2: OpenAI CEO predicting "novel insights" by 2026 and $30B revenue forecast**
- P(E|H): If planning a pause, they would be less likely to make such optimistic public predictions (20%)
- P(E|~H): If continuing development, such predictions are very likely (80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 20%/80% = 0.25
- This evidence decreases the probability of a pause

**Evidence 3: Existence of formal pause mechanisms in company policies**
- P(E|H): If a pause occurs, it would almost certainly follow these mechanisms (95%)
- P(E|~H): These mechanisms can exist without being triggered (70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 95%/70% ≈ 1.36
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeframe (less than 2 months)**
- P(E|H): A pause announcement in such a short timeframe would require an urgent trigger (15%)
- P(E|~H): Business as usual is much more likely in such a short period (90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 15%/90% ≈ 0.17
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3:97 (or 0.031)

First update (OpenAI's warning):
- Posterior odds = 0.031 × 3 = 0.093
- Posterior probability = 0.093/(1 + 0.093) ≈ 8.5%

Second update (Revenue and capability predictions):
- Posterior odds = 0.093 × 0.25 = 0.023
- Posterior probability = 0.023/(1 + 0.023) ≈ 2.3%

Third update (Existence of pause mechanisms):
- Posterior odds = 0.023 × 1.36 = 0.031
- Posterior probability = 0.031/(1 + 0.031) ≈ 3.0%

Fourth update (Short timeframe):
- Posterior odds = 0.031 × 0.17 = 0.0053
- Posterior probability = 0.0053/(1 + 0.0053) ≈ 0.5%

This seems too low given the recent warnings, so I should reconsider some factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be underestimating the significance of OpenAI's recent warnings, which could indicate they've already discovered something concerning
- The short timeframe cuts both ways - while it reduces the chance of a new discovery, it also means we're closer to the potential trigger point if one exists
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of external pressure (e.g., from government regulators) forcing a "voluntary" pause
- The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 2.6%, suggesting my final estimate may be too low

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A scenario where one of the labs has already discovered a concerning capability and is preparing stakeholders for an announcement
- A scenario where geopolitical tensions around AI lead to government pressure for a pause
- A scenario where a minor AI incident occurs in December 2025, triggering precautionary measures

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my final probability upward from 0.5%. The recent explicit warnings from OpenAI deserve more weight, and the community forecast of 2.6% provides a useful reference point.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors:
- The extremely short timeframe (less than 2 months)
- The strong commercial incentives against pausing
- The existence of formal pause mechanisms
- The recent explicit warnings about catastrophic risks
- The community forecast of 2.6%

I believe the probability is low but not negligible. The most likely scenario for a "yes" resolution would be the discovery of a concerning capability that triggers existing safety protocols, or significant external pressure forcing a "voluntary" pause.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a voluntary, proactive pause of a core R&D project by a leading commercial entity in a hyper-competitive technology race, motivated by anticipated future safety concerns. This is an extremely rare event.

*   **Reference Class 1: Industry-wide moratoria.** The 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA is a key example, but it was a collective, pre-commercial action. This suggests a base rate of perhaps one such event per major technological revolution, making it very low for any given year.
*   **Reference Class 2: Corporate project halts.** Companies like Boeing or pharmaceutical firms halt major projects, but almost always *reactively* after a public disaster or clear negative data, not proactively due to forecasted risk.
*   **Reference Class 3: Past behavior of these labs.** Despite numerous calls for a pause (e.g., the March 2023 FLI letter), none of the three labs have ever done so. Their revealed preference to date is to continue development.

Given these points, a base rate for such a pause occurring in a given year is very low, perhaps 2-5%. However, the question's timeframe is extremely short: from today (November 14, 2025) to January 1, 2026, a period of only ~1.5 months. A simple pro-rata adjustment of a 5% annual rate would be (47/365) * 5% ≈ 0.65%. I will select a conservative prior of **1%** to account for this very short window.

Prior Probability P(H) = 1%
Prior Odds = 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 1:99

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case of a typical industrial competition in ways that could make a pause more likely:

*   **Stated Concerns:** The leaders of these labs publicly acknowledge the potential for catastrophic and existential risks from their own technology, which is highly unusual.
*   **Formal Pause Mechanisms:** Both OpenAI (Preparedness Framework) and Anthropic (Responsible Scaling Policy) have established and publicized formal governance structures that explicitly include pausing training as a response to discovering dangerous capabilities. This creates a pre-defined pathway for such an action, making it more plausible than an ad-hoc decision.
*   **Unpredictable Capability Gains:** Progress is not linear. A single new model could unexpectedly exhibit dangerous emergent properties, forcing a rapid response that wasn't anticipated.

These factors suggest the probability, while low, is not zero and might be higher than in other industries.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key recent developments as evidence.

*   **Evidence Against Pause (E1): Immense Commercial and Competitive Pressure.**
    *   OpenAI's CEO predicted major breakthroughs by 2026, and the company is reportedly forecasting $30B in revenue by 2026. This indicates a powerful momentum towards acceleration, not pausing.
    *   This evidence is highly probable if no pause occurs (P(E1|~H) is high) and less probable if a pause is imminent (P(E1|H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1.** This evidence reinforces the low prior.

*   **Evidence For Pause (E2): Recent, Stark Public Warnings from OpenAI.**
    *   In early November 2025, OpenAI issued a public warning about "potentially catastrophic" risks and highlighted its safety policies.
    *   This timing is significant. Issuing such a strong warning could be a way to prepare the public, investors, and regulators for a drastic action if an ongoing internal evaluation of a new model reveals a critical risk. This type of specific, severe, and timely warning is more likely if a pause is a real possibility (P(E2|H) is high) than if it's just business-as-usual PR (P(E2|~H) is lower).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1.** This evidence should nudge the probability upward.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's update the prior odds using the evidence. The commercial pressure is the status quo and is already baked into the very low 1% prior. The key new evidence is the stark warning from OpenAI.

Let's estimate a likelihood ratio for the OpenAI warning (E2).
*   P(E2 | H): The probability of OpenAI issuing this specific warning in November, given they will pause before year-end. This seems quite likely, as it provides justification. Let's estimate this at 0.6.
*   P(E2 | ~H): The probability of the warning, given no pause will occur. This is also plausible (PR, regulatory shaping), but the timing and severity make it less likely than in the "pause" world. Let's estimate this at 0.2.
*   **Likelihood Ratio = P(E2|H) / P(E2|~H) = 0.6 / 0.2 = 3.**

Now, we update the odds:
*   **Posterior Odds** = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
*   Posterior Odds = (1:99) × 3 = 3:99 = 1:33
*   **Posterior Probability** = Odds / (1 + Odds) = 1 / (1 + 33) = 1/34 ≈ **2.94%**

This update moves the probability from 1% to approximately 3%. This reflects that the event remains very unlikely, but the recent specific rhetoric from a key actor makes it a non-trivial possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~3% is slightly above the Manifold market consensus of 2.6%. Could I be wrong?

*   **Argument for a Lower Forecast (<3%):** The OpenAI statements could be "safety-washing" to appease regulators while the company continues to accelerate. The institutional inertia, driven by billions in investment and intense competition, is a colossal barrier. A pause would be an extraordinary admission of failure to control their own technology and would cede ground to competitors. The chain of events required to happen in the next 47 days (finish training -> evaluate -> find critical risk -> get leadership to agree -> announce) is long and each step is uncertain. The true probability may be closer to my initial 1% prior.
*   **Argument for a Higher Forecast (>3%):** I may be underestimating the sincerity of the safety commitments. The Preparedness Framework is a formal commitment. If a red team genuinely discovers a model can, for example, autonomously replicate and seek power, the safety board might be obligated to force a pause. The recent warnings could be a direct signal that they are evaluating a model *right now* that is displaying worrying capabilities. In this world, a pause is a very real possibility, and 3% is too low.

Considering these, my 3% estimate seems like a reasonable balance. It acknowledges the powerful arguments against a pause but gives credible weight to the unusual and specific public statements and the formal safety frameworks that make this situation unique. The fact that the question resolves on *any* of the three companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepMind) adds a small amount of upside risk to the forecast, making a number slightly above a pure OpenAI-centric estimate more robust.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for such an event in this short timeframe is extremely low, around 1%. However, recent, stark warnings about "catastrophic risk" from OpenAI, combined with the existence of formal safety frameworks that include pausing as a remedy, provide a plausible mechanism and justification for a pause. This evidence is significant enough to warrant an upward update from the base rate. The immense commercial and competitive pressures remain the primary argument against a pause and keep the probability very low. Balancing these factors, I assess the probability to be in the low single digits.

Final: 3%
