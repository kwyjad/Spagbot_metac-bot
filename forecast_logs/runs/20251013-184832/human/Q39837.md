### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Ukraine's Own Precedent (2022-2025):** Since the full-scale invasion began, martial law has been extended every time it was set to expire. After an initial 30-day period, it has been renewed for 90-day terms 15 consecutive times.
    *   **Base Rate:** 100% (16 out of 16 extensions approved).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most specific and relevant reference class. The political and military conditions that necessitated the initial declaration and subsequent extensions have not fundamentally changed.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a perfect but small sample. It assumes the underlying conditions (active war, political unity on the war effort) remain constant.

2.  **States Under Active, Full-Scale Invasion:** Countries facing an ongoing, existential military invasion by another state power.
    *   **Base Rate:** >95% probability of maintaining a state of emergency/martial law.
    *   **Reasoning:** Martial law provides the legal framework for mass mobilization, resource redirection, suspension of certain civil liberties (e.g., holding elections), and streamlined military-civilian command structures necessary to fight an existential war. Lifting it while the invasion is ongoing is almost unheard of as it would signal a surrender or a catastrophic breakdown of the state.
    *   **Limitations:** Finding perfect historical analogues is difficult. The scale of international support for Ukraine is a unique variable.

3.  **Protracted Conflicts and States of Emergency:** Countries engaged in long-term conflicts (e.g., civil wars, enduring insurgencies) that utilize states of emergency.
    *   **Base Rate:** 80-90% probability of extension in any given year once established.
    *   **Reasoning:** Once emergency powers are granted and institutionalized, they create a strong status quo bias and are rarely relinquished until the conflict is definitively resolved or has transitioned to a much lower intensity.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is less relevant as it often includes internal conflicts where the political calculus for maintaining emergency powers is different from an external invasion that fosters national unity.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-22** Russia launches a major autumn offensive targeting Sumy and Kharkiv, increasing pressure on Ukrainian defenses. — ↑ — Reinforces the necessity of martial law for troop mobilization and defense coordination.
*   **2025-09-15** The G7 releases a statement reaffirming long-term security and financial support for Ukraine through 2026, without conditioning it on near-term elections. — ↑ — Reduces external pressure on Ukraine to lift martial law in order to hold elections.
*   **2025-08-07** The Verkhovna Rada votes 315-15 to approve the previous 90-day extension of martial law and general mobilization. — ↑ — Demonstrates overwhelming and recent cross-party political consensus on the necessity of martial law.
*   **2025-07-20** President Zelenskyy, in a public address, states that "peace is not on the horizon" and that Ukraine must prepare for a "difficult winter and a challenging 2026." — ↑ — Signals leadership's assessment that the conditions for lifting martial law (i.e., an end to the threat) will not be met by November.
*   **2025-06-13** The GLOBSEC report on security scenarios for 2025-2026 identifies a prolonged war of attrition as the most likely outcome. — ↑ — Expert consensus aligns with the view that the war will be ongoing, making martial law a continued necessity.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **State of the Military Conflict:** The intensity and status of the war is the primary driver. Active, high-intensity combat along the frontline makes extension virtually certain. A stable, comprehensive ceasefire is the main mechanism that could lead to non-extension. (Size: Large)
2.  **Legal & Constitutional Framework:** Ukrainian law explicitly links martial law to a state of war or armed aggression and prohibits national elections during its enforcement. This creates a powerful legal and procedural lock-in. (Size: Large)
3.  **Domestic Political Consensus:** As long as the major political forces and the public remain unified around the goal of defeating the invasion, there is little internal pressure to lift martial law. A significant fracture in this consensus is a prerequisite for non-extension. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Russian Strategic Aims:** Russia's stated goal remains the subjugation of Ukraine. As long as this is perceived as Moscow's intent, Kyiv has no incentive to lower its guard by lifting the legal framework for national defense. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **International Pressure:** Western partners could theoretically pressure Ukraine to hold elections, which would require lifting martial law. However, this is highly unlikely while the conflict remains hot, as it would be seen as destabilizing. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Nature of the Threat:** Unlike many conflicts involving martial law (e.g., internal insurgencies), this is a full-scale conventional invasion by a nuclear-armed neighbor. The threat is unambiguous, existential, and broadly understood, creating exceptionally strong justification for emergency measures.
*   **Democratic Constraints:** Ukraine is a democracy that has postponed elections due to the war. This creates a latent tension between security imperatives and democratic norms that is not present in autocratic states under the "protracted conflict" reference class. However, this tension is currently resolved in favor of security.
*   **Unprecedented International Support:** The scale of Western military and financial aid is unique. This support relies on the continued existence and functioning of the Ukrainian state, which is currently enabled by the martial law framework.
*   **Clarity of Conditions for Lifting:** The condition for lifting martial law is exceptionally clear: a durable end to the Russian invasion and existential threat. In many other cases, the "end" of a conflict is murky, leading to indefinite extensions. Here, the trigger for a potential "No" is more defined, even if unlikely to occur.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the high base rate from Ukraine's own precedent (>99%) and the reference class of states under active invasion (>95%). A strong prior of ~98% with an equivalent n of ~20 seems appropriate, reflecting the highly consistent pattern.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Recent Russian offensives and continued high-intensity conflict. (Large)
    *   (↑) Overwhelming and recent parliamentary approval for the last extension. (Moderate)
    *   (↑) Consistent messaging from Ukrainian leadership that the war is far from over. (Moderate)
    *   (↑) Lack of meaningful international pressure to lift martial law for elections. (Small)
*   **Net effect:** The recent evidence is uniformly positive and strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior should move slightly higher, very close to 100%, effectively confirming the initial assessment.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring YES):**
    *   Official announcements of new Russian or Ukrainian military offensives.
    *   President Zelenskyy submitting the formal decree for extension to the Rada in late October/early November.
    *   Rhetoric from major political parties in the Rada supporting the extension.
    *   Any major Russian missile or drone strike campaign against Ukrainian cities or infrastructure.

*   **DOWN indicators (favoring NO):**
    *   Credible, high-level reports of a breakthrough in back-channel ceasefire negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.
    *   A sudden and unexpected collapse of the Russian military front, leading to a rapid Ukrainian victory.
    *   A joint statement from the US and EU explicitly calling for a timeline for elections, implying an end to martial law.
    *   President Zelenskyy delaying the submission of the extension decree to parliament.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Events:** The sudden death or removal from power of Vladimir Putin or Volodymyr Zelenskyy could radically alter the strategic landscape.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** A sudden "frozen conflict" with a ceasefire but no peace treaty could create a gray area. Ukraine might choose to lift martial law nationally while keeping it in frontline oblasts. This would likely resolve as "No" but depends on the precise legal implementation.
*   **Information Warfare:** Be wary of reports from either side about imminent breakthroughs in peace talks or military collapses; these are often used for psychological effect.
*   **Internal Political Crisis:** While unlikely, a sudden collapse of the national unity government in Ukraine could disrupt the previously automatic extension process.
*   **Resolution Timing:** The extension is a procedural act. A delay in the parliamentary vote past November 5 for administrative reasons, even with the intent to pass it, could technically cause a "No" resolution if the current law expires.

**Final Research Summary:** The extension of martial law is a near-certainty. It is the legal and political linchpin of Ukraine's war effort, and with the high-intensity conflict showing no signs of abating, all political and military incentives are aligned for its routine renewal.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is Ukraine's own precedent since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Martial law has been extended every time it was set to expire, with 16 consecutive extensions. This gives a base rate of 100% (16 out of 16 extensions approved).
   - This base rate is chosen because it directly reflects the historical pattern of martial law extensions in Ukraine under the current conflict conditions.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation remains consistent with the conditions under which previous extensions were made. The war is ongoing, and there is strong political consensus in Ukraine for maintaining martial law.
   - Differences: There are no significant differences that would suggest a deviation from the established pattern of extensions. The recent Russian offensive and continued international support for Ukraine reinforce the status quo.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent Russian offensives (↑): The likelihood of martial law being extended is higher given the increased military pressure. P(E | H) is high, and P(E | ~H) is low, increasing the probability.
   - Overwhelming parliamentary approval for the last extension (↑): This demonstrates strong political support for martial law, making P(E | H) high and P(E | ~H) low.
   - Consistent messaging from Ukrainian leadership (↑): Signals that the leadership sees no end to the conflict, increasing P(E | H).
   - Lack of international pressure to lift martial law (↑): Reduces the likelihood of a "No" outcome, as P(E | ~H) is low.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 99:1 (based on the base rate of 99%).
   - Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors extension due to the evidence (e.g., recent offensives, political consensus).
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = Very high odds in favor of extension.
   - Posterior probability: Approaches 100%, given the overwhelming evidence supporting the continuation of martial law.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios: A sudden peace agreement or a major shift in international pressure could change the outcome, but these are unlikely given current conditions.
   - Overconfidence check: The high probability reflects the strong alignment of evidence with historical patterns. However, acknowledging the small chance of unexpected developments is important.
   - Best alternative forecast: A rapid and unexpected resolution to the conflict could lead to a "No" outcome, but this scenario lacks supporting evidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the strong historical precedent, current military and political conditions, and lack of significant counter-evidence, the probability of Ukraine extending martial law beyond November 5, 2025, is extremely high.

Final: 99%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Ukraine's own precedent since the 2022 Russian invasion as the most relevant base rate:

- Since February 24, 2022, martial law has been extended 16 consecutive times (100% extension rate)
- After initial 30-day periods, it has been consistently renewed for 90-day terms
- The political and military conditions that necessitated these extensions remain in place

**Prior probability: 98%**

I'm selecting this high prior based on:
1. The perfect historical record of extensions (16/16)
2. The reference class of countries under active invasion (>95% maintain emergency powers)
3. The ongoing nature of the existential threat from Russia

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental condition (active Russian invasion) remains unchanged
- Ukraine still faces an existential military threat requiring mobilization powers
- The legal framework linking martial law to national defense is intact
- Strong political consensus for maintaining martial law persists (315-15 vote in August 2025)

**Differences from base case:**
- The war has now lasted 3.5+ years, creating potential "emergency fatigue"
- Pressure for democratic normalization (elections) may have increased over time
- The conflict may have evolved toward a more static, lower-intensity phase

However, these differences appear insufficient to overcome the overwhelming security imperatives, especially given recent developments like Russia's autumn 2025 offensive in Sumy and Kharkiv.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key evidence #1: Recent Russian offensive (September 2022)**
- P(E|H): ~100% (If martial law will be extended, we'd almost certainly see continued military operations)
- P(E|~H): ~5% (If martial law were to end, it would likely require cessation of major combat)
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 (Strongly favors extension)

**Key evidence #2: Overwhelming parliamentary support (315-15 vote in August 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~95% (Strong political consensus is expected if extension is likely)
- P(E|~H): ~10% (Such consensus would be unlikely if martial law were about to end)
- Likelihood ratio: ~9.5:1 (Strongly favors extension)

**Key evidence #3: Zelenskyy's July 2025 statement that "peace is not on the horizon"**
- P(E|H): ~90% (Such messaging aligns with preparing for continued martial law)
- P(E|~H): ~20% (This messaging would be inconsistent with plans to end martial law)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.5:1 (Moderately favors extension)

**Key evidence #4: G7 support without election conditions (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~80% (International acceptance of continued martial law is expected)
- P(E|~H): ~40% (If pressure for elections were building, we might see different messaging)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 (Slightly favors extension)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 98:2 (49:1)

Update on Russian offensive:
- Posterior odds = 49 × 20 = 980:1
- Posterior probability = 980/(980+1) ≈ 99.9%

Update on parliamentary support:
- Posterior odds = 980 × 9.5 ≈ 9,310:1
- Posterior probability ≈ 99.99%

The remaining evidence further strengthens this already very high probability, but with diminishing returns given how close we already are to certainty.

After considering all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 99.9%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Unexpected diplomatic breakthrough**: A sudden ceasefire agreement could emerge from secret negotiations, though this seems highly unlikely given Russia's continued offensive actions and stated goals.

2. **Internal political crisis**: A major split in Ukrainian leadership could disrupt the extension process, though the 315-15 vote suggests overwhelming consensus.

3. **Technical/procedural failure**: The extension might fail due to administrative errors or timing issues, though this would likely be quickly remedied.

4. **International pressure**: Western allies could suddenly condition aid on democratic normalization, though this would be a dramatic reversal of current policy.

5. **Definition ambiguity**: Ukraine might implement a partial lifting of martial law in some regions while maintaining it in frontline areas, creating resolution ambiguity.

The most plausible alternative scenario is a sudden, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough leading to a ceasefire. However, given Russia's recent offensive and stated goals, plus Ukraine's consistent position, this remains highly improbable.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming evidence supporting extension, including:
- Perfect historical precedent (16/16 extensions)
- Active and intensifying military operations
- Near-unanimous political support
- Clear statements from leadership
- Continued international backing without democratic conditions

I assess that Ukraine will almost certainly extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025.

Final: 99%

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate comes from Ukraine's own actions since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.
- **Reference Class:** Extensions of martial law in Ukraine during the 2022-present war.
- **Data:** Martial law has been set to expire 16 times, and it has been extended 16 times.
- **Base Rate (P(H)):** This yields a historical base rate of 100% (16 out of 16). For forecasting purposes, it's prudent to avoid absolute certainty. A strong but non-absolute prior is more robust. Therefore, I will set the initial prior probability at **98%**. This reflects the perfect historical precedent while acknowledging that unforeseen circumstances could break the pattern. In odds, this is 98:2, or 49:1 in favor of extension.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation, as of October 2025, is fundamentally identical to the conditions under which the previous 16 extensions occurred. Ukraine is engaged in a high-intensity, existential war against a full-scale Russian invasion. The legal and political frameworks that necessitate martial law for mobilization and wartime governance remain unchanged.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the sheer duration of the war. Over three and a half years of conflict could increase war fatigue. However, the provided evidence does not suggest this fatigue has translated into political pressure to lift the core legal framework of the war effort. The fundamental driver—active, large-scale combat—remains the same.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The research report provides several recent pieces of evidence. Let H be the hypothesis that "Ukraine extends martial law," and ~H be the alternative.

- **Evidence 1: Russia's major autumn offensive (September 2025).**
  - This is much more likely if Ukraine needs to maintain its war footing (P(E|H) is high) than if conditions were improving to the point of lifting martial law (P(E|~H) is very low).
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (>>1). This evidence significantly increases the probability of extension.

- **Evidence 2: Overwhelming Verkhovna Rada approval (315-15) for the previous extension (August 2025).**
  - This demonstrates a robust and recent political consensus. It is highly likely given the plan is to extend again (P(E|H) is high). A sudden reversal of this consensus to vote against extension is extremely unlikely (P(E|~H) is very low).
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (>>1). This evidence reinforces the political viability of another extension.

- **Evidence 3: President Zelenskyy's statement that "peace is not on the horizon" (July 2025).**
  - This public messaging is what one would expect if the leadership intends to continue the war effort and extend martial law (P(E|H) is high). It is the opposite of the messaging one would expect if the government were preparing to lift martial law (P(E|~H) is very low).
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (>>1). This points to clear intent from the executive branch.

- **Evidence 4: G7 reaffirming support without conditioning it on elections (September 2025).**
  - This removes a key potential source of pressure for Ukraine to lift martial law. The lack of external pressure makes extension more likely.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors H (>1).

All available evidence is recent and points uniformly in the direction of extension.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 49:1
- **Likelihood Ratio (Combined):** The combined effect of the evidence (new offensive, strong political vote, leadership statements) is very strong. A conservative estimate of the combined likelihood ratio would be well over 10.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 49 × (Large Number) ≈ Very Large Number.
- **Update:** Starting with a 98% prior, the uniformly positive and strong evidence pushes the probability even higher. The evidence serves to eliminate most of the residual 2% of doubt, which was reserved for scenarios like a sudden end to the war or a political collapse. Since the evidence points directly against these scenarios, the posterior probability moves very close to 100%. I will update my forecast from 98% to 99%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible reason for non-extension would be a sudden, unexpected breakthrough in secret peace negotiations leading to a comprehensive ceasefire just before the November 5 deadline.
- **Plausibility:** While possible, this is a low-probability "black swan" event. All public-facing evidence, particularly President Zelenskyy's recent statements and Russia's new offensive, directly contradicts this scenario. The timeline is also very short (less than a month from the date of the report), making such a rapid and fundamental shift in the war's trajectory highly unlikely.
- **Other Risks:** A sudden collapse of the Russian front or the Ukrainian government are also tail risks, but the evidence of a grinding war of attrition and strong political unity makes these improbable.
- **Conclusion:** The 1% probability assigned to non-extension adequately covers these unlikely but not impossible scenarios. The forecast of 99% remains robust.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate, derived from 16 consecutive past extensions, is nearly 100%. All recent military, political, and diplomatic evidence strongly reinforces the necessity and intent to extend martial law again. The war remains at a high intensity, and martial law is the legal foundation of Ukraine's defense. The alternative scenarios, while conceivable, are unsupported by evidence and represent low-probability tail risks.

Final: 99%
