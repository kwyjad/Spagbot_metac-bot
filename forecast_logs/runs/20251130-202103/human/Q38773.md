### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Shandong Yinfeng's Historical Growth:** The most specific reference class is the organization itself. It cryopreserved its first patient in May 2017. By September 2020 (~3.3 years), it had 10 patients, an average rate of **~3.0 patients/year**. By October 2025 (~5.1 years later), it had 31 patients, adding 21 patients in that period for an average rate of **~4.1 patients/year**. This suggests a stable to slightly accelerating linear growth rate.
2.  **Established International Cryonics Organizations:** The other three global facilities (e.g., Alcor, Cryonics Institute in the US) provide a comparative base rate. These older organizations, founded in the 1970s, have each added patients at a rate of roughly **5-10 patients/year** over the last decade. They are more mature and operate in a different market.
3.  **New Cryonics Organizations:** Newer entrants, like Tomorrow Biostasis in Europe (founded 2019), offer a model for early-stage growth. However, data on their patient numbers is less public. Their growth is likely slower initially, similar to Yinfeng's early rate of **1-3 patients/year**, as they build infrastructure, reputation, and a client base.

*Limitations:* Yinfeng's unique position as a state-adjacent monopoly in China makes direct comparison difficult. Its growth curve may not follow the path of Western, private-citizen-led organizations.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Today's Date: 2025-11-30. Recency focus: last 6 months.*

-   **[2025-10-01]** Cryonics Wiki reports Yinfeng has 31 cryopreserved patients. **(↑)** — This is a high-confidence data point that provides a new, solid baseline for the forecast, confirming accelerated growth since 2020.
-   **[2025-02-07]** Yinfeng's joint project on ovarian tissue cryopreservation wins a provincial science award. **(↑, small)** — Enhances scientific credibility and public image, which can indirectly attract new clients by building trust in their underlying technology.
-   **[2024-12-24]** A documentary about Yinfeng's "Life Continuation Plan" is awarded for brand building. **(↑, small)** — Successful PR efforts increase public awareness and acceptance, a key driver for new sign-ups in a nascent, controversial field.
-   **[2024-10-30]** Yinfeng holds an online meeting for members, sharing progress and reinforcing its mission. **(↑, small)** — Demonstrates organizational health and active community management, which helps retain existing members and convert prospective ones.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Public Awareness and Media Portrayal:** Positive media, like the award-winning documentary, is crucial for demystifying cryonics and attracting clients. Negative press or scandals could halt growth. (Size: Moderate)
2.  **Operational Capacity & Funding:** As a division of the large Yinfeng Biological Group, the institute likely has stable funding and capacity to expand. The number of trained rapid-response and preservation teams is a key bottleneck. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Cultural and Ethical Acceptance:** Cryonics challenges traditional Chinese views on death. Overcoming this requires significant educational and PR efforts. The lack of strong religious objections, compared to some Western countries, is a potential tailwind. (Size: Large, long-term)
4.  **Cost and Client Acquisition Funnel:** The high cost of cryopreservation limits the addressable market. The number of people signed up for the "Life Extension Program" is a leading indicator of future patients. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Regulatory Environment:** The field operates in a legal gray area in China. Tacit government approval allows it to function, but explicit regulation—either favorable or restrictive—could dramatically alter its trajectory. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Monopoly Status:** Unlike the competitive US market, Yinfeng is the sole provider for mainland China, a vast potential market. This concentrates all domestic demand on one entity.
-   **State-Adjacent Nature:** Yinfeng is part of a major biological group and collaborates with state universities and hospitals. This provides a level of legitimacy and stability that Western libertarian-founded organizations lack.
-   **Early-Stage Growth Phase:** Compared to Alcor or the Cryonics Institute, Yinfeng is much younger. It is likely on a steeper part of its S-curve for growth, meaning its annual percentage growth can be much higher even if the absolute number is lower.
-   **Integrated Research Mission:** Yinfeng heavily emphasizes its broader cryobiology research (e.g., organ preservation), which may attract different funding sources and a more favorable public/regulatory view than a sole focus on human "reanimation."

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A simple extrapolation from the 2017-2020 data (10 patients in ~3.3 years) would suggest a linear growth of ~3 patients/year. This would yield a prior centered around **27 patients** by the end of 2025, with an equivalent n suggesting moderate confidence.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **(↑, Large)** The October 2025 report of **31 patients** is a powerful piece of evidence. It invalidates the slower growth prior and establishes a new, higher baseline, indicating an accelerated rate of ~4.1 patients/year since 2020.
    -   **(↑, Small)** Consistent positive PR and scientific awards throughout late 2024 and early 2025 suggest a healthy organization with momentum, supporting the likelihood of continued, albeit slow, growth in the immediate future.
    -   **(→, Small)** The extremely short horizon (resolution in ~1 month) severely constrains the potential for significant deviation from the October 2025 baseline. At a rate of ~4/year, adding one patient takes ~3 months.
-   **Net effect:** The posterior should be sharply updated to a distribution tightly centered just above the new baseline of 31. The evidence strongly suggests the final number will be the baseline plus any additions in Q4 2025.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   An end-of-year press release or news article from Yinfeng summarizing 2025 achievements.
    -   An update to the Cryonics Wiki page for Shandong Yinfeng.
    -   Social media posts from Yinfeng or affiliated researchers mentioning a new case.
    -   News of a prominent individual in China signing up for or undergoing cryopreservation.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   (The number of patients is unlikely to decrease).
    -   News of operational failure, scandal, or a halt in operations.
    -   Negative statements from Chinese government or medical bodies regarding cryonics.
    -   Key personnel, like Aaron Drake, announcing their departure.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Reporting Lag vs. Reality:** The question resolves on the *reported* number. The true number of patients on Dec 31, 2025, could be higher than the number in the last report published before 2026.
-   **Source Reliability:** The Cryonics Wiki is a well-regarded but unofficial source. The forecast is heavily dependent on the accuracy of its October 2025 data point.
-   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria require a report published in 2024 or 2025. The October 2025 Wiki entry likely counts, making ambiguity unlikely. However, if no new report appears before 2026, the resolution value will be 31.
-   **Definition of "Patient":** The forecast assumes "patient" refers to whole-body cryopreservations, which the Wiki source confirms is all 31 cases. Any inclusion of neuro-preservations or other tissues could alter the count if reporting changes.

**Final Research Summary:**
The forecast is strongly anchored by the October 2025 report of 31 patients. Given the institute's historical growth rate of approximately 4 patients per year, it is highly probable they will add one

To forecast the number of patients the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute will report by 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical growth rate of Shandong Yinfeng is the most relevant base rate. From 2017 to 2020, they added approximately 3 patients per year, and from 2020 to 2025, they added approximately 4.1 patients per year.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** The mean growth rate is approximately 4.1 patients per year, with a variance reflecting the slight acceleration observed over time.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The institute continues to operate as a monopoly in China, with stable funding and infrastructure, similar to the past.
- **Differences:** Recent positive media coverage and scientific awards suggest increased public awareness and credibility, potentially accelerating growth.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **October 2025 Report of 31 Patients:** This is a strong indicator of accelerated growth, suggesting a higher baseline than previously estimated.
- **Positive PR and Awards:** These factors increase the likelihood of continued growth, albeit at a modest rate.
- **Short Time Horizon:** Limits the potential for significant deviation from the current baseline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 27 patients by the end of 2025 based on earlier growth rates.
- **Likelihood:** The October 2025 report of 31 patients strongly suggests a higher growth rate.
- **Posterior:** Updated to reflect a distribution centered just above 31, accounting for potential additions in the remaining months of 2025.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Risks:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for unexpected regulatory changes or cultural shifts.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden increase in demand due to a high-profile case could push numbers higher.
- **Adjustments:** Consider a slightly wider distribution to account for these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the evidence and analysis, the forecasted number of patients by 2026 is likely to be slightly above the current reported number, with a small chance of significant deviation.

# Forecasting the Number of Patients at Shandong Yinfeng by 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use Shandong Yinfeng's own historical growth rate:
- Founded in 2015, first patient in May 2017
- September 2020: 10 patients (after ~3.3 years of operation)
- October 2025: 31 patients (adding 21 patients in ~5.1 years)

This gives us a growth rate of:
- 2017-2020: ~3.0 patients/year
- 2020-2025: ~4.1 patients/year
- Overall average: ~3.8 patients/year

The most recent rate (4.1 patients/year) is most relevant, suggesting a prior distribution centered around 32-33 patients by the end of 2025, with moderate variance due to the small sample size.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Same organization with consistent leadership and operational model
- Similar regulatory environment in China
- Continued monopoly status as China's only cryonics provider

**Differences from base case:**
- Very short time horizon (only ~1 month from latest data point to resolution)
- Recent positive PR and scientific recognition may accelerate growth
- The organization appears to be in a stable growth phase rather than early startup

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Key evidence:
1. **October 2025 data point (31 patients)**: This is extremely strong evidence that establishes our baseline. It's only ~2 months old and comes from a reliable source (Cryonics Wiki). Likelihood ratio strongly favors values very close to 31-32.

2. **Recent positive PR and scientific recognition**: The documentary award and provincial science award suggest the organization is functioning well and gaining legitimacy. This slightly increases the likelihood of continued growth at or above the historical rate. Likelihood ratio slightly favors higher values (32+).

3. **Short time horizon**: With only ~1 month between the latest data point and resolution, there's limited time for new patients. At ~4.1 patients/year, we'd expect ~0.34 patients per month on average. Likelihood ratio strongly favors values within +1 of the baseline.

4. **Seasonal factors**: End-of-year may see slightly higher activity due to terminal patients waiting for holidays with family. Likelihood ratio very slightly favors +1 patient over +0.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered around 32-33 patients by end-2025:

**Update based on October 2025 data point:**
- This sharply narrows our distribution around 31-32 patients
- P(31-32 | October data) >> P(33+ | October data)
- P(30 or less | October data) ≈ 0

**Update based on short time horizon:**
- With only ~1 month remaining and a rate of ~0.34 patients/month:
  - P(31 | time horizon) ≈ 0.7
  - P(32 | time horizon) ≈ 0.25
  - P(33 | time horizon) ≈ 0.05
  - P(34+ | time horizon) ≈ 0

**Update based on positive PR:**
- This slightly shifts probability mass upward:
  - P(31 | positive PR) ≈ 0.65
  - P(32 | positive PR) ≈ 0.28
  - P(33 | positive PR) ≈ 0.07
  - P(34 | positive PR) ≈ 0.01

The posterior distribution is thus heavily concentrated around 31-32, with a small probability of 33 and very small probability of 34+.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the reporting lag. The question resolves based on reports published before 2026, not the actual number on Dec 31.
- I might be overconfident in the October 2025 data point if the Cryonics Wiki isn't perfectly reliable.
- There could be seasonal patterns in cryopreservation that I'm not accounting for.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A sudden surge in patients due to a high-profile case or group preservation event
- A reporting error in the October 2025 data
- No new reports published between October 2025 and end of year

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties
- I'll place more probability mass on values just above 31 to account for the possibility of 1-2 new patients in the final months of 2025

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is the historical growth of the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute itself.

*   **Initial Growth (2017-2020):** The institute cryopreserved its first patient in May 2017 and reached 10 patients by September 2020. This is a rate of 10 patients in ~3.3 years, or **~3.0 patients/year**.
*   **Recent Growth (2020-2025):** The number grew from 10 in September 2020 to 31 in October 2025. This is an addition of 21 patients in ~5.1 years, for an accelerated rate of **~4.1 patients/year**.

This recent growth rate of ~4.1 patients/year is the most pertinent prior. This rate implies that, on average, one new patient is added every three months. Given the forecast is for the end of 2025 (a 3-month period from the last data point in early October), a simple prior for the number of *additional* patients is a Poisson distribution with a rate parameter (λ) of approximately 1.

*   **Prior Distribution:** The total number of patients will be `31 + X`, where `X` is the number of new patients in Q4 2025. I model `X` as a Poisson distribution, `X ~ Poisson(λ≈1)`.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is very similar to the base case, as we are extrapolating a stable, recent growth trend over a very short period (3 months). The key difference is not the underlying growth rate but the **reporting process**. The resolution depends on a report being published before 2026. The historical reporting has been sparse (a ~5-year gap between the last two major updates on the Cryonics Wiki). Therefore, the biggest uncertainty is whether any new patients added in late 2025 will be officially reported before the deadline.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The evidence consists of two main components: the baseline number and the likelihood of an update.

1.  **Baseline (Anchor):** The October 2025 report of **31 patients** is a very strong piece of evidence. It anchors the entire forecast. The final number cannot be lower than 31. This evidence has a massive upward effect compared to extrapolating from the 2020 data alone.
2.  **Likelihood of a New Report:** This is the crucial uncertainty.
    *   **Evidence for an update:** The positive PR (documentary award, science award) and active member engagement suggest an organization that may want to publish an end-of-year summary to showcase its progress.
    *   **Evidence against an update:** The primary source for the last number (Cryonics Wiki) has a multi-year update lag. It is unlikely to be updated again for just one or two new patients. An official report is possible but not guaranteed.
    *   **Judgment:** I estimate the probability of a new report being published in November or December 2025 as **40%**. This means there is a 60% chance the last reported number (31) will be the resolving value.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

My posterior is a mixture model based on the probability of a new report.

*   **Prior:** The number of new patients in Q4 2025, `X`, follows `Poisson(λ=1)`.
    *   P(X=0) ≈ 37%
    *   P(X=1) ≈ 37%
    *   P(X=2) ≈ 18%
    *   P(X=3) ≈ 6%
*   **Likelihood (Reporting Model):**
    *   `P(New Report) = 0.40`
    *   `P(No New Report) = 0.60`
*   **Posterior Calculation:**
    *   `P(Final = 31) = P(No New Report) + P(New Report) * P(X=0)`
        `= 0.60 + (0.40 * 0.37) = 0.60 + 0.148 = 0.748`
    *   `P(Final = 32) = P(New Report) * P(X=1)`
        `= 0.40 * 0.37 = 0.148`
    *   `P(Final = 33) = P(New Report) * P(X=2)`
        `= 0.40 * 0.18 = 0.072`
    *   `P(Final = 34) = P(New Report) * P(X=3)`
        `= 0.40 * 0.06 = 0.024`

This creates a posterior distribution heavily concentrated at 31, with a rapidly decaying tail for higher values. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is: P(≤31) = 74.8%, P(≤32) = 89.6%, P(≤33) = 96.8%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence in "No Report":** My biggest assumption is the 40% chance of a new report. Could it be higher? Yes, an end-of-year summary is a common corporate practice. If I increase `P(New Report)` to 50%, the CDF becomes P(≤31) = 68.5%, P(≤32) = 87.0%, P(≤33) = 96.0%. This does not change the final integer percentiles for P80 and P90. The forecast is robust to this assumption.
*   **Underestimation of Growth:** Could there be a sudden surge of patients? While possible, the process from sign-up to cryopreservation upon legal death is lumpy and slow. A surge of more than 2-3 patients in a single quarter would be a significant deviation from the established rate of ~4 per year. My Poisson model already accounts for this as a low-probability tail event.
*   **Best Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered at 32 would imply that a new report is highly likely and that at least one new patient is a near-certainty. This seems too optimistic given the sparse reporting history and the stochastic nature of patient additions. My model, which puts a ~75% chance on the outcome being 31, better reflects the combined uncertainty of reporting and growth.

### 6. Final Percentiles

Based on the posterior distribution derived from a 40% probability of a new report and a Poisson(1) model for new patients, the cumulative probabilities are P(≤31) = 74.8% and P(≤32) = 89.6% and P(≤33) = 96.8%. The percentiles are the lowest integer values that meet the required cumulative probability.
