### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Tenured Professors at R1/Top-50 Universities Facing Dismissal Proceedings:** The most relevant reference class. Dismissing a tenured professor is an exceptionally rare event, often termed a "corporate death penalty" in academia. Data is sparse, but estimates from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) suggest only a handful of such cases reach a formal hearing stage nationwide each year. The base rate of a tenured professor at an elite university being stripped of tenure in any given year is likely well below 0.1%, perhaps closer to 0.01%. This is a "tail event."
2.  **Professors Sanctioned for Controversial Speech:** A narrower class. Cases involving dismissal for speech (as opposed to research fraud, embezzlement, or sexual misconduct) are even rarer due to strong protections for academic freedom. While institutions are testing the boundaries of these protections, successful tenure revocation purely for extramural speech is almost unheard of. The base rate here is likely an order of magnitude lower than the general dismissal rate.
3.  **University Disciplinary Processes Concluding with Major Sanctions:** This class includes outcomes other than dismissal. Universities often opt for sanctions like suspension, censure, or loss of administrative posts. The base rate for a formal, multi-year disciplinary process concluding with *any* major sanction is low, but the rate of it concluding with a sanction *short of dismissal* is far higher than the rate of dismissal itself. This case has already entered that more common outcome path.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-09-23** Penn imposes sanctions: one-year suspension (2025-26), loss of named chair, half-pay. — ↓ — This is a "major sanction" but crucially is *not* tenure revocation. It represents the conclusion of a multi-year process, making a more severe outcome before 2026 highly improbable.
*   **2024-10-23** Sanctions are formally published in the University's journal of record. — ↓ — This formalizes the outcome of the disciplinary process, signaling its conclusion. Re-opening the case for a harsher penalty would be procedurally extraordinary and legally perilous for the university.
*   **2025-09-XX** (Implied by Nov source) Wax's first federal lawsuit against Penn is dismissed. — ↓ — While a legal setback for Wax, this event doesn't change her tenure status. It simply removes one avenue of her legal challenges, with no direct impact on the university's completed sanctions.
*   **2025-11-14** Wax files a second lawsuit against Penn in state court, alleging academic freedom violations. — ↓ — This action further entrenches the conflict in a legal battle over the *already-decided* sanctions. It makes it less likely the university would risk escalating the situation by pursuing tenure revocation while in active litigation over the current, lesser punishment.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **New Egregious Conduct by Wax:** A new, unambiguous, fireable offense (e.g., research fraud, criminal act, clear violation of university rules unrelated to protected speech) could trigger a new, expedited process. (Large impact, but low probability).
2.  **University Procedural Escalation:** The university administration or trustees could, in theory, reject the faculty senate's recommendation and pursue dismissal. However, the process appears concluded, and doing so now would violate established university governance and due process. (Moderate impact, very low probability).
3.  **Wax's Voluntary Resignation/Retirement:** Wax could choose to resign or retire in protest of the sanctions or as part of a settlement. This is a "wild card" dependent on her personal calculus. (Large impact, low but non-zero probability).
4.  **Institutional Inertia & Legal Risk:** The university has completed a long, costly, and public process. The path of least resistance and lowest legal risk is to enforce the decided-upon sanctions and defend against her lawsuit. This is the strongest driver for the status quo. (Large impact, high probability).
5.  **External Pressure:** Pressure from donors, alumni, or political figures could theoretically push the university to act further, but this is unlikely to override internal governance and legal constraints on such a short timeline. (Small impact).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Process is Concluded:** Unlike a typical case under consideration, the formal multi-year disciplinary process at Penn has *already finished*. The outcome was a major sanction, but explicitly not tenure revocation. The base rate applies to initiating and completing a process; this one is already done.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** With only ~1 month until the question's close date (Jan 1, 2026), there is virtually no time for a new tenure revocation process to be initiated, let alone completed. Such proceedings typically take a minimum of several months, and often years.
*   **Nature of Offense:** The core issue is controversial speech. This makes it a much harder and more contentious case for dismissal than clear-cut misconduct like fraud or embezzlement, increasing the university's incentive to settle for a lesser sanction.
*   **Active Litigation by the Professor:** Wax is now the plaintiff in a lawsuit against the university. This shifts the dynamic, putting the university on the legal defensive. Taking new punitive action against a professor who is actively suing could be viewed as retaliation and significantly weaken the university's legal position.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very strong prior against tenure revocation at an elite university (p < 0.001), reflecting the extreme rarity of the event. Equivalent n could be ~2000 with 1 "success."
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The conclusion of the 2+ year disciplinary process with a decision for suspension, *not* revocation, is powerful evidence that the university has chosen its path and it is not dismissal.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (~33 days) makes the completion of any new dismissal proceedings functionally impossible.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Wax's new lawsuit against Penn makes it legally and strategically disadvantageous for the university to escalate the conflict by seeking a harsher penalty.
    *   (↓ Small) The lack of any new public controversy or triggering event in late 2025 reinforces the stability of the post-sanction status quo.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The posterior probability of a "Yes" resolution should be significantly lower than the already very low prior, approaching a near-zero probability.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (signaling YES is more likely):**
    *   A public statement from Wax announcing her resignation or retirement.
    *   A university statement announcing the initiation of *new* dismissal proceedings based on a *new* offense.
    *   Credible media reports of a settlement negotiation where Wax agrees to relinquish tenure.
*   **DOWN indicators (signaling NO is more likely):**
    *   The university files a standard, procedural response to her November 2025 lawsuit.
    *   The passage of time with no new announcements from either Wax or the university.
    *   Statements from academic freedom groups (e.g., FIRE, AAUP) treating the sanction phase as concluded and focusing on the legality of the suspension.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Voluntary Resignation:** The largest uncertainty is a "black swan" personal decision by Wax to resign. This is not driven by university process and is therefore much harder to model.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** A remote possibility exists that her status during a one-year suspension at half-pay could be technically interpreted as not "having tenure" for that period. This is highly unlikely; suspension is a sanction applied *to a tenured professor*, who retains their underlying tenure status. The resolution criteria seem robust against this.
*   **Sealed Settlement:** A settlement could occur where she agrees to leave, but the terms are not made public until after the resolution date.
*   **Health or Personal Issues:** An unforeseen personal or health crisis could lead her to retire suddenly.

**Final Research Summary:**
The university has already concluded its multi-year disciplinary process, imposing a one-year suspension rather than tenure revocation. Given the extremely short time remaining before resolution and Wax's new lawsuit against Penn, the institutional and legal barriers to her losing tenure before 2026 are immense, making a "Yes" outcome exceptionally unlikely.

To forecast the probability that Amy Wax will no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a tenured professor at an elite university being stripped of tenure in any given year is extremely low, likely below 0.1%, and possibly closer to 0.01%. This is due to the rarity of such events, often termed a "corporate death penalty" in academia. Given the context of controversial speech, the base rate is even lower, as successful tenure revocation for speech is almost unheard of. Therefore, we start with a very low prior probability, say 0.01%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a tenured professor at a top university facing disciplinary action, which aligns with the base case of rare tenure revocation.
   - Differences: The disciplinary process has concluded with a sanction short of dismissal, and the timeline is extremely short for any new proceedings to occur. These differences suggest a lower probability than the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Conclusion of disciplinary process with suspension, not revocation: This strongly suggests the university has chosen not to pursue dismissal, decreasing the probability.
   - Short time horizon: With only about a month left, initiating and completing a new tenure revocation process is practically impossible, further decreasing the probability.
   - Active litigation by Wax: This makes it legally and strategically disadvantageous for the university to escalate the conflict, decreasing the probability.
   - No new public controversy: Reinforces the stability of the current situation, decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 0.01% or 0.0001 in probability terms.
   - Likelihood ratio: Given the strong evidence against tenure revocation, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards the event not happening.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0001 × (very low likelihood of revocation given current evidence).
   - Posterior probability: Approaching near-zero probability, significantly lower than the already low prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence check: Consider the possibility of a sudden resignation or a sealed settlement, but these remain low probability events.
   - Alternative forecast: A resignation or new offense could change the outcome, but these are unlikely given the current context.
   - Adjustments: The probability remains extremely low, with no significant adjustments needed.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the completed disciplinary process, short timeline, and ongoing litigation, the probability that Amy Wax will no longer have tenure before 2026 is exceptionally low.

Final: 0.01%

# Will Amy Wax no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for tenured professors losing tenure at elite universities, particularly in cases involving controversial speech.

The most appropriate base rate is extremely low. Tenure revocation at elite universities is often called the "academic death penalty" for its rarity. According to AAUP data, formal dismissal proceedings for tenured professors at R1 universities occur at a rate well below 0.1% annually, with successful revocations being even rarer.

For cases specifically involving controversial speech (rather than misconduct like sexual harassment or research fraud), the rate is even lower due to strong academic freedom protections.

**Prior probability:** 0.1% (1 in 1,000) that a tenured professor at an elite university would lose tenure within a ~3-year period for controversial speech.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Amy Wax is a tenured professor at an elite university (UPenn Law School, ranked in top 24)
- The controversy involves her speech and public comments, not research misconduct or criminal behavior
- Academic freedom principles generally protect controversial speech

**Key differences:**
- The formal disciplinary process has already concluded with a sanction that is NOT tenure revocation (one-year suspension, loss of chair, half-pay)
- The timeline is extremely compressed - only about one month remains until the January 1, 2026 resolution date
- Wax has filed lawsuits against the university, making further university action legally risky
- The university has already invested significant resources in a multi-year process that resulted in sanctions short of dismissal

These differences significantly reduce the probability below the already low base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Completed disciplinary process with lesser sanctions**
- P(E|H): If Wax were to lose tenure, it's unlikely the university would have concluded a lengthy process with lesser sanctions first (0.05)
- P(E|~H): If Wax retains tenure, it's very likely we would see exactly this outcome - a concluded process with lesser sanctions (0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053 (strong evidence against losing tenure)

**Evidence 2: Extremely short remaining timeline (one month)**
- P(E|H): If Wax were to lose tenure before 2026, we would expect more time for a new process (0.01)
- P(E|~H): If Wax retains tenure, the short timeline is exactly what we'd expect to see (0.99)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.01/0.99 = 0.01 (very strong evidence against losing tenure)

**Evidence 3: Wax's active litigation against the university**
- P(E|H): If Wax were to lose tenure, it's unlikely she would be the plaintiff in ongoing litigation (0.2)
- P(E|~H): If Wax retains tenure, her lawsuit is consistent with fighting the existing sanctions (0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25 (moderate evidence against losing tenure)

**Evidence 4: No new triggering events reported**
- P(E|H): If Wax were to lose tenure, we would expect new serious misconduct (0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Wax retains tenure, the absence of new triggers is expected (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (strong evidence against losing tenure)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 0.001/0.999 = 0.001001

Updating with Evidence 1:
Posterior odds = 0.001001 × 0.053 = 0.000053053
Posterior probability = 0.000053053/(1 + 0.000053053) ≈ 0.000053 (0.0053%)

Updating with Evidence 2:
Posterior odds = 0.000053053 × 0.01 = 0.00000053053
Posterior probability = 0.00000053053/(1 + 0.00000053053) ≈ 0.00000053 (0.000053%)

Updating with Evidence 3 and 4 would drive this probability even lower, but I'll stop here as we're already at an extremely low probability.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Voluntary resignation/retirement**: Wax could choose to resign or retire in protest of the sanctions. This wouldn't technically be "losing tenure" but would result in her no longer having tenure.

2. **Settlement agreement**: There could be ongoing confidential negotiations for a settlement where Wax agrees to leave.

3. **Technical interpretation of "having tenure"**: During her suspension period, there might be a technical argument that she doesn't "have tenure" in the full sense, though this seems contrary to standard academic understanding.

4. **Health or personal issues**: Unforeseen personal circumstances could lead to sudden retirement.

The most plausible alternative scenario is voluntary resignation, but given Wax's demonstrated willingness to fight the university through litigation, this seems unlikely. Even accounting for these possibilities, I would adjust my estimate only slightly upward.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that Amy Wax will no longer have tenure at a top-24 US university before 2026 as extremely low. The disciplinary process has concluded with lesser sanctions, there is virtually no time for a new process, and Wax is actively litigating against the university.

Even accounting for the small possibility of voluntary resignation or other unforeseen circumstances, the probability remains well below 1%.

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the probability that a tenured professor at an elite US university, for whom formal disciplinary proceedings have been initiated by the dean, ultimately loses their tenure as a result of that process. Dismissing a tenured professor is an exceptionally rare event. Even when a dean initiates a formal process for a "major sanction," the outcome is often censure, suspension, or a negotiated resignation rather than outright tenure revocation. A reasonable, albeit uncertain, prior at the start of this process in 2022 might have been that there was a 10-20% chance the process would ultimately lead to a loss of tenure before 2026. Let's establish a prior of **15%**.

Prior Odds: 0.15 / (1 - 0.15) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 1 to 5.67.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has moved far beyond the initial base case.
- **Similarity**: The case involves a high-profile, controversial tenured professor at an elite university, fitting the general pattern of such disputes.
- **Differences**: The most critical difference is that the multi-year disciplinary process is no longer pending; it has **concluded**. The university has already rendered its judgment and imposed a sanction. Furthermore, the resolution deadline is extremely close (less than 35 days away), which is a crucial constraint not present in the initial base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event "Amy Wax no longer has tenure before 2026."
Let ~H be the event "Amy Wax still has tenure on Jan 1, 2026."

- **Evidence 1: The outcome of the disciplinary process was a one-year suspension, not tenure revocation (September 2024).**
    - P(E1 | H): The probability that the university would conclude a multi-year process with a suspension, only to then revoke tenure within the next year, is extremely low. This would be a bizarre and procedurally dubious sequence of events.
    - P(E1 | ~H): The probability that the university would impose a suspension if they were *not* going to revoke tenure is very high. A suspension is a standard "major sanction" that achieves the university's goal of punishment while avoiding the much harder fight of tenure revocation.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H) is very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability of H.

- **Evidence 2: The current date is November 28, 2025, leaving only one month until the resolution date.**
    - P(E2 | H): For tenure to be lost now, it would require a sudden event like a resignation or a settlement. A formal, contested tenure revocation process cannot be started and completed in one month. Therefore, the probability of observing this short timeline, given that she will lose tenure, is very low as it constrains the possible mechanisms.
    - P(E2 | ~H): The probability of observing this short timeline, given that she will *not* lose tenure, is 1. The status quo simply continues.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: P(E2 | H) / P(E2 | ~H) is very small (<< 1). This evidence also strongly decreases the probability of H.

- **Evidence 3: Wax filed a new lawsuit against the university alleging academic freedom violations (November 2025).**
    - P(E3 | H): It is unlikely that Wax would be filing a new, forward-looking lawsuit if she were simultaneously negotiating an imminent exit/settlement to relinquish her tenure. While not impossible as a tactic, it points away from a voluntary departure.
    - P(E3 | ~H): This action is highly consistent with a professor who has been sanctioned, intends to keep her job, and is fighting the sanctions legally.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: P(E3 | H) / P(E3 | ~H) is less than 1. This evidence moderately decreases the probability of H.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with our prior odds of 1-to-5.67 (15% probability), we update with the overwhelming evidence.

- **Update with Evidence 1 (Suspension, not revocation)**: This is the decisive evidence. It signals the university has chosen its path, and it is not revocation. This should reduce the odds by a factor of at least 50, if not more.
    - Posterior Odds ≈ (1 / 5.67) * (1 / 50) = 1 / 283.5
    - This brings the probability down to ~0.35%.

- **Update with Evidence 2 & 3 (Short timeline & new lawsuit)**: These further constrain the possibility of a "Yes" resolution to a sudden, voluntary act by Wax, which her lawsuit makes seem less likely. This might reduce the remaining odds by another factor of 2 or 3.
    - Final Odds ≈ (1 / 283.5) * (1 / 3) ≈ 1 / 850.
    - Final Probability ≈ 1 / 851 ≈ 0.12%.

The formal update shows the probability is now extremely low. The initial prior has been almost entirely superseded by the evidence that the process has concluded.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest counter-argument is that the analysis is too focused on the university's formal process and underweights the possibility of a "black swan" event driven by Amy Wax herself.

- **Alternative Scenario**: The new lawsuit is a final, high-pressure tactic to force a rapid settlement. The university, exhausted by the long public fight and legal costs, could agree to a "golden parachute" settlement in which Wax resigns in exchange for a large payment. Such a negotiation could theoretically conclude in December.
- **Plausibility**: This is plausible in theory, but highly unlikely in practice within a 33-day window. Complex legal settlements, especially those involving the departure of a tenured professor, typically take months to negotiate.
- **Risk of Misinterpretation**: Could the one-year suspension itself count as "not having tenure"? This is extremely unlikely. A suspension is a temporary removal of duties applied *to a tenured professor*. They retain their underlying tenure status. The resolution criteria are unlikely to be triggered by this.
- **Conclusion**: The only realistic, though remote, path to a "Yes" is a sudden resignation or settlement. My updated probability of <1% seems to account for this. To be conservative and acknowledge the inherent unpredictability of an individual's actions, a final forecast of 1% is a robust way to signal that the event is highly unlikely but not strictly impossible.

### Final Forecast
The university's disciplinary process against Amy Wax has already concluded with a sanction of a one-year suspension, not tenure revocation. With only one month until the resolution date, there is no time for a new formal process to occur. The only remaining path for a "Yes" resolution is a voluntary resignation or a rapidly concluded settlement, both of which are made less likely by Wax's recent filing of a new lawsuit against the university. The probability of such an event occurring in the next month is extremely low.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event—tenure revocation (or effective loss of tenure) for a professor at a top-24 US university—is drawn from the reference class of tenured professors at elite (R1/top-50) institutions facing dismissal proceedings. According to data from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and general academic governance reports, such revocations are extremely rare, often fewer than 5-10 cases per year nationwide across all universities, with even fewer at elite institutions due to stronger protections and resources. This translates to a base rate of roughly 0.01% to 0.1% per year for any given tenured professor at an elite university losing tenure. Narrowing to cases involving controversial speech (as here), the rate is even lower, perhaps 0.001% or less, as academic freedom protections make pure speech-based dismissals nearly unprecedented (e.g., no clear modern examples at Ivy League levels without additional misconduct like fraud).

I chose this base rate because it reflects historical frequencies from reliable sources like AAUP censures and case studies (e.g., rare successes in cases like Ward Churchill or Steven Salaita, but those were not at top-24 schools and involved years-long processes). For this question's ~3-year window (2022-2026), I'd scale the annual rate up slightly but conservatively, starting with a prior probability of 0.1% (or odds of 1:999), emphasizing the "tail event" nature.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in that it involves a tenured professor at an elite university (UPenn, top-24) facing scrutiny for controversial extramural speech, which historically leads to investigations but rarely to tenure loss—universities often opt for lesser sanctions to avoid legal backlash (e.g., Princeton's Katz case involved added misconduct allegations, yet was criticized for free speech overreach). Like base cases, there's institutional inertia, legal risks, and academic freedom concerns at play.

However, it's different in key ways that lower the probability: (1) The disciplinary process has already concluded with suspension (not revocation), unlike ongoing base cases where escalation is still possible; (2) The remaining timeline is extremely short (~1 month to Jan 1, 2026), while base cases take months/years to resolve; (3) Active litigation by Wax shifts dynamics to defense mode for the university, reducing escalation incentives; (4) No new egregious conduct has emerged, unlike cases that tip toward dismissal. These differences matter because they close off typical pathways to revocation, making this far less likely than even the rare base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Key pieces of evidence from the background and research report:

- **Conclusion of disciplinary process with suspension (not revocation):** P(E | H) low (~10%), as revocation would likely have been the outcome if intended; P(E | ~H) high (~90%), as universities often stop at lesser sanctions for speech cases to minimize risk. Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (strongly decreases probability).
- **Extremely short remaining timeline (~1 month):** P(E | H) very low (~1%), as new processes can't complete in time; P(E | ~H) high (~99%), as status quo persists without time for change. Likelihood ratio: ~0.01 (strongly decreases probability).
- **Wax's new lawsuit against Penn:** P(E | H) moderate (~30%), as it might provoke escalation but rarely does; P(E | ~H) high (~80%), as it deters university action to avoid retaliation claims. Likelihood ratio: ~0.375 (decreases probability).
- **Lack of new triggering events:** P(E | H) low (~20%), as revocation often needs fresh cause; P(E | ~H) high (~95%), reinforcing stability. Likelihood ratio: ~0.21 (decreases probability).

Overall, all evidence points downward, with combined likelihood ratios multiplicatively reducing odds.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 1:999 (P(H) = 0.1%).

First explicit update: Incorporate the process conclusion (LR = 0.11). Posterior odds = 1:999 × 0.11 = 0.11:999 ≈ 1:9082. Posterior P = 1/(1+9082) ≈ 0.011%.

Second update: Add short timeline (LR = 0.01). Posterior odds = 1:9082 × 0.01 ≈ 0.01:9082 ≈ 1:908200. Posterior P ≈ 0.00011%.

Further qualitative updates for lawsuit and no new events (combined LR ~0.08) yield final posterior odds ~1:11,000,000, for P ≈ 0.000009% (essentially near-zero). This remains highly uncertain in absolute terms due to tail risks like sudden resignation, but the evidence overwhelmingly supports a very low probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in dismissing tail risks—e.g., I'm anchoring too heavily on procedural closure, but a "black swan" like Wax resigning in protest (perhaps 1-2% chance independently) could resolve Yes without university action. Alternative scenarios: A sealed settlement or health issue forces her out (tail risk ~0.01%). The best alternative forecast might be ~1% (arguing the prior should be higher at 1% for speech controversies, and litigation could backfire into escalation), plausible if I underestimated Wax's volatility or external pressures (e.g., donor influence). Rebuttal: Data shows universities avoid escalation post-sanction, and the timeline is too short; still, to account for blind spots, I'll nudge up slightly from near-zero to 0.1% for residual uncertainty in voluntary exit or misinterpretation of suspension status.

Final: 0.1%
