### Reference class & base rates
*   **Current HPAI H5N1 Outbreak (2022-2024):** This is the most relevant reference class, as it involves the same viral clade (2.3.4.4b) and current industry/regulatory conditions.
    *   **2022:** ~58.8 million birds affected. Characterized by a massive initial wave as the virus spread across the country.
    *   **2023:** ~23.6 million birds affected. A significant drop from the first year, suggesting potential adaptation or a lull between migratory seasons.
    *   **2024:** ~91.1 million birds affected (extrapolated from partial data and late-year surge). The year saw a quiet start but a massive resurgence in Q4, particularly in California egg-laying facilities.
    *   **Base Rate Range:** The annual data (approx. 24M, 59M, 91M) shows extreme volatility and no clear trend. The simple average is ~58 million, but the distribution is wide and skewed by a few massive outbreaks. A prior distribution should reflect this high variance, with a median perhaps in the 40-60 million range but with very fat tails.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-02-25** HPAI cases reported as surging since Nov 2024, with 134 new poultry cases in the last 30 days. — ↑ — Indicates high viral momentum and widespread activity entering the 2025 spring migration season.
*   **2025-02-20** USDA confirms 964 HPAI detections in dairy cattle across 17 states. — ↑ — Establishes a new, large, and potentially year-round mammalian reservoir for the virus, increasing overall environmental pressure.
*   **2025-01-09** Report highlights California as the epicenter of 2024 outbreaks, with 59 affected commercial flocks. — ↑ — Geographic concentration in a state with high poultry density suggests vulnerability to repeated, large-scale outbreaks remains high.
*   **2024-11-21** A single outbreak in Kern County, CA, affects over 1 million commercial laying hens. — ↑ — Demonstrates the high-impact, stochastic nature of the threat, where one biosecurity failure can add millions to the total.
*   **2024-10-12** First human HPAI case in Kern County confirmed, linked to infected dairy cattle. — ↔ — While concerning for public health, this has little direct impact on the number of birds culled, but it increases regulatory and public scrutiny.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Wild Bird Migration (Large):** The primary long-range vector for introducing the virus into new areas. Outbreaks have historically peaked during the spring (Mar-May) and fall (Oct-Dec) migrations.
*   **Mammalian Reservoir (Large):** The unprecedented and widespread infection in dairy cattle creates a novel, non-migratory source of viral amplification and potential spillover to poultry, especially where farms are co-located.
*   **Biosecurity & Farm Density (Large):** The virus spreads locally via contaminated equipment, personnel, and pests. High-density poultry regions (e.g., Iowa, California, Minnesota) are exceptionally vulnerable to rapid, cascading outbreaks once the virus is introduced.
*   **Virus Evolution (Moderate):** The H5N1 virus is constantly evolving. The jump to cattle demonstrates its capacity to adapt. Further evolution could alter its transmissibility or pathogenicity in poultry, though the direction is uncertain.
*   **Depopulation Policy (Large):** The standing USDA policy of culling entire affected and exposed flocks is the direct mechanism generating the resolution numbers. Any change to this policy (e.g., toward vaccination) would be a regime change.
*   **Seasonality & Weather (Small/Moderate):** The virus survives longer in cool, damp conditions, potentially exacerbating spread during spring and fall. Extreme weather events could also alter wild bird behavior and migration patterns.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Established Mammalian Reservoir:** Unlike in 2022-2024, the US now has a large, geographically dispersed HPAI reservoir in dairy cattle. This is a fundamental change, creating a persistent, year-round source of viral pressure independent of wild bird migration.
*   **Increased Viral Endemicity:** The virus is no longer a novel invader as it was in 2022. It is now deeply entrenched in wild bird populations and multiple mammal species across North America, increasing the baseline probability of introduction onto farms.
*   **Heightened Industry/Regulatory Awareness:** After three years, biosecurity protocols are more mature. However, the massive outbreaks in late 2024 show that even enhanced measures are fallible against intense viral pressure.
*   **Active Vaccination Debate:** While not yet policy, the persistent threat and spillover to mammals have intensified discussions around poultry vaccination. A policy shift in 2025, while unlikely to be fully implemented, could begin to alter the long-term outlook.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2022-2024 data should be wide and right-skewed (e.g., a Lognormal distribution) centered around 45-55 million, with a low strength (equivalent n≈3) to reflect the high year-to-year variance.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The establishment of a widespread HPAI reservoir in dairy cattle is a structural break from the past, significantly increasing the baseline risk of spillover to poultry.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** The high number of outbreaks in late 2024 and early 2025 indicates strong momentum carrying into the new year, suggesting 2025 will start with high viral activity.
    *   **↑ Small:** The virus is now more endemic and geographically widespread in wildlife than at the start of the reference period, increasing the chances of random introductions.
    *   **↓ Small:** The poultry industry has more experience with this specific virus, potentially leading to marginally better biosecurity effectiveness, though this is a weak counteracting force.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests an upward update. The new mammalian reservoir is a game-changer that the historical data does not fully capture. The posterior median should move significantly higher than the prior, likely into the 60-80 million range, with the upper tail of the distribution becoming much thicker.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmation of cattle-to-poultry transmission on a farm.
    *   Multiple large (>1 million birds) outbreaks during the spring 2025 migration.
    *   USDA reports of high HPAI prevalence in wild bird surveillance data.
    *   Significant expansion of HPAI detections in dairy herds into new states

To forecast the number of farmed birds that will be killed in the United States due to bird flu in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate for this forecast is the historical data from the current HPAI H5N1 outbreak from 2022 to 2024. The annual numbers of birds affected were approximately 58.8 million in 2022, 23.6 million in 2023, and an extrapolated 91.1 million in 2024. The simple average is about 58 million birds per year, but the distribution is highly variable and skewed. Therefore, a lognormal distribution centered around 45-55 million with a high variance is appropriate to capture this variability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that the virus remains highly pathogenic and the depopulation policy remains unchanged. However, the situation differs significantly due to the establishment of a mammalian reservoir in dairy cattle, which increases the baseline risk of spillover to poultry. This structural change suggests a higher baseline risk than in previous years.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **High Viral Momentum:** The surge in cases since late 2024 and early 2025 indicates strong viral momentum, suggesting higher numbers.
- **Mammalian Reservoir:** The presence of HPAI in dairy cattle is a significant factor that increases the likelihood of higher numbers due to a persistent source of infection.
- **Geographic Concentration:** The concentration of outbreaks in high-density poultry regions like California increases the risk of large-scale outbreaks.
- **Biosecurity Improvements:** While biosecurity measures have improved, the late 2024 outbreaks show they are not foolproof, providing a weak counterbalance.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered around 50 million, the evidence, particularly the establishment of a mammalian reservoir and high viral momentum, suggests a significant upward adjustment. The posterior distribution should reflect a higher median and a thicker upper tail, indicating a higher probability of extreme outcomes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Potential overconfidence in the forecast could arise from underestimating the effectiveness of improved biosecurity measures or potential policy shifts towards vaccination. However, the evidence of recent large outbreaks suggests these factors are not yet sufficient to counteract the increased risk. An alternative forecast might consider a lower impact if biosecurity measures prove more effective than anticipated, but the current evidence supports a higher forecast.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the evidence and Bayesian updating, the forecast percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased risk and variability:

P10: 40 million  
P20: 50 million  
P40: 65 million  
P60: 75 million  
P80: 90 million  
P90: 110 million

# Forecasting the Number of Farmed Birds Killed Due to Bird Flu in the US in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the recent historical data from the current HPAI H5N1 outbreak (2022-2024) as my primary reference class:
- 2022: ~58.8 million birds affected
- 2023: ~23.6 million birds affected
- 2024: ~91.1 million birds affected (based on data through late 2024)

This gives a mean of approximately 58 million birds per year, but with extremely high variance. The distribution is right-skewed, with 2024 showing a significant increase over previous years. Given this pattern and the high volatility, I'll use a lognormal distribution with a median around 50-55 million birds and a wide spread to reflect the uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Same virus strain (H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b) is circulating
- Same USDA depopulation policies remain in effect (culling entire affected flocks)
- Similar poultry industry structure and density patterns
- Seasonal migration patterns of wild birds remain a key transmission vector

**Key differences:**
- **Established mammalian reservoir:** Unlike previous years, there is now a widespread reservoir in dairy cattle (964 detections across 17 states), creating a year-round source of viral pressure independent of wild bird migration
- **Increased viral endemicity:** The virus is now deeply entrenched in North American ecosystems after several years
- **High momentum entering 2025:** The surge in late 2024 (particularly in California) suggests strong viral activity carrying into 2025
- **Industry adaptation:** The poultry industry has more experience with this virus, potentially improving biosecurity measures

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers:**
- The establishment of HPAI in dairy cattle creates a novel, persistent reservoir that increases baseline risk to poultry (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher numbers)
- 134 new poultry cases in the 30 days before February 2025 indicates high viral momentum entering the spring migration season (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher numbers)
- Geographic concentration in California (59 affected commercial flocks) demonstrates vulnerability in high-density poultry regions (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring higher numbers)
- Single large outbreaks (e.g., 1+ million birds in Kern County) show the stochastic, high-impact nature of the threat (likelihood ratio ~1.3:1 favoring higher numbers)

**Evidence supporting lower numbers:**
- Increased industry experience and potentially improved biosecurity protocols after three years of outbreaks (likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 favoring lower numbers)
- Possible policy shifts toward vaccination, though unlikely to be fully implemented in 2025 (likelihood ratio ~1.1:1 favoring lower numbers)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered around 50-55 million birds, I need to update based on the evidence above:

The strongest update comes from the established mammalian reservoir in dairy cattle, which fundamentally changes the dynamics compared to previous years. This shifts my distribution significantly upward.

Prior median: ~52 million birds
Likelihood ratio from mammalian reservoir: ~3:1 favoring higher numbers
First update: Shifts median to ~70-75 million birds

The high viral momentum entering 2025 provides another significant update:
Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher numbers
Second update: Further shifts median to ~85-90 million birds

The remaining evidence factors provide smaller adjustments, resulting in a posterior distribution with:
- Median: ~90 million birds
- Wider right tail to account for the possibility of catastrophic outbreaks
- Slightly narrower left tail as the evidence makes very low numbers less plausible

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent events (recency bias), particularly the late 2024 surge
- The relationship between cattle infections and poultry outbreaks is still not fully understood
- I might be underestimating the effectiveness of enhanced biosecurity measures
- Potential policy changes (e.g., emergency vaccination approval) could significantly alter outcomes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Lower-than-expected scenario (~30-40 million):** If the industry implements dramatically improved biosecurity, or if the virus evolves to become less transmissible in poultry
- **Much higher scenario (~150+ million):** If multiple large outbreaks occur in high-density regions, or if direct cattle-to-poultry transmission becomes common

**Adjustments for overconfidence:**
- I should widen my distribution, particularly the tails, to account for the high uncertainty and potential for extreme outcomes
- The right tail should be extended further to account for the possibility of unprecedented outbreaks

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to be wider than I initially considered, with a median around 85-90 million birds but with fat tails:

P10: 35,000,000
P20: 50,000,000
P40: 75,000,000
P60: 95,000,000
P80: 130,000,000
P90: 170,000,000

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the current HPAI H5N1 outbreak in the United States, which began in 2022. This period uses the same viral clade (2.3.4.4b) and operates under the current USDA policy of depopulating affected flocks. The annual data for birds killed are:
*   **2022:** ~58.8 million
*   **2023:** ~23.6 million
*   **2024:** ~91.1 million

This small dataset of three years shows extreme volatility. The mean is approximately 57.8 million, and the median is 58.8 million. The key characteristic is high variance and a right-skewed distribution, where a few massive outbreaks in high-density facilities (like egg-laying operations) can dominate the total. My prior distribution is therefore a wide, right-skewed distribution (akin to a log-normal) with a median around 55-60 million, reflecting the historical data but acknowledging the high uncertainty with a very wide spread.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The same H5N1 virus clade continues to circulate.
*   The primary long-range transmission vector remains wild migratory birds, leading to expected seasonal peaks in spring and fall.
*   The US poultry industry structure (high-density farms) and the USDA's depopulation policy are unchanged.

**Differences:**
*   **Established Mammalian Reservoir:** The most significant difference is the widespread HPAI infection in US dairy cattle, confirmed across 17 states by early 2025. This creates a novel, large, and potentially year-round reservoir for the virus, fundamentally increasing the environmental viral pressure on poultry farms beyond the seasonal risk from wild birds.
*   **High Momentum:** The outbreak surged in late 2024 and continued with high activity into early 2025. Unlike previous years which may have started from a lower baseline, 2025 begins amidst a significant ongoing wave of infections.
*   **Increased Endemicity:** After three years, the virus is more deeply entrenched in North American wildlife than it was at the start of the reference period, increasing the baseline probability of farm introductions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
*   **Evidence 1: Cattle Reservoir (Strong Upward Pressure):** The establishment of a large mammalian reservoir is a structural break from the 2022-2024 period. It introduces a new, persistent source of potential spillover. This makes outcomes higher than the historical average significantly more likely. I estimate this factor makes a high-cull year (>80M) at least 2-3 times as likely as a low-cull year (<40M) compared to the prior.
*   **Evidence 2: High Momentum (Moderate Upward Pressure):** The surge in cases from late 2024 into early 2025 indicates that the year is starting with high viral activity. This strongly disfavors a repeat of the 2023 lull (~24M) and pushes the entire distribution to the right.
*   **Evidence 3: Industry Adaptation (Weak Downward Pressure):** The poultry industry has three years of experience with this virus, potentially leading to improved biosecurity. However, the massive outbreaks in California in late 2024 demonstrate that these measures are fallible under intense viral pressure. This is a minor counteracting force.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A wide, right-skewed distribution with a median around 58 million.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence, dominated by the new cattle reservoir and high starting momentum, strongly favors higher numbers.
*   **Update:** I update my prior by shifting the entire distribution to the right. The prior median of ~58M is adjusted upwards significantly. The cattle reservoir is a game-changer, suggesting the average year under current conditions will be worse than the 2022-2024 average. The high momentum reinforces this. My posterior median shifts to approximately 85 million. The variance remains high, and the right tail becomes fatter, as the new reservoir increases the potential for catastrophic, multi-state outbreaks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative (Low) Scenario:** A much lower number (~30M) could occur if cattle-to-poultry transmission proves highly inefficient, the virus in cattle is a dead end, and the wild bird migratory seasons are unusually mild (similar to 2023). While possible, this scenario discounts the known high viral load in a new, widespread reservoir.
*   **Alternative (High) Scenario:** A much higher number (>150M) is plausible. If cattle-to-poultry transmission is efficient, or if the high environmental load from cattle sparks outbreaks in multiple high-density poultry states (e.g., Iowa, Georgia) simultaneously, the total could far exceed the 2024 record. The 2024 record was largely driven by one state (California); a multi-state crisis could be much worse.
*   **Adjustment:** The high-end scenario seems more plausible than the low-end one because the primary new evidence (cattle reservoir) is a known, large-scale risk factor with an uncertain but likely negative impact. My forecast maintains a fat right tail to account for this significant upside risk. My median of 85M reflects a year similar to or slightly worse than the record year of 2024, which seems justified by the new risk factors.

P20: 45000000
P40: 65000000
