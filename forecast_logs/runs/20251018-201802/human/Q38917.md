### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Interstate wars lasting >2 years since 1945:** Wars that reach this stage often become protracted conflicts of attrition. Of the ~30 major interstate wars since 1945, those lasting over two years (e.g., Iran-Iraq, Korea, Vietnam) have a low annual rate of resolution via a stable ceasefire. A rough estimate suggests a **15-20%** chance of a durable ceasefire being implemented in any given subsequent year. This class is broad but provides a general starting point for attritional conflicts.
2.  **Conflicts involving a great power vs. a smaller state backed by another great power:** This is a more specific class (e.g., Soviet-Afghan War, Vietnam War, Syrian Civil War). These conflicts are often prolonged, with endings heavily dependent on the patron power's political will. Ceasefires are frequently tied to shifts in the patron's domestic politics. The base rate for a stable ceasefire in a given year is likely similar or slightly lower than the general class, perhaps **10-25%**, due to the complex geopolitics.
3.  **"Frozen" conflicts initiated by Russia/USSR:** This class includes Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and the Donbas (pre-2022). Russia has a history of initiating ceasefires that lock in territorial gains and create unstable, long-term frozen conflicts. However, these were typically lower-intensity conflicts than the current war. The base rate of a *new* comprehensive ceasefire in these zones is very low, but the rate of *initiating* such a freeze after a period of high-intensity fighting is a relevant pattern. This suggests a ceasefire is a plausible Russian strategic goal, but provides little frequency data.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-17** Zelenskyy states Putin engages with Trump whenever advanced weapons (Tomahawks) are discussed. — **↑** — This reveals a primary, and apparently effective, US lever to compel Russian negotiation, making a forced settlement more likely.
*   **2025-10-16** Zelenskyy meets Trump in Washington to request Tomahawks amidst a Russian offensive in Donetsk. — **↑** — The situation is coming to a head. Ukraine's need and Russia's push create urgency, which is a prerequisite for a major diplomatic intervention by Trump.
*   **2025-10-16** Trump unveils plans for a triumphal arch in D.C. for 2026. — **↑ (small)** — Indicates a focus on domestic legacy projects. A foreign policy "win" like ending a major war would fit this narrative, increasing his motivation to force a deal.
*   **2025-08-18** Reports on Tesla's ambitious 2026 production plans. — **↑ (small)** — While indirect, the focus of key Trump advisor Elon Musk on his business ventures suggests he, too, would favor a swift resolution to the conflict to reduce geopolitical instability.
*   **2025-04-29** Reports confirm Trump's administration is actively implementing Project 2025's domestic agenda. — **↑** — A strong focus on a disruptive domestic agenda suggests a desire to minimize complex, resource-draining foreign entanglements, increasing the pressure on Ukraine to accept a deal.
*   **2024-11-19** Zelenskyy declares 2025 will be the "decisive" year for the war's outcome. — **↑** — This signals Ukrainian leadership anticipates a major turning point, which could be a military victory or a negotiated settlement under new political realities.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Trump Administration's "Deal" Imperative (Large ↑):** The single most significant driver. Trump's campaign promise to end the war "in 24 hours" and his transactional approach to foreign policy create immense pressure for a settlement, likely before the 2026 midterms.
2.  **US Military Aid as a Bargaining Chip (Large ↑/↓):** The Trump administration appears to be using the *threat* of providing/withholding game-changing weapons (Tomahawks) as a lever to force both Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. This can either precipitate a deal or, if it fails, lead to escalation.
3.  **Battlefield Attrition and Stalemate (Moderate ↑):** By late 2025, both sides will have endured almost three years of high-intensity warfare. Manpower and equipment shortages, coupled with the high cost of offensives, make a ceasefire to regroup and consolidate increasingly appealing.
4.  **Ukrainian Maximalist War Aims (Large ↓):** Ukraine's official position remains the liberation of all territory to its 1991 borders. A ceasefire that freezes Russian gains would be politically toxic for Zelenskyy and contrary to national sentiment, representing a major barrier.
5.  **Russian Opportunism (Moderate ↓):** Putin may perceive Trump's desire for a deal as a sign of weakness and an opportunity to lock in gains while paying a low price. He may engage in performative negotiations while continuing offensives to maximize leverage, without intending to honor a ceasefire.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Patron Pressure:** Unlike most historical proxy wars, the primary patron (USA) is led by an executive (Trump) with a strong, publicly stated personal political incentive to end the conflict quickly, even on terms unfavorable to its ally.
*   **Direct Presidential Diplomacy:** The dynamic is not one of slow, back-channel diplomacy. It is characterized by direct, high-stakes interactions between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Putin, making outcomes more volatile and personality-dependent.
*   **Explicit Linkage of Aid to Negotiation:** The conditioning of military support on a willingness to negotiate a specific type of deal is unusually explicit, turning the aid spigot into a direct tool of coercion against an ally.
*   **Asymmetric Stakes:** For Ukraine, the war is existential. For the Trump administration, it is a transactional foreign policy problem to be "solved." This stark difference creates a power imbalance that is not typical of all patron-client relationships.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of **~20%** seems appropriate, derived from the reference class of interstate wars in their third or fourth year (equivalent n≈5, with 1 success).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The Trump administration's explicit and urgent goal of forcing a deal.
    *   **↑ (Large):** The active use of advanced weaponry as a direct, coercive lever on both parties.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The timing of high-level meetings and diplomatic pressure in late 2025.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The fundamental incompatibility of a likely Trump-brokered deal (involving territorial concessions) with Ukraine's core strategic objectives.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** Russia's incentive to exploit the situation for maximum gain, potentially scuttling a deal it sees as insufficiently advantageous.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests a high probability of a *ceasefire attempt*. The upward pressures from the US are immense and novel. While the obstacles are significant, the unique nature of the primary driver (Trump) should push the posterior **significantly upwards** from the base rate.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Formal announcement of a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest or another neutral venue.
    *   A significant, unexplained reduction in the intensity of Russian offensive operations in Donetsk.
    *   Leaked reports from US officials outlining the framework of a "land for peace" deal.
    *   US officials publicly floating a post-war reconstruction package for Ukraine, conditioned on a settlement.
    *   Zelenskyy's rhetoric shifts from total victory to "saving Ukrainian lives" and "securing the state."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   US approval and delivery of Tomahawk missiles or other advanced long-range systems to Ukraine.
    *   Zelenskyy or other senior Ukrainian officials publicly and vehemently reject a US-backed peace proposal.
    *   Russia achieves a major strategic breakthrough on the battlefield (e.g., encircling a major city).
    *   The planned Trump-Putin meeting is cancelled or indefinitely postponed.
    *   Trump's attention is captured by a new domestic or international crisis.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Rigor:** The resolution requires the ceasefire to hold for 30 days and be comprehensive. A "Potemkin ceasefire" with constant low-level fighting or one that excludes certain regions (e.g., Crimea) would not suffice and could be a likely but non-resolving outcome.
*   **Trump's Volatility:** The entire thesis rests on Trump's continued focus. He is known

To forecast the probability of a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a durable ceasefire in interstate wars lasting over two years is approximately 15-20%. Given the specific context of a great power conflict with a smaller state backed by another great power, a slightly lower base rate of 10-25% is appropriate. For this analysis, we will use a prior probability of 20%, reflecting the midpoint of this range.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The conflict has lasted over two years, fitting the pattern of protracted wars. The involvement of great powers aligns with historical proxy conflicts.
   - Differences: The unique factor here is the Trump administration's explicit goal to end the conflict quickly, which is not typical in historical cases. This could significantly alter the dynamics and increase the likelihood of a ceasefire.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Trump's Deal Imperative (Large ↑):** The administration's strong motivation to broker a deal increases the likelihood of a ceasefire. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **US Military Aid as a Bargaining Chip (Large ↑/↓):** The use of military aid as leverage could either facilitate or hinder negotiations. Likelihood ratio slightly > 1.
   - **Battlefield Attrition and Stalemate (Moderate ↑):** The prolonged conflict may push both sides toward a ceasefire. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Ukrainian Maximalist War Aims (Large ↓):** Ukraine's resistance to territorial concessions decreases the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Russian Opportunism (Moderate ↓):** Russia's potential to exploit negotiations for gains decreases the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.20 / 0.80 = 0.25
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is approximately 1.5 (reflecting the stronger upward pressures).
   - Posterior odds = 0.25 × 1.5 = 0.375
   - Posterior probability = 0.375 / (1 + 0.375) ≈ 0.273 or 27.3%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could overestimate Trump's ability to broker a deal given the complex geopolitical stakes.
   - Alternative scenario: A major battlefield shift or internal political changes in Ukraine or Russia could alter the dynamics.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a temporary ceasefire that does not meet the resolution criteria, which could skew perceptions.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential pitfalls, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect the nuanced geopolitical landscape and the unique pressures from the Trump administration.

Final: 27%

# Will there be a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

- **Interstate wars lasting >2 years**: By 2025, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have lasted 3+ years. Historical data suggests a 15-20% chance of a durable ceasefire being implemented in any given subsequent year for wars that reach this stage.

- **Great power vs. smaller state backed by another great power**: This more specific reference class (Soviet-Afghan War, Vietnam War) suggests a 10-25% annual probability of ceasefire.

- **"Frozen" conflicts initiated by Russia/USSR**: While Russia has a history of creating frozen conflicts (Transnistria, South Ossetia, etc.), the current war is much higher intensity, making direct comparisons difficult.

Given these considerations, I'll use a prior of **20%** - representing the approximate annual probability of a comprehensive ceasefire in a protracted interstate conflict entering its fourth year. This is consistent with historical patterns while acknowledging the unique aspects of this conflict.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other protracted conflicts, both sides have experienced significant attrition
- The conflict involves a great power against a smaller state backed by external powers
- There are territorial disputes with entrenched positions
- Both sides face domestic political constraints on compromise

**Key differences:**
- The Trump administration has an unusually explicit and personal stake in ending the conflict quickly
- Direct presidential diplomacy is occurring at an unusually high level
- Military aid is being explicitly linked to negotiation in an unusually direct manner
- The timing coincides with the US electoral cycle, creating unique political pressures
- The conflict directly involves a nuclear power in its near-abroad, raising the stakes

These differences, particularly the Trump administration's explicit goal of forcing a deal, suggest the probability should be adjusted upward from the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence favoring a ceasefire:**

1. **Trump's campaign promise and personal stake** (Strong ↑)
   - P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If a ceasefire occurs, Trump's personal involvement would almost certainly be a key factor
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even without a ceasefire, Trump would still push for one
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2.25x in favor of ceasefire

2. **Use of advanced weapons as leverage** (Moderate ↑)
   - P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Weapons like Tomahawks being used as bargaining chips is consistent with a negotiation strategy
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This approach could also lead to escalation if mishandled
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.6x in favor of ceasefire

3. **War fatigue and battlefield stalemate** (Moderate ↑)
   - P(E|H): High (~0.7) - A ceasefire becomes more likely as both sides face resource constraints
   - P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even without a ceasefire, attrition is occurring
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.75x in favor of ceasefire

**Evidence against a ceasefire:**

1. **Ukrainian maximalist war aims** (Strong ↓)
   - P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If a ceasefire occurs, Ukraine would likely have to compromise on its core objectives
   - P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - Without a ceasefire, Ukraine would maintain its position on territorial integrity
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.33x against ceasefire

2. **Russian opportunism** (Moderate ↓)
   - P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Russia might accept a ceasefire that locks in gains
   - P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Russia has incentives to exploit Trump's desire for a deal without making concessions
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.63x against ceasefire

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), I'll update based on the key evidence:

1. Trump's personal stake (LR = 2.25)
   - Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
   - Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2.25 = 0.5625
   - Posterior probability: 0.5625/(1+0.5625) ≈ 36%

2. Ukrainian maximalist war aims (LR = 0.33)
   - Prior odds: 0.5625
   - Posterior odds: 0.5625 × 0.33 = 0.186
   - Posterior probability: 0.186/(1+0.186) ≈ 16%

3. War fatigue and battlefield stalemate (LR = 1.75)
   - Prior odds: 0.186
   - Posterior odds: 0.186 × 1.75 = 0.326
   - Posterior probability: 0.326/(1+0.326) ≈ 25%

4. Russian opportunism (LR = 0.63)
   - Prior odds: 0.326
   - Posterior odds: 0.326 × 0.63 = 0.205
   - Posterior probability: 0.205/(1+0.205) ≈ 17%

5. Weapons as leverage (LR = 1.6)
   - Prior odds: 0.205
   - Posterior odds: 0.205 × 1.6 = 0.328
   - Posterior probability: 0.328/(1+0.328) ≈ 25%

After incorporating all key evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 25%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating Trump's ability to force a deal if both parties are fundamentally unwilling
- The resolution criteria require a comprehensive ceasefire that holds for 30 days, which is a high bar
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a major battlefield development changing the calculus
- The Manifold market is at 10.4%, suggesting I may be overconfident

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A partial ceasefire that doesn't meet resolution criteria (e.g., limited to certain regions)
- A ceasefire that quickly breaks down before the 30-day requirement
- Trump losing interest or being distracted by other priorities
- A major Russian offensive succeeding, reducing their incentive to negotiate

**Adjustments:**
Given the strict resolution criteria and the Manifold market's lower estimate, I should adjust my forecast downward slightly. The requirement for a comprehensive ceasefire that holds for 30 days is particularly challenging given the history of failed ceasefires in this conflict.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe there is approximately a 22% chance of a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict before 2026.

Final: 22%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of major interstate wars since 1945 that have lasted for more than two years. The Russo-Ukrainian War began its full-scale phase in February 2022, and by 2025, it will be in its third full year, fitting this class. Historical data for such protracted conflicts (e.g., Iran-Iraq War, Korean War) suggests that the annual probability of a durable ceasefire or resolution is low. The research report suggests a range of 10-25% for a similar reference class. I will select a prior probability of **20%**. This reflects the inherent difficulty of ending wars of attrition once they become entrenched, but acknowledges that it is not impossible. In odds form, this is 1:4 (one chance of success for every four chances of failure).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:** The current conflict mirrors the historical base case in several ways. It has become a war of attrition with relatively static front lines, inflicting heavy casualties and economic costs on both sides. It also involves a great power (Russia) fighting a smaller state (Ukraine) that is heavily backed by another great power (the USA), a classic proxy war dynamic. These factors typically lead to prolonged conflicts.

**Differences:** The most significant difference is the nature of the primary patron's involvement. The US administration under President Trump has a publicly stated, urgent, and personal political motivation to broker a "deal" to end the war quickly. This is a departure from the more typical gradual waning of support due to war fatigue. The explicit use of military aid (the potential delivery of Tomahawk missiles) as a direct, coercive bargaining chip against both Ukraine and Russia is an unusually sharp and powerful diplomatic tool. This creates a situation of extreme pressure that is not characteristic of the base case and makes a sudden resolution more plausible than historical precedent would suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key evidence, considering the hypothesis (H) that a bilateral ceasefire occurs before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Intense US Diplomatic Pressure.** The reports of high-level meetings between Trump and Zelenskyy in late 2025, combined with Trump's established "deal-maker" persona and desire for a foreign policy win, constitute strong evidence. This level of direct presidential intervention to force a settlement is much more likely if a ceasefire is imminent (P(E|H) is high) than if the war is set to continue indefinitely (P(E|~H) is lower). This evidence **strongly increases** the probability of a ceasefire. (Likelihood Ratio > 1).

*   **Evidence 2: Ukrainian Political Constraints.** Ukraine's stated war aim is the liberation of all its 1991 territory. Any ceasefire brokered by Trump would almost certainly involve ceding territory to Russia. Such a deal would be seen as a national betrayal by a large portion of the Ukrainian population and military, making it politically toxic and potentially unenforceable for any Ukrainian leader. This fundamental obstacle is very likely to persist if no ceasefire occurs (P(E|~H) is high) and would have to be overcome for a ceasefire to happen (P(E|H) is low). This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability. (Likelihood Ratio < 1).

*   **Evidence 3: Short Timeline and High Resolution Bar.** The current date is October 18, 2025. For the question to resolve "Yes," a ceasefire must be implemented and hold for 30 days, with that period starting no later than December 31, 2025. This means a deal must effectively be in place by December 1, 2025—a very short window to resolve a complex, existential conflict. Furthermore, the 30-day stability requirement is a high bar for a coerced and likely unpopular agreement. This evidence **moderately decreases** the probability. (Likelihood Ratio < 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I begin with a prior of 20% (odds of 1:4).

1.  The primary evidence is the unprecedented pressure from the Trump administration. This is the most significant new variable. I'll estimate this has a likelihood ratio of approximately 3, reflecting that this intense push is three times more likely if a deal is to be made than if not.
    *   *Updated Odds* = Prior Odds × LR = (1/4) × 3 = 3/4.
    *   This translates to a probability of 3/(3+4) = 3/7 ≈ 43%.

2.  Next, I must account for the powerful countervailing forces: Ukraine's political red lines, Russia's potential to exploit the situation, and the short timeline. Combined, these factors make a *stable* ceasefire very difficult to achieve. I'll estimate their combined effect as a negative likelihood ratio of roughly 1/2. They halve the odds of a successful outcome.
    *   *Final Odds* = (3/4) × (1/2) = 3/8.
    *   *Final Probability* = 3 / (3 + 8) = 3/11 ≈ 27.3%.

This calculation suggests that the unique US pressure significantly increases the chances from the base rate, but the fundamental obstacles remain formidable, keeping the probability well below 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~27% is substantially higher than the Manifold market's prediction of 10.4%. The market may be correctly assessing that the political barriers within Ukraine are nearly absolute, making any deal that Trump could broker dead on arrival. I might be overestimating the power of US coercion against the existential will of a nation at war. A coerced deal is inherently fragile and may be designed to fail; the 30-day stability requirement is a critical hurdle that could easily be missed. A plausible alternative scenario is that Trump's pressure campaign backfires, leading to a public refusal from Zelenskyy and a breakdown in negotiations, driving the probability close to zero. Given the strength of this counterargument and the market signal, I will adjust my forecast slightly downwards from my calculated 27% to account for this fragility and the high risk of failure.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for a durable ceasefire in a protracted war of this type is low, around 20%. The primary factor increasing the probability is the unique and intense pressure from the Trump administration to force a deal before the end of 2025. However, this is counteracted by the immense political difficulty for any Ukrainian leader to accept the territorial concessions that would likely be required, as well as the short timeline and the high bar for a 30-day stable ceasefire. While the probability of a ceasefire *attempt* is high, the probability of a *successful and stable* ceasefire meeting the resolution criteria is much lower. Balancing these powerful opposing forces, I assess the probability to be slightly higher than the historical base rate but still unlikely.

Final: 25%
