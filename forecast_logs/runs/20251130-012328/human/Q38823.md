### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Severe Seasonal Influenza (U.S.):** This is the most analogous reference class for an endemic respiratory virus with significant mortality. Base rate is **20,000–60,000 deaths/year**. The 2017-2018 season was particularly severe, with an estimated 52,000 deaths. This class represents a plausible floor or stabilization point for endemic COVID-19 mortality.
2.  **Early Pandemic COVID-19 (U.S., 2020-2021):** This class represents the virus spreading through a largely immunologically naive population without widespread effective treatments or vaccines. The base rate is **385,000–465,000 deaths/year** (385,579 in 2020; 462,193 in 2021, per CDC WONDER). This serves as a high-end anchor, demonstrating the virus's potential under worst-case conditions.
3.  **Top 10 Causes of Death (U.S.):** This class contextualizes COVID-19's overall public health burden. In 2021, COVID-19 was the #3 cause of death. The #8-10 causes (e.g., Influenza/Pneumonia, Kidney Disease) typically cause **50,000–65,000 deaths/year**. This provides a benchmark for when COVID-19 transitions from a top-tier public health crisis to a more typical, albeit serious, cause of mortality.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-01** Fall/Winter 2025-2026 updated vaccine rollout begins. **(↓)** Matters because it targets circulating variants (e.g., descendants of "FLiRT"), aiming to reduce severe outcomes in the vulnerable during the winter respiratory virus season.
*   **2025-08-20** CDC reports wastewater surveillance shows rising COVID-19 activity in the Northeast, signaling the start of a potential fall wave. **(↑)** Matters as it is a leading indicator of a seasonal increase in transmission, which precedes increases in hospitalizations and deaths.
*   **2025-06-15** Major health systems report continued low uptake of antiviral treatments like Paxlovid for eligible patients, citing patient hesitancy and provider inertia. **(↑)** Matters because underutilization of effective treatments directly leads to more preventable severe disease and death than would otherwise occur.
*   **2025-04-30** End-of-season data for the 2024-2025 winter shows COVID-19 deaths were lower than the severe 2017-2018 flu season. **(↓)** Matters because it provides strong evidence that COVID-19 mortality has settled into a new, lower baseline, even during its seasonal peak.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Population Immunity (The "Immunity Wall"):** The combination of vaccination and repeated infections has built a substantial, albeit complex and waning, wall of immunity in the population. This is the primary driver reducing the infection-fatality rate. **(Large, downward pressure)**
2.  **Viral Evolution:** The virus continues to evolve, primarily towards greater immune evasion. A variant that also features a significant increase in intrinsic severity is a low-probability, high-impact risk. **(Large, primarily upward pressure on cases; uncertain on severity)**
3.  **Medical Countermeasures:** The effectiveness and uptake of annual updated vaccines and the availability of antivirals (e.g., Paxlovid) are key levers. They directly sever the link between infection and death, especially for high-risk groups. **(Moderate, downward pressure)**
4.  **Behavioral Normalization:** Public fatigue is complete. There is virtually no public appetite for mandates or widespread behavioral changes (e.g., masking). The response is now almost entirely individualized. **(Small, upward pressure)**
5.  **Demographics:** The U.S. population is aging, increasing the pool of individuals at high risk for severe outcomes. Furthermore, the "harvesting effect" of the early pandemic may have removed many of the most vulnerable, potentially lowering near-term death rates. **(Moderate, mixed effects)**
6.  **Data Reporting Infrastructure:** As the public health emergency has ended, states have scaled back reporting frequency and granularity. This introduces more lag and uncertainty into the final data counts. **(Small, affects measurement not reality)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **vs. Early Pandemic:** The key difference is the population is no longer immunologically naive. Widespread hybrid immunity from vaccines and infections dramatically reduces the risk of severe disease and death compared to 2020-2021.
*   **vs. Seasonal Flu:** SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a capacity for more rapid and significant antigenic drift ("variants") than influenza, making vaccine matching more challenging. Its intrinsic infection fatality rate remains higher than typical seasonal flu.
*   **vs. Early Pandemic:** Effective and widely available antiviral treatments exist now, which were not a factor in 2020-2021. This provides a critical backstop for preventing death in high-risk infected individuals.
*   **vs. Seasonal Flu:** The use of mRNA vaccine technology allows for much faster updates to COVID-19 vaccines to match circulating strains compared to the egg-based manufacturing timeline for most flu vaccines.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the transition from pandemic to endemic, would center on COVID-19 mortality becoming analogous to a severe flu season. A prior distribution centered around **55,000 deaths/year** with an equivalent n of 10 (moderate confidence) seems appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↓ Large)** The actual, near-final death counts for the first two years are known and anchor the calculation. 2022 was high (~246,000), but 2023 saw a dramatic fall (~76,000).
    *   **(↓ Moderate)** Provisional data for 2024 and year-to-date data for 2025 show this steep downward trend continuing, with projected annual totals falling well below the severe flu baseline (projected ~25k for 2024, ~17k for 2025).
    *   **(↑ Small)** The constant emergence of new variants creates upward risk, but so far they have not overcome population immunity to cause a significant rise in the death rate.
    *   **(↓ Moderate)** The continued, albeit imperfect, use of updated vaccines and antivirals is successfully mitigating the severity of seasonal waves.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the known data for 2022 and 2023, is definitive and powerful. The forecast is less a prediction and more a mathematical calculation. The posterior should be a much tighter distribution heavily influenced by the calculation: (246k + 76k + 25k + 17k) / 4 = 91k. The prior is overwhelmed by the data.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   CDC reports of a new variant with mutations suggesting both high immune escape and increased

To forecast the average number of COVID-19 deaths per year in the United States from 2022 to 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for this forecast is informed by the transition of COVID-19 from a pandemic to an endemic phase. A reasonable prior centers on COVID-19 mortality becoming analogous to a severe flu season, with a base rate of 20,000–60,000 deaths/year. However, given the higher intrinsic infection fatality rate of COVID-19 compared to influenza, a prior centered around 55,000 deaths/year is appropriate. This prior reflects moderate confidence and is informed by historical severe flu seasons and the evolving nature of COVID-19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the early pandemic due to widespread population immunity and the availability of effective vaccines and treatments. However, COVID-19's higher infection fatality rate and rapid antigenic drift compared to influenza suggest a higher baseline mortality than typical flu seasons. The presence of effective medical countermeasures and a substantial immunity wall are key differences that reduce mortality compared to the early pandemic.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Downward Pressure:** The dramatic decline in deaths from 2022 (~246,000) to 2023 (~76,000) and projected totals for 2024 (~25,000) and 2025 (~17,000) indicate a strong downward trend. The use of vaccines and antivirals further supports lower mortality.
- **Upward Pressure:** The emergence of new variants poses a small upward risk, though they have not significantly increased death rates due to existing immunity.
- **Net Effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly supports a lower mortality rate, with the actual data for 2022 and 2023 being particularly influential.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
The prior centered at 55,000 deaths/year is updated with strong evidence of declining mortality. The actual data for 2022 and 2023, along with projections for 2024 and 2025, suggest an average of 91,000 deaths/year. This evidence significantly shifts the posterior distribution downward, resulting in a tighter distribution centered around the calculated average.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Consideration of tail risks includes the potential for a new variant with high immune escape and severity. However, the current evidence and trends strongly suggest a continued decline in mortality. The best alternative forecast might consider a scenario where variant evolution significantly increases mortality, but current data does not support this. Adjustments for overconfidence are minimal given the strong evidence base.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the Bayesian update and consideration of evidence, the following percentiles are provided:

P10: 20,000  
P20: 30,000  
P40: 50,000  
P60: 70,000  
P80: 90,000  
P90: 110,000

# Forecasting COVID-19 Deaths in the US (2022-2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Early COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021):**
- 2020: ~385,000 deaths
- 2021: ~462,000 deaths
- Average: ~424,000 deaths/year

**Severe Seasonal Respiratory Diseases:**
- Severe flu seasons: 20,000-60,000 deaths/year
- 2017-2018 flu (particularly severe): ~52,000 deaths

**Known COVID-19 Deaths for 2022-2023:**
- 2022: ~246,000 deaths
- 2023: ~76,000 deaths

These reference classes show a clear downward trajectory as we move from pandemic to endemic phase. The most relevant prior would be centered around 75,000-100,000 deaths/year, with substantial uncertainty given the novel nature of COVID-19 and its evolution.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- COVID-19 has established seasonal patterns similar to other respiratory viruses
- Population immunity has built up through vaccination and prior infections
- Medical countermeasures (vaccines, antivirals) are established

**Differences from base case:**
- COVID-19 shows more rapid evolution than influenza
- The baseline intrinsic severity remains higher than seasonal flu
- We have a clear downward trend from 2022 to 2023 (246k → 76k)
- The years 2024-2025 will likely continue this downward trend but at a slower rate
- mRNA vaccine technology allows faster updates than traditional flu vaccines

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for lower deaths:**
- Strong downward trend from 2022 to 2023 (69% reduction)
- Increasing population immunity from multiple exposures (↓↓↓)
- Improved treatments like Paxlovid reducing case fatality rates (↓↓)
- Updated vaccines targeting circulating variants (↓↓)
- "Harvesting effect" may have already claimed many vulnerable individuals (↓)

**Evidence for higher deaths:**
- Continued viral evolution with immune-evasive variants (↑↑)
- Public fatigue with preventive measures (↑)
- Aging US population increasing vulnerability (↑)
- Reduced reporting infrastructure potentially undercounting (↑)
- Low uptake of antivirals despite availability (↑)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered around 85,000 deaths/year with wide uncertainty:

**First update - Known data for 2022-2023:**
- 2022: 246,000 deaths
- 2023: 76,000 deaths
- Average (2022-2023): 161,000 deaths/year
- This shifts our posterior upward from our prior

**Second update - Projected trend for 2024-2025:**
- Given the 69% drop from 2022 to 2023, we expect continued but slowing decline
- Conservative estimate: 30-50% further reduction from 2023 to 2024-2025
- 2024 estimate: ~45,000 deaths (41% reduction from 2023)
- 2025 estimate: ~30,000 deaths (33% reduction from 2024)
- This shifts our posterior downward

**Posterior calculation:**
- (246,000 + 76,000 + 45,000 + 30,000) / 4 = 99,250 deaths/year
- This is higher than our prior due to the high 2022 value

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the continued downward trend
- A new variant with both immune escape and higher severity could emerge
- The calculation is heavily influenced by the high 2022 number, which may not be representative of the endemic state
- I might be underestimating seasonal effects in 2024-2025

**Alternative forecast:**
- If 2022 is considered a transition year and excluded: (76,000 + 45,000 + 30,000) / 3 = 50,333 deaths/year
- This would be more representative of the endemic state but doesn't match the question parameters

**Tail risks:**
- High: A variant emerges with significant immune escape and higher severity
- Low: COVID-19 continues to attenuate and becomes milder than seasonal flu

Adjusting my percentiles to account for these considerations and the uncertainty in 2024-2025 data.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 75,000
P20: 85,000
P40: 95,000
P60: 105,000

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class for a long-term, endemic state of COVID-19 is severe seasonal influenza in the United States. Historically, severe flu seasons cause between 20,000 and 60,000 deaths per year. The particularly harsh 2017-2018 season resulted in an estimated 52,000 deaths. Therefore, a reasonable prior for the annual mortality of an endemic respiratory virus like COVID-19 would be a distribution centered around **50,000 deaths/year**, with a wide spread reflecting uncertainty (e.g., a standard deviation of 20,000). This prior represents a belief that COVID-19 would eventually stabilize as a public health threat comparable to a very bad flu season.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast period (2022-2025) is a transitional phase from pandemic to endemic, not a stable endemic state.
*   **Similarity:** Like the flu base case, COVID-19 mortality in this period is driven by seasonal waves, disproportionately affects the vulnerable, and is mitigated by vaccines and treatments.
*   **Difference:** The most critical difference is that this is not a pure forecast; it is a calculation of an average over a period for which most of the data is already recorded. The years 2022 and 2023 had mortality rates far exceeding the severe flu base rate due to the lingering effects of the pandemic (e.g., the Omicron wave). This historical data will dominate the four-year average, making the initial prior less influential than in a typical forecast.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence consists primarily of near-final mortality data, which provides a very strong signal that overwhelms the prior.
*   **2022 Deaths (Definitive, large upward pressure):** The CDC's final data shows approximately **246,000** COVID-19 deaths in 2022. This single data point pulls the four-year average far above the 50,000 base rate.
*   **2023 Deaths (Definitive, moderate upward pressure):** The CDC's provisional data, which is nearly final, shows approximately **76,000** COVID-19 deaths in 2023. This shows a dramatic decline but is still above the severe flu baseline.
*   **2024 Deaths (Strong evidence, downward pressure):** Provisional data for 2024 indicates a continued steep decline. Weekly deaths have been consistently low. A full-year projection of approximately **25,000** deaths is well-supported by the available data. This pulls the average down.
*   **2025 Deaths (Strong evidence, downward pressure):** With the forecast being made in late 2025, we have data for most of the year. The trend has continued downward. The research report's projection of **17,000** deaths is plausible, assuming the current winter wave is not severe. This further pulls the average down.

The combination of these data points makes values near the prior (50,000) extremely unlikely. The likelihood function is sharply peaked around the average calculated from these numbers.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Conceptually, we start with a wide prior centered at 50,000. We then update with overwhelming evidence.

*   **Prior:** P(Average) ~ Normal(μ=50k, σ=20k)
*   **Evidence:** The known and projected death totals for the four years.
*   **Update Step:** The central estimate of the posterior is a simple calculation:
    (246,000 + 76,000 + 25,000 + 17,000) / 4 = 364,000 / 4 = **91,000**
*   **Posterior Distribution:** The prior is effectively discarded. The posterior is a new, much tighter distribution centered at 91,000. The remaining uncertainty is not about the general level but about the precise final counts for 2024 and 2025 and any small revisions to 2022/2023 data.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily reliant on a simple calculation. What could make this wrong?
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher End):** A new, severe variant could emerge in the final month of 2025, causing a significant spike in deaths. If December 2025 saw an extra 20,000 deaths, the 2025 total would rise to ~37,000. This would increase the four-year average by 20,000 / 4 = 5,000, pushing it from 91,000 to 96,000. This is a plausible tail risk that suggests the distribution should be right-skewed.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower End):** The provisional data for 2024 and 2025 could be overestimates, and the final winter wave of 2025 could be exceptionally mild. If 2024 finalizes at 22,000 and 2025 at 15,000, the average would be (246k + 76k + 22k + 15k) / 4 = 89,750. This bounds the likely lower end of the distribution.
*   **Blind Spots:** I am assuming the CDC data is the final word and will not be radically restated. Given the resolution criteria and historical precedent, this is a safe assumption. The main risk is underestimating the severity of the 2025 winter wave.

Based on this, I will ensure my final percentiles reflect a median around 91,000 but with a wider spread on the upside (a right skew) to account for late-year risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is tightly centered on 91,000, with the main uncertainty coming from the final 2025 death count. The distribution is right-skewed to account for the low-probability, high-impact risk of a severe end-of-year variant surge.
