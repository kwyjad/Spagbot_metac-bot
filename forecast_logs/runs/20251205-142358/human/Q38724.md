### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Decadal changes in the NCES 18-24 4-year enrollment rate:** Historically, a 10% relative drop in this rate over a decade is rare. From its modern peak in 2011 (30.6%) to 2021 (27.4%), the rate fell by 10.5% over ten years, but this period includes the unprecedented COVID-19 shock. In more stable periods (e.g., 1995-2005), the rate was flat or rising. This reference class suggests such a drop is a low-probability event, perhaps a 10-20% base rate, but the 2015-2025 period is clearly not "stable."
2.  **Post-peak enrollment declines:** After enrollment rates peak, they tend to decline, but often slowly. Following the 2011 peak, the rate declined by an average of ~0.3 percentage points per year through 2019. Extrapolating this pre-COVID trend from the 29.9% baseline in 2015 would project a rate around 26.9% in 2025, very close to the threshold. This suggests a base rate closer to 50%.
3.  **Forecasts following major economic/social shocks:** Major shocks (recessions, pandemics) can reset enrollment trends. The 2020-2022 period saw a dramatic drop far exceeding the prior trend. The key question is whether this is a permanent level shift or a temporary dip followed by a rebound. Historical parallels are limited, but post-shock periods often see stabilization or recovery. This class is hard to quantify but suggests the pre-shock trend is a poor guide.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2023-05-18** NSC reports Spring 2023 undergrad enrollment down 0.5%, a major deceleration from prior pandemic-era declines. (↑) — Signals the enrollment freefall was ending, making a further large drop less likely.
*   **2023-10-26** NSC reports Fall 2023 undergrad enrollment up 1.2%, the first increase since the pandemic began. (↑) — Provides strong evidence of a post-pandemic stabilization or rebound, supporting Caplan's position.
*   **2023-12-31** The "Better FAFSA" form launches with significant delays and technical glitches. (↓) — Creates a major administrative barrier to enrollment for the 2024-25 academic year, which falls within the 2025 measurement period.
*   **2024-04-09** NCAN reports FAFSA completions are down 27% year-over-year, with even steeper drops for low-income and minority students. (↓) — This is a direct, negative leading indicator for Fall 2024 enrollment, threatening to reverse the 2023 rebound and push the rate down.
*   **2024-05-21** Federal Reserve officials signal interest rates will remain "higher for longer" amid persistent inflation. (↓) — A strong labor market, sustained by high rates, increases the opportunity cost of college, suppressing enrollment demand.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **COVID-19 Pandemic Aftermath:** The pandemic was the primary driver of the sharp 2020-2022 enrollment drop. The subsequent rebound in 2023 suggests a partial recovery dynamic is at play. The net effect of this entire cycle is the main determinant of the 2025 outcome. (Size: Large)
2.  **Labor Market Strength:** A tight labor market with rising wages for non-graduates increases the opportunity cost of full-time study. The persistent strength of the US labor market from 2022-2024 exerts significant downward pressure on enrollment. (Size: Moderate-to-Large)
3.  **FAFSA Simplification Failure:** The botched rollout of the new FAFSA for the 2024-25 academic year is a major administrative shock. It has directly reduced financial aid applications, which will almost certainly depress enrollment, particularly among aid-dependent students. This is a powerful, one-off negative driver. (Size: Moderate-to-Large)
4.  **Public Perception of Higher Education:** There is a secular trend of declining public confidence in the value proposition of a four-year degree, driven by high costs, student debt, and questions about ROI. This creates a steady, long-term downward pressure. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Demographics (The "Demographic Cliff"):** A decline in the college-age population due to lower birth rates post-2008 is a known future headwind. However, the 18-year-olds of 2025 were born in 2007, before the steepest drop. This driver's main impact will be felt *after* 2025, making it a minor factor for this specific question. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented External Shock:** The 2015-2025 period contains a global pandemic, an event with no modern parallel in its effect on education, making historical base rates less reliable.
*   **Major Administrative Failure:** The FAFSA crisis is a rare, self-inflicted wound to the higher education system, directly impacting the final data points for the bet. This is not a typical feature of enrollment cycles.
*   **Labor Market Dynamics:** The post-pandemic labor market has been unusually tight and resilient, creating a stronger-than-usual "pull" away from academia compared to previous decades.
*   **Political/Cultural Salience:** The value of a college degree has become a more polarized and politically charged topic, potentially accelerating shifts in public sentiment and enrollment choices.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the slow pre-pandemic decline, might have been ~65% in favor of YES (Caplan winning), with an equivalent n of ~10 observations. A 10% relative drop is a high bar.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The COVID-19 shock and subsequent drop to 27.2% by 2022 drastically reduced the buffer above the 26.6% threshold. This is the single largest update.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The enrollment stabilization and rebound reported by NSC for the 2023-24 academic year provided evidence that the floor had been reached.
    *   (↓ Large) The 2024-25 FAFSA crisis is a powerful new shock that directly threatens to lower enrollment in the final year of the measurement period.
    *   (↓ Small) Continued labor market strength and negative public sentiment act as persistent headwinds.
*   **Net effect:** The initial large negative update from COVID was partially offset by the 2023 rebound. However, the FAFSA crisis is a new, significant negative shock. The posterior should move sharply down from the prior, landing somewhere near 50/50, or perhaps slightly favoring NO.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) Fall 2024 enrollment report (releasing late 2024) shows an unexpected increase or smaller-than-feared decline.
    *   Reports that colleges' last-minute interventions successfully mitigated the FAFSA-related enrollment drop.
    *   Signs of a significant cooling in the US labor market (e.g., rising unemployment).
    *   A surge in late FAFSA submissions over the summer of 2024.
*   **DOWN indicators

To forecast whether Bryan Caplan will win his bet that the college enrollment rate will be greater than 26.6% in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for a 10% relative drop in college enrollment over a decade is historically low. From the reference class data, such a drop is rare, with a suggested base rate of 10-20%. However, considering the specific period from 2015 to 2025, which includes the COVID-19 pandemic, a more balanced prior might be around 50%, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the pandemic and other factors.

**Initial Prior:** 50% probability (or odds of 1:1).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation includes a post-peak enrollment decline, similar to historical trends where enrollment rates decline slowly after peaking.
- **Differences:** The COVID-19 pandemic and the FAFSA crisis are unprecedented events that significantly impact enrollment trends, making historical base rates less reliable.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **COVID-19 Impact:** The pandemic caused a sharp drop in enrollment, reducing the buffer above the 26.6% threshold. This is a strong piece of evidence against Caplan winning.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Low probability of enrollment being above 26.6% given the pandemic impact.
- **2023 Rebound:** The reported increase in enrollment in 2023 suggests stabilization or recovery, supporting Caplan's position.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate probability of enrollment being above 26.6% given the rebound.
- **FAFSA Crisis:** The significant drop in FAFSA completions is a direct negative indicator for enrollment, threatening to reverse the rebound.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Low probability of enrollment being above 26.6% given the FAFSA issues.
- **Labor Market:** A strong labor market increases the opportunity cost of college, exerting downward pressure on enrollment.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Low probability of enrollment being above 26.6% given labor market conditions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 50%, we adjust based on the evidence:
- **COVID-19 Impact:** Strong negative update.
- **2023 Rebound:** Moderate positive update.
- **FAFSA Crisis:** Strong negative update.
- **Labor Market:** Small negative update.

The net effect of these updates suggests a shift towards a lower probability of Caplan winning, but not overwhelmingly so due to the mixed evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the uncertainty and variability in enrollment trends, especially given the unprecedented nature of recent events.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of unexpected policy changes or economic shifts that could influence enrollment positively.
- **Rebuttals:** While the FAFSA crisis is significant, colleges might implement measures to mitigate its impact.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the evidence and adjustments, the probability that Bryan Caplan will win his bet is slightly below the initial prior due to the strong negative evidence from the FAFSA crisis and labor market conditions, despite the 2023 rebound.

Final: 45%

# Will Bryan Caplan win his bet that the college enrollment rate will be greater than 26.6% in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to determine whether the college enrollment rate for American 18-24 year-olds in 2025 will exceed 26.6%.

Looking at historical data:
- 2015 rate: 29.9% (baseline for the bet)
- 2022 rate: ~27.2% (most recent reliable data)
- The threshold is 26.6% (10% below the 2015 baseline)

The most appropriate base rate comes from examining historical enrollment trends and similar decade-long periods:

- From 2011 (peak of 30.6%) to 2021 (27.4%), enrollment fell by 10.5% over a decade
- Pre-pandemic (2015-2019), enrollment was declining at ~0.3 percentage points per year
- If that pre-pandemic trend continued from 2015, we'd expect ~26.9% by 2025, just above the threshold

Given these patterns, I'll set a prior of 55% that Caplan wins (enrollment exceeds 26.6%). This reflects that the pre-pandemic trend was heading toward the threshold, but not quite below it.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Long-term concerns about college ROI and costs remain consistent
- The demographic cliff's major impact is still expected after 2025
- The general pattern of post-peak decline continues

**Key differences:**
- COVID-19 caused an unprecedented shock to enrollment patterns
- The 2023 enrollment rebound (1.2% increase) suggests a recovery dynamic
- The FAFSA implementation crisis in 2024 creates a new administrative barrier
- The labor market remains unusually strong, increasing opportunity costs of college
- Political polarization around higher education has intensified

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: COVID-19 shock and subsequent partial recovery**
- P(E|H): If enrollment exceeds 26.6%, we'd expect the COVID shock to be temporary with substantial recovery - moderately likely
- P(E|~H): If enrollment falls below 26.6%, we'd expect the COVID shock to have lasting effects - highly likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7 (evidence slightly favors enrollment below threshold)

**Evidence 2: 2023 enrollment rebound (1.2% increase)**
- P(E|H): If enrollment exceeds 26.6%, we'd expect to see recovery signals like this - very likely
- P(E|~H): If enrollment falls below 26.6%, this rebound would be a temporary blip - somewhat unlikely
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (evidence moderately favors enrollment above threshold)

**Evidence 3: FAFSA implementation crisis (2024)**
- P(E|H): If enrollment exceeds 26.6%, the FAFSA crisis would have limited impact - unlikely
- P(E|~H): If enrollment falls below 26.6%, we'd expect administrative barriers like this - very likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.4 (evidence strongly favors enrollment below threshold)

**Evidence 4: Persistent strong labor market**
- P(E|H): If enrollment exceeds 26.6%, the labor market would likely weaken - moderately unlikely
- P(E|~H): If enrollment falls below 26.6%, a strong labor market increases opportunity costs - likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.6 (evidence moderately favors enrollment below threshold)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 55:45 (1.22:1) that enrollment exceeds 26.6%

First update (COVID shock and recovery):
- Posterior odds = 1.22 × 0.7 = 0.85
- Posterior probability = 0.85/(1+0.85) ≈ 46%

Second update (2023 enrollment rebound):
- Posterior odds = 0.85 × 2.0 = 1.7
- Posterior probability = 1.7/(1+1.7) ≈ 63%

Third update (FAFSA crisis):
- Posterior odds = 1.7 × 0.4 = 0.68
- Posterior probability = 0.68/(1+0.68) ≈ 40%

Fourth update (Strong labor market):
- Posterior odds = 0.68 × 0.6 = 0.41
- Posterior probability = 0.41/(1+0.41) ≈ 29%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the FAFSA crisis impact, as colleges are actively implementing workarounds
- The 2023 rebound could signal a stronger recovery trajectory than I've accounted for
- My analysis assumes the measurement methodology remains consistent

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Scenario 1: The labor market weakens significantly in 2024-2025, driving enrollment up
- Scenario 2: The FAFSA issues are resolved quickly, minimizing enrollment impact
- Scenario 3: The 2023 rebound accelerates, creating stronger momentum

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for Caplan winning (60%+) would emphasize that:
1. Historical 10% declines over a decade are rare
2. The 2023 rebound shows resilience in the system
3. Colleges have strong incentives to maintain enrollment and will adapt to challenges

However, the FAFSA crisis timing is particularly problematic as it directly impacts the final measurement year, and the labor market strength continues to create headwinds.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the enrollment rate will most likely fall below 26.6% in 2025, meaning Caplan will lose his bet. The FAFSA implementation crisis creates a significant administrative barrier at a critical time, and the continued strength of the labor market increases the opportunity cost of college attendance. While the 2023 rebound shows some resilience, it's likely insufficient to overcome these headwinds.

Final: 35%

Answering the question: **Will Bryan Caplan win his bet that the college enrollment rate will be greater than 26.6% in 2025?**

This requires forecasting whether the fraction of American 18-24 year-olds enrolled in four-year colleges for the year 2025 will be greater than 26.6%. A "Yes" outcome means Caplan wins.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The core of the bet is about the change in college enrollment over a decade (2015-2025). A suitable base rate can be derived from historical trends in this specific data series (NCES Table 302.60, 4-year college enrollment for 18-24 year-olds).

*   **Reference Class:** Decadal changes in this enrollment rate.
*   **Baseline (2015):** 29.9%.
*   **Threshold for Caplan to win:** > 26.6%.
*   **Pre-COVID Trend (2015-2019):** The rate declined slowly from 29.9% to 29.4%, an average of -0.125 percentage points (pp) per year. Extrapolating this slow decline over ten years would project a 2025 rate of 29.9% - (10 * 0.125) = 28.65%, well above the threshold. This suggests a high prior for Caplan winning.
*   **Post-Peak Trend (2011-2019):** From its peak of 30.6% in 2011, the rate fell to 29.4% in 2019, an average decline of -0.15 pp per year. This slightly faster decline would project a 2025 rate of 29.9% - (10 * 0.15) = 28.4%, also comfortably winning.

However, the 2015-2025 period is dominated by the COVID-19 shock, which makes simple trend extrapolation unreliable. The rate has already fallen to 27.2% by 2022, very close to the threshold. Given that the pre-shock trend suggested a win, but the shock itself has made the outcome highly uncertain, a neutral prior is most appropriate.

*   **Initial Prior (P(H)):** 50%. This reflects that the outcome is now a toss-up, with the pre-existing slow decline being massively accelerated by recent shocks.
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is fundamentally different from the pre-2020 base case due to two major shocks:
1.  **COVID-19 Pandemic:** Caused an unprecedented drop in enrollment, from 29.4% in 2019 to 27.2% in 2022. This single event erased most of the "buffer" Caplan's bet had.
2.  **FAFSA Crisis (2024):** The botched rollout of the new FAFSA form is a major, acute administrative shock that is a strong negative leading indicator for Fall 2024 enrollment. This is a unique event not present in historical data.

These differences mean we must rely more on recent evidence and causal drivers than on long-term historical base rates.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We start from the last known data point: **27.2% for 2022**. The threshold is 26.6%. Caplan has a 0.6 pp buffer. We need to evaluate evidence affecting the rate in 2023, 2024, and 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Post-Pandemic Rebound (Fall 2023)**
    *   **Evidence:** The National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) reported a 1.2% increase in undergraduate enrollment for Fall 2023, the first increase since the pandemic.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This evidence is much more likely if the long-term rate is stabilizing above the threshold (P(E|H)) than if it's continuing its steep decline (P(E|~H)). This is a strong update in favor of Caplan. Let's assume this nudged the 2023 rate up from 27.2% to an estimated 27.4%, increasing the buffer to 0.8 pp.
    *   **Impact:** Increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: FAFSA Crisis (Fall 2024)**
    *   **Evidence:** FAFSA completions for the 2024-25 academic year were down by over 25% as of Spring 2024. This is a direct and severe shock to the student enrollment pipeline.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** This event is far more likely under a scenario where the rate drops below 26.6% (P(E|~H)) than one where it stays above (P(E|H)). The FAFSA crisis provides a clear causal mechanism for a large, one-year drop. A 2-3% decline in the relevant student population due to this could erase the entire 0.8 pp buffer.
    *   **Impact:** Strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Macroeconomic Headwinds (Ongoing)**
    *   **Evidence:** A persistently strong labor market increases the opportunity cost of college. Declining public sentiment regarding the value of a degree acts as a steady downward pressure.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** These factors are more consistent with a continued decline (~H) than with stabilization or growth (H).
    *   **Impact:** Moderately decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start:** Prior of 50% (Odds 1:1).
2.  **Update with 2023 Rebound:** The positive NSC data was a significant update. This likely moved the odds in Caplan's favor, perhaps to 3:1 (75% probability). The situation looked very good for him at the end of 2023.
3.  **Update with FAFSA Crisis:** This is a powerful new piece of negative evidence. It largely, if not completely, negates the positive update from the 2023 rebound. A likelihood ratio of around 1/4 (meaning this evidence is 4 times more likely if Caplan loses) seems appropriate.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 3 × (1/4) = 0.75.
    *   Posterior Probability = 0.75 / (1 + 0.75) = 0.428 or ~43%.
4.  **Update with Headwinds:** The persistent negative macro factors provide a further small nudge downwards.
    *   Posterior Odds = 0.75 * 0.9 = 0.675
    *   Posterior Probability = 0.675 / 1.675 = ~40%.

My central estimate for the 2025 rate is now slightly below the 26.6% threshold. A quantitative model assuming a 2023 rebound (+0.2pp), a large FAFSA-induced drop in 2024 (-0.7pp), and a continued secular decline in 2025 (-0.15pp) yields a mean forecast of **26.55%**. Since this mean is just below the threshold and there is high uncertainty, the probability of the rate being > 26.6% is slightly less than 50%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast hinges on the FAFSA crisis causing a large enrollment drop in Fall 2024. What if it doesn't? Mitigation efforts by colleges and government could soften the blow. If the drop is only moderate (~0.4 pp), the rate would be ~27.0% heading into 2025, making it very likely Caplan wins.

Alternatively, the bet is on the Fall 2025 data. It's possible the FAFSA crisis causes a sharp drop in 2024, followed by a significant rebound in 2025 as the system normalizes and delayed students enroll. This volatility makes the outcome highly uncertain. However, students who skip a year of college are statistically less likely to ever return, which dampens the potential for a strong rebound.

Given these uncertainties, the final probability should remain close to 50%, but the FAFSA crisis is a strong enough factor to justify placing Caplan as a slight underdog. The Metaculus community forecast is also in the 44-46% range, suggesting this assessment is reasonable.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial slow decline in enrollment was massively accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the rate precariously close to the bet's threshold. A promising rebound in 2023 was likely nullified by the severe FAFSA crisis, which is expected to depress enrollment in Fall 2024. The final outcome depends on whether the rate in Fall 2025 can recover from the FAFSA shock or if it continues its secular downward trend. The balance of these powerful but opposing forces puts the expected outcome very near the 26.6% line, with a slight edge to the forces of decline.

Final: 45%
