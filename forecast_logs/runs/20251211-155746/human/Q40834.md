### Reference class & base rates
*   **Average 2025 Weekly YoY Growth:** The average year-over-year growth for OpenTable seated diners in 2025 (through mid-November) was **+9.4%**. This serves as a broad base rate for a typical week's performance this year. However, its utility is limited due to massive weekly volatility (ranging from -24% to +50%) and the specific holiday period in question.
*   **High-Growth Weeks in 2025:** Weeks in 2025 with YoY growth >20% occurred approximately 15% of the time. This class represents periods of high demand or comparison against weak prior-year periods. The week in question is the opposite: a comparison against a period of exceptionally high growth.
*   **Holiday Week Performance:** Holiday weeks exhibit extreme volatility. The comparison week (ending Jan 5, 2025) saw +50% growth, while other holiday-adjacent weeks (e.g., late November/December) show significant swings. This suggests a typical average is not a reliable prior, and the specific dynamics of the holiday are paramount.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-12-08] Restaurant tech predictions for 2026 highlight the rise of "agentic AI" and direct ordering through platforms like ChatGPT. (↔) — Matters for long-term competitive landscape, but has minimal impact on the next 3 weeks.
*   [2025-11-12] Resy announces a multi-year partnership with Toast and CRM platforms, deepening the integration of competitors. (↓) — Strengthens the ecosystem of OpenTable's primary rivals, likely accelerating market share erosion and creating a headwind for OpenTable's growth.
*   [2025-10-23] Toast's Q3 2025 data shows overall seated reservations grew 8% YoY, but cancellations also rose 7%. (↓) — Indicates moderating net growth in the overall digital reservation market and potential consumer caution, suggesting the post-pandemic boom is normalizing.
*   [2025-09-25] Tech outlook for 2026 points to AI-powered interactions and predictive analytics becoming central to restaurant operations. (↔) — Reinforces the competitive pressure from more technologically integrated players like Toast, but not an acute driver for the immediate forecast period.
*   [2025-07-20] Reports highlight AI-driven reservation systems becoming essential, with a focus on voice AI and POS integration. (↓) — Underlines the competitive disadvantage for any platform slower to integrate these features, potentially pressuring OpenTable's growth.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **The Base Effect (Large):** The single most significant driver. The comparison period, the first week of 2025, saw +50% YoY growth. This creates an exceptionally high bar to clear. It is statistically difficult to post strong growth on top of such a massive prior-year gain. This exerts strong downward pressure on the forecast.
*   **Market Share Erosion (Moderate):** OpenTable's US market share fell from 51% to 46% between 2022 and 2024. Competitors like Toast Tables, Resy, and Yelp are growing rapidly, with Toast in particular converting its large POS footprint into reservation customers. This acts as a persistent drag on OpenTable's numbers relative to the overall market.
*   **Economic Normalization & Consumer Sentiment (Moderate):** The post-pandemic "revenge spending" on discretionary services like dining has largely faded. While the economy may be stable, growth in fine dining is returning to more normal, GDP-like levels. Any softening in consumer confidence over the holiday period could further dampen spending.
*   **Calendar Alignment (Small):** New Year's Eve is a critical dining holiday. In the forecast period, NYE 2025 falls on a Wednesday. In the comparison period, NYE 2024 fell on a Tuesday. A mid-week Wednesday NYE may be slightly more favorable for dining than a Tuesday, as it's closer to the weekend, potentially encouraging more celebrations. This provides a slight upward pressure.
*   **Industry Saturation of Digital Tools (Small):** A significant portion of Toast's new reservation customers (68%) had not used a reservation provider before. This suggests the market for digital reservations is still growing, but the "easy wins" of converting restaurants from pen-and-paper may be diminishing, leading to slower overall market expansion.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Base Period:** Unlike a typical week in 2025, this forecast is benchmarked against the single strongest growth week of the entire year (+50%). The +9.4% average base rate is almost irrelevant due to this statistical outlier.
*   **Intensified Competitive Landscape:** The competitive pressure from Toast Tables is significantly greater now than it was at the beginning of 2025. Toast's integrated POS and reservation system creates a powerful incentive for restaurants to switch or adopt a non-OpenTable solution.
*   **End of Post-Pandemic Rebound:** The start of 2025 was still benefiting from comparisons to periods affected by the Omicron variant in early 2024. That rebound effect is now fully expired, meaning growth is driven by fundamentals rather than recovery dynamics.
*   **Holiday-Specific Volatility:** This is not a forecast for a random week but for the New Year's holiday week, which is subject to unique consumer behavior, weather events, and calendar effects that do not apply to the rest of the year.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a wide distribution centered near the 2025 average of +9.4%, but with a very low "equivalent n" to reflect extreme volatility and the poor fit of this average to the specific forecast week.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓↓) The +50% YoY growth in the comparison week creates a massive negative base effect.
    *   (↓) Persistent market share erosion to integrated competitors like Toast and Resy.
    *   (↓) Normalization of dining demand after the post-pandemic boom has ended.
    *   (↑) Slightly more favorable calendar placement of New Year's Eve (Wednesday vs. Tuesday).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should move significantly downward from the prior. The magnitude of the negative base effect is the dominant factor and will likely overwhelm all other considerations, pushing the forecast well into negative territory.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Major US winter storms failing to materialize in the week between Christmas and New Year's.
    *   Stronger-than-expected holiday retail sales reports, suggesting robust consumer spending.
    *   OpenTable launching an aggressive, widely-publicized New Year's Eve dining promotion.
    *   Anecdotal reports from restaurant groups of exceptionally strong NYE bookings.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Major snowstorms or extreme cold impacting key US markets (Northeast, Midwest) during the last week of December.
    *   Weak consumer confidence reports released in late December.
    *   News of competitors (e.g., Resy, Toast) offering aggressive promotions to capture NYE reservation volume.
    *   Spikes in weekly unemployment claims suggesting a rapid economic cooling.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Base Figure Legitimacy:** The +50% growth figure for the first week of 2025 is extreme. If it was caused by a data anomaly or a one-off event (e.g., comparison to a 2024 week crippled by weather), our understanding of the base effect could be flawed.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The exact start and end dates of the "week ending January 1" used by OpenTable are critical. A slight shift in the 7-day window could alter which days (e.g., the weekend prior) are included, impacting the final number.
*   **Weather's Outsized Impact:** For a single-week forecast, a major weather event in a large metropolitan area can have a dramatic impact on the global number, given OpenTable's concentration in the US. This is a key source of irreducible uncertainty.
*   **Global vs. US Focus:** While OpenTable is global, its business is heavily concentrated in the US. Our analysis focuses on US-centric drivers (competition, economy), potentially missing a significant event in another key market (e.g., UK, Canada, Australia) that could influence the global aggregate.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast for this specific week is dominated by an exceptionally strong base effect from the prior year (+50% growth), which will be nearly impossible to surpass. Combined with ongoing market share erosion, this points to a likely negative year-over-year change, a sharp reversal from the 2025 average.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the year-over-year change in seated diners reported by OpenTable is the average weekly growth for 2025, which is +9.4%. This average, however, is not a reliable indicator due to the extreme volatility observed throughout the year, with growth rates ranging from -24% to +50%. The variance is high, indicating a wide spread in potential outcomes. The specific week in question is a holiday week, which historically shows even more volatility.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The forecast is for a week in 2026, similar to the weeks in 2025 in terms of economic conditions and competitive pressures.
   - Differences: The week ending January 1, 2026, is compared against a week in 2025 that had an exceptionally high growth rate of +50%. This creates a high base effect, making it difficult to achieve positive growth. Additionally, the competitive landscape has intensified with the rise of competitors like Toast and Resy.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The +50% growth in the comparison week exerts strong downward pressure on the forecast, as it is statistically challenging to surpass such a high base (↓↓↓).
   - Market share erosion due to competitors like Toast and Resy further suggests a downward adjustment (↓).
   - The normalization of dining demand post-pandemic also contributes to a downward trend (↓).
   - The calendar alignment of New Year's Eve on a Wednesday, closer to the weekend, provides slight upward pressure (↑).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around +9.4% with high variance, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests a downward shift.
   - The dominant negative base effect, combined with competitive pressures and normalization of demand, shifts the posterior mean significantly downward.
   - The slight positive effect of the calendar alignment is not enough to counterbalance the strong negative factors.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence in the negative forecast could overlook potential positive surprises, such as unexpectedly strong consumer spending or favorable weather conditions.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a scenario where OpenTable launches a successful promotional campaign, boosting numbers.
   - However, given the strong negative base effect and competitive pressures, the likelihood of a positive outcome remains low.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Considering the evidence and potential tail risks, the forecast is adjusted to reflect a likely negative outcome, with some allowance for uncertainty.
   - Percentiles are calibrated to capture the range of possible outcomes, emphasizing the downward shift.

P10: -25
P20: -20
P40: -15
P60: -10
P80: -5
P90: 0

# Forecasting OpenTable's YoY Change in Seated Diners for Week Ending Jan 1, 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference distributions:

**Primary Base Rate**: The average YoY change for OpenTable seated diners in 2025 was +9.4%. However, this has limited utility given the extreme volatility (ranging from -24% to +50%).

**Holiday Week Performance**: More relevant is the performance of holiday weeks, particularly New Year's week. The comparison week (ending Jan 5, 2025) saw +50% YoY growth, which is crucial context.

**Competitive Trend Base Rate**: OpenTable's market share declined from 51% to 46% between 2022-2024, suggesting a negative trend of approximately -5% over two years or roughly -2.5% annually in market share.

Given these factors, my prior distribution would center around -5% to -10% (not the +9.4% average), with high variance to reflect the volatility. This negative prior reflects the extremely high base effect from the +50% comparison period.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Reference Distribution**:
- Still operating in the same industry with similar seasonal patterns
- Similar competitive landscape with Toast, Resy, and Yelp as main competitors
- Similar economic environment (assuming no major recession by end of 2025)

**Key Differences**:
- The comparison period (week ending Jan 1, 2025) had +50% YoY growth, creating an extremely high base effect
- Market share erosion has likely continued throughout 2025
- The post-pandemic "revenge dining" effect has fully normalized
- Calendar alignment differs: NYE 2025 falls on Wednesday vs. Tuesday in 2024

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence Pushing Forecast Down**:
- **Base Effect (+50% in comparison period)**: This creates an extremely strong downward pressure. It's statistically unlikely to maintain growth on top of such an outlier. (Strong downward shift, ~30-40 percentage points)
- **Market Share Erosion**: OpenTable's declining market share (51% → 46%) indicates competitors are gaining ground. Recent partnerships between Resy and Toast further strengthen competitors. (Moderate downward shift, ~5-10 percentage points)
- **Normalization of Post-Pandemic Dining**: The exceptional growth in early 2025 likely reflected lingering recovery from pandemic disruptions, which has now fully normalized. (Moderate downward shift, ~5-10 percentage points)

**Evidence Pushing Forecast Up**:
- **Calendar Alignment**: NYE 2025 falls on Wednesday vs. Tuesday in 2024, potentially creating a slightly more favorable dining environment. (Small upward shift, ~1-3 percentage points)
- **Industry Growth**: The overall digital reservation market continues to expand, with Toast data showing 8% YoY growth in Q3 2025. (Small upward shift, ~2-4 percentage points)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered around -7.5% (reflecting the base effect and market share erosion), I'll update based on the evidence:

**First Update - Base Effect**: The +50% comparison creates a massive likelihood ratio favoring negative growth. This shifts my distribution significantly left, with a new mean around -25%.

**Second Update - Market Share Erosion**: Continued competitive pressure further shifts the distribution left, but less dramatically. New mean around -30%.

**Third Update - Calendar Effect**: The slightly more favorable NYE placement provides a small positive update, shifting the mean slightly right to around -28%.

The posterior distribution is now centered around -28%, with significant variance (standard deviation ~15%) to reflect the inherent volatility in weekly data and holiday periods.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots**:
- I may be overestimating the base effect. If the +50% growth in early 2025 was due to a one-time anomaly (e.g., severe weather in 2024), the comparison might not be as unfavorable.
- I might be underestimating OpenTable's ability to respond to competitive pressure with new features or promotions.
- Global numbers could be influenced by international markets where OpenTable might be performing differently than in the US.

**Alternative Forecast**: A plausible alternative would center around -15%, arguing that OpenTable has successfully defended against competitors and that the restaurant industry is showing unexpected strength in late 2025.

**Rebuttal**: While possible, this seems optimistic given the magnitude of the base effect and the clear trend of market share erosion. The +50% comparison period creates a mathematical hurdle that would require extraordinary circumstances to overcome.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties, particularly in the right tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: -45%
P20: -38%
P40: -30%
P60: -25%
P80: -18%
P90: -12%

Answering this question requires forecasting a highly volatile, holiday-specific economic indicator. The core of the analysis rests on understanding the powerful "base effect" created by the comparison period's performance.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is the typical weekly performance of OpenTable diners in the recent past. The background provides that for 2025 (through mid-November), the average year-over-year (YoY) weekly growth was **+9.4%**. However, this came with extreme volatility, with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5 percentage points and a range from -24% to +50%.

Therefore, my prior distribution for a generic week in late 2025/early 2026 would be centered at approximately **+9.4%** but must be very wide to account for the observed volatility. A normal distribution with a mean of 9.4 and a standard deviation of 15, N(9.4, 15²), serves as a reasonable starting point before considering week-specific evidence.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The week ending January 1, 2026, is fundamentally different from a typical week in 2025 due to two primary factors:

1.  **Holiday Period:** This is the New Year's holiday week, a period of atypical and highly volatile consumer dining behavior.
2.  **Extreme Base Effect:** This is the most critical difference. The forecast is a YoY comparison to the first week of 2025. That specific week was an extreme outlier, posting **+50% YoY growth**. This creates an exceptionally high statistical bar for the week ending Jan 1, 2026, to clear.

Because of this extreme base effect, the generic +9.4% average is a poor predictor, and the analysis must be heavily weighted by the dynamics of this specific comparison.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on the prior.

*   **(↓↓↓) Base Effect:** This is the dominant piece of evidence. To even achieve 0% growth, dining volume in the first week of 2026 would need to match the volume of the first week of 2025, which was itself 50% higher than 2024. It is statistically improbable to post strong growth on top of a +50% year. This evidence strongly suggests a negative outcome. We can model this:
    *   Let D_YYYY be diners in the first week of year YYYY. We know D_2025 ≈ 1.50 * D_2024.
    *   A reasonable assumption for "normal" underlying growth for OpenTable over two years (2024 to 2026), considering market saturation and competition, might be 10% total (or ~4.9% per year). So, D_2026 ≈ 1.10 * D_2024.
    *   The forecast is (D_2026 / D_2025) - 1 ≈ (1.10 / 1.50) - 1 = **-26.7%**. This calculation provides a strong anchor for the forecast.

*   **(↓) Market Share Erosion:** OpenTable's market share is declining (51% in 2022 to 46% in 2024) as integrated competitors like Toast Tables and Resy grow. This acts as a persistent headwind, suggesting OpenTable's growth will lag the overall restaurant reservation market. This reinforces the assumption of modest underlying two-year growth, supporting a strongly negative forecast.

*   **(↓) Economic Normalization:** The post-pandemic "revenge spending" boom has faded. Dining growth has returned to more normal, GDP-like levels. This makes the +50% growth of early 2025, which was partly fueled by recovery dynamics, even more of an unrepeatable anomaly.

*   **(↑) Calendar Alignment:** New Year's Eve 2025 falls on a Wednesday, while NYE 2024 was on a Tuesday. A mid-week NYE may be slightly more conducive to dining out and extended celebrations than an early-week one. This provides a small upward pressure on the forecast, perhaps by a few percentage points.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

The evidence overwhelmingly points to a large downward revision of the prior.

*   **Prior:** N(9.4, 15²)
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence, dominated by the base effect calculation, acts as a powerful likelihood function that favors values around -20% to -30%.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution's central tendency will be almost entirely determined by the base effect calculation, as the prior is weak and the evidence is strong.
    *   Starting from the calculated anchor of **-26.7%**.
    *   Adjusting slightly upward for the favorable calendar effect (e.g., +3 points) brings the median estimate to around **-24%**.
    *   The variance remains high due to holiday volatility and external risks (e.g., weather). The distribution is also likely skewed to the left (negative), as a major snowstorm in the US could have a much larger negative impact than any plausible positive surprise.

My posterior distribution is thus centered around -24%, is wide, and has a fatter tail on the downside.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Forecast:** A much less negative forecast (e.g., -5% to -15%) could be plausible if the "true" underlying growth of OpenTable is much higher than I've estimated, or if the +50% base figure was a data anomaly.
*   **Rebuttal:** The market share data and general economic normalization strongly argue against high underlying growth for OpenTable. While the +50% figure is extreme, it is the official comparison point, and its statistical effect is undeniable even if its cause was a one-off.
*   **Tail Risks:** The most significant tail risk is a major winter storm impacting multiple large US metropolitan areas (e.g., Northeast, Midwest) during the holiday week. This could easily push the YoY change to -40% or worse. The upside is more capped; it's very difficult to imagine a scenario that overcomes the base effect to produce a positive number.
*   **Adjustment:** My assessment of left-skew seems appropriate. I will ensure my final percentiles reflect this, with the distance from the median to the P10 being larger than the distance from the median to the P90.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered around a median of -24%, reflecting the overwhelming base effect, with adjustments for minor factors and significant tail risks.

P10: -39
P20: -33
P40: -27
P60: -21
P80: -15
P90: -11
