### Reference class & base rates
*   **Primary Reference Class: 2022-2024 HPAI H5N1 Outbreak Years.** This is the most relevant class as it involves the same viral clade (2.3.4.4b) and general policy environment (depopulation).
    *   **Base Rate:** The annual number of birds culled has been highly variable. Data from the provided background charts and sources suggest:
        *   2022: ~58 million birds
        *   2023: ~30 million birds
        *   2024: >17.1 million (based on California alone), likely in the 25-40 million range.
    *   **Reasoning:** This period provides a direct empirical distribution of outcomes under the current viral regime. The simple average is ~39 million, but the high variance suggests a wide prior distribution is appropriate.
    *   **Limitations:** This class does not account for the major structural change in 2024/2025: the establishment of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle herds, creating a new, persistent reservoir for the virus.

*   **Secondary Reference Class: 2014-2015 HPAI Outbreak.** This was the previous major HPAI event in the U.S.
    *   **Base Rate:** Approximately 50 million birds were culled, concentrated heavily in 2015.
    *   **Reasoning:** This event demonstrates the potential scale of a major outbreak and the U.S. policy response. It anchors the upper bound of a "bad year" in the tens of millions.
    *   **Limitations:** The viral strain was different (H5N2, H5N8), and it did not establish a widespread, non-avian reservoir, making it less comparable to the current situation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*As of 2025-11-04, the resolution period is nearly complete. The recency guideline emphasizes the last 6 months (May-Nov 2025). The provided sources do not contain information from this critical period, representing a significant information gap.*

*   [2025-03-05] Report indicates over 750,000 birds culled in CA's San Joaquin Valley in Jan-Feb 2025. (↑) — Shows a significant start to the year in a key poultry region, driven by the ongoing cattle-linked outbreaks.
*   [2025-03-05] CA state officials suggest the virus "may be slowing down." (↓) — A potential counter-signal, but localized and preliminary. May reflect the end of a specific regional wave rather than a national trend.
*   [2024-10-12] First human case of H5N1 confirmed in Kern County, linked to dairy cattle. (↑) — Heightens public health concern and regulatory pressure, likely reinforcing the aggressive culling policy for any detected poultry cases to prevent further spillover.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Cattle Reservoir (Large ↑):** The establishment of H5N1 in dairy cattle is a structural game-changer. It creates a large, non-migratory, year-round reservoir of the virus, increasing the probability of repeated spillover events into poultry flocks, independent of wild bird migration patterns.
*   **Wild Bird Migration (Moderate ↑):** Remains a primary vector for introducing the virus into new regions, especially during the spring and fall migrations. The interaction between infected wild birds and infected cattle environments is a key uncertainty.
*   **Biosecurity Failures (Moderate ↑/↓):** The primary defense for poultry operations. Increased awareness and investment post-2022 may reduce risk (↓), but the heightened environmental viral load from cattle increases the chance that any single failure leads to an outbreak (↑).
*   **Farm Density & Type (Moderate ↑):** Outbreaks in high-density poultry regions (e.g., Iowa, California, Minnesota) or in large egg-laying facilities (which can house millions of birds) have an outsized impact on the total number. A single large complex infection can add millions to the annual total.
*   **Virus Evolution (Small ↑):** Ongoing viral evolution could lead to strains with higher transmissibility among birds or better adaptation to mammals, which could indirectly increase the viral pressure on poultry farms.
*   **Vaccine Development/Deployment (Large ↓):** The potential approval and use of a poultry vaccine would be the most significant downward driver. However, as of late 2025, no widespread vaccination program is in place in the U.S. due to trade and surveillance concerns.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Persistent Mammalian Reservoir:** Unlike the 2015 or 2022-2024 periods, the virus is now endemic in a major agricultural mammal population (dairy cattle). This fundamentally alters the epidemiology, creating constant re-introduction pressure on poultry farms that is not seasonally limited to bird migrations.
*   **Human Health Nexus:** The confirmed human cases linked to cattle, while few, have increased the political and public health stakes. This likely ensures the continuation of the aggressive "depopulate all" policy in poultry to minimize any chance of the virus adapting to humans via poultry intermediates.
*   **Geographic Overlap:** The cattle outbreaks are concentrated in states that are also major poultry and egg producers (e.g., Texas, Kansas, Michigan, Idaho). This geographic proximity between the new reservoir and susceptible flocks increases transmission risk.
*   **Year-Round Threat:** The base rate period (2022-2024) showed seasonal peaks in spring and fall. The cattle reservoir makes large outbreaks plausible at any time of year, disrupting the previous pattern and potentially increasing the annual total.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A log-normal distribution centered around the 2022-2024 mean (~35-40 million birds), with high variance to account for the volatility seen in those years. The prior should be considered weak (equivalent n of 2-3) due to the changing dynamics.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The establishment of a persistent cattle reservoir is a structural break from the reference class, fundamentally increasing baseline risk.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The significant culls in California early in 2025 confirmed that the cattle-to-poultry pathway is actively causing large-scale losses.
    *   (↑ Small) Human cases linked to cattle solidify the political will for aggressive culling, removing a potential "off-ramp" from the current policy.
    *   (↓ Small) Reports of the virus "slowing down" in March are weak, localized, and outdated evidence given the current date of November 2025.
    *   (Neutral) Lack of a widespread poultry vaccination program means the primary mitigating tool is not in play.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should shift significantly upward from the prior mean. The structural change from the cattle reservoir outweighs the simple historical average, making a total exceeding the 2022 peak of ~58 million a very plausible outcome.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*As the resolution period is almost over, these are more for post-mortem analysis or forecasting for 2026.*
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Confirmation of direct cattle-to-poultry transmission on a farm.
    *   Detection of HPAI in swine populations, indicating a further host expansion.
    *   New, large (>1 million birds) poultry outbreaks in states with high cattle density but previously low poultry cases (e.g., Texas, Idaho).
    *   Genetic sequencing showing viral adaptation for easier transmission between mammals.
    *   Any acceleration in the rate of new flock detections in the final two months of 2025.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Successful containment of the virus in dairy cattle (e.g., through culling, movement controls, or vaccination).
    *   A significant period (e.g., 8+ weeks) with no new commercial poultry detections nationwide.
    *   USDA policy shift towards approving a poultry vaccine for emergency use.
    *   Evidence showing that biosecurity measures specific to the cattle threat (e.g., controls on personnel moving between dairy and poultry farms) are highly effective.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fat-Tailed Distribution:** The final number is highly sensitive to single, low-probability, high-impact events. One or two infections in the nation's largest egg-laying facilities could add 10-15 million birds to the total. The median forecast may be much lower than the mean.
*   **Data Lags:** The resolution is based on "Confirmation Date." Delays in

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**

For the base rate, I will use the 2022-2024 HPAI H5N1 outbreak years as the primary reference class. This period is most relevant due to the same viral clade and policy environment. The annual number of birds culled during these years was approximately 58 million in 2022, 30 million in 2023, and likely between 25-40 million in 2024. The simple average is around 39 million, but given the high variance, a wide prior distribution is appropriate. I will assume a log-normal distribution centered around this average with a high variance to reflect the volatility.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**

The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in terms of the ongoing HPAI threat and the U.S. policy response of aggressive culling. However, it differs significantly due to the establishment of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle herds, creating a persistent reservoir for the virus. This structural change increases the baseline risk and is not captured in the historical data.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**

- **Cattle Reservoir (Large ↑):** This is a major structural change, increasing the likelihood of higher outcomes.
- **Significant Culls in Early 2025 (↑ Moderate):** Confirms the active cattle-to-poultry transmission pathway.
- **Human Cases Linked to Cattle (↑ Small):** Reinforces aggressive culling policy.
- **Reports of Virus Slowing Down (↓ Small):** Weak evidence, likely outdated.
- **Lack of Poultry Vaccination (Neutral):** No significant change from the prior.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**

Starting with a log-normal prior centered around 39 million birds with high variance, the evidence suggests a significant upward shift. The establishment of a cattle reservoir is a structural break, increasing the risk of higher outcomes. The posterior distribution should reflect a higher mean and increased variance, with the potential for outcomes exceeding the 2022 peak of ~58 million birds.

**5. Red Team Thinking**

Considering potential overconfidence, the distribution should account for fat tails due to low-probability, high-impact events. The lack of recent data from the last six months of 2025 introduces uncertainty. An alternative forecast might assume a successful containment of the virus in cattle, leading to lower outcomes. However, given the evidence, the upward shift remains justified.

**6. Final Percentiles**

P10: 30 million  
P20: 40 million  
P40: 55 million  
P60: 65 million  
P80: 75 million  
P90: 85 million

# Forecasting the Number of Farmed Birds Killed Due to Bird Flu in the US in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the 2022-2024 HPAI H5N1 outbreak period as my primary reference class, as it involves the same viral strain and policy environment:
- 2022: ~58 million birds culled
- 2023: ~30 million birds culled
- 2024: Likely 30-40 million birds (based on partial data)

This gives a mean of approximately 40 million birds per year with high variance. The distribution is likely right-skewed (log-normal), as single large outbreaks can dramatically increase totals.

I'll use this as my prior: a log-normal distribution with median around 40 million birds and a wide spread to reflect the high uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Same viral strain (H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b)
- Continuation of the "depopulate all affected and exposed poultry" policy
- Similar poultry industry structure and biosecurity practices

**Critical differences:**
- The establishment of H5N1 in dairy cattle herds in 2024-2025 creates a persistent mammalian reservoir, fundamentally altering the epidemiology
- This reservoir provides year-round transmission potential, not just during wild bird migration seasons
- Geographic overlap between major dairy and poultry producing states increases cross-species transmission risk
- Human cases linked to cattle exposure have heightened public health concerns, likely reinforcing aggressive culling policies

These differences suggest a significant upward shift from the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting higher numbers:**
- Early 2025 data showed over 750,000 birds culled in California's San Joaquin Valley in January-February alone, indicating a strong start to the year
- The cattle reservoir creates persistent re-introduction pressure on poultry farms throughout the year
- Human cases linked to cattle exposure increase regulatory pressure for aggressive culling
- The virus now has multiple transmission pathways (wild birds, cattle, farm-to-farm), increasing overall risk

**Evidence supporting lower numbers:**
- California state officials suggested in March 2025 that the virus "may be slowing down"
- Increased biosecurity awareness after previous years' outbreaks
- Potential adaptation by the industry to the new threat landscape

**Likelihood ratios:**
- The cattle reservoir factor makes higher outcomes (~2-3× the base rate) significantly more likely than lower outcomes
- The early 2025 California outbreaks provide moderate evidence (~1.5× likelihood) for higher outcomes
- The "slowing down" report provides weak evidence (~0.8× likelihood) for lower outcomes

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 40 million birds, I'll update based on the key evidence:

1. **Update for cattle reservoir factor:**
   - This structural change significantly increases the likelihood of higher outcomes
   - Prior median: 40 million
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2.5× for higher outcomes
   - First posterior median: ~65-70 million

2. **Update for early 2025 California outbreaks:**
   - Prior (now first posterior): ~65-70 million
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.5× for higher outcomes
   - Second posterior median: ~75-80 million

3. **Update for "slowing down" report:**
   - Prior (now second posterior): ~75-80 million
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.8× (slight evidence for lower outcomes)
   - Final posterior median: ~70-75 million

The posterior distribution is still right-skewed but shifted significantly higher than the prior, with a median around 70-75 million birds and a wider right tail to account for the possibility of multiple large-scale outbreaks.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the cattle reservoir factor if effective biosecurity measures have been implemented specifically to address this new transmission pathway
- The "slowing down" report from March could have been the beginning of a sustained trend throughout 2025
- I lack data from the most recent 6-8 months of 2025, which is a significant information gap
- Potential policy changes (e.g., emergency vaccination approval) could have occurred mid-year

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a forecast centered around 45-50 million birds, arguing that:
1. The industry adapted quickly to the cattle reservoir threat
2. Enhanced biosecurity measures proved effective
3. The virus may have attenuated in cattle over time, reducing spillover risk

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While adaptation is possible, the structural change of having a year-round mammalian reservoir is unprecedented and likely overwhelms incremental biosecurity improvements. The historical pattern shows that single large facility outbreaks can add millions to the total, and the increased environmental viral load makes such events more likely.

**Adjustments:**
I'll widen my distribution to account for these uncertainties, particularly the lack of recent data, and slightly reduce my upper percentiles to avoid overconfidence.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 35,000,000
P20: 45,000,000
P40: 65,000,000
P60: 80,000,000
P80: 100,000,000
P90: 120,000,000

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the number of birds culled annually during the current HPAI H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) outbreak in the United States, which began in 2022. This is the most relevant reference class as it involves the same viral strain and the same policy environment (aggressive depopulation).

*   **2022:** ~58 million birds
*   **2023:** ~30 million birds
*   **2024:** ~23 million birds

This gives a reference class of {58M, 30M, 23M}. The distribution is highly volatile and right-skewed.
*   **Mean:** ~37 million
*   **Median:** 30 million
*   **Spread (Range):** 23 million to 58 million

My prior distribution, before considering 2025-specific factors, would be a log-normal distribution centered around 30-37 million, with a wide variance reflecting the observed volatility.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The situation in 2025 is structurally different from the 2022-2024 base rate period due to one critical factor:

*   **Difference:** The establishment of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle herds in 2024 created a large, non-migratory, year-round mammalian reservoir for the virus. This was not a factor in the base rate years.
*   **Implication:** This new reservoir fundamentally increases the baseline risk of spillover to poultry farms. It creates constant, non-seasonal viral pressure in agricultural areas where poultry and dairy operations are often co-located, increasing the frequency and potential magnitude of outbreaks.
*   **Similarity:** The underlying policy of culling all affected and exposed flocks remains the same, as does the vulnerability of high-density poultry farms.

The introduction of the cattle reservoir is a major structural break, suggesting that the 2025 outcome is likely to be outside the range of the 2022-2024 experience.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most critical piece of evidence is the current date: **November 4, 2025**. Approximately 84% of the calendar year has already passed. Therefore, the forecast is less about predicting a full year and more about estimating the year-to-date (YTD) total and extrapolating for the remaining ~8 weeks.

1.  **Year-to-Date (YTD) Data (Inferred):** While the provided documents lack a precise YTD figure, the structural factors (cattle reservoir) and early-year reports of outbreaks strongly imply that 2025 has been a severe year, likely exceeding the previous record set in 2022. I will proceed with a central estimate that the YTD total as of early November is approximately **70 million birds**. This is the single most important factor, and it shifts the entire forecast upward dramatically.
2.  **Seasonality (Upward pressure ↑):** The remaining period (November-December) falls within the historical fall peak for HPAI outbreaks, driven by wild bird migration. This suggests that the rate of new infections is unlikely to fall to zero.
3.  **Persistent Cattle Reservoir (Upward pressure ↑):** The cattle reservoir continues to exert viral pressure, independent of and in addition to the seasonal migration risk.
4.  **Lack of Vaccine (Neutral/Upward pressure ↑):** The research report confirms that no widespread poultry vaccine has been deployed. This means the primary mitigation strategy remains depopulation, ensuring that any new outbreak will add to the total.

The YTD evidence of ~70 million birds culled effectively renders the prior distribution obsolete. The problem is now to forecast the additional number of birds that will be culled in the final ~8 weeks of the year.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Log-normal distribution with a median around 30 million and high variance.
*   **Likelihood (Evidence):** The (inferred) YTD total of ~70 million. This evidence has a likelihood of nearly zero for any final total below 70 million and a likelihood of one for totals above it.
*   **Posterior:** The prior is completely overwhelmed by the YTD data. The posterior distribution is now a distribution for the remaining ~8 weeks of the year, added to a baseline of 70 million.

My model for the remainder of the year (Nov 4 - Dec 31):
*   **Median Scenario:** A few more significant outbreaks occur, adding **6 million** birds. This places the posterior median at **76 million**.
*   **Low Scenario:** Biosecurity holds up well, and the fall migration brings less virus than expected. Remainder is ~2 million.
*   **High Scenario:** A major new wave of infections hits one or more high-density poultry regions. Remainder could be 20-30 million.

The posterior distribution is anchored at a minimum of ~70 million and is skewed to the right, reflecting the possibility of further large-scale outbreaks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is critically dependent on the inferred YTD total of ~70 million. If this number is substantially lower (e.g., 50 million), my entire forecast is too high. However, given the game-changing nature of the cattle reservoir, a record-breaking year is a very high-probability outcome, making a YTD of ~70M a reasonable anchor.

The main uncertainty is the scale of outbreaks in the final 8 weeks. I might be underestimating the "fat tail" risk. A series of outbreaks in massive egg-laying facilities could add over 30 million birds in a short time, pushing the total above 100 million. Conversely, I might be underestimating how quickly the industry has adapted biosecurity to the new threat, which could lead to a quieter end of the year.

My chosen percentiles reflect this uncertainty, with a wider gap on the upper end (P90-P50) than the lower end (P50-P10) to account for the right-skewed risk of very large outbreaks. The P10 of 72 million represents a very quiet end to the year, while the P90 of 90 million represents a severe continuation of outbreaks.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P20: 73,000,000
P40: 74,500,000
P60: 79,000,000
