### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Elimination of Cabinet-Level Departments:** This is an extremely rare event in US history. No cabinet-level department has been eliminated since the Post Office Department was reorganized into the independent USPS in 1971. The Department of Education itself has faced calls for elimination since its creation (e.g., the 1980 GOP platform), but all attempts have failed. **Base rate: <1%** for any given 4-year presidential term.
2.  **Granting of Presidential Reorganization Authority:** This authority, allowing the President to restructure the executive branch subject to Congressional oversight, is also rare. It was last granted in 1984 and has not been granted in the 40 years since, despite requests (e.g., by President Obama in 2012). **Base rate: ~2-3%** chance of being granted in any given Congressional session.
3.  **Major Partisan Policy Victories in First Year of a New Administration:** A new administration with unified government often tries to enact major policy changes. Examples include the ACA (2009) or the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017). However, these are typically focused on budget, tax, or healthcare priorities, not the fundamental elimination of government agencies. The success rate depends heavily on the size of the majority and party discipline. **Base rate: ~30-40%** for achieving *a* top-tier legislative priority, but eliminating a department is a much higher bar.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-04-22** Historical context piece published — ↔️ — Reaffirms the administration's intent to return education oversight to states, but adds no new information on legislative progress.
*   **2025-03-20** Trump signs executive order to dismantle the Department of Education — ↑ — Strongest possible signal of presidential intent and prioritization, though the action is legally non-binding without Congressional approval. It forces the issue onto the legislative agenda.
*   **2025-02-03** Reports emerge that Trump is considering executive action — ↑ — Early signal that the administration is actively exploring pathways and making this a near-term priority, moving beyond campaign rhetoric.
*   **2025-01-04** News analysis highlights legislative difficulty — ↓ — Early in the term, experts emphasize that Congressional approval is required and unlikely without filibuster reform, framing the challenge as formidable from the outset.
*   **2024-12-12** Trump's TIME interview published — ↑ — Post-election, Trump confirms his intention for a "virtual closure" of the department, solidifying it as a key goal for his administration.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Unified Republican Government (Large ↑):** A Republican-controlled House, Senate, and Presidency is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for either legislative path to succeed. Without it, the probability is near zero.
2.  **Senate Filibuster (Large ↓):** This is the single greatest obstacle. A standalone bill to eliminate the department or grant reorganization authority would require 60 votes, which is highly improbable. The entire question likely hinges on whether the filibuster is eliminated or circumvented.
3.  **Budget Reconciliation Process (Moderate ↑):** The administration could attempt to use reconciliation to defund the department, aiming for a "virtual elimination." However, the Byrd Rule likely prevents using this process to repeal the department's authorizing statute, meaning it would not meet the resolution criteria for legal elimination.
4.  **Presidential Prioritization & Political Capital (Moderate ↑/↓):** Trump's clear and repeated focus on this issue elevates its chances. However, legislative battles on other fronts (e.g., taxes, immigration, budget) could consume finite political capital and floor time, pushing this issue aside.
5.  **Intra-Party Cohesion (Moderate ↓):** While eliminating the department is a popular conservative goal, it is not universally supported. Moderate Republicans may balk at the disruption to student loan programs, grants to states (like IDEA funding), and civil rights enforcement, creating potential fractures in a narrow majority.
6.  **Stakeholder Opposition (Small ↓):** Intense opposition from teachers' unions, state education officials (who rely on federal funds), and civil rights groups will create significant political friction, but is unlikely to sway the administration or its base.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit, Detailed Plan:** Unlike past Republican rhetoric (e.g., Reagan), the Trump administration's goal is backed by a comprehensive and publicly available plan (Project 2025), providing a ready-made blueprint for action.
*   **Heightened Presidential Commitment:** President Trump has personally and repeatedly championed this issue post-election, including via a symbolic (if legally powerless) executive order, indicating a higher level of personal commitment than previous presidents.
*   **Increased Partisan Polarization:** The current political climate makes bipartisan cooperation on this issue impossible, hardening the 60-vote requirement in the Senate into a near-insurmountable wall, unlike in previous eras where some crossover votes might have been conceivable.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The question resolves at the end of 2025, meaning this must be accomplished within the first year of the new administration. This is a period of high legislative activity but also intense competition among priorities.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 2-4%) based on the historical rarity of eliminating cabinet departments and the high procedural hurdles. The reference class data is strong (equivalent n≈50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Unified GOP government and a clear presidential "mandate" on the issue.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The March 2025 executive order demonstrates high prioritization and willingness to act.
    *   ↓ (Large): The continued existence of the Senate filibuster remains the primary obstacle to any legislative action.
    *   ↓ (Small): The complexity of unwinding the department's functions (e.g., student loans, IDEA grants) creates practical and political headwinds even within the GOP.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence of strong intent significantly increases the probability from the near-zero historical base rate. However, this is powerfully counteracted by the unchanged, formidable structural barrier of the filibuster. The posterior should move up, but remain in the low-probability range (e.g., 5-15%).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Introduction of a bill to grant the President reorganization authority.
    *   Serious, leadership-backed discussions about eliminating the legislative filibuster.
    *   A bill to eliminate the department is placed on the legislative calendar in either chamber.
    *   Key committee chairs (e.g., Senate HELP, House Education) announce hearings on the topic.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The administration's legislative agenda for the remainder of 2025 focuses exclusively on other topics like the budget or tax reform.
    *   Key moderate Republican Senators publicly express opposition or concern.
    *   Congressional leadership signals that filibuster reform is off the table.
    *   No legislative action is taken by the August 2025 recess.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution requires legal elimination, not just defunding or a "virtual closure." An attempt to gut the department via reconciliation would be a strong signal but would not trigger a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Assumed Political Landscape:** This analysis assumes a narrow, non-filibuster-proof Republican majority in the Senate. A surprise supermajority would dramatically alter the forecast.
*   **"Black Swan" Events:** A major domestic or international crisis could completely derail the administration's legislative agenda, making this a non-priority.
*   **Path Dependency:** The two paths (direct law vs. reorganization authority) are distinct. Failure on one does not preclude an attempt on the other, but political capital spent on a failed attempt would reduce the chances of the second.

**Final Research Summary:**
President Trump's explicit and prioritized goal to eliminate the Department of Education is backed by a detailed conservative plan, significantly raising the probability above the near-zero historical base rate. However, the path to achieving this before 2026 is exceptionally narrow, blocked by the Senate filibuster, which remains the single most critical and prohibitive obstacle.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the elimination of a cabinet-level department in the US is extremely low, given historical precedent. The last such elimination was the Post Office Department in 1971. The base rate for eliminating a department like the Department of Education within a 4-year presidential term is less than 1%. This is due to the significant legislative and procedural hurdles involved.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a Republican administration with a stated goal of eliminating the Department of Education, similar to past Republican rhetoric.
   - Differences: Unlike past administrations, there is a detailed plan (Project 2025) and explicit prioritization by President Trump. However, the Senate filibuster remains a significant barrier, and the political landscape is highly polarized, making bipartisan support unlikely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Unified Republican Government (Large ↑):** Increases the likelihood as it is a necessary condition for legislative action.
   - **Executive Order (Moderate ↑):** Indicates strong presidential intent but lacks legal force without Congressional approval.
   - **Senate Filibuster (Large ↓):** A major obstacle, as eliminating the department would require overcoming the 60-vote threshold.
   - **Intra-Party Cohesion (Moderate ↓):** Potential resistance from moderate Republicans could hinder legislative efforts.
   - **Stakeholder Opposition (Small ↓):** While significant, it is unlikely to deter the administration's base.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 1% based on historical rarity.
   - Evidence of a unified government and presidential prioritization increases the probability, but the filibuster and intra-party challenges significantly counteract this.
   - Posterior probability calculation:
     - Prior odds = 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 0.0101
     - Likelihood ratio (considering all evidence) ≈ 1.5 (moderate increase due to intent and unified government, but large decrease due to filibuster)
     - Posterior odds = 0.0101 × 1.5 ≈ 0.01515
     - Posterior probability = 0.01515 / (1 + 0.01515) ≈ 0.015 or 1.5%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis might underestimate the potential for unexpected political shifts or crises that could alter priorities.
   - Alternative scenario: A major political event or shift in Senate rules could dramatically change the landscape, but this remains unlikely.
   - Adjustments: Given the persistent structural barriers, the probability remains low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unforeseen changes, the probability of the US eliminating the Department of Education through law or presidential reorganization before 2026 is approximately 2%.

Final: 2%

# Will the US eliminate the Department of Education through law or presidential reorganization before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical precedent for eliminating cabinet-level departments.

**Historical base rate considerations:**
- No cabinet-level department has been completely eliminated since the Post Office Department was reorganized into the USPS in 1971 (over 50 years ago)
- The Department of Education specifically has faced elimination calls since its 1979 creation, including in Republican platforms, but has survived
- Presidential reorganization authority has not been granted since 1984, despite requests (e.g., Obama in 2012)
- Major structural changes to the federal government typically require either bipartisan support or unified government with filibuster-proof majorities

Given these factors, I'll set a very low base rate of approximately **3%** for the elimination of a cabinet-level department within a single year of a presidential administration. This reflects the extreme rarity of such events in modern American governance.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like previous attempts, this would require Congressional action (either direct legislation or granting reorganization authority)
- The Department of Education remains politically contentious but institutionally entrenched
- The department administers significant programs (student loans, grants, civil rights enforcement) that create stakeholder dependencies

**Differences from base case:**
- President Trump has made this a specific, repeated priority both during and after the campaign
- The administration has taken concrete steps via executive order (March 2025) signaling serious intent
- Project 2025 provides a detailed blueprint for implementation, unlike previous attempts
- The current political environment is more polarized, making bipartisan cooperation less likely

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit commitment and executive order**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If the department will be eliminated, we would expect exactly this level of presidential prioritization
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.30) - Presidents often signal policy priorities that don't materialize due to legislative hurdles
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.2 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Senate filibuster remains in place**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.10) - For elimination to occur, we would expect filibuster reform or a workaround
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.95) - The filibuster typically blocks partisan legislation without supermajority support
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Unified Republican government**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.99) - Elimination would be virtually impossible without unified government
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.50) - Many policy priorities fail despite unified government due to other factors
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Complexity of unwinding department functions**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.40) - Successful elimination would require addressing these complexities
- P(E|~H): High (~0.80) - These complexities often prevent major structural changes
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5 (decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 3%, I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on Trump's commitment and executive order:**
- Prior odds: 3/97 = 0.031
- Likelihood ratio: 3.2
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 3.2 = 0.099
- Posterior probability: 0.099/(1+0.099) ≈ 9%

**Update on Senate filibuster remaining in place:**
- Prior odds: 9/91 = 0.099
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.099 × 0.11 = 0.011
- Posterior probability: 0.011/(1+0.011) ≈ 1.1%

**Update on unified Republican government:**
- Prior odds: 1.1/98.9 = 0.011
- Likelihood ratio: 2.0
- Posterior odds: 0.011 × 2.0 = 0.022
- Posterior probability: 0.022/(1+0.022) ≈ 2.2%

**Update on complexity of unwinding department functions:**
- Prior odds: 2.2/97.8 = 0.022
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.022 × 0.5 = 0.011
- Posterior probability: 0.011/(1+0.011) ≈ 1.1%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 1.1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of using budget reconciliation to effectively gut the department while technically keeping its legal structure
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of a surprise filibuster reform specifically for this issue
- The short time horizon (by November 2025) significantly constrains the legislative window
- I may be overweighting historical precedent in an era of increased political polarization and norm-breaking

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The administration could prioritize this issue above all others, spending enormous political capital
- A compromise version could emerge that technically eliminates the department while preserving many functions under different agencies
- A crisis in education could create unexpected political momentum

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for the possibility of unexpected political developments or creative legislative strategies. However, the fundamental structural barriers remain extremely high.

## 6. Final Forecast

After careful consideration of the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of the US eliminating the Department of Education through law or presidential reorganization before 2026 is approximately 2%.

The primary factors driving this low probability are:
1. The extremely high procedural hurdles (especially the Senate filibuster)
2. The short time horizon (just over one year remaining)
3. The complexity of unwinding the department's functions
4. The historical precedent showing the extreme rarity of eliminating cabinet departments

While there is clear presidential intent and a unified government, these factors are insufficient to overcome the structural barriers within the timeframe specified.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate base rate is the historical frequency of the US federal government eliminating a cabinet-level department. This is an exceedingly rare event. Since the creation of the Department of Education in 1979, no cabinet-level department has been eliminated. The last major reorganization of this type was the transformation of the Post Office Department into the United States Postal Service (an independent agency) in 1971. Despite frequent calls by Republican platforms since 1980 to abolish the Department of Education, it has persisted for over 45 years through numerous administrations. This suggests a base rate for any given year is extremely low. A reasonable prior probability, P(H), for the elimination of a specific, targeted department within a single year of a new administration is less than 1%. I will set the initial prior at **1%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The call to eliminate the Department of Education is a standard plank for conservative Republican administrations, similar to the Reagan administration's stated goals.
*   The fundamental legislative process, including the Senate filibuster, remains a major obstacle, as it has been in the past.

**Differences:**
*   **Unified Government and Presidential Prioritization:** The scenario assumes a unified Republican government (Presidency, House, Senate) and a President (Donald Trump) who has made this a much more explicit and personal priority than past presidents. The symbolic executive order signed in March 2025 demonstrates a higher level of commitment than mere campaign rhetoric. This significantly increases the chances compared to the base case of an average administration.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The most critical difference is the timeline. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, and the current date is November 5, 2025. This leaves less than two months, including holiday recesses, for major, controversial legislation to pass. The base rate considers a full year or a full term; we are at the very end of the first year.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the perspective of November 5, 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Strong Presidential Intent (e.g., TIME interview, March 2025 EO)**
    *   This evidence was strong at the beginning of 2025. It signaled that, unlike past administrations, this was a top-tier priority.
    *   P(E | H): If the department were to be eliminated (H), we would absolutely expect to see such strong signals of intent. P(E | H) ≈ 1.
    *   P(E | ~H): It is also common for a new administration to signal strong intent on many priorities but fail to achieve them due to legislative gridlock. P(E | ~H) is moderately high.
    *   Likelihood Ratio: > 1. At the start of the year, this evidence would have significantly increased the probability from the 1% base rate, perhaps into the 5-15% range.

*   **Evidence 2: Lack of Legislative Progress by November 2025**
    *   This is the most crucial piece of new information. As of November 5, no bill to eliminate the department or grant reorganization authority has passed either chamber, nor is one on the immediate legislative calendar for a final vote. The Senate filibuster remains in place.
    *   P(E | H): How likely is it that we would see no legislative progress by November, if the department were to be eliminated by the end of December? This is extremely unlikely. Major legislation requires months of process. A last-minute attachment to a must-pass spending bill is a theoretical possibility but represents a legislative "Hail Mary." So, P(E | H) is very low, perhaps < 0.02 (2%).
    *   P(E | ~H): How likely is it that we would see no progress by November if the department is *not* going to be eliminated? This is extremely likely. This is the default outcome for a failed or stalled legislative push. P(E | ~H) is very high, > 0.95 (95%).
    *   Likelihood Ratio: P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) is very small (e.g., 0.02 / 0.95 ≈ 0.02). This evidence powerfully decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with a generous probability of 10% (odds of 1:9) at the beginning of 2025, after accounting for the strong presidential intent.

*   **Prior Odds (as of early 2025):** 1:9
*   **Likelihood Ratio (from lack of progress):** ≈ 0.02
*   **Posterior Odds:** (1:9) × 0.02 = 0.02 : 9 = 1 : 450
*   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 450) ≈ 0.22%

The initial positive indicators have been overwhelmed by the reality of the legislative calendar and the formidable, unbreached obstacle of the Senate filibuster. The probability has collapsed as the time window has closed.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** Could I be wrong? The primary way this could still happen is if a provision to eliminate the department or grant reorganization authority is secretly negotiated and attached to a must-pass, end-of-year omnibus spending bill or another emergency measure. This would force a rapid, high-stakes vote and is a known, if rare, legislative tactic.
*   **Plausibility:** This scenario is still highly improbable. Such a controversial rider would likely poison the entire must-pass bill, risking a government shutdown, which leadership would be loath to do. Furthermore, the 60-vote threshold for cloture would still apply to the bill in the Senate, meaning Democrats could still block it. The only way around this is the "nuclear option" to eliminate the filibuster, a momentous step that would likely not be taken for this specific issue without significant public debate beforehand.
*   **Market Signal:** The Manifold market is at 2.9%. This is substantially higher than my sub-1% calculation. This implies the market is either slow to update on the time decay or assigns a much higher probability to a "lame-duck surprise" scenario than I do. While respecting the market's signal, the concrete constraints of the legislative calendar and Senate rules provide a stronger basis for a very low forecast. The market may be overweighting the initial intent.
*   **Adjustment:** My calculation leads to <0.5%. The market is near 3%. I will adjust my final forecast upward slightly from the calculated value to account for the small but non-zero possibility of a legislative black swan event, but I will remain significantly below the market, as the evidence against is overwhelming. A 1% forecast acknowledges this tail risk without ignoring the facts on the ground.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial strong intent of the Trump administration made the elimination of the Department of Education a plausible goal for 2025. However, with less than two months remaining, no meaningful legislative progress has been made. The formidable barriers of the legislative calendar and the Senate filibuster have proven decisive. The probability of passing such a monumental and controversial law in the handful of remaining legislative days is exceedingly small.

Final: 1%
