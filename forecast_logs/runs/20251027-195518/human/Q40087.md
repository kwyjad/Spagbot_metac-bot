### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the high-frequency (monthly) trend and volatility of zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) market share in Norway over the last 6-12 months?** This establishes the immediate baseline and recent momentum.
*   **Q2: What are the primary mechanisms driving this trend?** This involves identifying the key policy levers (taxes, incentives), market dynamics (model availability, consumer preference), and structural factors (charging infrastructure).
*   **Q3: Are there any scheduled changes to these mechanisms before or immediately after November 2025?** Policy shifts, especially around the new year, could create pull-forward or push-back demand.
*   **Q4: What characterizes the remaining ~2-3% of the non-ZEV market?** Understanding the barriers for the last buyers (e.g., specific vehicle needs, geographical constraints, behavioral resistance) is crucial for estimating the ceiling.
*   **Q5: Are there seasonal patterns in Norwegian car sales that might specifically affect the ZEV share in November?** For example, end-of-year sales pushes or model year changeovers.

**2. Search Queries:**

*   **Q1:** `OFV Norway new car registrations monthly data 2025`, `Norway EV market share by month 2025`, `Norge bilregistrering statistikk månedlig 2025`
*   **Q2:** `Norway electric vehicle incentives 2025`, `Norway car tax ICE vs EV 2025`, `Norwegian EV Association policy summary`
*   **Q3:** `Norway 2026 budget vehicle taxes`, `changes to EV VAT exemption Norway 2026`, `end of petrol car sales Norway policy details`
*   **Q4:** `reasons to buy ICE car in Norway 2025`, `Norway commercial vehicle electrification`, `barriers to 100% EV adoption Norway`
*   **Q5:** `Norway car sales seasonality`, `Norwegian car sales by month historical data`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The data provided is remarkably current and detailed, forming a strong foundation. The trend is unambiguously positive and accelerating into the high-90s. The most recent data points (June: 96.9%, July: 97.2%, Aug: 96.9%, Sept: 98.3%) show both high performance and slight monthly volatility. The primary driver remains the powerful tax incentive structure making ZEVs the default economic choice. The 2025 political goal acts as a powerful coordinating mechanism for industry and consumers. The remaining non-ZEV market likely consists of niche use cases (e.g., specific commercial vans, vehicles for heavy towing not yet well-served by EVs) and a small segment of "laggard" consumers. No major policy changes are anticipated that would reverse the trend before November 2025; if anything, anticipation of the year-end deadline could slightly accelerate it. Seasonally, November is a relatively standard month for car sales, though end-of-year pushes can occur. The core challenge is modeling the "last mile" of the S-curve, where gains become harder.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasting Panel**

**TO:** Bayesian Statistician
**FROM:** Research Desk
**DATE:** 2025-10-27
**SUBJECT:** Forecast Update: Percentage of Zero-Emission Cars in Norwegian New Car Registrations, November 2025

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Recent Monthly ZEV Share (Norway, 2025):** The most relevant reference class is the monthly performance in the last 6 months. The data shows a range from **96.9% to 98.3%**. The mean of the last four reported months (Jun-Sep) is 97.3%. This class suggests a very high baseline with minor volatility.
2.  **Technology Adoption S-Curves (Final Stage):** Norway's ZEV adoption is in the "late majority/laggard" phase of a classic S-curve, approaching its asymptote. In this stage, the rate of growth typically slows significantly as the remaining non-adopters are the most difficult to convert. This implies the final few percentage points towards 100% will be the hardest to achieve, and monthly progress will be incremental and non-linear.
3.  **Annual ZEV Share Growth (Norway):** The year-over-year growth has been substantial (e.g., 82.4% in 2023 to 88.9% in 2024). Extrapolating this annual trend is less useful for a specific monthly forecast but confirms the powerful underlying momentum.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-30:** ZEV share for September rebounds to a new record of **98.3%**. (↑) — Matters because it reverses the prior month's dip, indicating that momentum is still strong and the ceiling has not yet been reached.
*   **2025-08-31:** ZEV share for August dips slightly to **96.9%**. (↓) — Matters because it demonstrates that month-to-month progress is not guaranteed and is subject to volatility from factors like model delivery schedules.
*   **2025-07-31:** ZEV share for July hits a then-record **97.2%**. (↑) — Matters because it was the first time the share decisively cleared the 97% mark, setting a new, higher baseline for expectations.
*   **2025-06-30:** ZEV share for June was **96.9%**. (↔) — Matters as it established a high and stable market share in the upper 90s, consolidating earlier gains from the spring.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Tax & Purchase Incentives (Large ↑):** The core mechanism is the massive financial advantage of ZEVs, primarily through exemptions from Norway's high VAT (25%) and purchase taxes on ICE vehicles. This makes the total cost of ownership for most ZEVs significantly lower.
2.  **2025 Political Goal (Moderate ↑):** The widely publicized goal for all new cars to be zero-emission by 2025 creates a strong social and market expectation. It signals policy stability and encourages dealers to prioritize ZEV inventory and marketing.
3.  **Model Availability & Choice (Moderate ↑):** A vast and expanding selection of ZEV models across various segments (SUV, sedan, compact) has eliminated the "no suitable model"

### Probabilistic Forecast for the Percentage of Zero-Emission Cars Among Norwegian New Car Registrations in November 2025

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most recent monthly data from June to September 2025, with ZEV shares ranging from 96.9% to 98.3%, provides a strong base rate. The mean of these months is 97.3%.
   - **Rationale:** This period reflects the latest trends and captures the current momentum towards the 2025 goal. The variance is low, indicating a stable trend.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation aligns closely with the base rate due to the consistent high ZEV share in recent months.
   - **Difference:** The approach to the 2025 goal might introduce slight upward pressure, but the remaining non-ZEV market is resistant due to niche needs.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Recent Trends:** The rebound to 98.3% in September suggests strong momentum, making higher outcomes more likely.
   - **Policy and Incentives:** Continued strong incentives and the 2025 goal support high ZEV shares, increasing the likelihood of outcomes above the base rate.
   - **Market Dynamics:** Availability of diverse ZEV models supports maintaining or slightly increasing the current share.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior mean of 97.3%, the evidence of strong recent performance and incentives suggests a slight upward adjustment.
   - **Posterior Mean:** Adjusted to around 97.8%, reflecting the likelihood of continued high performance.
   - **Variance:** Remains low due to consistent historical data, but slightly increased to account for potential volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the difficulty of achieving the final percentage points due to niche market resistance.
   - **Tail Risks:** Consideration of potential policy changes or economic shifts that could impact ZEV sales.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A scenario where market saturation slows progress, keeping the share closer to 97%.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - **Adjusted Percentiles:** Reflecting the analysis and potential tail risks, the percentiles are slightly conservative to account for uncertainty.

P10: 97.0  
P20: 97.3  
P40: 97.6  
P60: 97.8  
P80: 98.1  
P90: 98.4

# Forecasting the Percentage of Zero-Emission Cars in Norwegian New Car Registrations (November 2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the recent monthly zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) market share in Norway from June to September 2025:
- June 2025: 96.9%
- July 2025: 97.2%
- August 2025: 96.9%
- September 2025: 98.3%

This gives a mean of 97.3% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.7 percentage points. This is the most relevant reference class because:
1. It represents the most recent data points in the same market
2. It captures the current stage of Norway's EV adoption curve
3. It reflects the current policy and market environment

The distribution appears to be slightly right-skewed, with a ceiling approaching 100% and more room for downside variation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Same country, same regulatory environment
- Same stage in the EV adoption S-curve (late majority/laggard phase)
- Similar seasonal factors (fall/winter months)
- Same policy incentives driving adoption

**Differences that matter:**
- November is closer to year-end than the reference months, which could increase pressure to meet the 2025 goal
- November typically has different weather conditions than summer months, which might affect consumer preferences
- Potential end-of-year model clearances could affect the mix of vehicles available
- The trend appears to be upward (September hit 98.3%), suggesting continued momentum

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing the forecast upward:**
1. The most recent data point (September 2025 at 98.3%) shows an increase from previous months, suggesting continued momentum. This makes values above 98% more likely (likelihood ratio ~1.5x for higher values).

2. The Norwegian parliament's goal that all new cars would be zero-emission by the end of 2025 creates pressure for continued improvement as the deadline approaches. This makes values above the mean more likely (likelihood ratio ~1.3x for higher values).

3. The overall trend from 2024 (88.9%) to mid-2025 (97%+) shows strong year-over-year growth, suggesting the trend is likely to continue. This makes values below 96% less likely (likelihood ratio ~0.7x for lower values).

**Evidence pushing the forecast downward:**

1. The adoption curve is in its final stage, where gains become increasingly difficult as only the most resistant consumers remain. This makes values above 99% less likely (likelihood ratio ~0.8x for the highest values).

2. Month-to-month volatility exists (e.g., the dip from July to August), suggesting random fluctuations could occur. This increases the probability of values below the mean (likelihood ratio ~1.2x for lower values).

3. There may be niche use cases where ZEVs still don't meet specific needs (heavy towing, certain commercial applications), creating a small but persistent non-ZEV market. This makes values above 99.5% less likely (likelihood ratio ~0.6x for the highest values).

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 97.3% with a standard deviation of 0.7 percentage points, I'll update based on the key evidence:

**Update 1: Recent upward momentum**
The September figure of 98.3% suggests the distribution should shift upward.
- Prior mean: 97.3%
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5x for values above the prior mean
- Posterior mean shifts to approximately 97.8%
- Posterior standard deviation narrows slightly to ~0.65 percentage points

**Update 2: Late-stage adoption curve challenges**
The difficulty of converting the last few percentage points of the market.
- Intermediate prior mean: 97.8%
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.8x for values above 99%
- Posterior mean remains around 97.8%
- But the right tail of the distribution becomes thinner (less probability mass above 99%)

**Update 3: Proximity to year-end goal**
November 2025 is close to the year-end target, creating additional pressure.
- Intermediate prior mean: 97.8%
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3x for values above the prior mean
- Posterior mean shifts to approximately 98.1%
- Posterior standard deviation remains around 0.65 percentage points

The resulting posterior distribution has:
- Mean: 98.1%
- Standard deviation: ~0.65 percentage points
- Right-skewed with a thinner right tail (approaching the 100% ceiling)
- Left tail extending further (accounting for possible volatility)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I may be overestimating the impact of the 2025 goal. If most achievable conversions have already happened, the remaining non-ZEV market might be more resistant than expected.

2. I haven't fully accounted for potential seasonal effects specific to November in Norway (e.g., winter conditions might affect certain vehicle preferences).

3. I might be underestimating the possibility of supply chain issues or delivery timing that could cause short-term fluctuations.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would center the forecast lower, around 97.5%, arguing that:
- The September figure of 98.3% might be an outlier rather than a new baseline
- The remaining non-ZEV market is more resistant to conversion
- Month-to-month volatility is more significant than the trend

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The consistent upward trend over multiple years and the proximity to the year-end goal provide strong evidence that the September figure is part of a genuine trend rather than an outlier.

**Adjustments:**
To account for these considerations, I'll slightly widen my distribution to reflect greater uncertainty and adjust my percentiles to reflect the possibility of both continued progress and resistance in the final stages of adoption.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 97.1
P20: 97.5
P40: 97.9
P60: 98.3
P80: 98.7
P90: 99.0

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate for this short-term forecast is the distribution of recent monthly data on zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) market share in Norway. The question is for November 2025, and we have data up to September 2025. The last four months provide a strong reference class:

*   June 2025: 96.9%
*   July 2025: 97.2%
*   August 2025: 96.9%
*   September 2025: 98.3%

The mean of this period is 97.3%, and the standard deviation is approximately 0.65%. This suggests a prior distribution centered around **97.5%** (slightly weighting the upward trend) with a standard deviation of around 0.7%. This captures both the high baseline and the observed monthly volatility. This is a technology adoption S-curve in its final "laggard" phase, where gains are incremental but still subject to monthly fluctuations.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: The forecast month, November 2025, is only two months after the last data point. The fundamental drivers—strong tax incentives for ZEVs, high taxes on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, wide model availability, and robust charging infrastructure—will be virtually identical to the conditions in the June-September period.
*   **Differences**: The primary difference is the proximity to the end of 2025, the year of the Norwegian parliament's widely publicized goal for all new cars to be zero-emission. This creates a powerful psychological and market-coordinating effect. Dealerships and consumers may "pull forward" registrations to help meet this symbolic target, creating upward pressure that was less pronounced in the summer months. The September record of 98.3% may be the beginning of this final push.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

1.  **September 2025 Record (98.3%)**: This is a very strong piece of evidence. It's the most recent data point and a new all-time high. This observation is much more likely under a hypothesis that the underlying trend is still climbing towards a higher asymptote (e.g., >98%) than a hypothesis that the market has plateaued around the summer average of ~97.3%. This evidence strongly pushes the forecast's central tendency **upward**.
2.  **Monthly Volatility (August Dip to 96.9%)**: The fact that the share dipped in August after a record in July demonstrates that progress is not linear. This is likely due to logistical factors like vehicle shipment schedules. This evidence increases the forecast's variance. It makes a reversion to the low-97s plausible, cautioning against overconfidence in a continued, uninterrupted rise. It makes the distribution **wider**.
3.  **The "2025 Goal" Narrative**: The approaching year-end deadline acts as a causal driver. It creates an incentive for all market participants to prioritize ZEV registrations. This makes higher outcomes (e.g., >99%) more probable than they would be otherwise. This factor pushes the distribution's **upper tail and positive skew**.
4.  **The "Laggard" Market**: The remaining ~1.7% of non-ZEV buyers are the most difficult to convert. They may have specific needs (e.g., heavy towing, specialized commercial use) for which ZEVs are not yet suitable, or they may be ideologically resistant. This creates a soft "ceiling" on the market share, making values above 99.5% extremely unlikely in any given month. This evidence **caps the upper end** of the plausible range.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior**: A distribution centered around 97.5% with a standard deviation of ~0.7.
*   **Update Step 1 (September Data)**: The 98.3% result is a powerful signal. I update my prior by shifting the central tendency significantly upward, anchoring the new median near this latest data point. The posterior median moves from ~97.5% to ~98.3%.
*   **Update Step 2 (Volatility & 2025 Goal)**: I incorporate the other factors. The August dip means I should not narrow the variance too much; a fall back to the mid-97s remains possible. The 2025 goal suggests the upside is more likely than the downside, introducing a slight positive skew. The "laggard" market reality puts a practical cap on the extreme upside.
*   **Posterior Shape**: The resulting posterior distribution is centered around **98.3%**. It is tighter than the prior but still accounts for volatility, with a plausible range from roughly 97% to 99.4%. It is slightly asymmetric, with more probability mass on outcomes above the median than far below it.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

A key risk is over-anchoring on the single data point from September. It could be a temporary high caused by a large shipment of a popular model. An alternative forecast might center on the 4-month average of 97.3%, arguing for a reversion to the mean. However, this alternative view likely underestimates the powerful, accelerating momentum created by the approaching 2025 deadline. The September result is more likely a signal of a new, higher baseline than a random fluke. My proposed distribution accounts for a potential dip back towards the average (the P10 is 97.1%), but correctly weights the likelihood of sustaining or improving upon the September record. The forecast also acknowledges the "hard ceiling" by keeping the P90 at a realistic 99.4%, well short of 100%.

P10: 97.1
P20: 97.6
P40: 98.1
P60: 98.7
P80: 99.1
P90: 99.4
