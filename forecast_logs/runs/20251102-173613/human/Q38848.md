### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern Military Juntas Facing Major Insurgency (1945-Present):** This class includes regimes that seized power and subsequently faced large-scale, multi-front civil wars. The average lifespan of military regimes is around 9 years (Geddes, Wright, & Frantz, 2014). However, those facing existential civil wars are more brittle. A rough base rate for collapse within the first 5 years of the conflict's escalation is likely low, perhaps **15-20%**. The Myanmar conflict escalated dramatically after the 2021 coup. A collapse by 2025 would be on the faster end of this reference class.
2.  **Incumbent Governments in Civil Wars (1945-Present):** Historically, incumbent governments win civil wars more often than they lose. Insurgent victories are relatively rare, occurring in approximately 25-30% of cases. This suggests a base rate of **~70-75%** that the incumbent (the junta) will not be defeated within the forecast period. This class is broad but highlights the inherent advantage of state actors (even weakened ones).
3.  **Protracted Internal Conflicts:** The median duration of a civil war is approximately 10 years. The current widespread conflict in Myanmar began in 2021. This reference class suggests a very low probability, perhaps **<10%**, of a decisive outcome (like the fall of the capital) within the first 4-5 years.

*Limitations:* These base rates are general. The current Myanmar conflict is unique due to the unprecedented level of coordination between Bamar resistance (PDFs) and long-standing Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs), and the junta's extreme international isolation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-02** PDF attacks junta troops in Mandalay Region. — **↑** (small) — Demonstrates continued, widespread resistance pressure, forcing the junta to fight on multiple fronts and depleting its resources.
*   **2025-01-31** Junta extends state of emergency for another six months. — **↓** (moderate) — Signals the junta's institutional apparatus is still functional and it retains the formal authority and intent to rule, pushing any collapse further out.
*   **2024-11-28** ICC prosecutor seeks an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing. — **↑** (moderate) — Deepens the regime's international isolation, potentially creating internal fractures among elites who may see the leader as a liability.
*   **2024-10-31** Reports confirm resistance forces have made significant territorial gains over the past year. — **↑** (large) — The military momentum has clearly shifted since late 2023's "Operation 1027," indicating a structural weakening of the junta's military control.
*   **2024-07-31** Junta extends state of emergency, citing instability. — **↓** (small) — Part of a recurring pattern showing the junta can maintain formal control despite battlefield losses, suggesting resilience in its core functions.
*   **2024-05-13** National Unity Government (NUG) continues to gain diplomatic traction. — **↑** (small) — Erodes the junta's legitimacy and builds a credible alternative government, which can attract more support and defections.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Junta Manpower & Morale (Large):** The Tatmadaw is suffering from catastrophic recruitment shortfalls, forcing it to rely on unpopular conscription, which in turn fuels more opposition. High rates of defection and battlefield surrender are its primary vulnerability. A collapse in key fighting units is the most likely path to rapid territorial loss.
2.  **Opposition Unity & Capability (Large):** The unprecedented coordination between the NUG/PDFs and powerful EAOs (like the Arakan Army and Three Brotherhood Alliance) is the main driver of rebel success. A breakdown in this alliance would relieve pressure on the junta. Conversely, coordinated offensives targeting core territories could accelerate collapse.
3.  **External Actor Influence (China) (Moderate):** China's position is critical. While not wanting a chaotic collapse, Beijing has shown willingness to accept and even facilitate resistance gains on its border to crack down on crime syndicates and secure its interests. A decisive shift away from backing the junta would be a major blow.
4.  **Economic Collapse (Moderate):** The junta's mismanagement has crippled the economy, fueling popular anger and limiting its ability to fund the war. While not an immediate cause of collapse, a hyperinflationary spiral or inability to pay soldiers could trigger a rapid breakdown.
5.  **Junta Internal Cohesion (Large):** The risk of an internal coup against Min Aung Hlaing is significant, especially as battlefield losses mount and international pressure (like the ICC warrant) singles him out. A coup could lead to fragmentation or a new leader who might negotiate, but it could also simply replace one dictator with another, not triggering the resolution criteria.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Nationwide Resistance:** Unlike past ethnic insurgencies confined to border areas, the current conflict involves the majority Bamar population in the country's heartland. The Tatmadaw is stretched thin, fighting a multi-front war it is not structured for.
*   **High Bar for Resolution:** The resolution criteria require the loss of control over *both* Naypyidaw and Yangon. These are the junta's core bastions and will be the last areas to fall. Most regimes collapse or transition before their fortress-like capital and largest commercial city are completely overrun. This makes the specific outcome much less likely than a generic "junta collapse."
*   **Unprecedented Military Weakness:** The Tatmadaw is weaker than at any point in modern history, losing significant territory, hundreds of bases, and control of major border crossings. This is a sharp deviation from the typical "strong state" in the civil war reference class.
*   **Alternative Government:** The existence of the NUG provides a politically credible government-in-exile that can coordinate resistance, manage liberated territories, and engage internationally, a feature often lacking in other insurgencies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start from a low prior for collapse by end-2025, anchored on the civil war duration base rate (n≈10). The high bar of the resolution criteria (taking two major cities) strongly favors the "After 2025" bin.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The sustained military momentum of opposition forces since late 2023 and the junta's severe, systemic manpower crisis are powerful evidence that the junta is on a losing trajectory, much faster than the base rate suggests.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** Growing international delegitimization (ICC warrant) and successful NUG diplomacy increase pressure and may fracture the junta's elite.
    *   **↓ Large:** The resolution criteria are a massive counterweight. Taking Naypyidaw (a purpose-built military fortress) and Yangon requires conventional capabilities the resistance may not possess by 2025. The junta will prioritize their defense above all else.
    *   **↓ Moderate:** The junta's institutional resilience, demonstrated by its ability to repeatedly extend emergency rule and maintain a chain of command, shows it has not yet reached a breaking point in its core.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the probability of an eventual collapse forward in time. However, the specific, difficult resolution criteria act as a powerful anchor. The posterior should shift probability out of the "After 2025" bin into the earlier bins, but "After 2025" should remain the most probable outcome. The update is a significant move toward an earlier collapse, but not enough to make it the base case.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (collapse more likely):**
    *   Sustained fighting within the Naypyidaw Union Territory or on the outskirts of Yangon.
    *   Defection of a Regional Military Commander or a high-ranking general from the War Office.
    *   Loss of a major airbase, which would cripple the junta's key military advantage.
    *   China or another key ASEAN state formally meeting with NUG leadership.
    *   A collapse of the currency (kyat) or widespread failure to pay military salaries.
*   **DOWN indicators (collapse less likely):**
    *   Successful, large-scale junta counter-offensives that retake significant territory (e.g., a major border town).
    *   Major, public fracturing of the alliance between the NUG and a key EAO.
    *   A new, substantial arms deal with Russia or China being fulfilled.
    *   Stabilization of the economy or a successful campaign to boost military recruitment.
    *   Opposition forces shifting to a defensive posture for a prolonged period.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fog of War:** All data on territorial control, casualties, and defections is highly contested and subject to propaganda from both sides. Ground truth is extremely difficult to ascertain.
*   **Resolution Criteria Specificity:** The question hinges on losing control of *most of the area* of two specific cities. A siege, partial control, or a negotiated handover could create ambiguity. The regime could also fall via an internal coup that preserves military control of the cities, which would not trigger resolution.
*   **Black Swan Events:** The sudden death

To forecast the probability of when the Myanmar military junta will collapse, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Option: Before Jun 2025**
  - **Base Rate:** Given the historical context of military juntas facing major insurgencies, the base rate for a collapse within the first 5 years is approximately **15-20%**. Considering the conflict began in 2021, this option represents a rapid collapse scenario.
  
- **Option: Jun to Aug 2025**
  - **Base Rate:** This period is slightly beyond the 5-year mark, where the base rate for collapse remains low, around **20-25%**, as the conflict continues to be intense but not yet at a decisive point.

- **Option: Sep to Dec 2025**
  - **Base Rate:** As we approach the end of 2025, the likelihood of collapse increases slightly, with a base rate of **25-30%**, given the ongoing pressure on the junta.

- **Option: After 2025**
  - **Base Rate:** Historically, incumbent governments in civil wars have a **70-75%** chance of not being defeated within a short timeframe. This option aligns with the expectation that the junta may persist beyond 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The Myanmar junta is facing a multi-front insurgency, similar to other historical cases of military regimes under pressure.
- **Differences:** The unique coordination between Bamar resistance and ethnic armed organizations, along with international isolation, makes the situation more precarious for the junta than typical cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **PDF attacks in Mandalay Region (2025-11-02):** Increases likelihood of earlier collapse due to sustained resistance pressure. **P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)**
- **Junta extends state of emergency (2025-01-31):** Decreases likelihood of collapse, showing institutional resilience. **P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)**
- **ICC arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing (2024-11-28):** Increases likelihood of internal fractures and earlier collapse. **P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)**
- **Resistance territorial gains (2024-10-31):** Significantly increases likelihood of earlier collapse due to military momentum. **P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Before Jun 2025:** Start with a low prior (15-20%). Evidence of resistance gains and international pressure slightly increases this probability.
- **Jun to Aug 2025:** Similar updates as above, but with a slightly higher starting base rate.
- **Sep to Dec 2025:** The evidence of resistance gains and international pressure increases the probability more significantly, as this period is closer to the end of 2025.
- **After 2025:** Despite evidence of weakening, the high bar for resolution and historical resilience of incumbents keeps this as the most likely outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected junta resilience or external support, which could delay collapse.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden internal coup or significant international intervention could shift probabilities.
- **Adjustments:** Given the high bar for resolution, maintain a conservative estimate for earlier collapse.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and reflect the evidence and base rates.

### 7. Output Format

Option_Before_Jun_2025: 10%  
Option_Jun_to_Aug_2025: 15%  
Option_Sep_to_Dec_2025: 25%  
Option_After_2025: 50%  

These probabilities reflect the current evidence and historical context, with "After 2025" remaining the most likely outcome due to the high bar for resolution and historical resilience of military regimes.

# Analysis: When will the Myanmar military junta collapse?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll consider several reference classes to establish base rates:

**Military Juntas Facing Major Insurgencies:**
- Military regimes have an average lifespan of ~9 years
- Those facing existential multi-front civil wars tend to collapse faster
- The Myanmar junta seized power in February 2021, so a collapse by end-2025 would be within 5 years
- Base rate for collapse within 5 years of conflict escalation: ~20%

**Civil War Outcomes:**
- Historically, incumbent governments win civil wars ~70% of the time
- Insurgent victories occur in only 25-30% of cases
- Median civil war duration is ~10 years
- Base rate for insurgent victory within 4-5 years: ~10-15%

**Resolution Criteria Consideration:**
- The question requires loss of control over both Naypyidaw and Yangon
- This is a high bar - many regimes collapse before losing their capital
- This specific outcome is less likely than a generic "junta collapse"

**Initial Prior Distribution:**
- Before Jun 2025: 5% (very soon)
- Jun to Aug 2025: 7% (mid-2025)
- Sep to Dec 2025: 13% (late 2025)
- After 2025: 75% (most likely based on historical patterns)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Rate Scenario:**
- Like most military juntas, the Myanmar regime maintains control of key institutions
- The junta controls the most powerful military in the country
- The regime has repeatedly extended emergency rule, showing institutional resilience
- The capital (Naypyidaw) was purpose-built to be defensible against uprisings

**Key Differences:**
- Unprecedented coordination between ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and majority Bamar resistance
- The junta controls less than 25% of territory (far less than typical incumbents)
- Extreme international isolation, including ICC arrest warrant for the leader
- Catastrophic recruitment shortfalls and high defection rates
- Multi-front war stretching military resources beyond capacity
- Existence of a credible alternative government (NUG) with growing legitimacy

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence Supporting Earlier Collapse:**

1. **Territorial Control Dynamics** - Reports confirm resistance forces have made significant territorial gains
   - P(E|H="Before 2026"): Very high (~80%)
   - P(E|H="After 2025"): Moderate (~40%)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2.0

2. **ICC Arrest Warrant for Min Aung Hlaing**
   - P(E|H="Before 2026"): Moderate-high (~60%)
   - P(E|H="After 2025"): Moderate (~40%)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.5

3. **Continued PDF Attacks in Core Regions (Mandalay)**
   - P(E|H="Before 2026"): High (~70%)
   - P(E|H="After 2025"): Moderate (~40%)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.75

**Evidence Supporting Later Collapse:**

1. **Junta Extension of Emergency Rule (Jan 2025)**
   - P(E|H="Before 2026"): Moderate (~50%)
   - P(E|H="After 2025"): Very high (~90%)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.56

2. **Absence of Fighting Near Naypyidaw/Yangon**
   - P(E|H="Before 2026"): Low (~20%)
   - P(E|H="After 2025"): High (~80%)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.25

3. **High Bar for Resolution Criteria**
   - P(E|H="Before 2026"): Low (~30%)
   - P(E|H="After 2025"): Very high (~90%)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.33

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update on the territorial control evidence first:

For "Before Jun 2025":
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 2.0 = 0.106
- Posterior probability: 0.106/(1+0.106) ≈ 9.6%

For "Jun to Aug 2025":
- Prior odds: 0.07/0.93 = 0.075
- Posterior odds: 0.075 × 2.0 = 0.15
- Posterior probability: 0.15/(1+0.15) ≈ 13.0%

For "Sep to Dec 2025":
- Prior odds: 0.13/0.87 = 0.149
- Posterior odds: 0.149 × 2.0 = 0.298
- Posterior probability: 0.298/(1+0.298) ≈ 23.0%

For "After 2025":
- Prior odds: 0.75/0.25 = 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3.0 × 0.5 = 1.5
- Posterior probability: 1.5/(1+1.5) ≈ 60.0%

After considering all evidence, the combined effect shifts probability mass from "After 2025" toward earlier periods, but not enough to make any earlier period the most likely outcome.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed of military collapse once a tipping point is reached
- The junta's manpower crisis could accelerate more rapidly than historical patterns suggest
- Internal coup dynamics within the junta could lead to sudden regime change
- The resolution criteria focus on territorial control, not regime survival in other forms

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- A negotiated transition could occur where the junta formally maintains control of cities while ceding power
- China could decisively withdraw support, accelerating collapse
- The resistance could fragment, allowing the junta to consolidate control

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase probability for "Sep to Dec 2025" slightly to account for accelerating momentum
- I should decrease "Before Jun 2025" slightly as we're already in November 2025 with no imminent collapse

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming:

Before Jun 2025: 8%
Jun to Aug 2025: 12% 
Sep to Dec 2025: 25%
After 2025: 55%

## 7. Final Forecast

Before Jun 2025: 8%
Jun to Aug 2025: 12%
Sep to Dec 2025: 25%
After 2025: 55%

Here is my probabilistic forecast and reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary reference class is the duration of modern civil wars and the success rate of incumbent regimes.

*   **Civil War Duration:** The median duration of a civil war since 1945 is approximately 10 years. The widespread conflict in Myanmar escalated significantly after the February 2021 coup. As of November 2025, the conflict is in its fourth year. This base rate suggests a low probability of a decisive resolution (like the fall of two capital cities) in the immediate future.
*   **Incumbent Success Rate:** Historically, incumbent governments, even non-democratic ones, tend to win civil wars more often than they are defeated. Insurgent victories are relatively rare. This suggests a strong prior that the incumbent junta will survive beyond the short-term forecast horizon.

Given the current date of November 2, 2025, the first two options ("Before Jun 2025" and "Jun to Aug 2025") are impossible and have a probability of 0%. The question effectively becomes: will the junta collapse in the next two months (Nov-Dec 2025), or will it survive into 2026?

Based on the reference classes, a collapse in any specific two-month period is a low-probability event. I will set a prior of **95% on "After 2025"** and **5% on "Sep to Dec 2025"**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The conflict follows a typical pattern of a central government fighting a multi-front insurgency in the periphery. The government retains control of the capital and major economic centers, using its advantages in heavy weaponry and airpower.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Junta's Extreme Weakness:** Unlike a typical incumbent, the Myanmar junta has suffered catastrophic losses of territory (reportedly controlling less than 25%), manpower (due to defections and recruitment failure), and border revenue. This makes it significantly more fragile than the base case average, suggesting a collapse could occur much faster.
    - **Unprecedented Opposition Unity:** The current level of coordination between the Bamar-majority People's Defence Force (PDF) and long-established Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) is a major departure from past conflicts in Myanmar. This unified front puts far more pressure on the junta than it has ever faced before.
    *   **Extremely High Resolution Bar:** The resolution criteria require the junta to lose control of *both* Naypyidaw (a purpose-built fortress capital) and Yangon (the country's largest city). A regime could be functionally defeated, see its leader deposed in a coup, or be forced to negotiate long before these two core strongholds are completely overrun. This specific requirement strongly favors a later resolution date.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key evidence for the hypothesis (H) that the junta collapses in Nov-Dec 2025 versus the alternative (~H) that it collapses after 2025.

*   **Evidence: Sustained, successful opposition offensives and massive junta manpower shortages.**
    *   P(E | H): Very high. A collapse in the next two months would almost certainly be preceded by the current state of accelerating decay.
    *   P(E | ~H): Also high. A collapse in early 2026 would also be preceded by these same conditions.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Slightly greater than 1. This evidence strongly suggests the junta is on a losing trajectory, pulling the timeline for collapse forward from the base rate. It makes a collapse in the near term more plausible than the initial 5% prior.

*   **Evidence: The junta continues to perform core state functions (e.g., extending the state of emergency).**
    *   P(E | H): Low. If a total collapse were two months away, we would expect to see a more advanced breakdown of the central state apparatus.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. This is consistent with a weakened but still-functioning regime that can hold on for many more months.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence pushes against an imminent collapse and supports the "After 2025" option.

*   **Evidence (Absence of): No credible reports of major battles on the immediate outskirts of Naypyidaw or Yangon.**
    *   P(E | H): Very low. To conquer two major cities in two months, resistance forces would likely need to be already massing for an assault or actively besieging them. The absence of this is strong evidence against an imminent conventional victory.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. If the collapse is months away, it is perfectly logical that the final battles for the capitals have not yet begun.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Much less than 1. This is the strongest piece of evidence against the "Sep to Dec 2025" option.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

*   **Prior Odds:** P(Collapse in Nov-Dec 2025) / P(Collapse After 2025) = 5 / 95 ≈ 1/19.
*   **Update:** The evidence of the junta's systemic weakness and the opposition's momentum is a significant update, making a collapse much more likely than the historical base rate would suggest. However, the extremely high bar of the resolution criteria, combined with the lack of active fighting at the gates of the two key cities, acts as a powerful counterweight. The timeline of just two months is the most restrictive factor. A conventional military capture of both cities in this timeframe seems nearly impossible. A collapse would have to come from a sudden internal implosion (e.g., a failed coup leading to fragmentation, or mass surrenders).
*   **Qualitative Adjustment:** The evidence of the junta's fragility is compelling and suggests a higher chance of a "black swan" collapse than my initial prior. I will update the probability of a collapse in the next two months from 5% to 10% to account for the possibility of a rapid, non-linear breakdown rather than a conventional military conquest. This leaves a 90% probability that the junta, even if losing, can hold its core bastions into 2026.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily weighted towards "After 2025". The primary risk is underestimating the speed of collapse. Regimes like the one in Afghanistan in 2021 can appear stable for months and then disintegrate in weeks. The Tatmadaw's manpower crisis could be the critical vulnerability that leads to such a cascading failure. A scenario where a few key units defending the capitals break, leading to a domino effect of surrenders, is plausible. The ICC warrant targeting Min Aung Hlaing personally could also trigger an internal coup that spirals out of control, leading to a rapid collapse of the command structure.

However, the Tatmadaw has a core of ideologically committed officers and has historically shown resilience. They will almost certainly concentrate their most loyal and effective remaining forces for the defense of Naypyidaw and Yangon. Therefore, while a rapid collapse is a non-trivial risk (which I've assigned 10% to), the more probable outcome is a continued grinding conflict where the fall of the two main cities, if it happens at all, occurs in 2026 or later.

### 6. Final Normalization

The current date is November 2, 2025.
*   "Before Jun 2025": This period has passed. Probability is 0%.
*   "Jun to Aug 2025": This period has passed. Probability is 0%.
*   "Sep to Dec 2025": This represents the remaining ~2 months of 2025. I assign a 10% probability to this outcome, reflecting the chance of a sudden, rapid collapse.
*   "After 2025": This represents the junta surviving into 2026. I assign a 90% probability to this, reflecting the high difficulty of capturing two capital cities in a short timeframe.

The probabilities sum to 100%.

Before Jun 2025: 0%
Jun to Aug 2025: 0%
Sep to Dec 2025: 10%
After 2025: 90%
