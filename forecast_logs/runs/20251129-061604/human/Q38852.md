### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Extrapolation of Dense Model Parameter Growth (2018-2022).** From 2018 (BERT, ~340M) to 2022 (Google PaLM, 540B), the largest dense models grew by roughly 10x per year. Extrapolating this trend from a ~0.5T parameter model in 2022 would predict a 5T model in 2023, a 50T model in 2024, and a 500T model in 2025.
    -   **Base Rate (Naive Extrapolation):** 60-70%. This rate assumes the trend observed in that specific four-year period would continue unabated.
    -   **Limitations:** This is a naive trend extrapolation that ignores changes in the underlying scientific and economic landscape. Technological trends, especially exponential ones, are prone to hitting physical, economic, or paradigm-shift-induced limits.

-   **Reference Class 2: Major AI Research Paradigm Shifts.** AI research progresses in waves, with dominant paradigms lasting 3-5 years before being superseded (e.g., RNNs -> Transformers, ImageNet scaling -> new scaling laws). The "bigger is better" dense model paradigm was dominant from roughly 2018 to 2022. A paradigm shift fundamentally alters research direction.
    -   **Base Rate (Paradigm Shift):** The probability of a dominant research trend being disrupted or abandoned within a 3-year window is high, perhaps 50-80%. Applying this suggests the naive extrapolation is unreliable.
    -   **Limitations:** The timing and nature of paradigm shifts are difficult to predict, but their occurrence is a reliable historical pattern.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-17] Article on the future of LLMs predicts multimodality, larger context windows, and specialized models as key trends for 2025-2030, with no mention of scaling dense parameters. (↓) — Reinforces the narrative that industry focus has shifted away from brute-force dense scaling.
-   [2025-09-29] Forecast for 2026 highlights "Agentic AI" handling complete workflows as the next major step, emphasizing autonomy and capability over raw model size. (↓) — The frontier of R&D is in agentic behavior, not creating larger dense models.
-   [2025-05-02] LLM trends report for 2025 predicts a shift *away* from general-purpose models towards smaller, efficient, domain-specific models and autonomous agents. (↓) — Directly contradicts the premise of building a general-purpose, extremely large dense model.
-   [2023-10-12] State of AI Report 2023 (foundational for the current period) highlighted the rise of open-source MoE models (e.g., LLaMA architecture) and confirmed the industry dominance of proprietary models like GPT-4, which is widely understood to be a sparse MoE model. (↓) — Shows the paradigm shift away from dense models was already well underway over two years ago.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **The "Chinchilla" Scaling Laws (↓, Large):** The 2022 DeepMind paper demonstrated it is more compute-optimal to train smaller models on vastly more data. A 100T dense model would require an astronomical, likely non-existent, amount of high-quality training data to be efficient. This finding disincentivizes building such a model.
-   **Economic Viability (↓, Large):** Training a 100T dense model would cost billions, if not tens of billions, of dollars in compute. Given the Chinchilla findings, this represents a deeply inefficient allocation of capital compared to training a smaller model or a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model.
-   **Rise of Sparse Architectures (↓, Large):** MoE models (like GPT-4, Gemini, Mixtral) offer a way to increase parameter count (and thus model knowledge/capacity) without a proportional increase in inference or training cost, as only a fraction of parameters ("experts") are used for any given input. This provides a much more efficient path to scale.
-   **Technical Hurdles (↓, Moderate):** Beyond cost, training a dense model of this size presents immense engineering challenges, including training stability (avoiding divergence), hardware reliability over long training runs, and memory management. These are unsolved research problems at this scale for dense models.
-   **Prestige/Strategic Imperative (↑, Small):** A nation-state or a company might attempt this for the "first to 100T" headline, ignoring economic and scientific efficiency. However, the risk of a costly failure that is derided by the research community as "un-Chinchilla-optimal" is a strong deterrent.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Paradigm Shift:** The base rate (naive extrapolation) is drawn from a period where "more dense parameters" was the primary scaling vector. The current period operates under the "Chinchilla-optimal" paradigm, which explicitly favors more data over more parameters beyond a certain point.
-   **Dominant Architecture:** The SOTA models of the base rate period were dense (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM). The SOTA models now (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini) are widely believed to be sparse MoE architectures. The industry has already moved on.
-   **Focus of Innovation:** The frontier of AI research has shifted from scaling parameters to improving data quality, developing multimodality, enabling long context, and building agentic systems. A 100T dense model is not aligned with these current research frontiers.
-   **Extreme Timescale:** The question resolves in approximately one month. A project of this magnitude would require years of planning and execution. The complete absence of any public announcements, credible rumors, or even whispers from major AI labs makes a resolution by Jan 1, 2026, extraordinarily unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the naive 2018-2022 trend, might have been moderately high (e.g., 40%), but with a low "equivalent n" due to the short duration of the trend.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The Chinchilla paper fundamentally altered the economic and scientific calculus of model scaling.
    -   (↓ Large) All major labs have pivoted to sparse MoE architectures for their flagship models.
    -   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (~1 month) with zero public signals of such a project.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The entire direction of recent AI discourse (agents, multimodality, efficiency) points away from this goal.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence provides a massive, multi-faceted update downwards. The posterior probability should be very close to zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A sudden, shocking announcement from a major AI lab (e.g., Google, OpenAI) or a well-funded, secretive state-level project.
    -   Publication of a major, unexpected breakthrough in dense model training that overcomes stability and cost issues.
    -   Credible leaks (e.g., from hardware suppliers about an unprecedented GPU/TPU cluster allocation) pointing to a secret project nearing completion.

-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The passage of time with no announcements (each day that passes makes a 'Yes' resolution less likely).
    -   Announcements of next-generation models (e

To forecast the probability of a dense machine learning model with at least 100 trillion parameters being trained before 2026, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The naive extrapolation of dense model parameter growth from 2018 to 2022 suggests a 60-70% probability if the trend continued unabated. However, considering the paradigm shift and the current focus on sparse models, a more realistic base rate might be significantly lower. Given the historical frequency of paradigm shifts and the current technological landscape, a base rate of around 10% seems more appropriate. This accounts for the possibility of a dense model being trained despite the prevailing trends against it.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The base case assumes continuous growth in model size, which was a trend from 2018 to 2022.
   - **Differences:** The current situation is marked by a shift towards sparse models and efficiency over sheer size, as evidenced by the Chinchilla scaling laws and the focus on sparse architectures. These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of a dense model of this size being trained.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Chinchilla Scaling Laws:** The likelihood of training a 100T dense model given the Chinchilla findings is very low, as it would be economically and computationally inefficient. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
   - **Industry Shift to Sparse Models:** The adoption of sparse models by major AI labs further decreases the likelihood of a dense model being trained.
   - **Short Time Horizon:** With only a month left and no announcements or credible rumors, the probability is further decreased.
   - **Focus on Other Innovations:** The industry's focus on agentic AI, multimodality, and efficiency suggests that resources are not being allocated to dense model scaling.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 10% probability translates to odds of 1:9.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence against the event (Chinchilla laws, industry trends), the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards the event not occurring.
   - **Posterior Odds:** The posterior odds are significantly lower than the prior odds due to the overwhelming evidence against the event.
   - **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is close to zero, reflecting the strong evidence against the training of such a model.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a secretive project or a breakthrough that could enable such a model. However, the lack of any signals or announcements makes this unlikely.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a small probability of a dense model being trained for strategic or prestige reasons, but this is countered by the economic and scientific inefficiencies.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the overwhelming evidence and the short time frame, the probability remains very low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian updating, the final forecast reflects a very low probability of a dense model with at least 100 trillion parameters being trained before 2026.

Final: 1%

# Will a dense ML model with at least 100 trillion parameters be trained before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical trends in ML model scaling.

**Reference Class**: Growth trajectory of dense ML models from 2018-2022
- 2018: BERT (~340M parameters)
- 2020: GPT-3 (175B parameters)
- 2022: Google PaLM (540B parameters)

This shows roughly a 10x growth every 1-2 years for the largest dense models. However, this trend notably stalled around 2022 with the publication of the Chinchilla paper, which demonstrated that smaller models trained on more data were more compute-efficient.

**Adjusted Reference Class**: Current paradigm shift in ML scaling (2022-present)
- Since 2022, the industry has shifted away from dense scaling toward sparse architectures (MoE models) and more efficient training regimes
- No dense models approaching even 1 trillion parameters have been announced since 2022

**Prior Probability**: 5%

This low prior reflects that the industry has fundamentally shifted away from dense scaling, with the Chinchilla findings redirecting research priorities. The prior accounts for the small possibility of a surprise announcement from a well-funded lab or nation-state pursuing this for prestige reasons.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The general trend of increasing model capabilities continues
- Major tech companies and research labs still compete for AI leadership
- Compute resources continue to grow more available

**Critical differences**:
- The scientific consensus has shifted dramatically against dense scaling as inefficient
- All major labs have pivoted to sparse MoE architectures for flagship models
- The research frontier has moved toward multimodality, agentic behavior, and efficiency
- The question resolves in approximately one month, leaving almost no time for a surprise announcement and verification

These differences strongly suggest the base rate from the 2018-2022 period is no longer applicable, and the probability should be significantly lower than what that trend would predict.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: The Chinchilla Scaling Laws (2022)**
- P(E|H): If a 100T dense model were to be built, it would need to directly contradict established scaling laws. Probability: 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no such model is built, this aligns perfectly with following the Chinchilla findings. Probability: 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.95 = 0.21 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Industry Shift to Sparse Architectures**
- P(E|H): If a 100T dense model were built, we'd expect to see continued investment in dense architectures. Probability: 0.3
- P(E|~H): If no such model is built, we'd expect exactly what we see - a shift to MoE models. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Absence of Announcements or Rumors**
- P(E|H): If such a model were to be released in the next month, we would expect some hints, rumors, or announcements by now. Probability: 0.1
- P(E|~H): If no such model is coming, we'd expect silence on this front. Probability: 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.95 = 0.11 (very strong evidence against)

**Evidence 4: Current Research Focus on Efficiency and Agents**
- P(E|H): If a 100T dense model were imminent, we'd expect research papers discussing dense scaling. Probability: 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no such model is coming, we'd expect the current focus on efficiency, agents, and multimodality. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on Chinchilla Scaling Laws**:
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 1:19
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21
- Posterior odds: 1:19 × 0.21 = 1:90.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+90.5) ≈ 1.1%

**Update on Industry Shift to Sparse Architectures**:
- Prior odds: 0.011/0.989 = 1:90.5
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 1:90.5 × 0.33 = 1:274.2
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+274.2) ≈ 0.36%

**Update on Absence of Announcements**:
- Prior odds: 0.0036/0.9964 = 1:274.2
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 1:274.2 × 0.11 = 1:2492.7
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+2492.7) ≈ 0.04%

**Update on Current Research Focus**:
- Prior odds: 0.0004/0.9996 = 1:2492.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 1:2492.7 × 0.22 = 1:11330.5
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+11330.5) ≈ 0.009%

This extremely low posterior probability reflects the overwhelming evidence against a 100T dense model being trained in the next month.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a secretive project by a nation-state (e.g., China) that could be revealed suddenly
- There could be a fundamental breakthrough in training efficiency that makes dense models viable again
- A company might pursue this for pure prestige despite the inefficiency

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A hybrid architecture that technically qualifies as "dense" under the resolution criteria but incorporates some sparse-like efficiencies
- A model that was trained months ago but kept secret until now

**Adjustments**:
Even accounting for these possibilities, the extremely short timeframe (one month) makes a surprise announcement and verification highly unlikely. I'll adjust my final probability slightly upward from the Bayesian calculation to account for unknown unknowns, but it remains very low.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming evidence against this outcome, particularly:
1. The paradigm shift away from dense scaling following the Chinchilla paper
2. The industry-wide adoption of sparse architectures
3. The extremely short timeframe remaining before resolution
4. The absence of any signals pointing to such a project

I assess the probability at 0.1%, which is slightly higher than my Bayesian calculation to account for unknown unknowns and black swan possibilities.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
-   **Reference Class**: The growth rate of the largest dense machine learning models from 2018 to 2022.
-   **Reasoning**: During this period, the parameter count of state-of-the-art dense models grew exponentially, roughly 10x per year (from BERT's ~340M to PaLM's 540B). A naive extrapolation of this trend from a 0.5T parameter model in 2022 would predict a 5T model in 2023, a 50T model in 2024, and a 500T model in 2025.
-   **Initial Prior**: Based on this trend alone, as viewed from the question's start date in early 2023, a forecaster might assign a moderately high probability. However, knowing that exponential trends are fragile, a more conservative prior is warranted. Let's set the initial prior at **P(H) = 40%**, representing a belief that the established trend had a reasonable chance of continuing, albeit with significant uncertainty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
-   **Similarities**: The key actors (major AI labs) and the fundamental goal of creating more powerful AI systems remain the same.
-   **Differences**: The core scientific and economic assumptions that drove the 2018-2022 trend have been overturned.
    1.  **Paradigm Shift**: The base rate is derived from the "bigger is better" era of dense model scaling. The current era operates under the "Chinchilla" scaling laws, which prioritize training smaller models on more data for compute-optimality.
    2.  **Architectural Shift**: The previous era's frontier models were dense. Today's frontier models (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude 3) are widely understood to be sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. This provides a more efficient path to increasing parameter count without a proportional increase in computational cost for inference. The question specifically requires a *dense* model.
    3.  **Time Horizon**: The question resolves in approximately one month (today is Nov 29, 2025). This is a critical difference, as a project of this magnitude would have a multi-year timeline.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H = "A 100T dense model is trained before 2026".

-   **Evidence 1: The "Chinchilla" Paper (March 2022)**. This paper demonstrated that massive dense models are a deeply inefficient use of compute.
    -   P(E1 | H) is very low. A lab would have to knowingly pursue a scientifically and economically suboptimal path.
    -   P(E1 | ~H) is very high. The paper's findings are the primary reason labs would abandon the pursuit of ever-larger dense models.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio**: Strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This evidence massively decreases the probability.

-   **Evidence 2: Industry-wide pivot to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (2023-present)**. All recent state-of-the-art models are believed to be sparse.
    -   P(E2 | H) is very low. It's unlikely the entire industry would move in one direction while a major player secretly pursued the opposite, less efficient path.
    -   P(E2 | ~H) is very high. MoE is the logical architectural evolution given the Chinchilla findings.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio**: Strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This evidence also massively decreases the probability.

-   **Evidence 3: Time remaining until resolution (~1 month) and lack of signals**. Training a 100T parameter model is a colossal undertaking, likely taking years and costing billions. There have been zero public announcements, credible leaks, or even rumors of such a project.
    -   P(E3 | H) is extremely low, approaching zero. For the event to happen, a multi-year secret project would have to be revealed in the next month.
    -   P(E3 | ~H) is extremely high (near 1). The absence of evidence is expected if no such project exists.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio**: Extremely favors ~H (<<< 1). This is the most conclusive piece of evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
-   **Prior Odds**: P(H) = 40% → 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.67
-   **Update Step 1 (Chinchilla & MoE pivot)**: The combined evidence of the new scaling paradigm and the industry's subsequent pivot away from dense models constitutes a massive downward update. A conservative likelihood ratio for this combined evidence might be 1/50.
    -   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.67 * (1/50) = 0.0134
    -   Updated Probability ≈ 0.0134 / (1 + 0.0134) ≈ 1.3%
-   **Update Step 2 (Time Horizon)**: The fact that we are one month from the deadline with zero signals is overwhelming evidence. The likelihood ratio here is exceptionally small, perhaps 1/100 or less.
    -   Final Odds ≈ 0.0134 * (1/100) = 0.000134
    -   **Final Probability** ≈ 0.000134 / (1 + 0.000134) ≈ 0.01%

The formal update drives the probability to a value very close to zero. The initial prior, based on a now-defunct trend, has been completely invalidated by subsequent events.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Alternative Scenario**: Could a nation-state be pursuing this as a secret "prestige" project, ignoring efficiency arguments? This is the most plausible "yes" scenario. A government might fund a massive project for strategic or propaganda purposes.
-   **Rebuttal**: Even for a nation-state, the opportunity cost would be immense. The required hardware (hundreds of thousands of top-tier GPUs/TPUs) and energy would be staggering, making it incredibly difficult to keep secret. Furthermore, the scientific community would likely view the achievement as a wasteful stunt rather than a genuine advance, diminishing its prestige value. The complete lack of any leaks or intelligence with one month to go makes this scenario extraordinarily improbable.
-   **Final Adjustment**: The probability is extremely low. A forecast of 1% seems appropriate to account for the tiny, non-zero possibility of a shocking last-minute revelation of a secret state-level project, or some other unforeseen "black swan" event.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial trend of exponential growth in dense model parameters has been decisively broken by a paradigm shift in AI research. The "Chinchilla" scaling laws demonstrated that building a 100T dense model would be a profoundly inefficient use of resources. The industry has since pivoted to more compute-efficient sparse architectures like Mixture-of-Experts. With only one month until the resolution date, the complete absence of any announcements, rumors, or leaks about such a massive, multi-year project makes a "Yes" outcome virtually impossible.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for this event—training a dense ML model with at least 100 trillion parameters before 2026—can be drawn from the historical trend of dense model parameter growth from 2018-2022, as outlined in the research report. During this period, the largest dense models scaled exponentially, from BERT (~340M parameters) in 2018 to Google's PaLM (540B) in 2022, representing roughly a 10x increase per year. Extrapolating naively from PaLM in 2022 would suggest ~5T in 2023, ~50T in 2024, ~500T in 2025, implying a high likelihood of reaching 100T by end-2025.

This reference class is chosen because it captures the "bigger is better" era of dense scaling, driven by labs like OpenAI and Google, before paradigm shifts. Historical data from sources like Epoch AI supports this growth rate during that window. However, this is a narrow reference class (only 4 years), prone to disruption, so I assign it a prior probability of 60% (or odds of 3:2), reflecting the naive extrapolation's 60-70% base rate from the report but tempered slightly for the trend's short history and known limitations like potential paradigm shifts (50-80% chance of disruption within 3 years).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the 2018-2022 base case in that AI labs continue to pursue scaling for performance gains, with compute resources still growing (e.g., via larger GPU clusters). Major players like OpenAI, Google, and DeepMind have the infrastructure and incentives to push boundaries, much like during the GPT-3/PaLM era.

However, it differs significantly in ways that lower the probability:
- **Paradigm shift post-Chinchilla (2022):** The base case assumed parameter count as the primary scaling lever, but Chinchilla's findings showed compute-optimal training favors more data over more parameters, making ultra-large dense models inefficient.
- **Architectural pivot:** SOTA models now are sparse (e.g., MoE like GPT-4, Gemini), unlike the dense focus of the base era.
- **Research focus:** Current trends emphasize agents, multimodality, and efficiency (per 2025 reports), not raw dense scaling.
- **Time constraint:** Only ~1 month remains until 2026, vs. the multi-year ramps in the base case. No public signals (announcements, leaks) exist, which would be expected for such a massive project.
These differences matter because they introduce economic, technical, and strategic barriers that weren't present in the base case, strongly disincentivizing a 100T dense model.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I'll evaluate key pieces of evidence from the background, research report, and my general knowledge as an LLM (e.g., trends up to 2023, extended by the report's 2025 updates). For each, I'll assess P(E | H) (likelihood if a 100T dense model is trained before 2026) vs. P(E | ~H) (if not), and the qualitative likelihood ratio (LR = P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)). LR >1 increases probability; LR <1 decreases it.

- **Chinchilla scaling laws (2022) and economic viability:** This evidence shows dense scaling beyond ~100B is compute-inefficient without massive data, costing billions inefficiently. P(E | H) is low (~10%) because pursuing this would ignore Chinchilla, requiring a prestige-driven override. P(E | ~H) is high (~90%) as it aligns with efficiency. LR ~0.11 (strong decrease).
  
- **Rise of sparse/MoE architectures (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Mixtral):** All recent SOTA models are sparse, per the 2023 State of AI Report and beyond. P(E | H) is moderate (~30%) if dense were still viable, but labs pivoted. P(E | ~H) is very high (~95%) as sparse offers better scaling. LR ~0.32 (moderate decrease).

- **Recent trends (2025 reports):** Focus on agents, multimodality, smaller/domain-specific models, no mention of dense scaling. P(E | H) is low (~20%) as this discourse would likely include hype for a 100T dense project. P(E | ~H) is high (~80%). LR ~0.25 (moderate decrease).

- **Short time horizon (~1 month left, no announcements):** No leaks or signals from labs/hardware suppliers. P(E | H) is very low (~5%) for a secretive, rushed project of this scale. P(E | ~H) is high (~99%) as silence fits abandonment. LR ~0.05 (strong decrease).

- **Technical hurdles (stability, hardware):** Training at 100T dense scale risks divergence and requires unsolved engineering. P(E | H) ~40% (possible with breakthroughs). P(E | ~H) ~70% (hurdles deter attempts). LR ~0.57 (slight decrease).

Net: All evidence decreases probability, with multiple strong downward factors (composite LR ~0.01-0.05 from multiplying rough estimates).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with prior odds of 3:2 (60% probability, or prior odds = 1.5).

Apply a composite likelihood ratio from the evidence. Conservatively aggregating the downward pressures (e.g., Chinchilla/economics LR=0.11, sparse pivot LR=0.32, trends LR=0.25, time/no signals LR=0.05, hurdles LR=0.57), the net LR is ~0.11 * 0.32 * 0.25 * 0.05 * 0.57 ≈ 0.00025 (very strong downward update).

Posterior odds = prior odds * LR = 1.5 * 0.00025 ≈ 0.000375 (or about 1:2667).

Posterior probability = posterior odds / (1 + posterior odds) ≈ 0.000375 / 1.000375 ≈ 0.0375% (rounding to ~0.04%).

This remains highly uncertain in the sense of tail risks (e.g., a secret project), but the evidence overwhelmingly shifts confidence toward "No," leaving the posterior near zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the downward update—I've aggregated multiple LRs multiplicatively, which could amplify if they're not independent (e.g., trends and sparse pivot overlap). Blind spots include underestimating nation-state actors (e.g., China pursuing prestige despite inefficiency) or a sudden breakthrough in dense training efficiency. Tail risks: A 1% chance of an unannounced project completing in the next month (e.g., via massive covert compute).

Best alternative forecast: 5-10% (arguing the prior should be higher at 70-80% due to unrelenting AI hype, and evidence less damning if sparse models hit limits). Rebuttal: This ignores the specific dense requirement and short timeline; no credible indicators support it. The related Metaculus question for any 100T model resolved Yes (likely sparse), but this is dense-specific, so the alternative overestimates.

Adjusting for this, I nudge up slightly to account for overconfidence, broadening to ~1% to cover tails without big swings (per calibration advice: small evidence-weighted updates).

Final: 1%
