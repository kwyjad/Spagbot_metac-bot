### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Supreme Court challenges to Presidential authority in foreign affairs/national security:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases like *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936) and *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), the Court affirmed broad executive power, even when statutory authority was ambiguous. A base rate derived from this class would suggest a high probability (perhaps 60-70%) of the President's actions being upheld, i.e., a "Tariffs lawful" ruling.
2.  **Recent Supreme Court cases involving the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** This modern doctrine holds that on issues of vast economic and political significance, an executive agency (or the President) must have clear, explicit authorization from Congress. In recent major cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *NFIB v. OSHA* (2022), the Court has used the MQD to strike down executive actions. This reference class suggests a very low probability (perhaps 10-20%) of the President's actions being upheld, favoring a "Tariffs unlawful" ruling.
3.  **Supreme Court rulings on challenges to Trump's first-term executive actions:** This class provides mixed results. The Court upheld the "travel ban" in *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), showing deference on national security. However, it blocked the attempt to rescind DACA (*Dept. of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of California*, 2020) on procedural grounds and rejected a citizenship question on the census. This suggests a roughly 50/50 split, with outcomes highly dependent on the specific legal questions.

Limitations: These base rates are conflicting, indicating that the specific legal arguments and the current Court's composition will be highly determinative. The unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariffs makes direct comparison difficult.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The entire scenario unfolds within the last 10 months, making all background information recent.
*   **2025-01-20:** Trump declares national emergency at the southern border under IEEPA. — (Neutral) — Establishes the initial legal predicate for tariffs.
*   **2025-02-01:** Trump expands the emergency and imposes "trafficking tariffs" on Mexico, Canada, and China. — (Neutral) — The first set of challenged actions.
*   **2025-04-02:** Trump declares a new emergency based on trade deficits and imposes "reciprocal tariffs." — (↓ for Lawful) — This action is on much weaker legal ground, stretching the definition of "emergency" and inviting an MQD challenge.
*   **2025-05-28:** Court of International Trade rules both sets of tariffs unlawful in *V.O.S. Selections*. — (↓ for Lawful) — First judicial rebuke, finding the tariffs don't "deal with" the threat.
*   **2025-05-29:** D.C. District Court rules tariffs unlawful in *Learning Resources*. — (↓ for Lawful) — Second judicial rebuke, on the more fundamental grounds that IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all.
*   **2025-08-29:** Federal Circuit affirms the *V.O.S. Selections* ruling. — (↓ for Lawful) — An appellate court, in a decisive 7-4 vote, agrees the tariffs are unlawful, strengthening the challengers' position.
*   **2025-09-09:** Supreme Court grants certiorari on an expedited basis. — (↓ for No 2025 ruling) — The Court's decision to move quickly makes a ruling by year-end highly probable and signals the issue's national importance.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine (MQD):** The current 6-3 conservative majority is highly skeptical of broad executive power grabs based on vague statutory language. Imposing a global tariff regime is a textbook "major question." This is the strongest driver toward an "Unlawful" or "Mixed" ruling. (Size: Large)
2.  **Judicial Deference in National Security:** The Court traditionally avoids second-guessing the President's national security determinations. The government will frame this as a national security issue (drugs, foreign threats). This is the primary driver for a "Lawful" ruling, though its power is diminished if the nexus is weak. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Textual Interpretation of IEEPA:** The core legal debate will be whether IEEPA's power to "regulate" imports includes the power to impose tariffs (a tax). A textualist-originalist court may find that the power to tax is exclusively Congress's and was not clearly delegated. This likely favors the challengers. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Severability of the Tariffs:** The "trafficking tariffs" have a more plausible (though still debatable) link to a national emergency than the "reciprocal tariffs" based on trade deficits. This creates a clear path for the Court to strike down one set but not the other, leading to a "Mixed ruling." (Size: Large)
5.  **Chief Justice Roberts' Institutionalism:** Roberts may seek a narrow ruling that resolves the case without creating a seismic shift in law (e.g., reviving the non-delegation doctrine). A narrow statutory ruling that the tariffs don't "deal with" the threat, or that the reciprocal tariffs are unlawful, would fit this pattern. This favors "Unlawful" or "Mixed" over a broad "Lawful" ruling. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Scope of IEEPA Use:** Unlike past IEEPA actions targeting specific countries or entities (e.g., Iran, terrorist groups), these tariffs are economy-wide, affecting nearly all U.S. trade. This scale invites heightened judicial scrutiny.
*   **Weak Nexus for Reciprocal Tariffs:** The justification of a "national emergency" based on trade deficits is legally novel and tenuous compared to traditional threats like war, terrorism, or hostage crises. This weakens the government's appeal to national security deference.
*   **Ascendancy of the Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's jurisprudence has shifted significantly in the last decade. Precedents granting broad deference (like *Dames & Moore*) were decided before the MQD became a primary tool for reining in the executive.
*   **Unanimity of Lower Court Outcomes:** While their reasoning differed, three separate courts (CIT, D.D.C., Fed. Cir.) all concluded the tariffs were unlawful. This signals a strong legal consensus against the government's position that the Supreme Court will have to overcome.
*   **Expedited Schedule:** The case is moving from petition to argument in under three months. This urgency underscores the massive economic disruption and makes a non-ruling or punt ("Other" or "No 2025 ruling") extremely unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on historical deference to the executive in foreign affairs, but with high uncertainty. E.g., Lawful (40%), Unlawful (30%), Mixed (20%), Other/No Ruling (10%). Equivalent n=4.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) The unprecedented scope of the tariffs and the weak justification for the "reciprocal" set strongly engage the Major Questions Doctrine, significantly reducing the odds of a full "Lawful" ruling. (Magnitude: Large)
    *   (↓) The unanimity of lower court rulings against the tariffs, including a decisive appellate decision, provides a strong signal of legal vulnerability. (Magnitude: Moderate)
    *   (↑ for Mixed) The clear distinction between the two types of tariffs provides the Court an obvious off-ramp to split the difference, upholding the more security-related tariffs while striking down the purely economic ones. (Magnitude: Large)
    *   (↓ for No 2025 ruling) The Court's grant of expedited review makes a delay past Dec 31, 2025 highly improbable. (Magnitude: Large)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes probability away from "Tariffs lawful" and "No 2025 ruling." The posterior should be heavily concentrated on "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling," with "Mixed ruling" emerging as a very strong contender due to the severability of the tariff schemes.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring "Lawful" or "Mixed"):**
    *   Oral argument questions from conservative justices (esp. Kavanaugh, Barrett) focusing on the President's unique Article II foreign affairs powers and the history of IEEPA.
    *   Questions from the bench expressing skepticism about the judiciary's role in reviewing national emergency declarations.
    *   Amicus briefs

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to evaluate the probabilities for each option.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to the President in matters of national security and foreign affairs, suggesting a base rate of around 60-70% for upholding executive actions. However, the Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) and recent trends in limiting executive power suggest a lower base rate. Let's start with 40% for "Tariffs lawful."
  
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The MQD and recent rulings against executive overreach suggest a higher base rate for striking down the tariffs. Given the unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs, a base rate of 30% seems reasonable.

- **Mixed ruling**: The possibility of the Court distinguishing between different types of tariffs (e.g., security-related vs. economic) suggests a base rate of 20% for a mixed ruling.

- **Other ruling**: Given the expedited schedule and the importance of the case, the likelihood of a procedural dismissal or other non-merits ruling is low. A base rate of 5% is appropriate.

- **No 2025 ruling**: The expedited schedule makes it unlikely that the Court will not rule by the end of 2025. A base rate of 5% reflects this low probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The case involves presidential authority in foreign affairs, similar to past cases where the Court has shown deference.

- **Differences**: The unprecedented scope of the tariffs and the weak justification for the "reciprocal" tariffs engage the MQD, which is a significant departure from past cases.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Unprecedented Scope**: The broad application of tariffs under IEEPA is likely to be viewed unfavorably under the MQD, decreasing the likelihood of a "Lawful" ruling.

- **Lower Court Rulings**: The unanimous decisions against the tariffs in lower courts strongly suggest a legal consensus against the tariffs, decreasing the likelihood of a "Lawful" ruling.

- **Severability**: The distinction between trafficking and reciprocal tariffs provides a pathway for a mixed ruling, increasing the likelihood of a "Mixed ruling."

- **Expedited Schedule**: The Court's decision to expedite the case decreases the likelihood of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs lawful**: Start with prior odds of 40%. The evidence (unprecedented scope, lower court rulings) significantly decreases this probability. Posterior probability: 15%.

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Start with prior odds of 30%. The evidence (unanimous lower court rulings, MQD) increases this probability. Posterior probability: 40%.

- **Mixed ruling**: Start with prior odds of 20%. The evidence (severability of tariffs) increases this probability. Posterior probability: 35%.

- **Other ruling**: Start with prior odds of 5%. The expedited schedule and importance of the case decrease this probability. Posterior probability: 5%.

- **No 2025 ruling**: Start with prior odds of 5%. The expedited schedule decreases this probability. Posterior probability: 5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence**: Consider the possibility that the Court may find a novel legal argument to uphold the tariffs, or that procedural issues could lead to an "Other ruling."

- **Tail Risks**: The Court could issue a narrow ruling that doesn't fit neatly into the given categories, but the likelihood remains low.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- Tariffs lawful: 15%
- Tariffs unlawful: 40%
- Mixed ruling: 35%
- Other ruling: 5%
- No 2025 ruling: 5%

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 15%  
Tariffs unlawful: 40%  
Mixed ruling: 35%  
Other ruling: 5%  
No 2025 ruling: 5%

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Tariffs lawful (20%)**: 
- Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security (e.g., Trump v. Hawaii upholding the travel ban).
- IEEPA grants the President broad powers during declared national emergencies.

**Tariffs unlawful (40%)**:
- Recent Supreme Court jurisprudence has increasingly limited executive power through the Major Questions Doctrine.
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against these tariffs (Court of International Trade, DC District Court, and Federal Circuit).

**Mixed ruling (30%)**:
- The Court often seeks compromise positions, especially in politically charged cases.
- The two sets of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) have different legal justifications, creating a natural dividing line.

**Other ruling (5%)**:
- Procedural dismissals are rare when the Court grants certiorari on expedited review.
- The Court typically reaches the merits when it takes cases of national importance.

**No 2025 ruling (5%)**:
- The expedited schedule (argument in November 2025) makes a ruling by December 2025 highly likely.
- The economic importance creates pressure for a timely decision.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other national security cases, the government argues for deference to executive judgment.
- Like other Major Questions Doctrine cases, this involves executive action with vast economic consequences.

**Key differences:**
- The scope of these tariffs is unprecedented under IEEPA, affecting global trade rather than targeted sanctions.
- The "national emergency" justification for reciprocal tariffs (trade deficits) stretches the concept beyond traditional security threats.
- The unanimity of lower court rulings against the tariffs (on different legal grounds) is unusual and significant.
- The expedited review schedule signals the Court recognizes the exceptional economic importance.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Lower courts unanimously ruled against the tariffs (P(E|H) high for "Unlawful", low for "Lawful").
- The Federal Circuit's 7-4 decision crossed partisan lines, suggesting legal rather than political reasoning.
- The reciprocal tariffs' justification (trade deficits as "emergency") is legally tenuous under IEEPA's text.
- The Major Questions Doctrine has been consistently applied by the current Court to limit executive power.

**Evidence favoring "Mixed ruling":**
- The two tariff schemes have different justifications - trafficking tariffs have a stronger security nexus.
- The Court of International Trade distinguished between the tariffs not "dealing with" the threat vs. exceeding authority.
- The Court often seeks narrower rulings that decide the case without sweeping constitutional pronouncements.

**Evidence favoring "Tariffs lawful":**
- IEEPA's text grants broad authority to "regulate" commerce during emergencies.
- National security deference remains a strong judicial tradition.
- The conservative majority may be sympathetic to presidential authority under a Republican administration.

**Evidence against "No 2025 ruling" or "Other ruling":**
- The Court granted expedited review with arguments in November 2025.
- All parties (government and challengers) agree on the need for quick resolution.
- The economic disruption from uncertainty would be enormous.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my priors:
- Tariffs lawful: 20%
- Tariffs unlawful: 40%
- Mixed ruling: 30%
- Other ruling: 5%
- No 2025 ruling: 5%

Let's update based on the unanimous lower court rulings:
- P(Unanimous lower court rulings | Tariffs lawful) = 0.2 (unlikely if the legal case were strong)
- P(Unanimous lower court rulings | Tariffs unlawful) = 0.8 (likely if the legal case is weak)
- P(Unanimous lower court rulings | Mixed ruling) = 0.5 (moderately likely)

Applying Bayes' rule for "Tariffs lawful":
- Prior odds = 0.2/(1-0.2) = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio = 0.2/0.65 ≈ 0.31 (weighted average of other likelihoods)
- Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.31 ≈ 0.08
- Posterior probability ≈ 7.4%

For "Tariffs unlawful":
- Prior odds = 0.4/(1-0.4) = 0.67
- Likelihood ratio = 0.8/0.35 ≈ 2.29
- Posterior odds = 0.67 × 2.29 ≈ 1.53
- Posterior probability ≈ 60.5%

For "Mixed ruling":
- Prior odds = 0.3/(1-0.3) = 0.43
- Likelihood ratio = 0.5/0.5 = 1
- Posterior odds = 0.43 × 1 = 0.43
- Posterior probability ≈ 30%

Now updating based on the expedited review schedule:
- This strongly reduces "No 2025 ruling" from 5% to approximately 2%
- "Other ruling" remains at approximately 2% given the Court's likely desire to resolve the merits

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Court's deference to executive authority in foreign affairs.
- The Court's textualist majority might find that IEEPA's language does authorize tariffs.
- I might be overweighting lower court decisions; the Supreme Court reverses many cases it takes.

**Alternative forecast:**
- A plausible alternative would give more weight to "Mixed ruling" (perhaps 45-50%) and less to "Tariffs unlawful" (35-40%).
- This would recognize that the Court often seeks compromise positions that avoid sweeping pronouncements.
- The clear distinction between the trafficking tariffs (stronger security nexus) and reciprocal tariffs (weaker justification) provides a natural dividing line.

**Tail risks:**
- The case could become moot if Trump withdraws the tariffs before decision (though unlikely given the expedited schedule).
- The Court could issue a ruling that doesn't cleanly fit the resolution criteria (e.g., remanding on narrow grounds).

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly to increase the probability of a mixed ruling.

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing my probabilities:

- Tariffs lawful: 8%
- Tariffs unlawful: 53%
- Mixed ruling: 35%
- Other ruling: 2%
- No 2025 ruling: 2%

Sum: 100%

## 7. Final Forecast

Tariffs lawful: 8%
Tariffs unlawful: 53%
Mixed ruling: 35%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 2%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider three relevant reference classes for Supreme Court cases involving challenges to presidential authority:

1.  **Historical Deference in Foreign Affairs:** Historically, in cases like *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.*, the Supreme Court has granted the President significant deference in foreign policy and national security matters. This reference class would suggest a high probability (perhaps 60-70%) that the President's actions are upheld ("Tariffs lawful").
2.  **Recent Major Questions Doctrine (MQD) Cases:** In the last decade, the Court has increasingly used the MQD to strike down executive actions of vast economic and political significance that lack clear congressional authorization (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*). This reference class suggests a very low probability (perhaps 10-20%) of the tariffs being upheld, strongly favoring "Tariffs unlawful."
3.  **Rulings on Trump's First-Term Actions:** The Court's record on challenges to the first Trump administration was mixed. It upheld the travel ban (*Trump v. Hawaii*) but struck down the DACA rescission and the census citizenship question. This suggests a more uncertain, roughly 50/50 outcome depending on the specific legal questions.

Synthesizing these conflicting base rates, the most relevant is the modern MQD jurisprudence, as it reflects the current Court's thinking. However, the foreign affairs context cannot be ignored. This leads to a diffuse prior with a slight edge to "Tariffs unlawful" due to the MQD's prominence.

*   **Initial Prior:**
    *   Tariffs lawful: 30%
    *   Tariffs unlawful: 40%
    *   Mixed ruling: 20%
    *   Other ruling: 5%
    *   No 2025 ruling: 5%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case has several unique features that distinguish it from the general base rate scenarios:

*   **Similarities:** The case presents a classic separation-of-powers conflict over the scope of authority delegated by Congress to the President.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Unprecedented Scope:** The use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose a near-global tariff regime is a far broader application than its historical use against specific state actors or terrorist groups. This scale makes an MQD challenge more potent.
    *   **Weak Justification:** The declaration of a "national emergency" based on trade deficits is legally tenuous and weakens the government's appeal for traditional national security deference.
    *   **Severability:** The existence of two distinct tariff regimes—the "trafficking tariffs" and the "reciprocal tariffs"—creates a clear opportunity for the Court to issue a split decision, making the "Mixed ruling" option more plausible than in a case with a single challenged action.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence from the provided background:

*   **Evidence 1: Unanimous Lower Court Rulings Against the Tariffs.** Three different courts (Court of International Trade, D.C. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) have ruled the tariffs unlawful.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence is much more likely if the tariffs are indeed unlawful (P(E | Unlawful) is high) than if they are lawful (P(E | Lawful) is low). While the Supreme Court often reverses lower courts, a consensus of this nature signals significant legal weaknesses in the government's position. This evidence strongly pushes probability *away* from "Tariffs lawful."

*   **Evidence 2: The Existence of Two Distinct Tariff Regimes.** The case involves both "trafficking tariffs" (with a colorable national security nexus) and "reciprocal tariffs" (with a much weaker economic justification).
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This factual predicate makes a "Mixed ruling" a very viable judicial path. The likelihood of this evidence existing is high under any outcome, but it specifically *enables* a mixed ruling. It provides an "off-ramp" for the Court to curb the most extreme assertion of power without completely stripping the President of authority under IEEPA. This evidence increases the probability of "Mixed ruling" relative to the other options.

*   **Evidence 3: The Supreme Court Granted Expedited Review.** The Court agreed to hear the case on a fast-tracked schedule, with arguments in November 2025.
    *   **Likelihood Assessment:** This action is extremely likely if the Court intends to issue a merits ruling in 2025 (P(E | Lawful/Unlawful/Mixed) is high). It is extremely *unlikely* if the Court does not plan to rule in 2025 (P(E | No 2025 ruling) is very low). This evidence strongly shifts probability away from "No 2025 ruling" and, to a lesser extent, "Other ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's walk through the updates conceptually:

1.  **Start with the Prior:** Lawful (30%), Unlawful (40%), Mixed (20%), Other (5%), No Ruling (5%).
2.  **Apply Evidence 3 (Expedited Review):** This is the strongest signal against delay. The probability for "No 2025 ruling" should collapse to a minimal tail risk (e.g., 1%). The probability for "Other ruling" (a procedural punt) also decreases (e.g., to 3%). The reclaimed probability mass (~6%) is redistributed among the three merits outcomes.
    *   *Intermediate probabilities (approx.):* Lawful (32%), Unlawful (42%), Mixed (22%), Other (3%), No Ruling (1%).
3.  **Apply Evidence 1 & 2 (Lower Court Losses & Weak Justification):** This is powerful evidence against a complete victory for the government. The MQD argument against the reciprocal tariffs is particularly strong. This significantly lowers the probability of "Tariffs lawful." The prior odds of Lawful vs. (Unlawful or Mixed) were about 32:64, or 1:2. This evidence easily doubles the odds against "Lawful," pushing its probability down to the ~15-20% range.
4.  **Reallocate Probability:** The probability taken from "Lawful" must be reallocated. The existence of two distinct tariff regimes makes the "Mixed ruling" option a very attractive and judicially prudent path. It allows the Court to apply the MQD to the weaker economic tariffs while preserving some presidential deference on the security-related ones. Therefore, a large portion of the probability from "Lawful" should shift to "Mixed ruling," with the remainder going to "Tariffs unlawful." This makes "Unlawful" and "Mixed" the two leading contenders.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary analysis points to "Unlawful" or "Mixed" as the most likely outcomes. A key risk is underestimating the weight the Court's conservative majority might place on the President's Article II powers in foreign affairs, potentially viewing IEEPA as a broad delegation that is exempt from the normal MQD analysis applied to domestic agencies. This is the government's best hope for a "Lawful" ruling. While I assess this as unlikely, it is not impossible, justifying a probability in the mid-teens. The "Mixed ruling" option is a robust scenario because it allows the Court to balance these competing principles—reining in executive overreach on one hand while showing deference on national security on the other. The "Unlawful" option is also very strong, as the Court could simply find that IEEPA's text does not authorize tariffs at all, invalidating both schemes. The probabilities assigned reflect the close competition between these two plausible outcomes.

### 6. Final Normalization

After weighing the priors and the evidence, I arrive at the following normalized probabilities:

*   **Tariffs unlawful:** The strongest single option, reflecting the powerful legal arguments against the tariffs and the consensus of the lower courts.
*   **Mixed ruling:** A very close second, reflecting the high plausibility of a judicial compromise that splits the two distinct tariff regimes.
*   **Tariffs lawful:** A distant third, representing the chance that the Court prioritizes broad executive power in foreign affairs over recent doctrinal trends like the MQD.
*   **Other/No ruling:** Small tail risks, made highly unlikely by the Court's decision to expedite the case.

The final probabilities are adjusted to sum to 100%.

---
Tariffs lawful: 16%
Tariffs unlawful: 44%
Mixed ruling: 36%
Other ruling: 3%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
