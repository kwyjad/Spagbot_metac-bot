### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US government taking equity stakes in healthy, non-financial companies as proactive industrial policy.** This is the most specific and relevant class. Historically, the US government has avoided taking ownership stakes in healthy private companies as a tool of industrial policy. Such actions are extremely rare, bordering on unprecedented outside of wartime mobilization.
    *   **Base Rate:** <1% chance in any given year for a specific sector. This is derived from the near-total absence of such events in post-WWII US history.
    *   **Limitations:** This reference class has very few data points, making the base rate an estimate based on absence. The current political environment and the specific CHIPS Act context may be unique.

2.  **US government taking equity stakes in major private corporations under any condition.** This class includes crisis-driven interventions like the 2008-2009 bailouts of the financial (TARP) and automotive industries (GM, Chrysler). These were responses to imminent systemic collapse or bankruptcy, not proactive policy.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~1-2% chance in any given year. This is derived by noting that such major interventions have occurred roughly once every 20-30 years, but are clustered in crisis periods. Averaging over time gives a low annualized rate.
    *   **Limitations:** The conditions are fundamentally different. The semiconductor firms are not failing; they are being incentivized. The legal and political justification for a bailout does not apply here.

3.  **Major changes to the terms of large, Congressionally-authorized federal grant/subsidy programs after funds have been allocated.** This class looks at the stability of government-business agreements. It is uncommon for the executive branch to unilaterally and fundamentally alter the nature of a multi-billion dollar program from grants to equity purchases after it is already underway.
    *   **Base Rate:** Low, perhaps 5-10% for a given major program. Changes happen, but usually through new legislation or lengthy rule-making, not rapid shifts in deal structure for individual recipients.
    *   **Limitations:** This class doesn't specifically address equity stakes, but rather the stability of the policy framework itself.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-08-28] Intel receives $5.7B in exchange for a 10% equity stake. — ↑ — Establishes a powerful, concrete precedent and demonstrates the administration's capability and willingness to execute this policy.
*   [2025-08-25] Trump administration vows to target other semiconductor companies for similar deals. — ↑ — Signals clear intent to apply the Intel model more broadly, explicitly naming potential targets.
*   [2025-08-21] TSMC states it would consider returning subsidies if equity terms are imposed. — ↓ — Demonstrates that key companies have leverage and are willing to push back forcefully, potentially scuttling deals.
*   [2025-08-21] US Trade Secretary Lutnick clarifies the policy will not apply to TSMC and Micron. — ↓ — A significant walk-back. It shows the administration is responsive to pressure and may not apply the policy universally, reducing the number of potential targets under this question.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **President Trump's "Deal-Maker" Ideology:** The administration views itself as transactional and believes the government should get a direct financial return on its investments, rather than just subsidies. This is the primary driver for the policy shift. (Size: Large)
2.  **The Intel Precedent:** The successful deal with Intel creates a template and political momentum. It makes it easier to justify and structure subsequent deals and harder for other companies to argue they should be treated differently. (Size: Large)
3.  **Company Resistance & Leverage:** Target companies, especially foreign ones like Samsung and TSMC, are not desperate. They have other options and can resist terms they see as unfavorable (e.g., IP risk, shareholder dilution). TSMC's public threat was highly effective. (Size: Large)
4.  **Bureaucratic & Timeline Constraints:** Negotiating and finalizing an equity acquisition is a complex legal and financial process. Given the ~2.5 month horizon until 2026, completing such a deal with a new company is highly challenging, especially with holidays approaching. (Size: Large)
5.  **Foreign Government Influence:** A deal with Samsung would involve the South Korean government. They may object to the US government taking a stake in one of their national champions, adding a layer of diplomatic complexity. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Remaining Targets' Need for Capital:** The remaining companies (Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Microchip) still need CHIPS funding for their US expansion plans. This gives the administration leverage to compel them to accept terms they might otherwise reject. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proactive vs. Reactive Policy:** Unlike the TARP or auto bailouts (the main reference for USG equity), this is not a crisis response. The government is using its leverage proactively to shape industrial policy and secure a financial return, not to prevent collapse.
*   **Healthy Target Companies:** The semiconductor firms are profitable and strategically vital, not failing. This fundamentally changes the negotiating dynamic; they have more leverage than a company facing bankruptcy.
*   **Unconventional Executive Actor:** The Trump administration's preference for bespoke, transactional "deals" over established bureaucratic processes is a major departure from the norm that produced the low base rate.
*   **Foreign-Owned Targets:** Two of the key companies (Samsung, TSMC) are foreign-owned. US government ownership in them is far more complex legally and diplomatically than in a domestic firm like GM or Intel.
*   **Specific Legislative Vehicle:** The policy is being implemented through the CHIPS Act, a specific, pre-existing funding vehicle. The administration is re-interpreting its mandate rather than seeking new Congressional authority.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 2-5%) based on the historical rarity of the US government taking equity in healthy firms. The reference class is small, so the prior is not very strong (equivalent n of ~20-30).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Intel deal precedent: ↑ Large (proves feasibility and intent)
    *   Trump's public vow: ↑ Moderate (reinforces intent)
    *   Lutnick's clarification exempting TSMC/Micron: ↓ Large (halves the pool of key targets and shows a willingness to back down)
    *   Extremely short timeline (<2.5 months): ↓ Large (major practical barrier to completing a complex deal)
    *   Remaining targets (Samsung, GF) still in play: ↑ Small (maintains some possibility)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence pushes in both directions strongly. The Intel deal dramatically increased the probability from the historical baseline. However, the subsequent walk-back for two major companies and the severe time constraint act as powerful counterweights. The posterior should be moderately higher than the very low prior, but likely remain well under 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Leaks or official reports of active equity negotiations between the Commerce Dept. and Samsung, GlobalFoundries, or Microchip.
    *   President Trump or Secretary Lutnick publicly naming one of the remaining companies as the next target for an equity deal.
    *   A company's SEC filings mentioning potential equity issuance to the US government as a condition of CHIPS funding.
    *   Establishment of a new government entity or team within the Commerce Department to manage public equity stakes.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official statements from the administration further clarifying that the equity policy was unique to Intel or will not be applied to other firms.
    *   Public statements from Samsung, GlobalFoundries, or Microchip executives explicitly rejecting the possibility of an equity deal.
    *   Announcements of CHIPS funding for these companies structured as traditional grants, loans, or guarantees, with no mention of equity.
    *   Key administration officials involved in the Intel deal (e.g., Lutnick) resigning or being reassigned.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Actor Unpredictability:** The administration's decision-making is highly personalized and can be impulsive. A sudden decision to force a deal cannot be ruled out, even if it seems impractical.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity of "Acquire":** The question resolves on whether the government "acquires stock." This could be interpreted as the moment an agreement is signed or the moment shares are formally transferred. A deal could be announced in December 2025 but not legally finalized until January 2026, creating ambiguity. The latter interpretation (formal transfer) makes a "Yes" resolution less likely.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** These negotiations would be highly confidential. The public is unlikely to learn of a deal until it is announced, leaving little time for indicators to emerge.
*   **Timeline Crunch:** The ~10-week window before 2026 is a severe constraint. Any minor delay in negotiations could easily push the final acquisition past the deadline. The holiday season in late December will further slow bureaucratic processes.

**Final Research Summary:** The administration has demonstrated both the intent and capability to take equity stakes via the Intel deal. However, strong resistance from other key players has already forced a partial retreat, and the extremely short timeline presents a formidable practical barrier to finalizing another complex deal before 2026.

To forecast the probability of the US government acquiring stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the US government taking equity stakes in healthy, non-financial companies as a proactive industrial policy. Historically, this is extremely rare, with a base rate of <1% per year for a specific sector. This is because the US government typically avoids taking ownership stakes in healthy private companies outside of crisis situations.
   - Initial prior: Let's start with a base rate of 2% to account for the unique political environment and the specific context of the CHIPS Act.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves the US government potentially taking equity stakes in healthy companies, which aligns with the base case.
   - Differences: The Trump administration's proactive industrial policy approach and the precedent set by the Intel deal are significant departures from historical norms. The semiconductor companies are not in financial distress, which changes the dynamics compared to past government interventions.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Intel Deal Precedent**: The successful deal with Intel increases the likelihood of similar deals occurring. Likelihood ratio: High (increases probability).
   - **Trump's Public Vow**: Reinforces the administration's intent to pursue similar deals. Likelihood ratio: Moderate (increases probability).
   - **Lutnick's Clarification**: Exempting TSMC and Micron reduces the pool of potential targets. Likelihood ratio: High (decreases probability).
   - **Short Timeline**: The limited time before 2026 is a significant barrier to completing complex deals. Likelihood ratio: High (decreases probability).
   - **Remaining Targets' Need for Capital**: Samsung, GlobalFoundries, and Microchip still need CHIPS funding, which maintains some possibility. Likelihood ratio: Low (slightly increases probability).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 2% = 0.02 / 0.98 = 0.0204
   - Evidence from Intel deal and Trump's vow increases odds, while Lutnick's clarification and timeline constraints decrease them.
   - Let's assume the net effect of evidence results in a moderate increase to the prior odds, reflecting the mixed signals.
   - Posterior odds: 0.0204 × 1.5 (net effect of evidence) = 0.0306
   - Posterior probability: 0.0306 / (1 + 0.0306) ≈ 2.97%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the administration's ability to push through deals quickly, despite the timeline.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden political or economic shift could increase the urgency for such deals, raising the probability.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slight increase to account for potential unforeseen developments or rapid decision-making by the administration.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability is slightly adjusted upwards to reflect the possibility of rapid developments.

Final: 4%

# Will the US government acquire stock in any of the selected semiconductor companies before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the US government acquiring stock in any of the specified semiconductor companies (Micron, TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries, or Microchip Technology) before 2026, which is about 2.5 months away.

The most relevant reference class is "US government taking equity stakes in healthy, non-financial companies as proactive industrial policy." This is extremely rare in US history outside of wartime mobilization or financial crises.

**Base Rate: 5%**

I'm selecting this low base rate because:
- The US government rarely takes equity stakes in healthy private companies
- When it has occurred (like 2008-2009 bailouts), it was during financial crises, not as proactive industrial policy
- The specific action of converting subsidies to equity stakes in semiconductor companies has almost no historical precedent

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The semiconductor industry is strategically important but not in crisis
- The companies in question are generally healthy and profitable
- There are significant political and legal hurdles to government ownership

**Key differences that matter:**
- The Trump administration has already executed one such deal with Intel, creating a precedent
- The administration has explicitly stated its intention to pursue similar deals with other companies
- The CHIPS Act provides a specific funding vehicle that can be repurposed
- The timeline is extremely short (only 2.5 months until 2026)
- Two major companies (TSMC and Micron) have already been explicitly exempted

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Intel deal completed (August 28, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If the government will acquire stock in other companies, the Intel precedent would almost certainly exist
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - The government might do a one-off deal with Intel but no others
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.2
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump administration's stated intention to target other semiconductor companies**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Public statements of intent would be expected
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Political rhetoric doesn't always translate to action
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.25
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 3: TSMC and Micron explicitly exempted (August 21, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Exempting major players reduces the likelihood of other deals
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Exemptions suggest the policy is being scaled back
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.375
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeline (2.5 months until 2026)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Complex equity deals typically take many months
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Time constraints make completing a deal unlikely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on Intel deal:**
- Prior odds: 1:19 (5%)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.2
- Posterior odds: 3.2:19 = 0.168:1
- Posterior probability: 0.168/(1+0.168) ≈ 14.4%

**Update on stated intentions:**
- Prior odds: 0.168:1 (14.4%)
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.378:1
- Posterior probability: 0.378/(1+0.378) ≈ 27.4%

**Update on TSMC/Micron exemptions:**
- Prior odds: 0.378:1 (27.4%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 0.142:1
- Posterior probability: 0.142/(1+0.142) ≈ 12.4%

**Update on timeline constraints:**
- Prior odds: 0.142:1 (12.4%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 0.031:1
- Posterior probability: 0.031/(1+0.031) ≈ 3.0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the Trump administration's ability to fast-track deals when motivated
- The definition of "acquiring stock" could include preliminary agreements that are signed before 2026 but executed later
- There could be ongoing negotiations with Samsung or Global Foundries that aren't public yet
- The administration might prioritize getting at least one more deal done before year-end for political reasons

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The administration could announce a deal in principle with Samsung in December, with formal acquisition in early 2026
- A smaller company like Microchip Technology might accept equity terms quickly to secure funding
- The administration could create a special-purpose vehicle to streamline the acquisition process

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability slightly upward from 3.0% to account for the possibility of fast-tracked deals or announcements that technically qualify before 2026. However, the time constraint remains extremely significant.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I arrive at a final probability of 7%. This reflects:
- The established precedent with Intel
- The stated intentions of the administration
- The significant counterevidence of exemptions for major players
- The severe time constraint of only 2.5 months
- The possibility of unexpected fast-tracking or alternative deal structures

Final: 7%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of the US government taking equity stakes in healthy, non-financial companies as a tool of proactive industrial policy. Historically, this is exceptionally rare. Outside of wartime or imminent systemic collapse (like the 2008 financial and auto bailouts), the US government has consistently avoided direct ownership of private industry. This suggests a historical base rate of well under 1% for such an event occurring in any given sector in a given year.

However, the background information includes a crucial event: the US government *has already taken a 10% stake in Intel* under this exact policy framework. This single event fundamentally changes the context. It proves the administration's willingness and capability to execute such a policy. Therefore, the historical base rate is less relevant than a new, conditional prior: "Given the administration has just set a precedent with Intel, what is the probability they extend this policy to another company in the same program?"

This new situation is much closer to a 50/50 proposition. The administration has shown clear intent, but extending a controversial policy is not guaranteed. I will set the prior probability at **40%**. This reflects the strong positive evidence of the Intel deal and the administration's stated intent, balanced against the inherent difficulties of repeating such an unconventional action.

Prior Odds: 40% probability corresponds to odds of 0.40 / 0.60 = 2:3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The legal and bureaucratic frameworks for government-corporate dealings remain largely the same. The target companies are healthy, publicly-traded corporations with fiduciary duties to their shareholders, making them inherently resistant to government ownership.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the specific political actor (the Trump administration) and its transactional approach, which deviates significantly from the norm that established the low historical base rate. The existence of the CHIPS Act provides a unique pool of funds and leverage. Most importantly, the Intel deal serves as a powerful, immediate precedent, moving the situation from "unprecedented" to "a potential repeat of a recent action."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will update the 40% prior based on events that occurred after the initial policy was demonstrated with Intel.

*   **Evidence 1: Strong pushback from TSMC and a subsequent policy clarification exempting TSMC and Micron.**
    *   This is the most significant piece of evidence. It demonstrates that the administration's power is not absolute and that targeted companies (especially major foreign ones) have significant leverage to resist. The government's public walk-back for two of the five named companies is a major concession.
    *   P(E | H): How likely is the government to publicly exempt two major targets if it still intends to acquire stock in one of the remaining three? This is plausible as a strategic retreat—sacrificing difficult targets to focus on easier ones. Let's estimate P(E | H) at 0.3.
    *   P(E | ~H): How likely is the government to issue this exemption if it has abandoned the policy extension? Very likely. This would be the primary way to signal a return to the status quo and de-escalate the conflict. Let's estimate P(E | ~H) at 0.9.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** (0.3 / 0.9) = 1/3. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The extremely short timeline.**
    *   The deadline is January 1, 2026, which is approximately 10.5 weeks from the current date (October 17, 2025). This period includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which significantly slow corporate and governmental work.
    *   Negotiating and finalizing a multi-billion dollar equity acquisition is a highly complex legal and financial process. The timeline presents a formidable practical barrier.
    *   This evidence acts as a strong feasibility filter. Let's frame it as a likelihood.
    *   P(E | H): How likely is it that a deal, if it were to happen, would be finalized in this short 10.5-week window? This would require negotiations to be already at a very advanced stage. This is possible, but unlikely. Let's estimate P(E | H) at 0.2.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no deal is going to happen, the short timeline is irrelevant. P(E | ~H) is effectively 1.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** (0.2 / 1.0) = 0.2. This evidence also very strongly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will now update the prior odds using the likelihood ratios.

*   **Prior Odds:** 2:3
*   **Update with Evidence 1 (Exemptions):**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio 1
    *   Posterior Odds = (2:3) × (1/3) = 2:9
*   **Update with Evidence 2 (Timeline):**
    *   Final Odds = Posterior Odds × Likelihood Ratio 2
    *   Final Odds = (2:9) × (0.2) = (2:9) × (1/5) = 2:45

*   **Final Probability:**
    *   Final Probability = Final Odds / (1 + Final Odds)
    *   Final Probability = 2 / (2 + 45) = 2 / 47 ≈ 4.25%

This formal update results in a very low probability. I will round this up slightly to account for uncertainties in my likelihood estimates. A probability in the high single digits seems more appropriate. Let's say the timeline constraint's LR was closer to 0.4, which would yield Final Odds of 2:22.5, or a probability of 2/24.5 ≈ 8%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis points to a low probability. What could make this wrong?

*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (My forecast is too low):** The biggest blind spot is the possibility of secret, advanced negotiations. A deal with GlobalFoundries (a US-based company, likely with less leverage than TSMC or Samsung) could have been negotiated in parallel with Intel's and may be nearly complete. If so, the timeline is not a barrier. The administration might be highly motivated to announce another deal to prove the Intel case was not a one-off. This scenario, while speculative, is plausible and could mean the true probability is in the 15-25% range.

*   **Argument for a Lower Probability (My forecast is too high):** The public walk-back on TSMC and Micron may have signaled a complete abandonment of the equity-for-subsidy policy. The political and diplomatic blowback might have been judged too severe, and the administration may have reverted to providing standard grants and loans for the remaining companies. In this case, the probability is near zero.

*   **Adjustment:** The formal Bayesian update resulted in a probability of ~4-8%. The red team analysis highlights the significant upside risk of a nearly-completed secret deal. To account for this primary alternative scenario, I will adjust my final forecast upward from the calculated result. A probability of 15% seems like a reasonable balance, acknowledging that while the publicly available evidence points to "No," the potential for unobserved factors in these confidential negotiations is significant.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial precedent set by the Intel deal dramatically increased the possibility of the US government taking further equity stakes. However, subsequent evidence has been strongly negative. The administration's public retreat on the policy for TSMC and Micron shows that powerful companies can successfully resist, and the extremely tight timeline to 2026 creates a major practical barrier to finalizing another complex deal. While a nearly-complete secret deal with a more pliable company like GlobalFoundries cannot be ruled out, the weight of the public evidence suggests this event is unlikely.

Final: 15%
