### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Vaccine/Therapeutic Era DRC Outbreaks (2018-Present):** This is the most relevant reference class, as it accounts for modern tools like the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and monoclonal antibody treatments. There have been 7 outbreaks in the DRC since the start of the Kivu epidemic.
    *   **Base Rate:** Excluding the massive Kivu outlier (2,299 deaths), the median deaths for the other 6 outbreaks is 5.5 (range: 1 to 55). The mean is 12.5. This class suggests that most modern outbreaks are contained very quickly with a low number of fatalities.
    *   **Limitations:** The Kivu outbreak (2,299 deaths) demonstrates that even with modern tools, contextual factors like severe conflict can lead to catastrophic failure. This class has a small sample size (n=7) and is bimodal, with one massive outlier and several small events.

2.  **All Historical DRC Ebola Outbreaks (1976-Present):** This class provides a broader historical perspective on the virus's potential in the DRC across various contexts. There have been 16 recorded outbreaks.
    *   **Base Rate:** The median number of deaths is approximately 40. The distribution is highly right-skewed, with a mean of ~230 deaths, driven by a few large events (Yambuku 1976: 280 deaths; Kivu 2018-20: 2,299 deaths). Most outbreaks (10 of 16) have resulted in fewer than 60 deaths.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is less relevant as it includes many outbreaks from before the development of effective vaccines, rapid diagnostics, and therapeutic treatments, which have fundamentally changed response protocols and outcomes.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-14] Report indicates Republic of Congo is reinforcing border measures. ↓ — Matters because it shows neighboring countries are activating preparedness plans, potentially limiting international spread.
*   [2025-10-13] Report states no new cases have been detected in the DRC outbreak for 18 days. ↓↓↓ — This is a very strong signal of successful containment. The maximum incubation period is 21 days. Reaching this milestone without new cases is a major step toward ending the outbreak.
*   [2025-10-07] CDC reports 64 confirmed/probable cases and 43 deaths. ↑ — Represents the peak reported size of the outbreak to date, establishing the current baseline for the final toll.
*   [2025-09-24] Direct Relief reports at least 31 deaths from 48 cases as of Sept 18. ↑ — Showed rapid initial growth in the first two weeks, indicating a significant transmission chain before the response was fully mobilized.
*   [2025-09-04] DRC declares the Ebola outbreak in Kasaï Province. ↑ — The official start of the event and the response. The delay between initial transmission and declaration is a key factor in final size.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Speed and Efficacy of Response:** The single most important driver. Rapid case identification, contact tracing, and isolation quickly break transmission chains. A slow or ineffective response allows for exponential growth. (Large impact)
2.  **Vaccine Deployment (Ring Vaccination):** The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is highly effective. Its rapid deployment to contacts and contacts-of-contacts ("rings") creates firewalls of immunity, halting spread. Delays or shortages would be critical. (Large impact)
3.  **Geographic Location & Infrastructure:** The outbreak is in Kasaï Province, a "remote area with limited transportation." This is a double-edged sword: it naturally slows geographic spread to major hubs (downward pressure) but also severely hampers the logistical response of getting personnel and supplies in (upward pressure). (Moderate impact)
4.  **Community Trust and Engagement:** Mistrust of health workers, fueled by misinformation or cultural beliefs, can lead to hidden cases, resistance to vaccination, and attacks on response teams. This was a primary driver of the Kivu outbreak's scale. High community cooperation is critical for success. (Moderate to Large impact)
5.  **Concurrent Health Crises:** The DRC is simultaneously battling mpox, cholera, and measles. This strains the healthcare system, diverting personnel, resources, and attention that would otherwise be focused solely on Ebola. (Small to Moderate impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Advanced Tools vs. History:** Unlike the pre-2018 base rate, responders have highly effective vaccines and therapeutics from the outset. This fundamentally lowers the expected case fatality rate and transmission potential compared to historical outbreaks.
*   **No Active Conflict (vs. Kivu):** The Kivu epidemic (2018-20) occurred in a warzone, which severely hampered response and led to it becoming a massive outlier in the modern era. Kasaï Province, while facing challenges, is not an active, high-intensity conflict zone, making the response environment significantly more permissive.
*   **Faster Initial Spread than Recent Small Outbreaks:** This outbreak grew to 43 deaths in its first month. This is much larger and faster than the other post-Kivu outbreaks in the DRC (which had 1, 5, 5, 6, and 12 deaths in total). This suggests a delayed initial detection or a superspreader event early on.
*   **Strong Signal of Containment:** The report of "no new cases for 18 days" is a powerful and unusually clear piece of recent evidence. While other outbreaks have been contained, having such a strong signal this early in the public reporting is a significant downward indicator.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the "Post-Vaccine Era" reference class (excluding the Kivu conflict outlier) seems most appropriate. This suggests a distribution with a median around 10-20 deaths but with a long tail to account for low-probability failures. The equivalent n is low (~6), reflecting the small sample size of this reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): The initial growth to 43 deaths by early October was much faster than the non-Kivu modern outbreaks, suggesting the prior's central tendency was too low for this specific case.
    *   ↓↓↓ (Large): The subsequent report of 18 days with no new cases is extremely strong evidence that transmission chains have been successfully broken and the outbreak is nearly over.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The location is not a major conflict zone like Kivu, making a repeat of that catastrophic failure scenario highly unlikely.
*   **Net effect:** The initial evidence pushed the estimate up significantly. However, the most recent and powerful evidence of containment pushes it back down very strongly. The posterior distribution should be heavily concentrated on a final number slightly above the last reported death toll (43), with a rapidly decaying tail. The final median should be in the 45-60 range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any new confirmed case, especially if the transmission link is unknown.
    *   Geographic spread to a new health zone or a major transportation hub.
    *   Reports of community resistance or attacks on healthcare workers.
    *   Detection of a linked case in a neighboring country (e.g., Republic of Congo).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official confirmation of reaching 21 consecutive days with no new cases.
    *   Official confirmation of reaching 42 consecutive days (2x max incubation), leading to the declaration that the outbreak is over.
    *   Reports that all known contacts have completed their 21-day monitoring period.
    *   Successful genomic sequencing confirming all cases belong to a single, contained cluster.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag & Reliability:** Information from remote regions of the DRC can be slow to emerge and subject to revision. The "18 days" report is from a secondary source and needs official confirmation from the DRC MoH or WHO.
*   **Definition of "Linked":** The resolution criteria include deaths in other countries "linked to this outbreak." A single traveler could spark a new cluster elsewhere that might be difficult to definitively link, creating ambiguity.
*   **The "One Spark" Problem:** Ebola containment is fragile. A single undetected case can restart a transmission chain, dramatically changing the outlook. The "18 days" is a strong signal, but not a guarantee.
*   **Political Instability:** The DRC has a background level of political instability. A sudden crisis could disrupt the health response and change the trajectory of the outbreak.
*   **Resolver Specificity:** The final number will be determined by the DRC's Ministry of Health. Their counting methodology and reporting schedule are the ground truth, regardless of what other agencies (WHO, CDC) report.

**Final Research Summary:**
The outbreak's initial growth exceeded recent norms, but powerful recent evidence of an 18-day halt in new cases suggests containment has been successful. The final death toll is therefore likely to be only slightly higher than the 43 deaths reported in early October.

To forecast the number of deaths from the current Ebola outbreak in the DRC before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the "Post-Vaccine/Therapeutic Era DRC Outbreaks (2018-Present)" excluding the Kivu outlier. This suggests a median of 5.5 deaths and a mean of 12.5 deaths, with a range of 1 to 55 deaths. This base rate reflects the impact of modern medical interventions.
   - **Rationale:** This base rate is chosen because it reflects the current capabilities in managing Ebola outbreaks with vaccines and treatments, which are crucial in the current context.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current outbreak benefits from the same modern medical interventions as past outbreaks in the post-vaccine era.
   - **Differences:** The current outbreak has already reached 43 deaths, which is higher than most recent outbreaks, indicating a faster initial spread. However, the recent 18-day period without new cases suggests effective containment.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Initial Rapid Spread:** The outbreak reached 43 deaths quickly, suggesting a higher potential than the base rate initially indicated. This increases the likelihood of a higher death toll.
   - **18 Days Without New Cases:** This is strong evidence of containment, significantly reducing the likelihood of a large number of additional deaths.
   - **Geographic and Infrastructure Challenges:** The remote location could hinder response efforts, but the lack of conflict reduces the risk of a large-scale outbreak like Kivu.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Start with a distribution centered around the base rate, adjusted for the initial rapid spread.
   - **Update:** The strong containment evidence (18 days without new cases) shifts the distribution downward, concentrating it around the current death toll with a slight increase to account for potential undetected cases or delays in reporting.
   - **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The mean shifts slightly above 43, with a narrow variance reflecting the strong containment signal.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of undetected cases or reporting delays. The 18-day period without new cases is a strong signal but not a guarantee.
   - **Tail Risks:** A single undetected case could restart transmission. Political instability or concurrent health crises could also impact response effectiveness.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** If containment fails, the death toll could rise significantly, but current evidence strongly supports containment.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong evidence of containment and the current death toll, the forecast is centered around a slightly higher number than the current toll, with a narrow distribution reflecting the containment success.

P10: 44  
P20: 45  
P40: 47  
P60: 50  
P80: 55  
P90: 60

# Forecasting Deaths from the 2025 Kasaï Province Ebola Outbreak

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the "Post-Vaccine Era DRC Outbreaks (2018-Present)" as my primary reference class, excluding the Kivu outlier. This is most appropriate because:

- It reflects modern containment capabilities including the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and therapeutic treatments
- It accounts for contemporary DRC healthcare infrastructure and response protocols
- It represents the most recent and relevant historical data for this specific context

This reference class shows:
- Median deaths: 5.5
- Mean deaths: 12.5
- Range: 1 to 55 deaths
- Distribution: Right-skewed with most outbreaks contained quickly

However, I need to account for the Kivu outlier (2,299 deaths) as a low-probability but high-impact scenario in my tail risk assessment.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Same country (DRC) with similar healthcare infrastructure challenges
- Same pathogen (Ebola virus) with known transmission patterns
- Same modern tools available (vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics)
- Similar international response mechanisms

**Key differences:**
- **Already larger than typical:** This outbreak has already reached 43 deaths, which exceeds the typical post-vaccine outbreak size
- **Faster initial growth:** The outbreak grew more rapidly in its first month than other recent outbreaks
- **Strong containment signal:** No new cases reported for 18 days (as of Oct 13, 2025)
- **No active conflict:** Unlike the Kivu outbreak, Kasaï Province is not an active warzone, making response more effective
- **Multiple concurrent health crises:** The DRC is simultaneously battling mpox, cholera, and measles

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward:**
- Initial rapid growth to 43 deaths in first month (strong evidence, ~3× likelihood ratio favoring higher outcomes)
- Remote location with limited transportation infrastructure (moderate evidence, ~1.5× likelihood ratio)
- Multiple concurrent health crises straining resources (weak evidence, ~1.2× likelihood ratio)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward:**
- No new cases for 18 days as of Oct 13 (very strong evidence, ~0.2× likelihood ratio)
- Absence of active conflict unlike Kivu (strong evidence, ~0.3× likelihood ratio)
- Neighboring countries implementing border measures (moderate evidence, ~0.7× likelihood ratio)
- Availability of effective vaccines from outbreak onset (moderate evidence, ~0.7× likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 10-20 deaths (from post-vaccine era reference class), I need to update based on the evidence:

**First update - Initial size and growth rate:**
- Prior median: ~15 deaths
- Evidence: Already 43 deaths reported by CDC on Oct 7
- Update: This shifts my distribution significantly upward, with a new median around 60-70 deaths, reflecting the potential for continued growth

**Second update - No new cases for 18 days:**
- Interim median: ~65 deaths
- Evidence: No new cases for 18 days (approaching the 21-day incubation period)
- Update: This strongly shifts my distribution downward and tightens it considerably
- New median: ~50 deaths, with much reduced uncertainty about continued growth

The posterior distribution is now centered slightly above the last reported death toll (43), with a relatively tight spread. The 18-day containment signal is extremely powerful evidence that the outbreak is nearly over.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- The "18 days without new cases" report could be inaccurate or premature
- Remote areas might have unreported cases that haven't been detected
- The case fatality rate might increase if healthcare resources become strained
- A single undetected case could restart transmission chains

**Alternative scenarios:**
1. **Continued containment (80% probability):** No significant new cases, final toll 45-55 deaths
2. **Limited resurgence (15% probability):** A few new transmission chains identified, final toll 55-100 deaths
3. **Major failure scenario (5% probability):** Significant undetected spread or spread to new regions, final toll 100-500+ deaths

**Adjustments needed:**
- Widen my uncertainty bands to account for reporting delays and potential undetected cases
- Ensure my upper percentiles reflect the small but real possibility of containment failure
- Slightly increase my lower percentiles to account for the fact that 43 deaths have already been confirmed

## 6. Final Percentiles

After careful consideration of the base rates, evidence, and potential scenarios, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 44
P20: 46
P40: 49
P60: 53
P80: 65
P90: 85

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is **Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the post-vaccine era (2018-present)**. This class is superior to all historical outbreaks because it accounts for the modern toolkit of rapid diagnostics, effective vaccines (rVSV-ZEBOV), and monoclonal antibody treatments, which have fundamentally altered outbreak dynamics.

There have been 7 such outbreaks. This reference class is bimodal:
*   **The Kivu Outbreak (2018-2020):** A massive outlier with 2,299 deaths, driven primarily by intense armed conflict that severely hampered the public health response.
*   **The other 6 outbreaks:** These were all contained relatively quickly. Their death tolls were 1, 5, 5, 6, 12, and 55.

Given that the current outbreak is not in a zone of high-intensity conflict, the Kivu outbreak is a poor comparison. Therefore, my prior distribution is based on the **6 non-conflict modern outbreaks**. This gives a **median of 5.5 deaths** and a mean of 14 deaths. The distribution is highly right-skewed, suggesting that most outbreaks are very small, but there's a possibility of them growing to several dozen fatalities.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarity:** The outbreak is occurring in the DRC, where health authorities have recent and extensive experience with Ebola response, and the modern medical toolkit is available.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Initial Velocity:** This outbreak, with 43 deaths reported by early October, has already surpassed the final toll of 5 of the 6 outbreaks in my reference class. It grew much faster initially than a "typical" small, modern outbreak. This suggests a significant delay in detection or an early superspreader event.
    *   **Context:** Unlike the Kivu outlier, Kasaï Province is not an active warzone, making a catastrophic failure of the response far less likely. However, the DRC is battling other diseases (mpox, cholera), which could strain resources.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate two key pieces of evidence against the prior.

1.  **Evidence: Initial growth to 43 deaths by October 7.**
    *   **Impact:** This is strong evidence against the prior's low median (5.5 deaths). The final number of deaths must be at least 43. This observation is much more likely under a scenario where the final toll is >50 than one where it is <50.
    *   **Adjustment:** This evidence dramatically shifts the entire distribution to the right. The lower bound is now anchored at 43, and the expected median is pushed significantly higher than the base rate would suggest.

2.  **Evidence: A report of no new cases for 18 days as of October 13.**
    *   **Impact:** This is extremely powerful evidence suggesting that transmission has been interrupted. The maximum incubation period for Ebola is 21 days. Reaching 18 days without a new case is a very strong signal that containment efforts have succeeded.
    *   **Adjustment:** This evidence acts as a massive downward update on the potential future growth of the outbreak. It makes scenarios involving hundreds of deaths highly improbable. The final death toll is now most likely to be the 43 already reported, plus a small number of additional deaths from the pool of currently identified cases (64 total cases - 43 deaths = 21 active/recovered cases).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A right-skewed distribution with a median around 6-10 deaths and a tail extending to ~60.
*   **Likelihood 1 (43 deaths):** I update my belief. The prior is clearly wrong for this specific case. The distribution is now anchored at a minimum of 43. The median shifts to perhaps 60-80, with a tail reflecting the uncertainty of an uncontrolled outbreak.
*   **Likelihood 2 (18-day lull):** I perform a second, major update. This new evidence is highly inconsistent with a large, ongoing outbreak. It collapses the right tail of the distribution. The posterior becomes tightly concentrated just above the last reported number of 43.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The final distribution has a minimum of 43. Its central tendency (median) is likely in the high 40s to low 50s, accounting for potential further deaths among the 21 existing non-fatal cases. The distribution has a thin but present right tail to account for the possibility of an undiscovered transmission chain.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily dependent on the "18 days with no new cases" report.
*   **What if the report is wrong or premature?** Information from remote areas can be unreliable. A single missed contact could restart a transmission chain. If a new, unlinked case appears next week, my forecast would be far too low and overconfident.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible alternative is that there is a small, undiscovered cluster of cases that will be found in the coming weeks. This could add another 10-20 deaths before it is contained, pushing the total into the 60-70 range.
*   **Tail Risk:** While a Kivu-scale event is exceptionally unlikely due to the lack of conflict, a failure of containment leading to spread to a larger town could still result in an outbreak exceeding 100 deaths. This is a low-probability, high-impact tail risk.

To account for these risks, I will widen the upper end of my distribution. While the median will remain low (around 50), the P80 and P90 percentiles must be high enough to reflect the "smoldering outbreak" and "containment failure" scenarios.
