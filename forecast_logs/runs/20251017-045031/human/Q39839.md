### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Second Attempt at Orbital Booster Propulsive Landing:** The most relevant reference class is a company's second attempt to land an orbital-class booster after the first attempt failed. The primary analogue is SpaceX's Falcon 9. Their first sea-based landing attempt (CRS-5, Jan 2015) failed, as did their second (CRS-6, Apr 2015). Success came on their fifth sea-based attempt. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps **10-20%**, for success on the second try. *Limitation: This class has a very small sample size (n=1, SpaceX) and doesn't account for Blue Origin's extensive suborbital experience.*
2.  **Inaugural Landing of a New Orbital Vehicle Type:** This class includes the first attempt by any company with a new vehicle. SpaceX Falcon 9 failed its first several sea-based attempts. SpaceX's Starship has also had multiple failures before achieving a soft splashdown. The base rate for a successful propulsive landing on an early flight of a brand-new orbital vehicle is very low, likely **<10%**. *Limitation: New Glenn is on its second flight, not its first, and benefits from data from the first attempt's failure.*
3.  **Propulsive Landings by Blue Origin:** Blue Origin has a near-perfect record of propulsive landings with its suborbital New Shepard vehicle (12 consecutive successful landings of the same booster). This suggests a base rate of **>90%** for their *mastery of the core technology*. *Limitation: New Shepard is a much smaller, suborbital vehicle. The physics of re-entry and landing for the much larger, faster New Glenn orbital booster are significantly more challenging.*

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-15** Wikipedia and other aggregators list a target launch date of November 9, 2025. — ↑ — A specific date within the 2025 window indicates the project is on track and not facing indefinite delays.
*   **2025-10-08** The "Never Tell Me The Odds" booster (NG-2) was rolled out to the launch pad for testing. — ↑ — This is a major hardware milestone, showing the vehicle is assembled and ready for pre-flight qualification, increasing the odds of a 2025 launch.
*   **2025-06-10** The NG-2 launch was delayed from an earlier target to "no earlier than August 15." — ↓ — Delays are common in rocketry, but this earlier slip shows the schedule has been fluid, introducing uncertainty about meeting the end-of-year deadline.
*   **2025-01-16** The first New Glenn (NG-1) successfully reached orbit but the booster was lost during the landing attempt. — ↑/↓ — The successful orbital insertion de-risks the "launch" part of the question. The landing failure provides invaluable data to correct for the second attempt, which historically is a key step toward success.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **New Shepard Experience:** Blue Origin has extensive, successful experience with the terminal phase of propulsive landing via its New Shepard program. This provides a deep well of expertise in guidance, navigation, control, and engine throttling. (Large positive driver for landing success).
2.  **Data from NG-1 Failure:** The company possesses telemetry and data from the first landing attempt. Knowing the specific failure mode (e.g., engine relight, hydraulic failure, control surface issue) is the most critical input for ensuring the second attempt succeeds. (Large positive driver for landing success).
3.  **ESCAPADE Mars Launch Window:** The payload is a NASA mission to Mars, which has a constrained, non-negotiable launch window that closes in late 2025. This creates immense external pressure to launch on schedule and avoid a two-year delay. (Large positive driver for launching before 2026).
4.  **"Gradatim Ferociter" (Step-by-Step, Ferociously) Culture:** Blue Origin's cautious, test-heavy engineering philosophy contrasts with SpaceX's rapid iteration. This could increase the intrinsic reliability of the vehicle, but it also makes them more likely to delay the launch if any pre-flight tests show anomalies. (Moderate driver; increases landing success probability but decreases 2025 launch probability).
5.  **BE-4 Engine Performance:** The seven BE-4 engines on the first stage are new, high-performance methalox engines. Their reliability, particularly the ability to relight in flight and throttle deeply for landing, is the single most important technical factor. Any unknowns here are a major risk. (Large driver, direction uncertain).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Suborbital Precedent:** Unlike SpaceX when it was developing Falcon 9, Blue Origin has already mastered propulsive landing on a smaller scale (New Shepard). This provides a much stronger technical foundation than the reference class suggests.
*   **External Hard Deadline:** Early Falcon 9 landing attempts were often for commercial satellite launches with flexible schedules or for their own Starlink missions. NG-2 has a planetary science mission for NASA with a hard Mars transfer window, creating a powerful forcing function to launch in 2025 that was absent in the reference class.
*   **Engine Technology:** New Glenn uses liquid methane (methalox) BE-4 engines, whereas the Falcon 9 reference class uses kerosene (RP-1) Merlins. Methane offers performance benefits but also presents different challenges (e.g., deep throttling, relight characteristics) that are less flight-proven for landing.
*   **Data-Rich Second Attempt:** This is not a blind second attempt. It directly follows a full orbital flight where the booster went through the entire atmospheric re-entry and descent profile. The quality of data for correcting the failure is much higher than on early, lower-altitude test flights.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the "Second Attempt" reference class, a prior of ~20% seems reasonable, with low confidence (equivalent n≈10) due to the small sample size.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Extensive New Shepard landing experience provides a strong signal of competence in the core technology, arguing this is not a typical "second attempt."
    *   ↑ (Large): The hard NASA Mars launch window provides a powerful incentive to overcome technical hurdles and launch within 2025, directly addressing the timing part of the question.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The successful orbital flight of NG-1 de-risks the launch phase and provided high-quality data on the specific failure mode of the first landing attempt.
    *   ↔ (Small): The company's cautious culture is a mixed signal; it increases the chance of a successful landing *if they launch* but also increases the risk of a slip into 2026. The external deadline likely overrides the tendency to delay.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the prior suborbital experience and the hard external deadline, strongly pushes the probability up from a low base rate. The posterior should be significantly higher than the prior, likely moving into the >50% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a successful static fire test of the NG-2 booster on the launch pad.
    *   FAA launch license issuance for the ESCAPADE mission.
    *   Official confirmation of a specific launch date (e.g., "NET Nov 9") from Blue Origin.
    *   Successful completion of a full wet dress rehearsal.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Scrubbed static fire attempt or reports of an anomaly during testing.
    *   Rollback of the rocket from the pad to the integration facility for non-weather reasons.
    *   Any official communication pushing the launch window into December 2025 or later.
    *   Statements from NASA expressing concern about the launch schedule.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Conjunction Fallacy:** The question requires two conditions to be met: (1) a launch before 2026 AND (2) a successful landing. A failure in either part resolves the question to "No." A delay past Dec 31 is as much a failure as a crash.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Blue Origin is a private company known for its secrecy. We lack public information on the specific cause of the NG-1 landing failure and the fixes implemented, forcing us to infer their effectiveness.
*   **Defining "Successful Landing":** The resolution criteria are simple, but edge cases exist (e.g., a hard landing that damages the booster but leaves it upright on the ship). Assume "successful" means the booster is in a condition to be notionally reused, as is standard in the industry.
*   **Weather Risk:** Launching from Florida in the late fall still carries risks of weather delays (e.g., high winds) which could push a late-November attempt into December, tightening the schedule against the deadline.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for a second orbital landing attempt is low, but Blue Origin is not a typical case. Their extensive suborbital landing experience and the hard deadline of a NASA Mars mission are powerful positive drivers that suggest a significantly higher probability of success than the reference class would indicate.

To forecast the probability of Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully landing, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the success rate of a company's second attempt to land an orbital-class booster after a failed first attempt. The primary analogue is SpaceX's Falcon 9, which failed its first two sea-based landing attempts. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps **10-20%**, for success on the second try. Given the small sample size and Blue Origin's unique context, I'll start with a prior probability of **20%**.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both involve a second attempt after a failed first landing.
   - Differences: Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience and a hard deadline for a NASA mission, which were not factors in the SpaceX reference case. These differences suggest a higher probability of success for Blue Origin.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **New Shepard Experience**: Blue Origin's success with New Shepard landings suggests competence in landing technology. This increases the probability.
   - **Data from NG-1 Failure**: Having data from the first attempt allows for targeted improvements, increasing the probability.
   - **ESCAPADE Mars Launch Window**: The hard deadline for the NASA mission creates pressure to launch in 2025, increasing the probability.
   - **Cautious Culture**: Blue Origin's cautious approach may reduce the probability of a 2025 launch but increase landing success if launched.
   - **BE-4 Engine Performance**: New technology presents risks, but no specific issues have been reported, so this is neutral.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25
   - Likelihood ratio: Considering the positive evidence (New Shepard experience, data from NG-1, and the hard deadline), let's assume a likelihood ratio of 3.
   - Posterior odds = 0.25 * 3 = 0.75
   - Posterior probability = 0.75 / (1 + 0.75) = 0.43 or 43%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The conjunction of two events (launch and landing) could be underestimated. Consider the possibility of delays or technical issues.
   - Alternative scenario: A delay into 2026 due to unforeseen technical challenges or regulatory issues.
   - Adjustments: Given the hard deadline and positive drivers, the probability remains reasonable but should account for potential delays.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 43%

# Probability Analysis: Will Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" launch before 2026 and successfully land?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to select an appropriate base rate for a second orbital booster landing attempt following a first failed attempt.

The most relevant reference class is "second attempt at orbital booster propulsive landing after first failure." This is a small sample size, with SpaceX's Falcon 9 being the primary example. SpaceX failed on their second sea-based landing attempt (after failing the first), and only succeeded on their fifth attempt.

However, Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience with New Shepard (12 consecutive successful landings of the same booster), which provides valuable expertise.

Considering these factors, I'll set a base rate of **25%** - higher than SpaceX's second attempt outcome would suggest, but still conservative given the significant challenges of orbital-class booster recovery.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like SpaceX's early attempts, this is an early-generation orbital booster recovery attempt
- The company has data from a previous failed attempt to inform improvements
- The physics challenges of supersonic reentry, engine restart, and precision landing remain similar

**Key differences:**
- Blue Origin has extensive suborbital landing experience (New Shepard program), unlike SpaceX at a comparable stage
- The NG-2 mission has a NASA Mars payload with a hard launch window in 2025, creating stronger schedule pressure
- Blue Origin has a more cautious engineering culture than SpaceX, potentially increasing reliability but also risking delays
- The company has full telemetry from the first attempt's failure, providing specific data on what went wrong

These differences generally favor a higher probability than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent hardware milestone - booster rollout (Oct 8, 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If the launch and landing will succeed before 2026, we would expect to see the hardware at the pad by now
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if they ultimately miss the 2025 window or fail the landing, they might still roll out hardware for testing
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Previous launch schedule slips (June 2025 delay)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even successful programs experience some delays
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Programs that ultimately miss deadlines or fail technically tend to show early schedule instability
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75
- This evidence slightly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Hard NASA Mars launch window deadline**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - External schedule pressure is a powerful motivator for meeting deadlines
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.6) - Even with pressure, technical issues could force delays or compromise landing success
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.58
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: New Shepard landing experience**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - Success would build on this foundation of expertise
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Orbital landing is significantly more challenging than suborbital
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 25:75 (0.25/(1-0.25) = 1/3)

First update (hardware milestone):
- Posterior odds = 1/3 × 1.9 = 0.633
- Posterior probability = 0.633/(1+0.633) ≈ 0.39 or 39%

Second update (schedule slips):
- Posterior odds = 0.639 × 0.75 = 0.475
- Posterior probability = 0.475/(1+0.475) ≈ 0.32 or 32%

Third update (Mars launch window):
- Posterior odds = 0.47 × 1.58 = 0.75
- Posterior probability = 0.75/(1+0.75) ≈ 0.43 or 43%

Fourth update (New Shepard experience):
- Posterior odds = 0.75 × 1.8 = 1.35
- Posterior probability = 1.35/(1+1.35) ≈ 0.57 or 57%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the transferability of New Shepard landing experience to the much larger, faster New Glenn
- The question requires both a launch before 2026 AND a successful landing - this conjunction necessarily has a lower probability than either component alone
- Blue Origin's secretive nature means we lack detailed information about the specific failure mode of the first landing attempt
- Weather risks in late 2025 could push a November/December launch into 2026

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would place the probability around 30-35%, arguing that:
1. The conjunction requirement (both timing and landing success) significantly lowers the probability
2. Blue Origin's cautious culture makes them more likely to delay if any issues arise
3. The BE-4 engines are relatively unproven for the landing profile

However, this view underweights the powerful schedule pressure from NASA and the extensive landing experience Blue Origin already possesses.

**Adjustments:**
Given the conjunction requirement and remaining technical uncertainties, I should adjust my estimate slightly downward from 57% to approximately 52%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and the red team analysis, I arrive at a final probability of 52% that Blue Origin's "Never Tell Me The Odds" will both launch before 2026 and successfully land.

Final: 52%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question requires two conditions to be met: a launch before 2026 AND a successful landing. The more challenging and uncertain of these is the landing. Therefore, I will establish a base rate for the success of a second attempt at an orbital booster propulsive landing.

*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is a company's second attempt to land an orbital-class booster on a sea-based platform after the first attempt failed.
*   **Data:** The primary analogue is SpaceX's Falcon 9. Their first sea-landing attempt failed, as did their second. This extremely small sample size (n=1 for the second attempt) suggests a very low base rate.
*   **Chosen Base Rate (Prior):** Acknowledging the immense difficulty of the task, I will set a low prior probability for a successful landing. I choose **P(H) = 20%**. This reflects that success on an early attempt is exceptional, while being less extreme than the 0% suggested by the single SpaceX data point. This prior corresponds to odds of 1-to-4 in favor of failure.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with Blue Origin's New Glenn has key differences from the base case of SpaceX's early Falcon 9 attempts.

*   **Similarities:** Both involve a new, large, partially reusable orbital rocket attempting a propulsive landing on a ship, a fundamentally difficult engineering challenge. Both are second attempts following a first-attempt failure.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Suborbital Experience:** Blue Origin has a near-perfect record of successful propulsive landings with its suborbital New Shepard vehicle. This demonstrates mastery of the terminal phase of landing (guidance, navigation, control, engine throttling) that SpaceX did not possess at the equivalent stage of Falcon 9's development. This is a significant positive differentiator.
    2.  **Data Quality:** New Glenn's first flight was a full orbital mission, providing high-fidelity data on the entire re-entry and descent. This allows for a more precise diagnosis and fix of the first landing's failure mode.
    3.  **Company Culture:** Blue Origin's cautious, test-heavy culture ("Gradatim Ferociter") suggests the vehicle may be more mature and reliable by its second flight compared to a "fail fast" development model.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will analyze the problem as a conjunction: P(Launch in 2025) * P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025).

**A) For the Landing Success (P(Successful Landing | Launch in 2025)):**
*   **Evidence 1: New Shepard Landing Record.** This is strong positive evidence. A company that will succeed at orbital landing (H) is much more likely to have a flawless suborbital record (E) than a company that will fail (~H). The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability from the base rate.
*   **Evidence 2: Cautious Culture & NG-1 Data.** The methodical approach and the high-quality data from the first failure increase the chances that the specific failure mode was correctly identified and fixed. This is moderately positive evidence, with a likelihood ratio greater than 1.

**B) For the Launch Timing (P(Launch in 2025)):**
*   **Evidence 3: NASA ESCAPADE Mars Mission.** The payload has a non-negotiable planetary launch window that closes in late 2025. Missing it would mean a two-year delay and a major contract failure. This provides immense external pressure to launch on time. This is very strong positive evidence for a 2025 launch.
*   **Evidence 4: Hardware Readiness.** The booster was rolled out to the launch pad in early October 2025 for final testing. This is a major milestone indicating the vehicle is assembled and on track for a near-term launch. This is also strong positive evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will first update the probability of the landing success, then multiply it by the probability of a timely launch.

*   **Step 1: Update Landing Probability.**
    *   **Prior:** P(Landing Success) = 20% (Odds: 1 to 4).
    *   **Evidence Impact:** The strong positive evidence from Blue Origin's specific experience and culture (New Shepard record, etc.) makes them a much stronger candidate than the base case. I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 2.7. This means the evidence is 2.7 times more likely if they are to succeed than if they are to fail.
    *   **Posterior Odds:** (1 to 4) × 2.7 = 2.7 to 4 ≈ 0.675 to 1.
    *   **Posterior Probability P(Landing Success | Launch):** 0.675 / (1 + 0.675) ≈ **40%**. This revised probability reflects a significant update from the prior but still acknowledges that failure is more likely than success for such a difficult task on only the second attempt.

*   **Step 2: Estimate Launch Probability.**
    *   The base rate for a new rocket launching on schedule is low. However, the evidence here is overwhelming. The hard Mars deadline and the fact that the vehicle is on the pad in mid-October makes a 2025 launch highly probable. I estimate **P(Launch in 2025) = 90%**. The 10% chance of failure accounts for a major anomaly found in final testing or a prolonged series of weather delays pushing the launch into 2026.

*   **Step 3: Combine for Final Forecast.**
    *   P(Event) = P(Launch in 2025) × P(Landing Success | Launch in 2025)
    *   P(Event) = 0.90 × 0.40 = 0.36

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Main Risk:** Am I overweighting the New Shepard experience? The physics of orbital re-entry are an order of magnitude more difficult than a suborbital flight. If this experience is less transferable than assumed, the landing probability could be much closer to the 20% base rate, which would drop the final forecast to ~18%.
*   **Counter-Argument:** The pressure from the hard NASA deadline is a powerful forcing function that mitigates Blue Origin's natural tendency to delay. They are highly incentivized to find solutions and launch.
*   **Conjunction:** The forecast correctly accounts for the conjunction fallacy by multiplying the probabilities of two distinct events, ensuring the final probability is lower than either of its components. My 40% estimate for landing success already bakes in significant uncertainty and respects the difficulty of the task. The 90% launch probability seems robust given the circumstances. The combined 36% feels like a reasonable balance of these factors.

### Final Forecast
The probability of a launch occurring before 2026 is very high (~90%) due to the hard Mars launch window for its NASA payload and the vehicle's advanced state of readiness. The probability of a successful landing on this second attempt is significantly lower. Starting from a low base rate of 20%, Blue Origin's extensive suborbital landing experience and methodical approach justify a substantial update to approximately 40%. Combining these probabilities (0.90 * 0.40) yields the final forecast.

Final: 36%
