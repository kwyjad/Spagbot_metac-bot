Here is my research plan.

**Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **What is the legal and procedural basis for extending martial law in Ukraine?** Is it a simple majority vote? Is it controversial? What does the constitution mandate regarding its termination?
2.  **What is the current state of the Russo-Ukrainian War as of October 2025?** Is there active, large-scale combat? Is it a frozen conflict? Are there active peace negotiations? The state of the war is the primary driver.
3.  **What are the direct consequences of *not* extending martial law?** Specifically, how would it affect military mobilization, command structures, and the constitutional requirement to hold elections?
4.  **What is the domestic political sentiment in Ukraine?** What are President Zelenskyy's approval ratings? Is there significant political or public pressure to end martial law and hold elections, despite the war?
5.  **What is the stance of Ukraine's key international partners (e.g., US, EU)?** Are they exerting pressure to restore full democratic processes, or do they accept martial law as a wartime necessity? How does this interact with Ukraine's EU accession goals?
6.  **What is the precedent?** How have the previous 16 extensions been handled? Were they contentious or routine?

**Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

6.  `"history of martial law extensions Ukraine 2022-2025"`
    `"Verkhovna Rada votes on martial law extension"`

**Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Legal/Procedural:** The Constitution of Ukraine (Article 83) explicitly prohibits parliamentary elections under martial law. The President proposes the extension, and the Verkhovna Rada approves it with a simple majority. This has become a routine, non-controversial legislative act, repeated 16 times.
*   **State of the War:** The conflict remains active, with ongoing hostilities across a long front line. There are no credible, imminent peace agreements or ceasefires on the horizon that would be implemented before the November 5, 2025 deadline. The war's nature—a high-intensity conventional conflict—necessitates the powers granted under martial law.
*   **Consequences of Non-Extension:** Ending martial law would trigger a constitutional requirement to organize and hold elections within a short timeframe. It would also severely disrupt military mobilization, resource allocation, and civil defense measures (like curfews) that are legally dependent on the martial law framework. This would be operationally catastrophic for the war effort.
*   **Domestic Politics:** The provided Gallup source (August 2025) shows that while Zelenskyy's approval has declined from its 2022 peak, he retains majority support. More importantly, there is a broad political consensus and public understanding that holding elections during a full-scale invasion is impractical and dangerous. The security imperative overrides political considerations.
*   **International Stance:** While partners like the US and EU champion democracy, they have prioritized Ukraine's ability to defend itself. There is no evidence of significant pressure to end martial law while the country is fighting for its survival. The EU accession process (Atlantic Council source) focuses on long-term reforms, but accepts the current security reality.
*   **Precedent:** The 16 previous extensions have established a powerful institutional momentum. It is the default action as long as the underlying condition (the invasion) persists.

**Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

The synthesis reveals an overwhelming case for "Yes." The core logic is that martial law is the legal foundation for Ukraine's entire war effort, and its termination is contingent on the end of large-scale hostilities, which is not imminent. The following brief will structure these findings for the statistician.

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Ukraine's own martial law extensions (2022-2025):** This is the most specific and relevant class. Martial law has come up for renewal 16 times, and it has been extended 16 times. This suggests a base rate of >95%, approaching 99%. The process is routine as long as the war continues.
*   **Nations under full-scale invasion/existential threat:** States facing an invasion that threatens their sovereignty (e.g., UK in WWII, South Korea post-1950, Kuwait 1990) almost universally maintain states of emergency and suspend normal electoral politics until the immediate threat is neutralized. The base rate of a country voluntarily revoking such powers *while active combat continues on its territory* is extremely low, likely <5%.
*   **Prolonged states of emergency:** A broader, less useful class where governments use emergency powers for various reasons (e.g., counter-terrorism, civil unrest). These have a more mixed record of extension vs. termination. However, Ukraine's case fits the "existential threat" subclass, not a lower-level emergency.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-12** Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, approves the 16th extension of martial law and general mobilization for another 90 days, until November 5, 2025. — ↑ — Reinforces the established, routine nature of extensions, setting a strong precedent for the upcoming decision.
*   **2025-08-07** Gallup poll shows Zelenskyy's approval has fallen from wartime peaks but remains at a majority, while approval for the national government is lower. — ↓ (small) — Indicates growing war fatigue but is not potent enough to override the security consensus against holding elections during active conflict.
*   **2025-09-15** Russia launches a significant offensive operation in the Donbas region, increasing the intensity of fighting and prompting further Ukrainian mobilization measures. — ↑ (large) — Directly reinforces the primary justification for martial law: the need to defend against an active, ongoing invasion.
*   **2025-10-10** The head of the President's office, Andriy Yermak, states that "all necessary legal measures to ensure the defense of the state will continue as long as the aggressor is on our land." — ↑ — Signals clear executive intent to seek another extension, reducing uncertainty about the government's position.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **State of the War (Large):** This is the master driver. The continuation of active, large-scale hostilities makes the legal powers of martial law (e.g., for mobilization, curfews, resource direction) indispensable for the state's defense. A sudden ceasefire is the only plausible off-switch.
*   **Constitutional Prohibition on Elections (Large):** The Ukrainian constitution forbids national elections during martial law. Ending it would trigger a constitutional crisis by forcing elections that are logistically impossible and strategically unwise to hold, given millions of displaced citizens and active security threats.
*   **Institutional Momentum (Moderate):** With 16 prior extensions, the process has become a routine, expected, and non-controversial legislative act within the Verkhovna Rada. The default action is to extend.
*   **Domestic Political Consensus (Moderate):** Despite war fatigue, there is a broad elite and public consensus that holding elections during an existential war is not feasible or desirable. Security and stability trump normal political life.
*   **International Acceptance (Small):** Key allies, while promoting democracy as a long-term goal, have accepted the necessity of martial law for Ukraine's war effort. There is no significant external pressure to end it prematurely.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Existential Nature of the Threat:** Unlike many states of emergency enacted for counter-terrorism or civil unrest, this is a response to a full-scale conventional invasion by a nuclear power, making the security justification exceptionally strong and clear-cut.
*   **Explicit Constitutional Link to Elections:** The direct constitutional link between martial law and the suspension of elections creates a very high barrier to ending it, as doing so would immediately raise the intractable problem of wartime elections.
*   **High Degree of National Unity:** Despite internal political friction, the external threat has forged a level of national unity and political consensus on core security issues that is absent in many other reference class cases.
*   **Unprecedented Level of International Support:** Ukraine's reliance on and integration with Western partners means its actions are under scrutiny, but this support also validates the necessity of its wartime measures, including martial law.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A strong prior of ~95% is justified by the most relevant reference class (16/16 previous extensions). This reflects an "almost certain" starting point, with an equivalent n of ~20.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Continued high-intensity warfare on Ukrainian territory.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The powerful institutional momentum and procedural routine of extensions.
    *   (↑ Small) Lack of any significant domestic or international pressure to end martial law.
    *   (↓ Small) Evidence of public war fatigue, which slightly raises the long-term political cost of extensions but does not affect the immediate decision.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior should move upward, closer to 98-99%, reflecting the near-inevitability of an extension under current conditions.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   President Zelenskyy submitting the formal decree to the Verkhovna Rada for the extension.
    *   Public statements by parliamentary leaders confirming the vote is scheduled.
    *   Any significant escalation of hostilities by Russia.
    *   Statements from Western partners affirming support for Ukraine's "necessary measures" for defense.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a sudden, comprehensive, and credible ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia.
    *   A major, unexpected political crisis in Kyiv where a faction demands elections immediately.
    *   A public, high-level statement from the US or EU explicitly linking future aid to the termination of martial law.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast assumes no sudden, paradigm-shifting events like the collapse of a front, the death of a key leader, or a sudden political coup in either Kyiv or Moscow

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the historical frequency of martial law extensions in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in 2022. Martial law has been extended 16 times, suggesting a base rate of nearly 100% for extension under similar conditions. Given the ongoing conflict, a base rate of 95% is reasonable, reflecting the high likelihood of continuation.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors previous extensions, with ongoing conflict and no significant changes in the geopolitical landscape or domestic political pressures that would suggest a deviation from past behavior.
   - Differences: There is some evidence of war fatigue and declining approval ratings for Zelenskyy, but these factors are not strong enough to outweigh the security imperatives.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Continued Conflict**: The ongoing high-intensity warfare increases the likelihood of extending martial law. P(E | H) is high because martial law is necessary for wartime governance. P(E | ~H) is low because ending martial law would be strategically unwise. Likelihood ratio is high, increasing probability.
   - **Institutional Momentum**: The routine nature of extensions suggests a high likelihood of continuation. P(E | H) is high, P(E | ~H) is low. Likelihood ratio is high, increasing probability.
   - **International Stance**: Lack of pressure from allies to end martial law supports continuation. P(E | H) is high, P(E | ~H) is low. Likelihood ratio is moderate, slightly increasing probability.
   - **Domestic Politics**: While there is some war fatigue, the consensus against elections during conflict remains strong. P(E | H) is moderate, P(E | ~H) is low. Likelihood ratio is moderate, slightly increasing probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 95% probability translates to odds of 19:1.
   - Likelihood ratio: Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1, suggesting a strong reinforcement of the prior.
   - Posterior odds: 19:1 × high likelihood ratio = very high posterior odds.
   - Posterior probability: Approaches 98-99%, reflecting the strong evidence supporting continuation.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could be overconfident if unexpected political shifts occur. However, the evidence strongly supports continuation.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden peace agreement could change the calculus, but current evidence suggests this is unlikely.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence and historical precedent, the forecast remains robust.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability reflects the high base rate and strong supporting evidence for extending martial law beyond November 5, 2025.

Final: 98%

# Will Ukraine extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Ukraine's own history of martial law extensions as the most relevant reference class. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has extended martial law 16 times out of 16 opportunities - a 100% extension rate.

This suggests a very high base rate of approximately 95-99%. I'll use 95% as a conservative prior to account for some uncertainty, which corresponds to prior odds of 19:1 in favor of extension.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The fundamental reason for martial law (active war with Russia) remains unchanged
- The constitutional prohibition on elections during martial law still applies
- The institutional process for extension is well-established after 16 iterations
- The same government leadership remains in place

**Differences from base case:**
- The war has now continued for over 3.5 years, potentially increasing war fatigue
- Zelenskyy's approval ratings have declined from wartime peaks (though still majority)
- The longer martial law continues, the more pressure might build for democratic normalization

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Ongoing active combat operations**
- P(E|H): ~0.99 (If martial law will be extended, we'd almost certainly see ongoing combat)
- P(E|~H): ~0.05 (If martial law won't be extended, combat would likely have ceased)
- Likelihood ratio: ~20:1 (strongly favors extension)

**Evidence 2: Recent Russian offensive in Donbas (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.70 (If martial law will be extended, escalations are somewhat likely)
- P(E|~H): ~0.05 (If martial law won't be extended, recent escalations would be unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~14:1 (strongly favors extension)

**Evidence 3: Yermak's statement that measures will continue "as long as the aggressor is on our land"**
- P(E|H): ~0.90 (If planning to extend, such statements are very likely)
- P(E|~H): ~0.10 (If planning to end martial law, such statements would be unlikely)
- Likelihood ratio: ~9:1 (strongly favors extension)

**Evidence 4: War fatigue and declining approval ratings**
- P(E|H): ~0.60 (Even with extension, some war fatigue is expected)
- P(E|~H): ~0.90 (Without extension, we'd expect significant war fatigue)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.67:1 (slightly against extension)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 19:1 (95% probability)

Update on Evidence 1 (ongoing combat):
- Posterior odds = 19:1 × 20:1 = 380:1
- Posterior probability = 380/(380+1) ≈ 99.7%

Update on Evidence 2 (recent Russian offensive):
- Posterior odds = 380:1 × 14:1 = 5320:1
- Posterior probability = 5320/(5320+1) ≈ 99.98%

This is becoming unrealistically high, so I'll be more conservative in my final assessment.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- I may be overweighting the historical pattern and underestimating the possibility of change
- There could be behind-the-scenes peace negotiations not visible in public reporting
- Domestic political pressures for normalization might be stronger than reported
- International pressure (especially related to EU accession) might increase
- The constitutional requirement for elections might create more urgency than I've accounted for

Alternative scenario: Ukraine might announce a partial lifting of martial law in specific regions far from the front lines, as a compromise between security needs and democratic normalization.

The strongest case against extension would be if there were a sudden ceasefire agreement or if Western allies made aid conditional on democratic reforms. However, there's no evidence for either scenario in the provided information.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and accounting for uncertainty, I believe there is a very high probability that Ukraine will extend martial law beyond November 5, 2025. The ongoing war, constitutional constraints, institutional momentum, and explicit government statements all strongly support this conclusion.

While there are some countervailing factors like war fatigue, they are not nearly strong enough to overcome the security imperatives that necessitate martial law during an active invasion.

Final: 97%

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

**1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
The most relevant base rate is the history of martial law extensions in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.
- **Reference Class:** Decisions by the Ukrainian government to extend martial law.
- **Data:** As of the current date (October 17, 2025), martial law has been put up for extension 16 times, and it has been extended 16 times.
- **Calculation:** A simple frequentist approach gives a 100% rate. A Bayesian approach using Laplace's Rule of Succession, which accounts for small sample sizes, would estimate the probability as (s+1)/(n+2), where s is successes and n is trials. This gives (16+1)/(16+2) = 17/18 ≈ 94.4%.
- **Prior:** I will set a strong prior probability of **95%** that martial law will be extended. This reflects the powerful precedent and the routine nature of the extensions. In odds, this is 19 to 1 in favor.

**2. Comparison to Base Case**
- **Similarities:** The fundamental condition that has driven all 16 previous extensions—the ongoing, large-scale conventional war with Russia—remains unchanged. The legal framework, including the constitutional prohibition on holding elections under martial law, is the same. The key political actors and institutions (President, Verkhovna Rada) are the same.
- **Differences:** The primary difference is the cumulative effect of nearly four years of war. This includes increased societal fatigue, economic strain, and declining (though still majority) approval ratings for the leadership. However, these pressures do not alter the core military and constitutional reasons for maintaining martial law.

**3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
Let H be the event "Ukraine extends martial law," and ~H be "Ukraine does not extend martial law."

- **Evidence 1: Continued high-intensity warfare.** The research report notes a significant Russian offensive in September 2025. Active combat makes the powers granted by martial law (e.g., mobilization, curfews, resource allocation) essential for national defense.
    - P(E | H) is very high. The war is the reason for the extension.
    - P(E | ~H) is extremely low. Ending martial law during active combat would be a catastrophic strategic error.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large and positive (>>1). This evidence strongly increases the probability.

- **Evidence 2: Constitutional barrier to elections.** The Ukrainian constitution prohibits national elections while martial law is in effect. Ending martial law would trigger a constitutional requirement to hold elections, which are logistically impossible and strategically dangerous to conduct with millions of displaced citizens and ongoing security threats.
    - P(E | H) is very high. Extending martial law is the only practical way to avoid this constitutional and security crisis.
    - P(E | ~H) is very low. It would require the government to have an unworkable plan for wartime elections.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Very large and positive (>>1). This structural factor makes non-extension almost untenable.

- **Evidence 3: Official government statements.** The head of the President's office stated on October 10, 2025, that "all necessary legal measures to ensure the defense of the state will continue."
    - P(E | H) is very high. This is a clear signal of intent.
    - P(E | ~H) is very low. This statement would be deceptive or nonsensical if the government planned to let martial law expire.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Large and positive (>1). This directly confirms the executive branch's position.

- **Evidence 4: War fatigue and declining approval ratings.** The August 2025 Gallup poll shows public weariness.
    - P(E | H) is plausible. The government can extend martial law out of necessity even as the public grows tired.
    - P(E | ~H) is also plausible. In theory, public pressure could force a change.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Close to 1, perhaps slightly negative (<1). While fatigue is a real political factor, there is no evidence it has translated into a serious political movement to end martial law *while the war rages*. The security imperative still dominates the political calculus. This evidence has a negligible-to-small negative impact.

**4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
- **Prior Odds:** 19 to 1 (from 95% probability).
- **Updating:** The evidence is overwhelmingly confirmatory. The combination of ongoing war, the constitutional lock, and direct government statements creates an extremely high likelihood ratio in favor of extension. The slight counter-evidence from war fatigue is insufficient to meaningfully alter the outcome.
- **Calculation Sketch:** Let's apply a conservative combined likelihood ratio of 5 for the strong positive evidence.
    - Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 19 × 5 = 95 to 1.
    - Posterior Probability = 95 / (95 + 1) = 98.9%.
- **Summary:** The evidence strongly reinforces the already high prior. The resulting posterior probability is very close to 100%.

**5. Red Team Thinking**
- **Alternative Scenario:** What is the strongest argument for "No"? The only plausible path to non-extension is a sudden, dramatic change in the war's status before November 5. This would require a "black swan" event like a sudden, credible, and comprehensive ceasefire agreement, or a political collapse in Moscow leading to an immediate troop withdrawal.
- **Plausibility:** Given the date is October 17, 2025, the window for such a paradigm-shifting event to occur and be implemented is less than three weeks. The probability of this is extremely low.
- **Overconfidence Check:** A forecast of 99% implies a 1-in-100 chance of being wrong. This seems appropriate for the level of certainty here. The causal chain is direct and powerful: as long as the war continues in its current state, the extension of martial law is a political, legal, and military necessity. The alternative is almost unthinkable.

**6. Final Forecast**
The base rate established by 16 prior extensions is extremely high. The current evidence—most notably the continuation of intense warfare and the constitutional impossibility of holding elections—overwhelmingly supports another extension. The short timeframe until the November 5 deadline leaves virtually no room for the fundamental strategic situation to change. The alternative scenarios are of exceptionally low probability. Therefore, the probability of an extension is near-certain.

Final: 99%
