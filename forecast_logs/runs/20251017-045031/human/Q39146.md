### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: World Championship Winners by Region (2011-2024).** This is the broadest and most reliable class. In the 14 tournaments held, 8 winners were from South Korea (LCK), 4 from China (LPL), 1 from Taiwan (LMS, now part of APAC's PCS), and 1 from Europe (LEC/EMEA).
    -   **Base Rate (Regional):** LCK (South Korea): ~57%; LPL (China): ~29%; Other APAC: ~7%; EMEA: ~7%; Americas: 0%. The probability of an Asia-Pacific team (LCK, LPL, etc.) winning is ~93%.
    -   **Limitations:** This long-term data may not fully capture recent shifts in regional power, although the LCK/LPL duopoly has been stable for a decade.

-   **Reference Class 2: Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) Winner's Performance at Worlds (same year).** This class is more specific, focusing on teams that proved their international strength mid-season. Since MSI's inception in 2015, the MSI winner has gone on to win Worlds in the same year 3 out of 9 times (2015 EDG failed, 2016 SKT succeeded, 2017 SKT failed, 2018 RNG failed, 2019 G2 failed, 2021 RNG failed, 2022 RNG failed, 2023 JDG failed, 2024 Gen.G failed).
    -   **Base Rate (MSI Winner):** The MSI champion wins Worlds ~33% of the time.
    -   **Limitations:** Small sample size. The format of both tournaments has changed over time. However, it serves as a crucial check against over-weighting an MSI victory.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-09-28] Gen.G wins the LCK single-season championship over Hanwha Life Esports. — ↑ Gen.G — Confirmed their status as the undisputed best team in the historically strongest region, securing the top seed for Worlds.
-   [2025-07-21] Gen.G wins the Esports World Cup (EWC), defeating China's Anyone's Legend 3-2. — ↑ Gen.G, ↑ APAC — Another major international tournament victory, reinforcing their dominance over top competition from other regions, specifically China's LPL.
-   [2025-07-13] Gen.G wins the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), defeating fellow Korean team T1 3-2. — ↑ Gen.G, ↑ APAC — This was the most significant international event of the year. Winning it established Gen.G as the best team in the world mid-way through the season.
-   [2025-10-13] Multiple outlets release pre-tournament power rankings, placing Gen.G at #1. — ↑ Gen.G — Reflects a strong, unanimous expert consensus that Gen.G is the clear favorite entering the tournament.
-   [2025-10-16] Gen.G's mid-laner, 'Chovy', is widely cited as the best player in the world. — ↑ Gen.G — Individual player form is a critical component of team success, and having the consensus best player provides a significant edge.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Regional Dominance (LCK/LPL):** The infrastructure, talent pool, and strategic depth in South Korea (LCK) and China (LPL) are far more developed than in other regions. This creates a high probability that the winner will emerge from this group. (Large impact).
-   **Team Form & Momentum:** Gen.G has won every significant domestic and international tournament in 2025. This level of sustained success creates momentum, confidence, and a well-practiced, versatile playstyle. (Large impact).
-   **Meta Adaptability:** The World Championship is played on a specific game patch. The team that best understands and innovates on the prevailing strategies ("the meta") gains a massive advantage. This is the largest source of potential variance and upsets. (Large impact).
-   **Individual Player Skill:** Elite players, particularly in key "carry" roles, can single-handedly turn the tide of a game. Gen.G's roster, led by Chovy, is considered to be at the peak of individual performance. (Moderate impact).
-   **Knockout Stage Pressure:** The single-elimination format of the final bracket means one bad day can end a tournament run. Mental fortitude and "clutch" performance under extreme pressure are crucial. (Moderate impact).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented Single-Season Dominance:** It is extremely rare for one team to win its domestic league, MSI, and another major international event (EWC) in the same year. This level of sustained dominance makes Gen.G a stronger favorite than a typical #1 seed from the base rate.
-   **Consensus Favorite:** Unlike some years with multiple top contenders (e.g., a top LCK team and a top LPL team with comparable achievements), in 2025, there is a single, undisputed favorite in Gen.G. The gap between them and the next tier of teams appears larger than usual.
-   **Stability of Roster:** Gen.G has maintained a stable and cohesive roster throughout their dominant 2025 run, which is a key factor in their consistent performance, contrasting with teams that may have made mid-season changes.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on historical regional strength (Reference Class 1). An Asia-Pacific team winning is a very strong prior (~93%), with LCK (~57%) being the most likely region. Equivalent n ≈ 14 (past tournaments).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑ (Large) Gen.G's MSI victory provides the strongest cross-regional signal of superiority.
    -   ↑ (Moderate) Gen.G's EWC victory reinforces the MSI result against another top international team.
    -   ↑ (Moderate) Gen.G's domestic LCK title confirms their regional dominance was not a fluke.
    -   ↑ (Moderate) Unanimous expert consensus placing Gen.G as the #1 favorite solidifies the narrative and reduces the likelihood of overlooked weaknesses.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests concentrating a significant portion of the probability mass onto a single outcome: Gen.G winning. The prior for LCK winning should be updated upwards, with almost all of that increase allocated to Gen.G specifically. The probability for "An Asia-Pacific team" should move very close to 100%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (for Gen.G):**
    -   A dominant, undefeated, or near-undefeated run through the tournament's opening (Swiss) stage.
    -   Demonstrating mastery over multiple strategies, not relying on a single style.
    -   Key players (Chovy, Peyz) maintaining their high statistical performance (KDA, damage output).
    -   Cleanly winning the draft phase against other top-tier teams.

-   **DOWN indicators (for Gen.G):**
    -   Struggling or dropping multiple games in the Swiss stage, especially to lower-seeded teams.
    -   Another team, particularly from the LPL (e.g., BLG, TES), looking unexpectedly dominant on the Worlds patch.
    -   Showing a clear weakness against a specific champion or strategy that opponents begin to exploit.
    -   Losing in a best-of-five series during the knockout stage.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **The Worlds Patch Meta:** The single largest unknown. A significant shift in the game's balance could neutralize Gen.G's practiced strengths and elevate a team whose style is better suited to the new patch.
-   **Single-Elimination Bracket Variance:** The tournament favorite fails to win more often than not. A single bad day, a poor draft, or an opponent's surprise strategy can lead to an upset in a best-of-five series.
-   **The "Curse" of the Favorite:** The immense pressure and scrutiny on a dominant favorite can sometimes lead to underperformance. Historically, teams with this much hype have faltered (e.g., 2018 RNG, 2023 JDG).
-   **Information Asymmetry:** While Gen.G won MSI and EWC, teams evolve significantly in the months leading up to Worlds. The true strength of top LPL teams, who have been scrimmaging internally, may be understated.

### Final Research Summary
Gen.G enters the 2025 World Championship on the back of one of the most dominant single seasons in League of Legends history. The combination of their international and domestic titles makes them the overwhelming, consensus favorite, far more so than a typical top-seeded team. While the inherent variance of the tournament format and meta shifts provides a path for an upset, all available evidence points to a Gen.G victory.

To forecast the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Gen.G**: Given their dominance in 2025, winning the LCK, MSI, and EWC, Gen.G is the clear favorite. Historically, LCK teams have a ~57% win rate at Worlds. Given Gen.G's exceptional year, we start with a higher prior for them.
- **Other LCK Teams (T1, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster)**: These teams benefit from the LCK's historical strength, but Gen.G's dominance reduces their individual probabilities.
- **LPL Teams (Bilibili Gaming, Anyone's Legend, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming)**: LPL teams have a ~29% historical win rate. Given the competitive nature of the LPL, these teams are strong contenders.
- **Other Regions (EMEA, Americas, Other APAC)**: Historically, these regions have a much lower chance of winning, with EMEA having a single win and Americas having none.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Gen.G**: Their dominance across multiple tournaments is unusual and strengthens their case compared to a typical LCK team.
- **Other LCK and LPL Teams**: While strong, they lack the same level of dominance Gen.G has shown this year.
- **Other Regions**: Historically weaker, and no significant evidence suggests a shift in power.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Gen.G**: Winning MSI, EWC, and LCK, and being the consensus #1, strongly supports their case. Likelihood of winning given this evidence is high.
- **Other LCK Teams**: While strong, they haven't shown the same level of dominance. Likelihood is moderate.
- **LPL Teams**: Historically strong, but no team has shown dominance like Gen.G. Likelihood is moderate.
- **Other Regions**: Lack of historical wins and current evidence makes their likelihood low.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Gen.G**: Start with a high prior due to LCK dominance (~57%). Evidence (MSI, EWC, LCK wins) significantly increases their probability.
- **Other LCK Teams**: Prior is reduced due to Gen.G's dominance.
- **LPL Teams**: Maintain a moderate probability due to historical strength.
- **Other Regions**: Low probability due to lack of evidence and historical wins.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence in Gen.G**: Consider the possibility of meta shifts or unexpected performances from other teams.
- **Alternative Scenarios**: An LPL team could emerge strong, or a meta shift could favor a non-LCK/LPL team.
- **Adjustments**: Slightly reduce Gen.G's probability to account for these uncertainties.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Gen.G: 45%  
T1: 10%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 5%  
KT Rolster: 5%  
Bilibili Gaming: 10%  
Anyone's Legend: 5%  
Top Esports: 5%  
Invictus Gaming: 5%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 5%  
An EMEA team: 3%  
An Americas team: 2%  

These probabilities reflect Gen.G's strong position while acknowledging the potential for upsets and the historical strength of LPL teams.

# Forecasting the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Winner

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option based on historical World Championship results:

**Regional Base Rates (2011-2024):**
- South Korean teams (LCK): ~57% (8/14 championships)
- Chinese teams (LPL): ~29% (4/14 championships)
- Other APAC: ~7% (1/14 championships)
- EMEA: ~7% (1/14 championships)
- Americas: 0% (0/14 championships)

**Team-Specific Base Rates:**
- For specific teams, I need to distribute the regional probability among active teams:
  - LCK (South Korea): T1, Hanwha Life Esports, KT Rolster, Gen.G (~14.25% each)
  - LPL (China): Bilibili Gaming, Anyone's Legend, Top Esports, Invictus Gaming (~7.25% each)

These base rates reflect the historical dominance of the LCK and LPL regions, with virtually no success from the Americas region.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Case:**
- The tournament structure remains similar to previous years
- The regional qualification system is consistent
- The dominance of Asian teams (particularly LCK and LPL) continues

**Key Differences:**
- Gen.G has demonstrated unprecedented dominance in 2025, winning:
  - LCK championship
  - Mid-Season Invitational (MSI)
  - Esports World Cup (EWC)
- This "triple crown" achievement is extremely rare and suggests Gen.G is significantly stronger than a typical favorite
- There is an unusually strong expert consensus that Gen.G is the clear favorite
- Gen.G's mid-laner Chovy is widely considered the best player in the world

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Gen.G's MSI Victory**
- P(MSI Win | Gen.G wins Worlds): Very high (~80%)
- P(MSI Win | Gen.G doesn't win Worlds): Low (~20%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 in favor of Gen.G

**Evidence 2: Gen.G's EWC Victory**
- P(EWC Win | Gen.G wins Worlds): High (~75%)
- P(EWC Win | Gen.G doesn't win Worlds): Low (~25%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 in favor of Gen.G

**Evidence 3: Gen.G's LCK Championship**
- P(LCK Win | Gen.G wins Worlds): High (~70%)
- P(LCK Win | Gen.G doesn't win Worlds): Moderate (~30%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.3:1 in favor of Gen.G

**Evidence 4: Expert Consensus on Gen.G as #1**
- P(Expert Consensus | Gen.G wins Worlds): Very high (~85%)
- P(Expert Consensus | Gen.G doesn't win Worlds): Low (~15%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~5.7:1 in favor of Gen.G

**Evidence 5: Chovy as Best Player**
- P(Best Player | Gen.G wins Worlds): High (~70%)
- P(Best Player | Gen.G doesn't win Worlds): Moderate (~30%)
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.3:1 in favor of Gen.G

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Starting with Gen.G's prior of ~14.25% (as one of four major LCK teams):

**Update on MSI Victory:**
- Prior odds: 14.25% / 85.75% = 0.166
- Posterior odds: 0.166 × 4 = 0.664
- Posterior probability: 0.664 / (1 + 0.664) = 39.9%

**Update on EWC Victory:**
- Prior odds: 0.399 / 0.601 = 0.664
- Posterior odds: 0.664 × 3 = 1.992
- Posterior probability: 1.992 / (1 + 1.992) = 66.6%

**Update on LCK Championship:**
- Prior odds: 0.666 / 0.334 = 1.994
- Posterior odds: 1.994 × 2.3 = 4.586
- Posterior probability: 4.586 / (1 + 4.586) = 82.1%

**Update on Expert Consensus:**
- Prior odds: 0.821 / 0.179 = 4.586
- Posterior odds: 4.586 × 5.7 = 26.14
- Posterior probability: 26.14 / (1 + 26.14) = 96.3%

This is likely overconfident, so I'll adjust downward to account for tournament variance.

For other teams, I'll adjust their probabilities downward proportionally to accommodate Gen.G's increased probability.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Overconfidence:**
- The "curse of the favorite" is real in esports - highly favored teams often underperform due to pressure
- MSI winners have only won Worlds in the same year 33% of the time (3/9 instances)
- The tournament meta (game balance) could shift dramatically before the finals, potentially disadvantaging Gen.G
- Single-elimination format creates high variance; one bad day can eliminate even the strongest team

**Alternative Scenarios:**
- Another LCK team (particularly T1) could peak at the right time
- A top LPL team could have been "sandbagging" (hiding strategies) during earlier tournaments
- The Worlds patch could favor a different playstyle than what Gen.G excels at

**Adjustments:**
- I'll reduce Gen.G's probability from the calculated 96.3% to a more reasonable ~45%
- I'll distribute remaining probability mass to other top contenders, particularly other LCK teams and top LPL teams

## 6. Final Normalization

After adjusting for overconfidence and tournament variance:

- Gen.G: 45% (dominant 2025 performance but tournament variance is high)
- T1: 15% (strong LCK team with championship pedigree)
- Bilibili Gaming: 10% (top LPL contender)
- Hanwha Life Esports: 8% (LCK finalist)
- Top Esports: 7% (strong LPL team)
- KT Rolster: 5% (solid LCK team)
- Anyone's Legend: 4% (EWC finalist)
- Invictus Gaming: 3% (former champion, but less consistent recently)
- An EMEA team: 2% (historically less competitive)
- An Asia-Pacific team: 1% (excluding teams already listed)
- An Americas team: 0% (historically unsuccessful at Worlds)

## 7. Final Forecast

T1: 15%  
Hanwha Life Esports: 8%  
KT Rolster: 5%  
Gen.G: 45%  
Bilibili Gaming: 10%  
Anyone's Legend: 4%  
Top Esports: 7%  
Invictus Gaming: 3%  
An Asia-Pacific team: 1%  
An EMEA team: 2%  
An Americas team: 0%  
(sum 100%)

Here is a probabilistic forecast for the winner of the 2025 League of Legends World Championship.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary base rate is the historical distribution of World Championship winners by region from 2011 to 2024 (14 tournaments). This provides the most robust long-term data on regional strength.

*   **South Korea (LCK):** 8 wins (~57%)
*   **China (LPL):** 4 wins (~29%)
*   **Taiwan/SEA (LMS/PCS, part of APAC):** 1 win (~7%)
*   **Europe (LEC, part of EMEA):** 1 win (~7%)
*   **Americas (LCS/CBLOL):** 0 wins (0%)

From this, I establish the following regional priors:
*   **P(Asia-Pacific win):** ~93% (LCK + LPL + PCS)
*   **P(EMEA win):** ~7%
*   **P(Americas win):** <1% (I will use 1% to account for the possibility of a massive upset).

For individual teams, a naive prior would distribute the regional probability among its qualified teams. For example, a top-seeded LCK team might start with a prior of ~15-20%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The tournament format, featuring a multi-stage process culminating in a single-elimination bracket, remains. The general dominance of the LCK and LPL regions over the West is also consistent with the historical base case.
*   **Differences:** The key difference in 2025 is the unprecedented single-season dominance of one team, Gen.G. They have won their domestic LCK title, the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), and the Esports World Cup (EWC). It is extremely rare for one team to enter Worlds with such a clean sweep of major domestic and international titles. This makes Gen.G a much stronger favorite than a typical #1 seed from the base rate, suggesting probability should be more concentrated on them.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the evidence primarily as it pertains to Gen.G's chances (H) versus the rest of the field (~H).

*   **Evidence 1: Gen.G won MSI & EWC.**
    *   P(E | Gen.G wins Worlds) is high. Winning prior international tournaments is a strong indicator of the strength required to win Worlds.
    *   P(E | Gen.G does not win Worlds) is much lower. It is rare for one team to win both events.
    *   This evidence provides a very strong likelihood ratio in favor of Gen.G being the eventual champion compared to any other team.

*   **Evidence 2: Gen.G won the LCK Championship.**
    *   This confirms their dominance within the historically strongest region. While expected for a Worlds favorite, it solidifies their position and eliminates the possibility of a domestic slump. It moderately increases their probability of winning.

*   **Evidence 3: Unanimous expert power rankings place Gen.G at #1.**
    *   This is a signal that the market of experts agrees with the strength shown by their results. It reduces the chance that we are overlooking a key weakness or a rising challenger. This moderately strengthens the case for Gen.G.

*   **Counter-Evidence: The "Favorite's Curse".**
    *   Historically, overwhelming favorites have often failed to win Worlds (e.g., 2018 RNG, 2023 JDG). The high-variance, single-elimination bracket and meta shifts on the "Worlds patch" are major hurdles. This evidence tempers the update from the positive signals and prevents assigning an excessively high probability (>50%) to Gen.G.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

I will start with a prior for a generic LCK #1 seed at ~20% and update based on the evidence.

*   **Prior:** P(Gen.G wins) = 20%. Prior Odds = 0.20 / 0.80 = 0.25.
*   **Update:** The evidence of winning MSI, EWC, and the LCK, plus the unanimous expert consensus, is exceptionally strong. This represents a much stronger profile than almost any previous favorite. A simple model for winning the tournament is winning three consecutive best-of-five series in the knockout stage. Even for a dominant team, assigning a win probability higher than 75-80% per series is difficult. A 75% chance per series results in a ~42% overall probability (0.75^3). Given the historical failure of favorites, I will adjust this down slightly.
*   **Posterior for Gen.G:** I assess the evidence as roughly doubling the initial prior, moving it to **38%**. This makes them a strong favorite but gives the field a 62% chance, acknowledging the tournament's high variance.

The remaining 62% is distributed among other teams, primarily the other top contenders from the LCK and LPL, reflecting their status as the next most likely winners. T1 (MSI finalist) and BLG (top LPL team) receive the next largest shares. The regional probabilities are adjusted to reflect LCK's superior international performance in 2025.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My biggest concern is overconfidence in Gen.G. A 38% probability for one team is very high. The most likely failure mode is a significant meta shift on the Worlds patch that neutralizes Gen.G's strengths and benefits another team, like BLG or T1, who adapt more quickly. The single-elimination bracket means one bad day or one poor draft can end their run. I have capped Gen.G's probability below 40% to account for this significant variance, which is a very real and historically supported risk. The alternative forecast would have Gen.G closer to 25-30% and distribute that probability among T1, BLG, and HLE, creating a flatter distribution among the top 4 contenders. However, I believe Gen.G's 2025 record is so exceptionally strong that it justifies the larger separation from the pack.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are distributed as follows, summing to 100%. The hierarchy places Gen.G as the clear favorite, followed by a tier of top LCK/LPL contenders (T1, BLG, HLE), then other strong teams, with small probabilities for major regional upsets.

*   **LCK Teams Total:** 38% + 13% + 9% + 5% = 65% (Updated from 57% base rate)
*   **LPL Teams Total:** 11% + 7% + 7% + 4% = 29% (Same as 29% base rate)
*   **Other APAC:** 3%
*   **EMEA:** 2%
