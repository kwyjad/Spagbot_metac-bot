### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States re-acquiring nuclear weapons after disarmament:** The most specific reference class consists of states that possessed nuclear weapons and then voluntarily gave them up. This class includes Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan (who inherited Soviet arsenals), and South Africa (who developed its own and then dismantled it). **The base rate for this class is 0%.** No state has ever re-started a nuclear weapons program after full disarmament. This is a very strong prior against the event.
2.  **New states developing nuclear weapons post-NPT (1970):** A broader class includes all non-nuclear-weapon states party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that subsequently developed weapons. Since 1970, only North Korea has successfully developed and tested a weapon after joining and then withdrawing from the NPT. India, Pakistan, and Israel developed weapons but were never NPT signatories. This suggests a very low rate of proliferation from within the NPT regime, roughly 1 case in ~50 years among ~190 signatories, or **<<1% per country-year.**
3.  **States with "nuclear latency" developing weapons:** This class includes countries with the technical and material capacity to build a weapon but which have not done so (e.g., Japan, Germany, Brazil). The rate of conversion from latent to active weapons state is extremely low, arguably zero in the post-NPT era, as no such state has made the political decision to "break out."

**Limitations:** Ukraine's situation is historically unique. It is the first state to have given up nuclear weapons and subsequently been invaded by the very power that gave it security "assurances." This unique context may weaken the predictive power of historical base rates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-02-27** Filling the Security Void of the Budapest Memorandum article published — **↑ (small)** — Highlights the ongoing, high-level discourse in Ukraine and among its allies about the failure of past assurances, reinforcing the motive for a sovereign deterrent.
*   **2025-01-28** Zelenskyy expresses deep regret over giving up nukes, calling it a "blunder" — **↑ (small)** — Strongest rhetoric to date from the highest level. Signals that the nuclear option is being actively discussed as a strategic alternative, increasing its political viability.
*   **2025-01-15** West Point Lieber Institute symposium on the Budapest Memorandum's failure — **↑ (small)** — Academic and military analysis reinforcing the lesson that non-binding assurances are worthless, which strengthens the argument for a domestic deterrent in Kyiv.
*   **2024-12-05** Zelenskyy states the Budapest Memorandum "not a single day...did this document work" on its 30th anniversary — **↑ (small)** — Keeps the failure of disarmament at the forefront of Ukrainian national security discourse, justifying a potential policy shift.
*   **2023-2025 (Ongoing)** Continuous IAEA presence and monitoring at all Ukrainian nuclear power plants — **↓ (large)** — Makes diversion of nuclear material for a clandestine weapons program extremely difficult and highly likely to be detected quickly, a major technical and political obstacle.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Failure of International Security Guarantees (↑, Large):** The collapse of the Budapest Memorandum is the primary driver. It creates a powerful, existential incentive for Ukraine to develop its own ultimate deterrent, as external promises have proven unreliable against Russian aggression.
2.  **Dependency on Western Military & Financial Aid (↓, Large):** Ukraine's war effort and economy are entirely dependent on support from a coalition of states (led by the US) that are strongly committed to non-proliferation. Launching a nuclear program would almost certainly sever this lifeline, constituting strategic suicide.
3.  **Risk of Russian Pre-emptive Strike (↓, Large):** A nascent Ukrainian nuclear program would be the highest-priority target for Russia. Moscow would likely use overwhelming conventional or even tactical nuclear force to destroy any suspected facilities before they could become operational, making the attempt incredibly risky.
4.  **Path to NATO/EU Membership (↓, Moderate):** A credible, accelerated path to NATO membership, with its Article 5 security guarantee, would be a viable alternative to a domestic nuclear deterrent. Progress on this front significantly reduces the incentive for Ukraine to proliferate. Conversely, indefinite delays would increase it.
5.  **Technical & Resource Constraints (↓, Moderate):** While Ukraine has latent capabilities (scientists, raw materials, missile tech), it lacks the specific enrichment or reprocessing facilities needed for fissile material. Building these during a full-scale war, under constant surveillance, while resources are stretched thin, is a monumental challenge. The timeline to a credible program likely exceeds the 2026 horizon.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Existential Threat Level:** Unlike most NPT members or latent nuclear states, Ukraine is fighting a full-scale conventional war for its survival against a nuclear-armed aggressor that explicitly threatens its existence. This provides a motive of unparalleled intensity.
*   **Unprecedented Betrayal:** Ukraine is the only country to have been invaded by a signatory of its own security assurance document (the Budapest Memorandum), creating a unique and powerful "lesson learned" that could override standard non-proliferation norms.
*   **Extreme International Scrutiny:** Unlike clandestine programs in North Korea or Pakistan, Ukraine's nuclear energy sites are under constant, on-site monitoring by the IAEA. This makes diversion of materials for a weapons program exceptionally difficult to conceal.
*   **Unprecedented Foreign Dependence:** Ukraine's ability to resist Russia is wholly contingent on Western support. This gives its allies immense leverage to prevent proliferation, a situation not present for past proliferators like India or North Korea, who were not similarly dependent during their program's development.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<2%) based on the reference class of zero states ever re-acquiring nuclear weapons after disarmament (equivalent n > 50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The intensity of the existential threat and the complete failure of the Budapest Memorandum provide a powerful motive that historical cases lack.
    *   ↑ (Small): Repeated high-level rhetoric from Ukrainian officials (Zelenskyy, Melnyk) indicates the option is no longer taboo and is part of the strategic calculus.
    *   ↓ (Large): Overwhelming dependency on Western aid creates a veto point for the US and allies, who would not tolerate proliferation. This is the single strongest factor against.
    *   ↓ (Large): The high probability of detection by the IAEA and a subsequent pre-emptive Russian strike makes the endeavor prohibitively risky.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): The short timeline to Jan 2026 is likely insufficient to stand up a program credible enough to be reported, given the technical hurdles and wartime conditions.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for "No" (dependency, risk, timeline) is far stronger and more immediate than the evidence for "Yes" (motive, rhetoric). The posterior should remain very low, likely in the low single digits (<5%).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any Ukrainian attempt to restrict or expel IAEA inspectors from its nuclear facilities.
    *   A significant, long-term collapse in Western military support for Ukraine.
    *   Intelligence reports (e.g., from the US or UK) of suspicious construction at sites like the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology or near uranium processing facilities.
    *   Official statements from Kyiv that Ukraine is formally withdrawing from the NPT.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A formal invitation for Ukraine to join NATO or the signing of a binding, bilateral defense treaty with the United States.
    *   A sustainable ceasefire or peace agreement that secures Ukrainian sovereignty.
    *   New IAEA reports explicitly confirming all nuclear material in Ukraine remains accounted for under safeguards.
    *   Significant Ukrainian battlefield successes that reduce the immediate existential threat from Russia.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Program":** The resolution hinges on a "credible report." This is ambiguous. A research project or computer simulation could be considered a "program" by some, even if years from producing a weapon. A Russian disinformation campaign could also aim to trigger this resolution.
*   **Clandestine Activity:** Despite IAEA monitoring of known sites, a small-scale, clandestine effort (e.g., a plutonium reprocessing "hot cell") could escape detection, though this is difficult and unlikely to scale.
*   **Political Volatility:** A radical change in Ukrainian leadership or a catastrophic turn in the war could alter the current cost-benefit analysis, making a high-risk gamble on nuclear weapons seem more palatable.
*   **False Positives:** A report could emerge that meets the criteria but is later proven false after the one-month retraction window. The resolution criteria are based on the report's existence, not its ultimate truth.

**Final Research Summary:**
While Ukraine's motive to acquire nuclear weapons is at an all-time high due to the failure of past security assurances, the overwhelming constraints—primarily its total dependence on Western aid and the extreme risk of a Russian pre-emptive strike—make the launching of a program before 2026 exceptionally unlikely.

To forecast the probability of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most specific reference class is states that have re-acquired nuclear weapons after disarmament. The base rate for this class is 0%, as no state has ever restarted a nuclear weapons program after full disarmament. This provides a very strong prior against the event.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the historical precedent, the initial prior probability is extremely low, less than 2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Ukraine, like other states in the reference class, has previously disarmed and is under international scrutiny.
- **Differences:** Ukraine faces an existential threat from Russia, a unique situation compared to other disarmed states. This increases the motive for a nuclear program, but the dependency on Western aid and international monitoring are significant deterrents.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Existential Threat (↑, Moderate):** The ongoing war with Russia and the failure of the Budapest Memorandum provide a strong motive for Ukraine to consider nuclear weapons. This increases the likelihood of the event.
- **Western Dependency (↓, Large):** Ukraine's reliance on Western military and financial support acts as a strong deterrent against starting a nuclear program. This decreases the likelihood significantly.
- **IAEA Monitoring (↓, Large):** Continuous monitoring by the IAEA makes it difficult for Ukraine to develop nuclear weapons clandestinely. This is a major obstacle.
- **Technical Constraints (↓, Moderate):** Ukraine lacks the necessary facilities and resources to quickly develop a nuclear program, especially under wartime conditions.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Let's assume a prior probability of 2%, which translates to prior odds of 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 0.0204.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards "No" due to Western dependency and IAEA monitoring.
- **Posterior Odds:** Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio. Given the strong evidence against, the likelihood ratio is much less than 1, leading to even lower posterior odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability remains very low, likely below 5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The unique geopolitical situation could lead to unexpected developments. However, the constraints are substantial.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A drastic change in Western support or a significant shift in Ukrainian leadership could alter the calculus, but these remain unlikely.
- **Rebuttals:** The risk of a Russian pre-emptive strike and the technical challenges are significant deterrents that are unlikely to change in the short term.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential scenarios, the probability of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is very low.

Final: 3%

# Will Ukraine launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

1. **States re-acquiring nuclear weapons after disarmament**: Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and South Africa all gave up nuclear weapons. None have restarted nuclear programs. Base rate: 0%.

2. **NPT signatories developing weapons post-signing**: Only North Korea has successfully developed nuclear weapons after joining and then withdrawing from the NPT. With ~190 signatories over ~50 years, this gives a rate of approximately 0.01% per country-year.

3. **States under existential threat developing nuclear weapons**: Israel developed weapons when facing existential threats, but most threatened states have not (e.g., Taiwan, South Korea).

Given these reference classes, I'll start with a very low prior of **2%**. This acknowledges the extremely rare nature of nuclear proliferation generally, and especially for former nuclear states that voluntarily disarmed.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Ukraine is a signatory to the NPT with international monitoring
- Ukraine has made public commitments to non-proliferation
- The international community strongly opposes new nuclear states

**Key differences:**
- Ukraine is experiencing an unprecedented situation: being invaded by the nuclear power that provided security guarantees after disarmament
- Ukrainian officials have explicitly mentioned reconsidering nuclear status
- Ukraine has some technical prerequisites (nuclear industry, uranium deposits, missile technology)
- Ukraine is in an active war with its survival at stake

These differences suggest some upward pressure on the base rate, but the constraints remain formidable.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for launching a nuclear program:**

1. **Official statements about reconsidering nuclear status**
   - P(E|H): ~90% (If Ukraine were planning a program, such statements would be likely)
   - P(E|~H): ~30% (These could be political posturing even without actual plans)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (Moderate increase in probability)

2. **Ukraine's existential threat from Russia**
   - P(E|H): ~95% (An existential threat is almost necessary for such a decision)
   - P(E|~H): ~95% (The threat exists regardless of nuclear decision)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.0 (Neutral)

3. **Technical capabilities and prerequisites**
   - P(E|H): ~100% (Nuclear program requires these capabilities)
   - P(E|~H): ~90% (These capabilities exist for civilian purposes too)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~1.1 (Slight increase)

**Evidence against launching a nuclear program:**

1. **Dependency on Western aid**
   - P(E|H): ~10% (Unlikely to see continued Western support if pursuing nukes)
   - P(E|~H): ~90% (Western support continues without nuclear pursuit)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.11 (Strong decrease in probability)

2. **IAEA monitoring of nuclear facilities**
   - P(E|H): ~20% (Difficult to divert materials under monitoring)
   - P(E|~H): ~95% (Normal monitoring continues)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.21 (Strong decrease)

3. **Risk of Russian pre-emptive strikes**
   - P(E|H): ~30% (Would accept this risk if pursuing nukes)
   - P(E|~H): ~90% (No additional risk beyond current war)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.33 (Moderate decrease)

4. **Short timeline to 2026**
   - P(E|H): ~30% (Difficult to establish a program in this timeframe)
   - P(E|~H): ~95% (Normal timeline constraints)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.32 (Moderate decrease)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2:98 (2% probability), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on Western aid dependency:**
- Prior odds: 2:98 = 0.0204
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.0204 × 0.11 = 0.00224
- Posterior probability: 0.00224/(1+0.00224) ≈ 0.22%

**Update on IAEA monitoring:**
- Prior odds: 0.0022:0.9978 = 0.00224
- Likelihood ratio: 0.21
- Posterior odds: 0.00224 × 0.21 = 0.00047
- Posterior probability: 0.00047/(1+0.00047) ≈ 0.05%

**Update on official statements:**
- Prior odds: 0.0005:0.9995 = 0.00047
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.00047 × 3.0 = 0.00141
- Posterior probability: 0.00141/(1+0.00141) ≈ 0.14%

**Update on timeline constraints:**
- Prior odds: 0.0014:0.9986 = 0.00141
- Likelihood ratio: 0.32
- Posterior odds: 0.00141 × 0.32 = 0.00045
- Posterior probability: 0.00045/(1+0.00045) ≈ 0.05%

After these updates, the probability is extremely low, around 0.05%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may underestimate Ukraine's desperation if the war worsens dramatically
- A clandestine program might exist that hasn't been detected
- The definition of "nuclear weapons program" could include preliminary research that falls short of actual weapons development
- Western support might collapse, removing a key constraint

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Ukraine might initiate a very small-scale research program that technically qualifies but isn't detected until after 2026
- A false report meeting the resolution criteria could emerge (e.g., Russian disinformation)

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should increase my estimate slightly to account for definitional ambiguity and the possibility of undetected activities. However, the fundamental constraints remain overwhelming.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and constraints, particularly Ukraine's dependency on Western support, IAEA monitoring, the risk of Russian pre-emptive strikes, and the short timeline to 2026, I assess the probability as very low but not zero.

Final: 1%

```md

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast following the specified steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider the most relevant reference classes:

1.  **States Re-acquiring Nuclear Weapons After Disarmament:** This is the most specific reference class. It includes Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan (who inherited and surrendered Soviet weapons), and South Africa (who built and then dismantled its own program). In this class, zero states have ever restarted a nuclear weapons program after full disarmament. This suggests a base rate of **0%**, or at least a very low number, given the small sample size.
2.  **New States Developing Nuclear Weapons Post-NPT:** A broader class includes all non-nuclear-weapon states party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since 1970, only North Korea has developed a weapon after being a signatory (it later withdrew). This represents one case among ~190 signatories over ~55 years, an extremely low rate of proliferation (<0.1% per country-year).

Given the strong international norms and historical precedent, I will select a very low prior probability. A prior of **1%** seems appropriate. This acknowledges that the event is not impossible while reflecting its extreme historical rarity. In odds form, this is 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like other NPT signatories, Ukraine is subject to IAEA inspections and is integrated into the international community, which strongly opposes proliferation.
*   **Differences:** Ukraine's situation is historically unique and deviates significantly from the base case.
    *   **Existential Motive:** Ukraine is fighting a full-scale war for its survival against a nuclear-armed aggressor that has repeatedly issued nuclear threats. This motive is far stronger than for any other state in the reference class.
    *   **Failed Security Assurances:** Ukraine is the only country to have been invaded by a signatory of its own security assurance document (the Budapest Memorandum). This provides a powerful, specific rationale for seeking a sovereign deterrent that other nations lack.
    *   **Unprecedented Foreign Dependence:** Conversely, Ukraine's ability to fight is entirely dependent on military and financial aid from Western powers, primarily the US, who are staunchly committed to non-proliferation. This gives its allies immense leverage to prevent such a program, a constraint not faced by past proliferators like North Korea or Pakistan.

The extreme motive pushes the probability up, while the extreme dependency pushes it down, making the situation highly unusual.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their effect on the probability.

*   **Evidence Increasing Probability:**
    *   **Failure of the Budapest Memorandum & Official Rhetoric:** The complete failure of past security guarantees, coupled with statements from President Zelenskyy and other officials regretting the decision to disarm, provides a powerful political and strategic justification for a nuclear program. This makes the topic less taboo and signals it is part of the strategic calculus. This evidence is more likely if Ukraine is considering a program (P(E|H)) than if it is not (P(E|~H)). This is a **moderate upward update**.

*   **Evidence Decreasing Probability:**
    *   **Dependence on Western Aid:** This is the single most powerful factor. Launching a nuclear program would almost certainly lead to the immediate suspension of Western aid, which would cause Ukraine's defenses to collapse. Therefore, starting a program is tantamount to strategic suicide under current conditions. The likelihood ratio P(E|H)/P(E|~H) is very small. This is a **large downward update**.
    *   **Risk of Russian Pre-emptive Strike:** Russia would view a Ukrainian nuclear program as an existential threat and would likely use overwhelming force to destroy it before it could become operational. The risk of triggering a catastrophic escalation for a program that may not succeed is a massive deterrent. This is a **large downward update**.
    *   **IAEA Monitoring:** The continuous presence of IAEA inspectors at all of Ukraine's declared nuclear facilities makes the diversion of materials for a clandestine program extremely difficult and highly likely to be detected quickly. This is a **strong downward update**.
    *   **Short Timeline:** The deadline is January 1, 2026. Developing the necessary infrastructure (e.g., enrichment or reprocessing facilities) and producing fissile material is a multi-year process, making it technically challenging to launch a meaningful program within this timeframe, especially during a full-scale war. This is a **moderate downward update**.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Let's start with the prior odds of 1:99 (1% probability).

1.  **Prior:** 1:99 odds.
2.  **Update for Motive/Rhetoric:** The powerful motive makes the "Yes" case more plausible than the base rate suggests. Let's say this increases the odds by a factor of 3, to 3:99. The probability is now ~3%.
3.  **Update for Constraints (Dependency & Pre-emption):** The combined effect of Western dependency and the risk of a Russian strike is an overwhelming deterrent. It is extremely unlikely Ukraine would start a program while these constraints are in place. This should reduce the odds dramatically. A conservative multiplier of 0.1 (a 10x reduction) seems appropriate. The odds become (3:99) * 0.1 = 3:990. The probability drops to ~0.3%.

This simple update shows that the current constraints are far more powerful than the motive. The posterior probability, based on the current situation, is very low, likely below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis suggests a very low probability. What could I be missing?

*   **The "Desperation" Scenario:** The biggest blind spot is a fundamental change in circumstances. The most plausible path to a "Yes" vote is a scenario where Western, particularly US, support collapses following a change in administration in 2025. If Ukraine is facing imminent defeat with no outside help, the rational calculation changes. A high-risk, high-reward nuclear gamble might seem like the only option left.
*   **The "Report" Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria hinge on a "credible report" of a "program," not a functional weapon. In a desperation scenario, Ukraine could make a political *announcement* that it is withdrawing from the NPT and beginning research. This would likely be reported by major media and trigger a "Yes" resolution, even if a physical weapon is years away.

Let's model this specific scenario:
*   P(A): Probability of a near-total collapse of US aid in 2025. This is a significant political uncertainty. Let's estimate this at 40%.
*   P(B|A): Probability that Ukraine, facing defeat, makes a political declaration about a nuclear program. This is still not guaranteed; they might pursue other options. But the temptation would be high. Let's estimate this at 10%.

The probability of this specific path is P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.40 * 0.10 = 0.04, or 4%.

This single, plausible (though uncertain) scenario is the primary driver of any non-trivial probability for this question. It accounts for a potential future state where the current, overwhelming constraints are removed.

### 6. Final Forecast

My initial analysis, based on the current strategic reality, yields a probability of <1%. However, the Red Team exercise identifies a plausible, politics-dependent scenario that could lead to a "Yes" resolution. This "desperation" scenario, driven by a potential collapse in US aid, combined with the soft resolution criteria (a "report" of a "program"), elevates the risk. Synthesizing the extremely low probability of a program under current conditions with the higher probability in a potential future scenario, I arrive at a final forecast that is low but non-negligible.

Final: 4%
