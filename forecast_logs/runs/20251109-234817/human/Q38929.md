### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Medical Cannabis Legalization:** This is the strongest reference class. Starting with California in 1996, it took 24 years for 36 states to legalize medical cannabis (~1.5 states/year). The initial adoption rate was much slower, with only 8 states legalizing in the first 10 years (0.8 states/year). Psilocybin therapy is in this early, slow-adoption phase. A base rate of **0.5 to 1 new state per year** seems plausible.
2.  **US Recreational Cannabis Legalization:** A more recent and faster-moving analogue. Since 2012, 24 states have legalized in ~12 years (~2 states/year). This likely represents an upper bound for psilocybin, which faces different therapeutic/medical regulatory hurdles and has less established public acceptance.
3.  **Novel State-Level Policy Adoption (General):** Policies like state lotteries or marriage equality often follow an S-curve of adoption: a slow start, a rapid acceleration as a tipping point is reached, and a slowdown as the remaining states hold out. Psilocybin therapy is unequivocally at the very beginning of this curve, where the rate of change is lowest.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-03] Head of FDA's drug center resigns amid controversy. (↓ small) — Leadership turmoil at the FDA can introduce minor delays and uncertainty into the broader regulatory environment for novel therapies, reinforcing a cautious federal stance.
*   [2025-09-10] California's psychedelic therapy bill (SB-58) is vetoed by the governor for the second year in a row. (↓ moderate) — Demonstrates that even in the most progressive states, legislative approval faces significant hurdles and is not guaranteed, slowing momentum for 2026 and beyond.
*   [2025-08-22] Colorado announces the first conditional licenses for psilocybin healing centers, with doors expected to open to clients by year-end. (↑ small) — A successful, on-schedule rollout in a second state provides a positive proof-of-concept for other states, but does not change the total count for the 2025 deadline.
*   [2025-06-04] An FDA advisory committee votes overwhelmingly against recommending MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. (↓ moderate) — This major setback for a similar psychedelic therapy signals a highly skeptical federal regulatory climate, likely causing state legislators to adopt a more cautious "wait-and-see" approach.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **State Legislative Action (Large):** The primary path for new states. However, most state legislatures have adjourned for 2025 and will not reconvene until 2026. The odds of a special session for this topic are near zero.
*   **Ballot Initiatives (Large):** The path used by Oregon and Colorado. This is the most direct route via popular vote, but major initiatives are almost exclusively on ballots in even-numbered years (e.g., Nov 2024, Nov 2026). This lever is inactive for 2025.
*   **Implementation of Existing Laws (Moderate):** A state could have passed a law previously with a go-live date in late 2025. Currently, only Oregon and Colorado have passed such laws. Oregon is operational; Colorado is on the cusp. No other states are in this pipeline.
*   **Federal FDA Approval (Large):** FDA approval of a psilocybin-based drug (e.g., from Compass Pathways or Usona Institute) would be a paradigm shift. However, no application is currently before the FDA, and the review process takes 6-12+ months. This cannot happen by Dec 31, 2025.
*   **Programmatic Failure in Pioneer States (Moderate):** A major public health crisis or scandal in Oregon or Colorado could cause a program to be suspended, reducing the number. This remains a low-probability risk.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Therapeutic vs. Medical Model:** Unlike cannabis, which was often distributed through dispensaries, psilocybin is being legalized under a supervised, therapeutic model. This requires a much more complex and slow-to-build state-level regulatory infrastructure for facilitator training, licensing, and service centers.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in under two months. The base rate of ~1 state/year is an average; the probability of a state completing the entire legislative *and* implementation process in the final 52 days of the year is functionally zero.
*   **Lack of a "Pre-Legal" Industry:** Medical cannabis was often preceded by a robust black market and decriminalization, creating existing constituencies and business interests. The psilocybin movement is more driven by clinical research, non-profits, and biotech firms, leading to a more cautious and methodical rollout.
*   **Federal Skepticism:** The recent rejection of the MDMA application by an FDA advisory panel creates a stronger headwind than medical cannabis faced in its early days, where federal opposition was present but less tied to specific clinical trial data reviews.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The current number of states is 2 (Oregon, Colorado). The prior should be a very strong point mass on 2, reflecting the high inertia of state policy. An equivalent n of >100 would be appropriate, given the deterministic nature of legislative and implementation timelines.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Legislative calendars for 2025 are closed. No new state can pass and implement a law in time.
    *   (↓ Large) Implementation timelines for this complex therapy model are 18-24 months, as shown by Oregon and Colorado. No other state has a law already in the implementation pipeline.
    *   (↓ Large) The ballot initiative cycle is over until November 2026.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Federal headwinds from the MDMA adcomm vote discourage any remaining, albeit unlikely, legislative pushes.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly confirms the prior. The posterior distribution should be almost entirely concentrated on 2. The probability of the number changing from 2 (either up or down) by the deadline is exceedingly small.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   (Extremely Unlikely) A governor calling a surprise special legislative session to pass a psilocybin bill.
    *   (Extremely Unlikely) A major court ruling that radically alters a state's drug laws.
    *   (Irrelevant for 2025 deadline) News of a well-funded ballot initiative qualifying for the 2026 ballot in a new state.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Colorado's health department announcing a major delay in the launch of its program past the Dec 31, 202

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the legalization of psilocybin for therapy in US states is informed by the historical adoption of medical cannabis laws. The initial adoption rate for medical cannabis was approximately 0.8 states per year in the first decade. Given that psilocybin is in an early adoption phase, a base rate of 0.5 to 1 new state per year is plausible. The mean of this base rate is approximately 0.75 states per year, with a variance reflecting the slow adoption phase.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Both psilocybin and cannabis faced initial skepticism and regulatory hurdles. Both are being considered for therapeutic use.
   - Differences: Psilocybin is being legalized under a supervised therapeutic model, requiring more complex regulatory infrastructure. The current situation is marked by a very short time horizon (less than two months), making it unlikely for new states to legalize psilocybin by the deadline.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Legislative calendars for 2025 are closed, making new legalizations unlikely (↓ Large).
   - Implementation timelines for psilocybin therapy are lengthy, with no other states in the pipeline (↓ Large).
   - Federal skepticism, as evidenced by the FDA's stance on MDMA, discourages legislative pushes (↓ Moderate).
   - Colorado's progress provides a positive signal but does not affect the 2025 count (↑ Small).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Strong concentration on 2 states (Oregon and Colorado).
   - Evidence overwhelmingly supports the prior, with legislative and implementation timelines effectively ruling out changes by the deadline.
   - Posterior: The distribution remains concentrated on 2, with negligible probability of change.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence is mitigated by considering the extremely short time horizon and closed legislative calendars.
   - Tail risks, such as unexpected legislative sessions or court rulings, are deemed extremely unlikely.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a small probability of a third state, but evidence strongly supports the current forecast.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the overwhelming evidence and short timeline, the forecast is highly concentrated on 2 states.
   - Percentiles reflect the near certainty of no change by the deadline.

# Forecast: Number of US States with Legal Psilocybin Therapy by Dec 31, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the current state of psilocybin therapy legalization in the US:
- Currently, only 2 states (Oregon and Colorado) have legalized psilocybin for therapeutic use
- Oregon legalized in November 2020 via ballot initiative
- Colorado legalized in November 2022 via ballot initiative

The most appropriate base rate is the adoption pattern of medical cannabis, which took approximately 24 years to reach 36 states (1.5 states/year), with a much slower initial adoption rate of 0.8 states/year in the first decade. Psilocybin therapy appears to be in this early, slow-adoption phase.

My prior distribution is therefore heavily concentrated around 2 states, with a small probability of 1 or 3 states.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Psilocybin, like early medical cannabis, faces significant regulatory hurdles and social stigma
- Both involve substances classified as Schedule I under federal law
- Both have emerging research supporting therapeutic benefits

**Key differences:**
- Psilocybin therapy uses a supervised therapeutic model requiring complex infrastructure, unlike the dispensary model of medical cannabis
- The question resolves in less than two months, giving almost no time for new states to complete legislation and implementation
- Psilocybin lacks the robust pre-existing industry and constituency that cannabis had
- Recent FDA skepticism toward psychedelic therapies (MDMA rejection) creates stronger federal headwinds

These differences strongly suggest that the adoption rate for psilocybin therapy will be slower than medical cannabis, especially in the near term.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence supporting status quo (2 states):**
- Legislative calendars for 2025 are effectively closed (very strong evidence, LR ≈ 10:1 favoring 2 states)
- Implementation timelines for psilocybin therapy typically take 18-24 months (strong evidence, LR ≈ 5:1)
- No ballot initiatives are possible until November 2026 (very strong evidence, LR ≈ 10:1)
- FDA advisory committee's rejection of MDMA therapy creates regulatory headwinds (moderate evidence, LR ≈ 3:1)

**Evidence supporting decrease (< 2 states):**
- California's governor vetoed a psychedelic therapy bill for the second time (weak evidence for program suspension, LR ≈ 1.5:1 favoring status quo)
- Potential implementation challenges in Colorado or Oregon could lead to program suspension (very weak evidence, LR ≈ 1.2:1 favoring status quo)

**Evidence supporting increase (> 2 states):**
- Colorado's successful progress toward implementation provides a positive model (very weak evidence for expansion, LR ≈ 1.1:1 favoring status quo)
- No evidence of any state being close to legalization before December 31, 2025

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior heavily concentrated on 2 states (probability ~0.9), with small probabilities for 1 state (~0.05) and 3 states (~0.05):

First update using legislative calendar evidence (LR ≈ 10:1 favoring 2 states):
- P(2 states) increases from ~0.9 to ~0.99
- P(1 state) decreases from ~0.05 to ~0.005
- P(3 states) decreases from ~0.05 to ~0.005

Second update using implementation timeline evidence (LR ≈ 5:1):
- P(2 states) increases from ~0.99 to ~0.995
- P(1 state) decreases from ~0.005 to ~0.0025
- P(3 states) decreases from ~0.005 to ~0.0025

The posterior distribution is now extremely concentrated around 2 states, with only tiny probabilities for other outcomes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a state having already passed legislation with a late 2025 implementation date that hasn't received widespread attention
- I might be overestimating the stability of existing programs in Oregon and Colorado
- There could be legal challenges or court rulings that unexpectedly change a state's status

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A state could implement emergency legislation in response to a mental health crisis (extremely unlikely)
- A federal court ruling could unexpectedly impact state laws (extremely unlikely)
- Implementation problems could cause Oregon or Colorado to suspend their programs (very unlikely)

After considering these scenarios, I maintain high confidence in 2 states, but will slightly increase the probability of 1 state to account for the small possibility of program suspension.

## 6. Final Percentiles

My distribution is extremely concentrated around 2 states, with minimal probability mass elsewhere. The short timeframe and lack of any states in the pipeline make additional states by December 31, 2025 virtually impossible, while the established programs in Oregon and Colorado are unlikely to be suspended.

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is the state-level legalization of medical cannabis. This process was slow, especially initially, averaging about 0.8 new states per year in its first decade. This suggests that state-level adoption of novel drug therapies is a high-inertia process. However, the question's time horizon is extremely short (resolving on December 31, 2025, from a forecast date of November 9, 2025). Therefore, the most relevant prior is not the annual adoption rate, but the current state of affairs. As of today, two states have passed laws to legalize psilocybin therapy: Oregon (already operational) and Colorado (in the final stages of implementation). My prior distribution is therefore a very strong point mass on the number 2, reflecting the high improbability of state-level policy changing in under two months.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is different from the long-term base rate of cannabis legalization in one critical way: the time horizon. The base rate averages over years, whereas this forecast is for the next 52 days. The primary mechanisms for adding a new state—legislative sessions and ballot initiatives—are functionally closed for 2025. Most state legislatures have adjourned, and the election cycle for ballot initiatives is over until 2026. This makes the addition of a new state (from 2 to 3) virtually impossible. The only relevant uncertainty is whether a state could drop off the list, which is not a factor in the long-term base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence overwhelmingly points toward the number of states remaining at 2, with a small possibility of it dropping to 1.

*   **Evidence for N=2 (High Likelihood):**
    *   Oregon's program is already operational.
    *   Colorado's program is in the final stage. The report states, "Colorado announces the first conditional licenses for psilocybin healing centers, with doors expected to open to clients by year-end." Issuing licenses is a late-stage step, making a launch by the deadline highly probable.

*   **Evidence for N=3 or more (Extremely Low Likelihood):**
    *   The report confirms the primary levers for change are inactive: "most state legislatures have adjourned for 2025" and the "ballot initiative cycle is over until November 2026." This makes the addition of a new state a near-impossibility.
    *   The recent veto of California's bill and the negative FDA advisory vote on MDMA therapy create political headwinds, further reducing the already negligible chance of a surprise special session or executive action.

*   **Evidence for N=1 (Low but Plausible Likelihood):**
    *   The key risk is a short-term delay in Colorado's launch. The phrase "expected to open" implies some uncertainty. Government program rollouts can be subject to last-minute administrative delays, legal challenges (e.g., an injunction), or logistical hurdles. A delay of even one day past December 31 would mean Colorado does not count. This is the only plausible scenario for the number to change.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior was very strongly centered on N=2. The evidence confirms that N=3 or higher is not a credible outcome. The main update is to incorporate the small but real risk of a delay in Colorado's program launch.

*   **Prior:** P(N=2) ≈ 99%, P(N≠2) ≈ 1%
*   **Evidence:** The primary mechanisms for increasing the number are closed. The only plausible risk is a short-term implementation delay in Colorado.
*   **Posterior:** I will shift some probability mass from N=2 to N=1 to account for this delay risk. I estimate the probability of Colorado's program launch being delayed past December 31 at approximately 15%. This is the most significant source of uncertainty.
    *   My final posterior is P(N=1) ≈ 15%, P(N=2) ≈ 85%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is highly concentrated on just two outcomes (1 or 2). Could I be missing a "black swan" event?
*   **Could N=3?** This would require a state to pass and implement a law in less than two months. Given the known legislative calendars and the complexity of setting up a therapeutic framework, this is not a realistic scenario.
*   **Could N=1?** This is my primary alternative scenario. The argument is that "expected to open" is not a guarantee, and bureaucratic inertia or last-minute legal challenges are common. A 15% probability for this failure mode seems reasonable—it acknowledges the risk without overstating it, given that the state is already issuing licenses.
*   **Could N=0?** This would require Colorado's program to be delayed *and* Oregon's operational program to be suspended. A scandal large enough to cause an emergency suspension in Oregon in the next 52 days is extremely unlikely. The probability of N=0 is negligible.

My forecast hinges on the interpretation of Colorado's implementation status. The distribution P(1)=15%, P(2)=85% feels like a robust way to capture this specific uncertainty while correctly identifying that no other outcomes are plausible.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on a posterior distribution of approximately 15% probability for N=1 and 85% for N=2, the percentiles are derived as follows. The cumulative probability reaches 15% at N=1 and 100% at N=2.

P10: 1
P20: 2
P40: 2
P60: 2
P80: 2
P90: 2
