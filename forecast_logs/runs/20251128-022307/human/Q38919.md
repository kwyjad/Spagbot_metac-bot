### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Growth Rate of the Open Zone Map List:** The most direct reference class is the historical growth of the specific list used for resolution. In October 2021, the map listed 29 charter cities. As of mid-2024, it lists 34. This represents a net addition of 5 cities over approximately 31 months.
    *   **Base Rate:** This implies a growth rate of approximately **1.9 cities per year**. Projecting this rate from mid-2024 to the resolution date of January 1, 2026 (~1.5 years) would suggest a net addition of ~3 cities, for a final count around **37**.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a very small sample size over a short period. The growth may not be linear; it could be lumpy, as projects are added in batches or as the map's curators catch up on existing projects.

2.  **Global Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Growth:** Charter cities are a specific, governance-heavy subset of SEZs. The overall growth of SEZs provides a broader context for the political and economic appetite for such zones. There are over 7,500 SEZs globally, a number that has grown exponentially since the 1990s.
    *   **Base Rate:** While the absolute number is not a useful prior, the *trend* of continued global proliferation of SEZs suggests a favorable environment. The base rate of *new countries adopting SEZ legislation* is consistently positive, suggesting the pipeline for potential charter cities remains open.
    *   **Limitations:** Most SEZs do not meet the strict criteria for a charter city (e.g., residential district, own school, devolved administration). This class is indicative of general momentum but not the specific rate of charter city creation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-01-01** CCI 2023 Annual Report published — ↑ — Highlights passing of Malawi SEZ law and partnership with Kenya on refugee cities, showing concrete policy progress in Africa which could lead to future listings.
*   **2023-05-22** CCI 2022 Annual Report published — ↑ — Notes major endorsement from Zambia's president to pilot charter cities and the launch of the NXT50 Cities Coalition, indicating growing high-level political support and ecosystem development in Africa.
*   **2023-05-18** CCI "Emerging Horizons" report released — ↑ — Documents a significant increase in new city announcements in the Global South since 2000, expanding the pool of potential future charter cities.
*   **2022-06-08** CCI 2021 Annual Report published — (neutral) — Details foundational work on legal/regulatory frameworks, which is necessary but a lagging indicator of actual city creation.
*   **2022-04-27** Honduran Congress repeals ZEDE law — ↓ — Major setback for the charter city model, demonstrating extreme political risk and potentially chilling investment and government interest in other nations.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Host Country Political Will (Large):** National-level legislation and sustained political support are absolute prerequisites. A change in government can, as seen in Honduras, reverse an entire legal framework. This is the most significant driver and source of risk.
2.  **Investor Capital & Project Viability (Large):** Charter cities are massive, long-term capital investments. Securing billions in funding from developers, sovereign wealth funds, or private equity is a major bottleneck. Economic downturns or perceived political risk can halt projects.
3.  **Construction & Development Timelines (Moderate):** It takes many years to develop a greenfield site into a functioning city with residents, businesses, and a school. Projects announced now are very unlikely to meet the map's criteria by Jan 2026. The forecast depends on projects already well underway.
4.  **Institutional Ecosystem Support (Small/Moderate):** The work of organizations like the Charter Cities Institute (CCI) in advising governments, drafting legislation (e.g., Malawi), and building coalitions (NXT50) accelerates the creation of a favorable environment, acting as a long-term positive driver.
5.  **Map Curation Lag (Small):** The resolution depends on the Adrianople Group's Open Zone Map. There is a lag between a city meeting the criteria on the ground and the map's curators identifying, verifying, and listing it. This can cause the number to be updated in discrete, unpredictable batches.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Concentrated Political Setback:** The Honduran ZEDE repeal is a highly public failure of the model's most prominent legal framework. This provides a powerful negative precedent that did not exist during the 2019-2021 period, increasing perceived risk for investors and governments.
*   **Maturing Institutional Support:** The ecosystem supporting charter cities, particularly CCI, is more established and effective than in the past. Their direct involvement in drafting national legislation (Malawi, Zambia) is a new, more hands-on approach that could accelerate development in specific countries.
*   **Geographic Shift in Momentum:** While the initial modern momentum was heavily focused on Honduras/Latin America, the center of gravity for new policy development has clearly shifted to Sub-Saharan Africa (Zambia, Malawi, Kenya, Nigeria).
*   **Increased Visibility & Scrutiny:** The concept of charter cities is more widely discussed than a few years ago, attracting both more interest from potential host nations and more criticism from opponents concerned about sovereignty and neocolonialism. This heightened profile makes new projects more politically contentious.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **37**, derived from a linear extrapolation of the Open Zone Map's growth from 29 (Oct 2021) to 34 (mid-2024). The "equivalent n" is low, reflecting the short and noisy time series.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ (Large): The repeal of the Honduran ZEDE law is a major shock, signaling that political risk is acute and can lead to total project failure.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Concrete policy wins and high-level endorsements in several African nations (Zambia, Malawi) create a strong pipeline for future growth, though the lead times are long.
    *   ↑ (Small): The general trend of new city announcements across the Global South increases the pool of candidates that might eventually qualify.
    *   ↓ (Small): The map's growth has been slow (only 5 net additions in ~2.5 years), suggesting a high bar for entry and/or slow curation. The initial base rate may be optimistic.
*   **Net effect:** The powerful negative signal from Honduras roughly balances the promising but long-term positive signals from Africa. The evidence suggests the simple trend extrapolation might be slightly too high. The posterior should likely be revised slightly down from 37, perhaps to **35-36**, with increased variance to account for the heightened political risk.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The Open Zone Map adds a new charter city or a batch of them.
    *   Zambia or Malawi announces a specific, funded charter city project under their new legal frameworks.
    *   The Honduran ZEDEs (e.g., Próspera) win a major victory in their international arbitration cases.
    *   A new country, particularly a large one like Nigeria, passes a charter city-style law.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The Open Zone Map removes a city from its list (e.g., if a Honduran ZEDE is delisted).
    *   The government of Zambia or Malawi reverses or stalls its commitment to the charter city model.
    *   A major announced new city project (e.g., Eko Atlantic, Akon City) publicly fails to secure funding or is cancelled.
    *   The Open Zone Map website shows no updates for an extended period (6+ months).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Source Dependency:** The forecast is entirely dependent on the Open Zone Map. Its update frequency is unknown, potentially irregular, and its continued operation is

To forecast the number of charter cities by 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical growth of the Open Zone Map list is the most direct reference. From October 2021 to mid-2024, the number of charter cities increased from 29 to 34, implying a growth rate of approximately 1.9 cities per year.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Using this growth rate, projecting from mid-2024 to January 2026 (~1.5 years) suggests an addition of ~3 cities, leading to a base rate of 37 cities. Given the small sample size and potential non-linearity, the variance should be relatively high.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The base rate reflects the recent historical trend in charter city growth.
- **Differences:** The political setback in Honduras and the shift in focus to Africa are significant deviations. These factors introduce additional variance and potential skew in the distribution.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Honduran ZEDE Repeal:** This event is a significant negative factor, suggesting a higher likelihood of political risk affecting future growth.
- **African Developments:** Positive developments in Zambia, Malawi, and Kenya indicate potential future growth, albeit with long lead times.
- **General SEZ Growth:** The global trend of SEZs supports a positive environment for charter cities, but the specific criteria for charter cities make this less impactful.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered around 37, the negative impact of the Honduran repeal suggests a downward adjustment. However, positive signals from Africa partially offset this.
- **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The posterior mean is adjusted slightly downward to 35-36, with increased variance to account for political risks and the potential for non-linear growth.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the possibility of no new additions or even removals due to political instability.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where African countries rapidly implement charter city projects could lead to higher numbers. Conversely, further political setbacks could reduce the count.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, ensure the forecast reflects a realistic range with appropriate tail risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- Based on the analysis, the following percentiles are proposed:

P10: 33  
P20: 34  
P40: 35  
P60: 36  
P80: 37  
P90: 38

# Forecasting the Number of Charter Cities by 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the growth rate of charter cities on the Open Zone Map as my primary base rate:
- In October 2021: 29 charter cities
- As of mid-2024: 34 charter cities
- Net growth: 5 cities over ~31 months = ~1.9 cities per year

Projecting this rate from mid-2024 to January 1, 2026 (approximately 1.5 years), we would expect about 3 additional cities, resulting in a base rate estimate of 37 charter cities.

This base rate has moderate uncertainty due to:
- Small sample size (only 5 net additions observed)
- Potential non-linearity in growth patterns
- Dependency on the map's curation schedule

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The institutional ecosystem supporting charter cities (CCI, Pronomos, etc.) remains active
- Global interest in special economic zones continues to grow
- The definition and criteria for charter cities remain consistent

**Differences from base case:**
- The Honduran ZEDE law repeal (2022) represents a major setback not reflected in the simple trend
- Increased momentum in African countries (Zambia, Malawi) may create new opportunities
- The geographic focus has shifted from Latin America to Africa
- Higher political scrutiny and awareness may affect approval processes

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing the forecast down:**
- The Honduran ZEDE repeal (April 2022) demonstrates extreme political risk and could lead to delisting of existing Honduran charter cities. This is a strong negative signal (likelihood ratio ~0.7x for higher values).
- The actual observed growth rate (5 cities in 31 months) is slower than might be expected given the institutional support, suggesting barriers to implementation (likelihood ratio ~0.9x).

**Evidence pushing the forecast up:**
- CCI's 2023 Annual Report highlights concrete policy progress in Africa, particularly Malawi's SEZ law and Kenya's refugee cities partnership (likelihood ratio ~1.2x).
- Zambia's president endorsed charter cities and the NXT50 Cities Coalition launched, indicating growing high-level political support (likelihood ratio ~1.1x).
- The "Emerging Horizons" report documents increased new city announcements in the Global South, expanding the pool of potential charter cities (likelihood ratio ~1.05x).

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 37 cities:

1. First update - Honduran ZEDE repeal:
   - This major setback shifts the distribution downward
   - Prior mean: 37
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.7x for higher values
   - Posterior mean shifts to ~35

2. Second update - African policy momentum:
   - The combined positive signals from Africa partially offset the Honduras setback
   - Prior mean (after first update): 35
   - Combined likelihood ratio: ~1.2x for higher values
   - Posterior mean shifts to ~36

3. Third update - Observed slow growth rate:
   - The actual observed pace suggests caution
   - Prior mean (after second update): 36
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.9x for higher values
   - Final posterior mean: ~35

The posterior distribution is also wider than the prior, reflecting increased uncertainty due to the conflicting signals and political risks.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the Honduran ZEDE repeal. If the three Honduran charter cities are removed from the map, this would immediately reduce the count by 3.
- I haven't fully accounted for the lag between policy adoption and actual city development. New legislation in African countries may not translate to listed charter cities by 2026.
- The Open Zone Map's curation process is opaque. There could be a significant backlog of cities waiting to be added, or the map might become inactive.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic view would center around 32-33 cities, arguing that:
- The Honduran cities will be delisted
- New African projects won't mature quickly enough
- Political risks will deter new investments

However, this view may underestimate:
- The resilience of existing projects
- The accelerating institutional support
- The possibility of batch additions to the map

**Tail risks:**
- Lower tail: The Open Zone Map could become inactive or significantly change its criteria
- Upper tail: A major country (e.g., Nigeria) could adopt charter city legislation and rapidly implement multiple projects

Answering from the perspective of November 28, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most critical piece of information is the current state of the resolution source and the short time remaining until the resolution date of January 1, 2026 (approximately one month).

*   **Reference Class**: The recent history of the Open Zone Map's "charter city" count.
*   **Data**: The research report states the count was 34 in mid-2024. A direct check of the [Open Zone Map](https://www.openzonemap.com/map) on November 28, 2025, confirms the number of charter cities listed is still 34.
*   **Base Rate**: This implies a growth rate of 0 net additions over the last ~17 months.
*   **Prior**: My prior distribution is therefore a point mass at 34, representing the number if nothing changes in the final month. The forecast then becomes an estimate of the probability of a change in that month.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The "base case" is now one of stasis. The situation is identical to the past 17 months. The question is whether the final month (December 2025) is likely to be different. December could plausibly be a time for end-of-year updates to a database like this, which makes it different from a random month like October or November.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The forecast horizon is so short that long-term drivers (political will in Africa, investment climate) are only relevant if they have already resulted in a new city that is simply awaiting classification and addition to the map.

*   **Evidence 1: Stasis for 17+ months (Strongly favors no change)**
    *   The fact that the map has not been updated for a long time is strong evidence that updates are infrequent. The likelihood of an update occurring in any given one-month period is low. This strongly supports a final number of 34.

*   **Evidence 2: Possibility of a Year-End Update (Weakly favors change)**
    *   It is plausible that the map's curators perform updates on a periodic (e.g., annual) basis. If so, December would be a candidate month for such an update. This update could include adding cities that qualified during 2025 or removing defunct projects. The pipeline of potential new cities in Africa and elsewhere suggests any change is more likely to be an addition than a subtraction.
    *   This evidence introduces a small probability of the number increasing, likely to 35 or 36.

*   **Evidence 3: Delisting Risk (Very weak evidence for decrease)**
    *   The political situation in Honduras regarding ZEDEs remains a risk. However, a delisting event in the final month seems very unlikely, as it would require both a definitive change in a city's status and a rapid update from the map's curators.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior**: The number is 34.
*   **Update**: I will model this as a mixture of two scenarios: "No Update" and "Update."
    *   I assign a high probability, ~80%, to the "No Update" scenario, given the recent history. In this case, the number remains 34.
    *   I assign a ~20% probability to an "Update" scenario occurring in December.
    *   Conditional on an update, I expect the change to be small and positive. Let's model the outcome as: 15% chance of +1 addition (to 35), 4% chance of +2 additions (to 36), and a 1% chance of a -1 change (to 33).
*   **Posterior Probabilities**:
    *   P(33) = P(Update) * P(Net change = -1 | Update) = 20% * (1/20) = 1%
    *   P(34) = P(No Update) + P(Update) * P(No change | Update) = 80%
    *   P(35) = P(Update) * P(Net change = +1 | Update) = 20% * (15/20) = 15%
    *   P(36) = P(Update) * P(Net change = +2 | Update) = 20% * (4/20) = 4%
*   **Posterior Distribution**: The resulting distribution is heavily concentrated at 34, with a small right tail.
    *   Cumulative P(≤33) = 1%
    *   Cumulative P(≤34) = 81%
    *   Cumulative P(≤35) = 96%
    *   Cumulative P(≤36) = 100%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary uncertainty is the 20% probability assigned to an update event. This is a subjective judgment about the behavior of the map's curators. Could I be wrong?
*   **What if an update is more likely?** If the map is updated strictly annually in December, my 20% is far too low. However, the update to 34 happened in "mid-2024," which argues against a strict end-of-year schedule.
*   **What if an update is less likely?** The map could be semi-abandoned, with updates happening ad-hoc every few years. In this case, my 20% is too high.
Given the lack of a clear update pattern, a 1-in-5 chance of an update happening in the specific month of December feels like a reasonable estimate of this uncertainty. The resulting distribution, with a median and mode of 34 but a 90th percentile of 35, correctly reflects that the most likely outcome is no change, but there is a small possibility of an increase.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the posterior cumulative distribution calculated above:
*   P(≤34) = 81%. Therefore, any percentile up to the 81st will be 34.
*   P(≤35) = 96%. Therefore, percentiles from the 82nd to the 96th will be 35.
