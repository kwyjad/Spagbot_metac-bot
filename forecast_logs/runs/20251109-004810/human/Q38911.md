### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Controversial Social Policy Amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA):** The NDAA is considered "must-pass" legislation, making it a target for amendments on divisive social issues (e.g., abortion policy, transgender service members, diversity initiatives). Most of these amendments fail to make it into the final bill, as leadership prioritizes the bill's core function and strips out provisions that threaten bipartisan passage.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~15-25% success rate per attempt for a highly controversial provision to survive the conference committee and be signed into law. This is derived from observing the fate of numerous such amendments over the past decade, where most are either defeated on the floor or removed during reconciliation between the House and Senate versions.
2.  **Major Changes to U.S. Military Conscription Policy:** Significant changes to the Selective Service System are rare. The system was effectively dormant after 1973, registration was reinstated in 1980, but the fundamental structure (male-only registration) has not changed since.
    *   **Base Rate:** <5% chance of a fundamental change in any given 2-year congressional cycle. This is based on one major change (reinstating registration) in the last 50 years. This class suggests a very low prior.
3.  **Legislative Adoption of National Commission Recommendations:** Bipartisan national commissions are often formed to study complex issues and provide a path forward. Their recommendations are not always adopted, especially when they face strong political headwinds.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~30-40% chance of a key recommendation being enacted within 5 years of a commission's final report. This is a rough estimate based on the history of commissions like the 9/11 Commission or the Simpson-Bowles Commission, where some, but not all, recommendations become law, often after significant delay and modification.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2024-08-02** Bipartisan bill to abolish the Selective Service introduced in the Senate. ↓ — This strengthens the "abolish, not expand" argument, providing a political off-ramp for legislators who oppose expansion but don't want to appear unsupportive of the military.
- **2024-06-24** House passes its version of the FY2025 NDAA (H.R. 8070). ↓ — The passed version includes automatic registration for *men only*, explicitly omitting the expansion to women, signaling the House's current position is against the change.
- **2024-06-15** Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approves its version of the FY2025 NDAA. ↑ — The SASC version *does* include a provision requiring women to register, setting up a direct conflict with the House version in the future conference committee.
- **2022-12-07** Provision requiring women to register is removed from the final FY2023 NDAA. ↓ — Demonstrates a recent, repeated pattern of failure. The political dynamics that killed the provision in the past are likely still present.
- **2021-12-06** Provision requiring women to register is removed from the final FY2022 NDAA. ↓ — Establishes the initial failure in the recent cycle, showing that even with initial committee support, the opposition is strong enough to force its removal.
- **2021-06-07** Supreme Court declines to hear *National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System*. (neutral) — The court explicitly deferred to Congress, placing the impetus for change squarely on the legislative branch and signaling it would not force the issue for now.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **NDAA Conference Committee Dynamics (Large ↓):** This is the primary battleground. To become law, the provision must survive reconciliation between the House and Senate versions. Given the House version omits it and a bloc of conservative Republicans strongly opposes it, leadership is highly likely to strip it out to ensure the overall bill passes, as they have done twice before.
2.  **Social Conservative Opposition (Large ↓):** A vocal and influential bloc of lawmakers, primarily in the House Republican conference, views requiring women to register for the draft as a violation of traditional gender roles and a step toward "woke" military policy. Their opposition has been the key factor in past failures.
3.  **Bipartisan "Abolish, Don't Expand" Coalition (Moderate ↓):** A coalition of anti-war progressives and libertarian-leaning conservatives (e.g., Wyden, Paul) argues the entire Selective Service system is an obsolete relic. This provides an alternative path for opponents and complicates the arguments of proponents.
4.  **Military and Establishment Support (Moderate ↑):** The Department of Defense, the 2020 National Commission, and key leaders on the Armed Services Committees (like Sen. Jack Reed) support the change on grounds of gender equality and military readiness. This ensures the issue is repeatedly introduced.
5.  **Supreme Court Pressure (Small ↑):** While the Court deferred in 2021, the legal argument against male-only registration remains potent. Justices noted the justification for the distinction is weak. The threat of a future court ruling could motivate Congress to act preemptively, though this seems unlikely before 2026.
6.  **Major Geopolitical Crisis (Small, but Large Impact ↑):** A large-scale conflict that raises the real possibility of a draft could dramatically shift the political calculus, making military readiness and personnel numbers an urgent priority that overrides social objections.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Repeated, Recent Failures:** Unlike a novel proposal, this specific provision has been included in committee-passed bills and then stripped from the final NDAA twice in the last three years. This provides strong, specific evidence of the political obstacles.
- **Entrenched, Asymmetric Opposition:** The opposition is more intense and motivated than the support. For social conservatives, this is a core cultural issue. For proponents, it is often a matter of policy principle and good governance, which carries less political energy.
- **Viable "Third Option":** The "abolish the draft" movement is a significant complicating factor not present in many other policy debates (like DADT repeal). It allows politicians to oppose the expansion without appearing to oppose the military or equality, fracturing the potential support base.
- **Lack of Public Salience:** Unlike other major military social issues, expanding draft registration to women does not command significant public attention or pressure, as the prospect of an actual draft is remote. This allows a focused minority in Congress to have an outsized impact.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with a prior of ~20%, anchored on the base rate for controversial NDAA amendments succeeding. This acknowledges it's a difficult but not impossible legislative lift. (Equivalent n ≈ 10).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **↑ (Moderate):** Consistent support from the military establishment and SASC leadership.
    - **↓ (Large):** The provision's failure to pass in both the FY22 and FY23 NDAAs after similar committee-level support. This is a powerful track record of failure.
    - **↓ (Large):** The FY25 House-passed NDAA already excludes the provision, setting up the exact same failure condition as previous years.
    - **↓ (Moderate):** The growing "abolish, don't expand" coalition, which provides a politically safe off-ramp for opponents.
- **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The repeated, specific failures and the entrenched nature of the opposition significantly outweigh the persistent institutional support. The posterior should be revised substantially lower than the prior, likely into the single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - Key House Republican leaders (e.g., Speaker, Majority Leader) publicly endorse including the provision in the final NDAA.
    - A new Supreme Court case challenging male-only registration is granted certiorari.
    - Proponents successfully attach the provision to another "must-pass" bill outside of the NDAA.
    - A major international crisis significantly increases discussion of military readiness and a potential draft.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - The NDAA conference committee report is released without the provision for women's registration (most likely outcome for FY25).
    - Key conservative opponents (e.g., Sen. Hawley, Rep. Gaetz) are appointed as NDAA conferees.
    - Polling shows the issue is unpopular in key swing districts ahead of an election.
    - The "Abolish the Selective Service" bill (S.4881) gains additional, influential co-sponsors.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Resolution Timing:** The law must *take effect* before Jan 1, 2026. A bill signed in late 2025 could easily have an implementation date in 2026, which would resolve as "No." This shortens the effective timeline.
- **Legislative Vehicle:** The forecast is heavily dependent on the NDAA process. While it's the most likely vehicle, the provision could theoretically pass in another bill, though this is highly improbable.
- **"Black Swan" Event:** A major war or national emergency could render all current political calculations obsolete, likely increasing the probability of passage dramatically.
- **Political Turnover:** The outcome of the 2024 election could shift the composition of Congress and the leadership of the Armed Services Committees, though the core opposition bloc is likely to remain.
- **Definition of "Required":** The resolution criteria are clear, but any ambiguity in a passed law's language could complicate resolution. The focus is on a legal mandate taking effect.

**Final Research Summary:** The proposal to require women to register for the Selective Service faces a near-certain legislative death in the FY2025 NDAA, following the same pattern of failure seen in previous years. While institutional support remains, it is consistently overcome by a highly motivated coalition of social conservatives and an emerging "abolish, don't expand" movement, making passage before 2026 highly unlikely absent a major geopolitical shock.

To forecast the probability of women being required to register for US Selective Service before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for controversial social policy amendments to the NDAA succeeding is approximately 15-25%. This is based on historical observations of similar amendments being proposed and often removed during the legislative process. Given the context of this specific amendment, a prior probability of 20% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The proposal to require women to register for Selective Service is a controversial amendment to the NDAA, fitting well within the reference class.
   - Differences: This specific amendment has been repeatedly proposed and removed in recent years, indicating stronger opposition than typical for controversial amendments. The presence of a viable "abolish the draft" movement further complicates its passage.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Repeated Failures (↓):** The provision has been removed from the NDAA in both 2022 and 2023, suggesting strong opposition. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
   - **House Position (↓):** The House's FY2025 NDAA version excludes the provision, indicating continued opposition. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
   - **Senate Support (↑):** The Senate Armed Services Committee included the provision, showing some institutional support. Likelihood ratio slightly greater than 1.
   - **Abolish Movement (↓):** The growing coalition to abolish the Selective Service provides a politically safe alternative to expansion. Likelihood ratio less than 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 20% probability = 0.25 odds.
   - Evidence strongly points downward due to repeated failures and entrenched opposition.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (net effect of evidence is a strong decrease).
   - Posterior probability is adjusted significantly lower than the prior, likely into the single digits.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for a geopolitical crisis to change the calculus.
   - Alternative scenario: A major international conflict could increase the urgency for military readiness, potentially overriding current opposition.
   - Adjustments: Consider a small upward adjustment to account for low-probability, high-impact events.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the strong evidence against the proposal's passage and the low likelihood of a significant geopolitical shift before 2026, the final probability is adjusted to reflect these factors.

Final: 5%

# Will women be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Controversial Social Policy Amendments to the NDAA**: These typically have a ~15-25% success rate per attempt, as most controversial provisions are stripped during conference committee to ensure the core defense bill passes.

2. **Major Changes to US Military Conscription Policy**: These are extremely rare, with only one significant change (reinstating registration) in the last 50 years, suggesting a <5% chance in any given 2-year congressional cycle.

3. **Legislative Adoption of National Commission Recommendations**: Roughly 30-40% of key recommendations from bipartisan commissions are enacted within 5 years of a final report.

Given the specific history of this provision being included in committee versions but removed from final bills twice already (2021, 2022), I'll weight the first reference class most heavily. The prior should reflect that this is a difficult but not impossible legislative change.

**Prior probability: 15%** (odds of 3:17)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The provision continues to have institutional support from military leadership and key Senate figures
- It follows the pattern of controversial social policy amendments to the NDAA
- The basic political dynamics (progressive vs. conservative views on gender roles) remain consistent

**Key differences:**
- **Repeated specific failures**: This exact provision has been included and then removed from the NDAA twice in recent years (2021, 2022), establishing a clear pattern
- **Current legislative status**: The 2024-2025 process shows the House version explicitly excluding women while the Senate committee version includes them, setting up the same conflict that previously resulted in removal
- **Growing "abolish, don't expand" coalition**: A bipartisan group now advocates eliminating the Selective Service entirely, providing political cover for those who oppose expansion
- **Lack of judicial pressure**: The Supreme Court has explicitly deferred to Congress, removing immediate legal pressure

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the general base rate, as they show specific, repeated obstacles to this particular provision becoming law.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Repeated removal from final NDAA (2021, 2022)**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect ~30% chance of seeing these past failures (temporary setbacks before eventual success)
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we would expect ~90% chance of seeing these past failures (consistent pattern of opposition prevailing)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: House passed FY2025 NDAA with male-only registration**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect ~20% chance the House would pass a bill explicitly excluding them
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we would expect ~80% chance the House would pass such a bill
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Senate committee included women's registration in FY2025 NDAA**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect ~90% chance of committee inclusion
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we would expect ~50% chance of committee inclusion (as we've seen before)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Introduction of bipartisan bill to abolish Selective Service**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect ~30% chance of seeing this alternative proposal
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we would expect ~60% chance of seeing this alternative
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3:17 (15% probability):

**Update on Evidence 1 (repeated past failures):**
- Prior odds: 3:17
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 3:17 × 0.33 = 1:17
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+17) = 5.6%

**Update on Evidence 2 (House passed male-only bill):**
- Prior odds: 1:17
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 1:17 × 0.25 = 0.25:17 = 1:68
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+68) = 1.4%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Senate committee inclusion):**
- Prior odds: 1:68
- Likelihood ratio: 1.8
- Posterior odds: 1:68 × 1.8 = 1.8:68 = 1:37.8
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+37.8) = 2.6%

**Update on Evidence 4 (abolish alternative):**
- Prior odds: 1:37.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 1:37.8 × 0.5 = 0.5:37.8 = 1:75.6
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+75.6) = 1.3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent failures and underestimating the possibility of a compromise version passing
- The timeline extends to January 2026, giving multiple legislative cycles for passage
- A major geopolitical crisis could dramatically change the political calculus

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Court intervention**: Despite previous deference, the Supreme Court could take up a new challenge and rule male-only registration unconstitutional
- **Compromise legislation**: A version requiring women to register but with exemptions for combat roles could gain bipartisan support
- **Attachment to different legislation**: The provision could be attached to another must-pass bill besides the NDAA

**Adjustments needed:**
- The probability should be slightly higher to account for multiple legislative opportunities before 2026
- The possibility of geopolitical shocks warrants a small increase

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my estimate from 1.3% to approximately 3%.

## 6. Final Forecast

The evidence strongly suggests that women will not be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026. The provision has failed twice in recent years despite committee support, the House has explicitly excluded it from their current version, and there's a growing bipartisan movement to abolish rather than expand the system. While institutional support remains from military leadership and some lawmakers, the political obstacles appear insurmountable absent a major geopolitical crisis.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the success rate of controversial social policy amendments attached to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is a "must-pass" annual bill, making it a frequent battleground for such issues. Historically, most of these highly divisive amendments are stripped out during the House-Senate conference committee to ensure the main bill's passage. Based on the fate of similar amendments over the past decade (e.g., regarding transgender service, abortion policy, diversity initiatives), a base rate of approximately **20%** for such a provision succeeding in any given legislative cycle is a reasonable starting point. This reflects that passage is difficult but not impossible. In odds, this is 1:4.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is significantly more challenging than the base case for a generic controversial amendment for several key reasons:

*   **Similarity:** The issue follows the typical pattern where it has strong institutional support (from the Department of Defense and Armed Services Committee leadership) but faces intense, focused opposition from a key political bloc (social conservatives in the House).
*   **Difference (Negative):** This specific proposal has a recent and repeated track record of failure. It was included in the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) version of the NDAA for both FY2022 and FY2023 but was removed from the final bill each time. This provides powerful, specific evidence of the political obstacles it faces, which are stronger than for a novel proposal.
*   **Difference (Negative):** The opposition is asymmetric and entrenched. For social conservatives, this is a core cultural issue, generating high political energy. For proponents, it is a matter of principle and good governance, which often carries less weight in legislative horse-trading.
*   **Difference (Negative):** A bipartisan "abolish, don't expand" coalition exists, offering a politically viable off-ramp for legislators. This allows them to oppose the expansion without appearing to be against equality or military readiness, thereby fracturing the potential support base for the change.

These differences suggest the true probability is likely much lower than the 20% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the key evidence against the 20% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The provision was removed from the final NDAA in both the FY22 and FY23 cycles.**
    *   P(E | H): The probability of this past failure, given that the law will pass before 2026, is very low. It implies that the fundamental political dynamics must change dramatically.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of past failure, given that the law will *not* pass, is very high. Past performance is a strong indicator of future results when conditions remain similar.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<< 1). This evidence massively decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The House passed its FY25 NDAA version *without* the provision, while the SASC version *includes* it (June 2024).**
    *   P(E | H): This is an unlikely path to passage. It requires the Senate to win a major concession from a resistant House in the conference committee on a culturally charged issue.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is the exact scenario that led to failure in previous years. It is highly likely that if the provision is to fail again, it will follow this path.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly less than 1 (< 1). This evidence strongly reinforces the expectation of failure in the current legislative cycle.

*   **Evidence 3: A bipartisan bill to abolish the Selective Service was introduced (August 2024).**
    *   P(E | H): This is somewhat unlikely. Momentum to abolish the system is counterproductive to expanding it.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is quite likely. The "abolish" movement provides a convenient alternative for opponents of expansion.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence moderately decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with our prior odds of 1:4 (20% probability), we update with the overwhelming evidence of past and current legislative failure.

1.  **Prior Odds:** 1:4 (20%)
2.  **Update with repeated failures:** The fact that this exact proposal has failed twice recently in the same manner is extremely strong evidence. Let's estimate this evidence is at least 10 times more likely if the proposal fails than if it passes (Likelihood Ratio ≈ 0.1).
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1:4) × 0.1 = 1:40.
    *   This updates the probability to 1 / (1 + 40) ≈ 2.5%.

3.  **Update with current legislative state:** The FY25 NDAA is already set up to repeat this failure. This confirms the political dynamics have not changed. This makes the chance of passage in the current cycle (ending late 2024) near zero.

4.  **Consider the final opportunity (FY26 NDAA):** The question resolves before Jan 1, 2026, leaving one more legislative cycle after the 2024 election. The outcome hinges entirely on this cycle.
    *   If the political situation remains a divided government or a Republican-controlled House, the probability of passage remains extremely low (~1-2%).
    *   If the 2024 election results in Democrats controlling the House, Senate, and Presidency, the primary obstacle is removed. The probability in this scenario would rise substantially, perhaps to 20-30%. (It is not a guarantee, as it's not a top-tier priority and still faces "abolish" opposition).
    *   Let's estimate a ~50% chance of a political alignment post-election that is favorable to passage (i.e., Democrats win the House).
    *   The probability for the FY26 cycle is roughly: P(Favorable outcome) * P(Passage | Favorable outcome) + P(Unfavorable outcome) * P(Passage | Unfavorable outcome).
    *   P(Passage in FY26) ≈ (0.5 * 0.20) + (0.5 * 0.01) = 0.10 + 0.005 = 10.5%.

The total probability is dominated by this final legislative chance in 2025.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~10% rests heavily on the outcome of the 2024 election creating a window of opportunity in 2025.

*   **Why could the forecast be too low?** A major geopolitical crisis could erupt, making military readiness an urgent, overriding priority. In such a scenario, arguments for expanding the draft pool would become much more powerful, and the bill could pass quickly with broad bipartisan support. This is a low-probability, high-impact event.
*   **Why could the forecast be too high?** I might be overestimating the likelihood of passage even under a Democratic trifecta. The issue is not a major public priority, and a new Congress will have many other goals. It could easily be pushed aside or fail due to opposition from anti-war progressives joining with Republicans to abolish the system instead. My 20% estimate for P(Passage | Favorable outcome) might be too optimistic.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A 25% forecast would imply that the establishment support is stronger than I assess or that a political bargain is more likely. A 3% forecast would imply that even a change in party control is insufficient to overcome the legislative inertia and lack of political will.

My 10% estimate attempts to balance these factors, acknowledging that passage is highly unlikely under current conditions but possible if the political landscape shifts significantly.

### 6. Final Forecast
The path to this becoming law before 2026 is extremely narrow. It is almost certain to fail in the current (FY2025 NDAA) legislative cycle, following the pattern of the previous two attempts. Its only realistic chance lies in a significant shift in the political composition of Congress following the 2024 election, which would create an opportunity for passage in the FY2026 NDAA during 2025. Even in that scenario, success is not guaranteed. The combination of a low probability of success in the current environment and the uncertainty of a future, more favorable environment leads to a low overall probability.

Final: 10%
