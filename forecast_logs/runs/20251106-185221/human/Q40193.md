Here is my research plan.

**Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **Reference Class Analysis:** What are the historical precedents for countries granting international inspectors access to nuclear facilities shortly after those facilities have been attacked by a foreign power? What about precedents for Iran's own behavior with the IAEA after periods of high tension or setbacks?
2.  **Recency & Current State:** What is the trajectory of Iran-IAEA relations in the immediate past (last 6 months)? What does the sequence of events (war -> suspension -> deal -> scrapped deal) tell us about the current decision-making calculus in Tehran?
3.  **Causal Mechanisms:** What are the primary strategic, domestic, and technical factors driving Iran's decision to either grant or deny access?
    *   **Pro-Access (YES):** What would Iran gain? (e.g., de-escalation, sanctions relief, international goodwill, leverage in future negotiations, preventing a narrative of material diversion).
    *   **Anti-Access (NO):** What are the reasons to refuse? (e.g., national sovereignty/pride, hiding the status of the material, using ambiguity as a deterrent, internal hardliner pressure, logistical challenges).
4.  **Contextual Differences:** How does the current situation (post-US strike, known HEU stockpile, short timeline) differ from historical analogues?
5.  **Future Indicators:** What specific, observable events or statements in the coming weeks would signal a shift in Iran's position in either direction?

**Step 2: Propose Search Queries (Adapted for the fictional scenario)**

1.  **Reference Class:**
    *   `IAEA inspections Iraq Osirak reactor after 1981 Israeli strike`
    *   `Syria Al-Kibar Dair Alzour reactor IAEA access after 2007 strike`
    *   `Iran IAEA cooperation history after Stuxnet attack`
    *   `Libya nuclear program dismantlement timeline IAEA negotiations`
    *   `North Korea IAEA inspectors expulsion history`
2.  **Recency & Current State:**
    *   `(fictional) Iran parliament vote IAEA suspension June 2025`
    *   `(fictional) Iran IAEA deal September 2025 details`
    *   `(fictional) Iran scraps IAEA deal October 2025 reasons`
    *   `IAEA Board of Governors statements on Iran late 2025`
3.  **Causal Mechanisms:**
    *   `Iranian hardliner vs reformist view on nuclear program`
    *   `Iran "strategic patience" vs "resistance economy" doctrine`
    *   `Impact of US military strikes on Iranian domestic politics`
    *   `Technical requirements for safeguarding damaged nuclear material`
4.  **Contextual Differences & Indicators:**
    *   `P5+1 statements on Iran post-June 2025 war`
    *   `Satellite imagery analysis of Natanz Fordow Isfahan post-strike`
    *   `Statements by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi on Iran late 2025`

**Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Historical Precedent is Negative:** States whose nuclear facilities are attacked (Iraq 1981, Syria 2007) do not cooperate with the IAEA afterward. They deny, obfuscate, and delay. This establishes a very low base rate for "YES".
*   **Iran's Behavior is Volatile but Trends Negative:** Iran has a history of "tit-for-tat" responses with the IAEA, restricting access in response to pressure (e.g., sanctions, censure). The recent timeline (suspension -> deal -> scrapped deal) shows a pattern of extreme volatility, with the most recent and decisive action being negative.
*   **Drivers for "NO" are Currently Dominant:** The bombing by the US, a major power, creates immense domestic pressure for a hardline, defiant stance. National pride and the desire to not appear weak are powerful motivators. Furthermore, maintaining ambiguity about the status of the 400kg of HEU provides strategic leverage and deterrence. The logistical difficulty of inspecting a bombed site provides a convenient and plausible excuse for denial.
*   **Drivers for "YES" are Weak in the Short Term:** While Iran may eventually want to trade access for sanctions relief or de-escalation, the timeline of less than two months is extremely short for such a major diplomatic reversal, especially after a direct military humiliation.
*   **Key Difference:** Unlike Iraq or Syria's clandestine programs, Iran's stockpile is a known quantity from a previously monitored program. This makes it a tangible and powerful bargaining chip, but also a source of nationalistic pride and a symbol of defiance.

**Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

---

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Attacked Nuclear States (Base Rate: <5%):** The most direct reference class is states whose nuclear facilities were attacked by a foreign power. After Israel bombed Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981 and Syria's Al-Kibar reactor in 2007, neither country subsequently allowed transparent IAEA inspections of the sites. Instead, they engaged in denial and obfuscation. This class suggests a very low probability of cooperation.
*   **Nuclear Negotiations Under Duress (Base Rate: 20-30%):** A broader class includes states with contested nuclear programs negotiating IAEA access under severe international pressure (e.g., Iran pre-JCPOA, Libya 2003, North Korea at various times). Cooperation in these cases is transactional, often protracted, and prone to reversals. Agreements are possible but are far from guaranteed, especially on short timelines.
*   **Iran's Own History (Base Rate: ~25%):** Iran has a pattern of restricting IAEA access in response to perceived hostile actions (e.g., sanctions, censure resolutions) and then using the restoration of access as a bargaining chip. A deal is possible, but the default response to direct attack is non-cooperation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-06-22] US B-2s strike Iranian nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. (↓) — The direct military attack creates a powerful political imperative for defiance and non-cooperation.
*   [2025-06-25] Iranian lawmakers vote overwhelmingly to suspend IAEA cooperation. (↓) — Formalizes the defiant posture, making a reversal politically costly for the regime.
*   [2025-09-09] Iran and the IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections at bombed sites. (↑) — A significant, albeit temporary, signal that a pragmatic path was possible, likely driven by a desire to de-escalate.
*   [2025-10-20] Iran announces the deal with the IAEA is void. (↓↓) — A major reversal. Scrapping a recent agreement is a much stronger negative signal than never having made one.
*   [2025-10-27] CSIS analysis suggests possible new clandestine nuclear activity. (↓) — Indicates Iran may be shifting focus to new avenues, reducing the incentive to be transparent about damaged, older sites.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Nationalist Defiance & Sovereignty (↓, Large):** After a direct US military strike, the Iranian regime is under immense domestic pressure from hardliners to show strength and resist bowing to international demands. Granting access could be framed as a capitulation.
*   **Strategic Ambiguity (↓, Large):** The uncertain status of the 400kg of 60% enriched uranium is a powerful deterrent and bargaining chip. By denying inspection, Iran keeps adversaries guessing about whether the material is damaged, secured, or being repurposed, creating strategic leverage.
*   **Logistical Pretext (↓, Moderate):** The sites are confirmed to be heavily damaged. Iran can plausibly claim that inspections are unsafe or technically impossible, providing a convenient and difficult-to-refute reason for denial, even if the true motive is political.
*   **Desire for De-escalation & Sanctions Relief (↑, Moderate):** Iran's economy remains under pressure, and the regime may wish to avoid a wider conflict. Allowing inspections could be a key step to reopen diplomatic channels and seek the easing of sanctions, as likely demonstrated by the short-lived September deal.
*   **International Legitimacy (↑, Small):** Cooperating with the IAEA would restore some of Iran's standing as a signatory to the NPT and could garner support from neutral parties like China and Russia. However, this is a minor driver compared to security and domestic politics.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Known Stockpile as Bargaining Chip:** Unlike Iraq or Syria's clandestine programs, the IAEA knows Iran possesses a large stockpile of HEU. This isn't about discovering a secret program but verifying the status of a known, dangerous asset, making the stakes for both sides much higher.
*   **Direct US Attack:** The strikes were conducted by a superpower, not a regional rival. This escalates the nationalistic and political implications of "capitulation" far beyond the Osirak/Al-Kibar cases.
*   **Extreme Time Compression:** The resolution horizon is less than two months away. Major diplomatic reversals and the implementation of complex technical agreements rarely happen this quickly, especially in a post-conflict environment.
*   **Recent Failed Agreement:** The September deal's collapse is a crucial and unusual feature. It shows that a path to "Yes" existed but was actively rejected, suggesting the forces of non-cooperation have recently won the internal policy debate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior of ~15% is appropriate, anchored on the reference class of attacked states (<5%) but adjusted slightly upward by Iran's history of transactional diplomacy. (Strength: equivalent n of ~10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The US strike and subsequent suspension of cooperation set a strong negative baseline.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The September 9th agreement briefly offered a path to "Yes".
    *   (↓↓ Large) The October 20th scrapping of that agreement is the most powerful recent evidence, effectively negating the September signal and indicating a decisive shift against cooperation.
    *   (↓ Small) The short time horizon makes a complex agreement highly improbable.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces a "No" outcome. The posterior should move down significantly from an already low prior, likely into the single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for YES):**
    *   Statements from the Supreme Leader's office or the Supreme National Security Council signaling a desire for de-escalation.
    *   A high-profile visit by the IAEA Director General to Tehran that is not immediately rejected.
    *   Reports of back-channel talks between Iran and the U.S. or E3, mediated by a third party (e.g., Oman, Qatar).
    *   Satellite imagery showing significant, organized cleanup and preparation for external visitors at the sites.
*   **DOWN indicators (for NO):**
    *   Rhetoric from senior Iranian officials (e.g., IRGC commanders, President) emphasizing "resistance" and rejecting "foreign pressure."
    *   An official announcement that the sites are unsafe for inspectors for the foreseeable future.
    *   Any new IAEA Board of Governors resolution censuring Iran, which would likely trigger further defiance.
    *   Continued absence of any high-level diplomatic engagement on the issue.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** An "agreement" could be a vague verbal understanding rather than a formal, written deal. The resolution criteria require an "announcement," which is fairly

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate:** The historical precedent for countries allowing IAEA inspections after their nuclear facilities have been attacked is very low. For instance, Iraq and Syria did not allow inspections after their facilities were bombed. Therefore, a base rate of less than 5% is appropriate for this scenario. However, considering Iran's history of transactional diplomacy, where it has at times allowed inspections under pressure, we can adjust this base rate slightly upward to around 15%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The situation is similar to past cases where countries have been attacked and subsequently resisted international inspections, reinforcing a low probability of cooperation.

**Differences:** Unlike Iraq or Syria, Iran's stockpile is a known quantity, which could be used as a bargaining chip. Additionally, the recent history of a short-lived agreement with the IAEA suggests some willingness to negotiate, albeit temporarily.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **US Strike and Suspension of Cooperation:** The US military strike and Iran's subsequent suspension of cooperation create a strong negative baseline, suggesting a low likelihood of cooperation (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
  
- **September Agreement:** The temporary agreement to resume inspections indicates a moderate likelihood of cooperation, but its subsequent cancellation diminishes its weight (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H), but not strongly).

- **October Scrapping of Agreement:** The cancellation of the agreement is a decisive negative signal, indicating a strong likelihood of non-cooperation (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).

- **Short Time Horizon:** The short timeline makes a diplomatic reversal unlikely, further decreasing the probability of cooperation (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

**Prior Odds:** 15% probability translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).

**Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence, particularly the scrapping of the agreement, suggests a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1, reinforcing non-cooperation.

**Posterior Odds Calculation:**
- Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
- Given the strong negative evidence, the likelihood ratio is assumed to be around 0.2.
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.2 = 0.0352

**Posterior Probability:**
- Posterior probability = 0.0352 / (1 + 0.0352) ≈ 3.4%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might be overconfident in the negative outcome. However, given the strong negative signals and historical precedent, the low probability seems justified.
  
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A potential shift in Iran's domestic politics or international pressure could lead to a surprise agreement. However, these scenarios seem unlikely given the current context.

- **Rebuttals:** The September agreement shows some willingness to negotiate, but the subsequent cancellation and the short timeline make a reversal improbable.

### 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian updating, the final forecast is:

Final: 3%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class of similar situations where countries have allowed or denied international inspections of nuclear facilities after military strikes.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Countries whose nuclear facilities were attacked and their subsequent cooperation with IAEA (Iraq post-1981 Osirak strike, Syria post-2007 Al-Kibar strike)
- Iran's own historical pattern of IAEA cooperation during periods of high tension
- Countries negotiating nuclear inspections under severe international pressure

Looking at these reference classes:
- After the Israeli strikes on Iraq's Osirak reactor (1981) and Syria's Al-Kibar facility (2007), neither country allowed transparent IAEA inspections afterward
- Iran has historically used IAEA access as a bargaining chip, restricting access when under pressure and granting it when seeking diplomatic benefits
- The timeline for cooperation is extremely short (less than 2 months from now until 2026)

**Prior probability:** I'll set a base rate of 15%, which reflects:
- The very low cooperation rate of countries whose nuclear facilities were attacked (~5%)
- Adjusted slightly upward to account for Iran's history of transactional diplomacy with the IAEA
- The extremely short timeline (less than 2 months) which makes diplomatic breakthroughs less likely

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like previous cases, Iran has suffered a direct military strike on its nuclear facilities
- Iran has a consistent pattern of restricting IAEA access when under pressure
- The international community continues to pressure Iran for transparency

**Key differences:**
- The attack was conducted by the US (a superpower) rather than just Israel, making the political stakes of "capitulation" much higher
- Unlike Iraq or Syria's clandestine programs, Iran has a known stockpile of 400kg of 60% enriched uranium
- There was a brief agreement in September 2025 that was subsequently scrapped in October 2025
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than 2 months until 2026)
- The sites are heavily damaged, providing Iran with a plausible technical pretext to deny access

These differences generally make cooperation less likely than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: US B-2 bomber strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (June 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran were to allow inspections, this strike would be a major humiliation requiring significant diplomatic concessions to overcome
- P(E|~H): If Iran were to deny inspections, this strike provides strong justification for defiance
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors non-cooperation (P(E|~H) > P(E|H))
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 2: Iranian parliament vote to suspend IAEA cooperation (June 25, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran were to allow inspections, this vote would need to be reversed, requiring significant political capital
- P(E|~H): If Iran were to deny inspections, this vote provides formal domestic political backing
- Likelihood ratio: Favors non-cooperation (P(E|~H) > P(E|H))
- Direction: Decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Iran-IAEA deal announcement (September 9, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran were to allow inspections, this shows a pathway to cooperation exists
- P(E|~H): If Iran were to deny inspections, this deal would need to have failed
- Likelihood ratio: Favors cooperation (P(E|H) > P(E|~H))
- Direction: Increases probability

**Evidence 4: Iran scraps the IAEA deal (October 20, 2025)**
- P(E|H): If Iran were to allow inspections, this reversal would need to be reversed again
- P(E|~H): If Iran were to deny inspections, this is consistent and recent evidence
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors non-cooperation (P(E|~H) >> P(E|H))
- Direction: Significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 5: Short timeline (less than 2 months until 2026)**
- P(E|H): If Iran were to allow inspections, negotiations would need to conclude very rapidly
- P(E|~H): If Iran were to deny inspections, the status quo simply needs to persist
- Likelihood ratio: Favors non-cooperation (P(E|~H) > P(E|H))
- Direction: Decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176), I'll update based on the strongest pieces of evidence:

**Update on Evidence 4 (Iran scrapping the IAEA deal):**
- This is the most recent and decisive evidence
- Likelihood ratio: I estimate this as approximately 1:5 (much more likely under non-cooperation)
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × (1/5) = 0.035
- Posterior probability = 0.035/(1+0.035) ≈ 3.4%

**Update on Evidence 1 (US strikes):**
- Likelihood ratio: I estimate this as approximately 1:3 (more likely under non-cooperation)
- Posterior odds = 0.035 × (1/3) = 0.012
- Posterior probability = 0.012/(1+0.012) ≈ 1.2%

**Update on Evidence 3 (September deal):**
- This is the only significant evidence favoring cooperation
- Likelihood ratio: I estimate this as approximately 3:1 (more likely under cooperation)
- Posterior odds = 0.012 × 3 = 0.036
- Posterior probability = 0.036/(1+0.036) ≈ 3.5%

**Update on Evidence 5 (Short timeline):**
- Likelihood ratio: I estimate this as approximately 1:2 (more likely under non-cooperation)
- Posterior odds = 0.036 × (1/2) = 0.018
- Posterior probability = 0.018/(1+0.018) ≈ 1.8%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Iran's pragmatism and desire for sanctions relief
- The September deal, though scrapped, demonstrates that a path to cooperation exists
- Back-channel negotiations could be occurring that aren't publicly known
- Iran might see strategic value in demonstrating that its nuclear material is secure

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Iran could announce a limited, conditional inspection agreement as a diplomatic gesture
- A third-party mediator (Russia, China, or Oman) might broker a face-saving compromise
- Iran might allow inspections of one site as a token gesture while restricting access to others

**Adjustments:**
- The September deal does suggest some Iranian willingness to cooperate under the right conditions
- Given the extremely short timeline and recent negative developments, I'll maintain a low probability but adjust slightly upward to account for possible diplomatic breakthroughs

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence in this case, and potential blind spots, I assess that Iran is very unlikely to allow IAEA inspections of its enriched uranium stockpile before 2026. The recent scrapping of the September deal, combined with the extremely short timeline and the political dynamics following a direct US military strike, make cooperation highly improbable.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant base rate comes from the reference class of states whose nuclear facilities have been subjected to a foreign military attack. There are two key historical precedents:
1.  **Iraq (1981):** After Israel bombed the Osirak reactor, Iraq did not cooperate with the IAEA regarding the site and continued its clandestine nuclear program.
2.  **Syria (2007):** After Israel bombed the Al-Kibar facility in Deir ez-Zor, Syria denied the site's nuclear nature and obstructed IAEA access for years.

In both cases, the probability of allowing inspections shortly after the attack was effectively 0%. A broader reference class might be "countries negotiating nuclear access under extreme duress," which has a slightly higher success rate over longer timeframes, but the direct-attack precedent is much more powerful. Iran's own history is one of transactional cooperation, but a direct military strike by a superpower is an unprecedented level of duress.

Given this, a very low prior is appropriate. I will set the initial prior probability P(H) at **10%**. This is higher than the 0% suggested by the narrow reference class to account for the fact that Iran's program was previously under some safeguards and that Iran has a history of using inspections as a bargaining chip, which Iraq and Syria did not. The prior odds are 0.1 / 0.9 = 1/9, or 1-to-9 against.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Like Iraq and Syria, Iran has suffered a humiliating military strike on its sovereign territory targeting its most sensitive national program. The domestic political pressure to show defiance and not capitulate to international demands (which would be framed as caving to the attackers) is immense.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Known Stockpile:** Unlike the clandestine Iraqi and Syrian programs, the IAEA and the world *know* Iran possesses a significant stockpile of 60% enriched uranium. This raises the stakes, making verification more urgent for the international community but also making the stockpile a more potent bargaining chip for Iran to withhold.
    2.  **Attacker Identity:** The attack was carried out by the US, a superpower, not a regional rival. This likely amplifies the nationalist pressure for defiance, making cooperation even harder than in the base cases.
    3.  **Recent History:** The most significant difference is the sequence of events in late 2025. Iran has already gone through a mini-cycle of agreeing to a deal and then scrapping it, which provides powerful, specific evidence about its current intentions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key events that have occurred since the June 2025 war.

*   **Evidence A: Iran and the IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections (September 9, 2025).**
    *   This was a strong piece of evidence in favor of "Yes." It showed that a faction within the Iranian regime was willing and able to pursue a pragmatic path of de-escalation.
    *   P(E | H) is high: If a deal is to be made by December, a preliminary agreement in September is a very likely step.
    *   P(E | ~H) is low: If Iran was determined not to allow access, making a deal only to break it later is a possible, but less likely, diplomatic strategy.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1:** This evidence significantly increased the probability from the initial low prior.

*   **Evidence B: Iran announces the deal is void (October 20, 2025).**
    *   This is the most powerful and recent piece of evidence. It is not merely a lack of progress; it is an active reversal of a previous positive step.
    *   P(E | H) is very low: It is extremely unlikely that Iran would publicly scrap a deal in October if it intended to announce a new one less than two months later. This would signal extreme diplomatic incoherence.
    *   P(E | ~H) is very high: If Iran's ultimate decision is to deny access, then scrapping a preliminary deal is a logical and expected action, signaling that hardliners opposed to the deal have won the internal power struggle.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio <<< 1:** This evidence is extremely strong and points decisively toward "No." It effectively negates and overwhelms the positive signal from September.

*   **Evidence C: The short timeline (resolution before Jan 1, 2026).**
    *   There are less than two months remaining. High-stakes international agreements, especially after a military conflict, require extensive technical and political negotiation.
    *   P(E | H) is low: It is unlikely that such a complex and politically charged agreement could be finalized in such a short period.
    *   P(E | ~H) is high: If no deal is the outcome, the short timeline is a major contributing factor.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1:** This is a strong structural factor weighing against a "Yes" resolution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 1-to-9 against (10% probability).
2.  **Update with September Deal (Evidence A):** This positive news might have shifted the odds significantly, perhaps to 1-to-2 against (a 33% probability), as it showed a concrete path to "Yes" existed.
3.  **Update with October Scrapping of Deal (Evidence B):** This is a massive blow. It suggests the path to "Yes" is now closed. This evidence is much stronger than the September deal. It likely reduces the odds by a factor of 10 or more. Taking the 1-to-2 odds and applying a 1/10 likelihood ratio gives new odds of 1-to-20 against.
4.  **Update with Short Timeline (Evidence C):** This further reinforces the negative outlook. It might halve the remaining chance, moving the odds to 1-to-40 against.

*   **Posterior Odds:** 1-to-40 against.
*   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 40) = 1/41 ≈ 2.4%.

The evidence strongly suggests that the window for cooperation that briefly opened in September has been decisively shut. The dominant factors are now nationalist defiance, the strategic value of ambiguity over the uranium stockpile, and the practical difficulty of reaching a deal in under two months.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

What is the best argument for a "Yes" outcome, and why might my forecast be wrong?

The primary alternative scenario is one of **crisis diplomacy**. My analysis assumes a relatively static environment, but an external shock could force Iran's hand. For example:
*   A credible, private threat of a second, more devastating wave of strikes from the US/Israel if inspectors are not granted access by a specific deadline.
*   A severe internal crisis (e.g., economic collapse, widespread protests) that forces the regime to seek immediate sanctions relief at any cost.
*   A technical emergency at one of the bombed sites (e.g., risk of a major radiological leak) that requires IAEA assistance to manage, which could be framed domestically as a technical necessity rather than a political capitulation.

In such a crisis, a deal could be announced very quickly. The public scrapping of the October deal could even have been a tactic to raise the stakes before this final, high-pressure negotiation.

However, these are all low-probability, high-impact events. The baseline trajectory, based on the available evidence, is overwhelmingly negative. My calculated probability of ~2.4% seems too precise. Rounding up to **5%** accounts for these tail-risk scenarios without betraying the strong evidence against the resolution.

### 6. Final Forecast

The forecast is anchored on a very low base rate derived from historical precedents of attacked nuclear states. This low prior is then updated with recent, high-weight evidence. While a deal was briefly on the table in September, Iran's public reversal in October is a powerful signal that the political will for cooperation has evaporated. Combined with the extremely short timeline, the probability of Iran announcing an agreement for inspections is very low. The small residual probability accounts for the possibility of a sudden reversal driven by a new crisis or a secret back-channel deal.

Final: 5%
