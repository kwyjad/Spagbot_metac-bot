### Reference class & base rates
*   **Sub-Saharan African Country-Years (1960-2023):** This class includes countries with similar colonial histories, institutional development levels, and regional dynamics. The historical rate of successful coups in this region is approximately 1.8% per country-year. With a ~14-month forecast horizon (Sept 2023 - Dec 2025), this suggests a baseline probability of around 2.1%.
*   **Personalist Autocracies with Leaders in Power >30 Years:** This is a more specific and relevant class. Such regimes are often brittle, with stability highly dependent on the leader. While they excel at coup-proofing, succession periods are exceptionally volatile. The annual probability of a coup attempt (successful or not) in these specific regimes is higher, estimated at around 3-4%. This implies a baseline probability of ~4-5% over the forecast horizon.
*   **Post-Election Periods in Autocracies:** Contested or fraudulent elections in autocratic states are known triggers for instability, including coups. Data suggests a significant spike in coup risk in the months following such an event. This is not a standalone base rate but a powerful conditional modifier on the other classes.

**Reasoning:** The most appropriate reference class is the second one (long-serving personalist autocrats), adjusted for the acute risk of a post-election crisis. The general Sub-Saharan African rate provides a lower bound. The key limitation is that historical data averages out periods of stability and crisis; Cameroon is currently in an acute crisis period, making historical averages less predictive.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-12** The presidential election is held amidst concerns over fairness and the president's advanced age. — (→) Sets the stage for the primary destabilizing event.
*   **2025-10-27** 92-year-old Paul Biya is declared the winner of his eighth term with 53.66% of the vote. — (↑) The official result, widely seen as fraudulent, acts as the primary trigger for the current crisis.
*   **2025-10-29** Protests erupt in major cities, led by supporters of the opposition who allege widespread electoral fraud. — (↑) Popular unrest creates a permissive environment for a military intervention under the pretext of "restoring order."
*   **2025-10-31** The government suppresses protests, deepening the regime's legitimacy crisis and highlighting the lack of a constitutional succession plan. — (↑) Hardline response closes off political avenues for resolving the crisis, potentially making a coup seem like the only option for disgruntled elites.
*   **2025-11-06** The *Journal of Democracy* reports on suspicions of wide-scale vote manipulation, further undermining the election's credibility. — (↑) International and domestic perception of illegitimacy grows, weakening the regime's authority and support base.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Acute Succession Crisis (Large):** At 92, Biya's health is fragile and his succession is unplanned. The fraudulent election forces the issue. Elites, including his son Franck Biya and Secretary-General Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh, may see a pre-emptive move as the only way to secure power, fearing they will be sidelined in a chaotic post-Biya scramble.
*   **Elite Fragmentation & Military Factionalism (Large):** Biya's rule has depended on balancing competing factions within the military and government. This system, designed for stability, becomes a major risk factor when the arbiter is weakened. A faction that believes it is losing the succession race has a strong incentive to launch a coup.
*   **Regional Coup Contagion (Moderate):** Successful coups in nearby former French colonies (Niger, Gabon, Burkina Faso) have created a "coup belt" and normalized military intervention as a tool for political change, reducing the perceived international and regional costs for plotters.
*   **Military Grievances (Moderate):** The Cameroonian military is stretched thin, fighting Boko Haram in the north and a separatist insurgency in the Anglophone regions. Grievances over pay, equipment, and high casualties, combined with elite political maneuvering, could create a receptive audience for a coup plot within the mid-ranks of the officer corps.
*   **Popular Unrest as Pretext (Small):** While post-election protests create instability, the opposition is divided and has historically been unable to mobilize a critical mass for regime change. The protests are more likely to serve as a convenient justification for an elite-driven coup than to be the primary cause themselves.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Sophisticated Coup-Proofing:** Unlike many autocrats who are overthrown, Biya has survived for over 40 years by creating a complex, multi-layered security apparatus. The Presidential Guard (GP) is a powerful, well-equipped, and ethnically loyal force separate from the regular army, designed specifically to counter coup attempts. This is a powerful mitigating factor.
*   **Extreme Age and Frailty of Leader:** While the reference class is "long-serving autocrats," a 92-year-old leader who is rarely seen in public represents an extreme case. The power vacuum is not theoretical; it is immediate and tangible, dramatically increasing the incentives for pre-emptive action by would-be successors.
*   **Simultaneous Security Crises:** Cameroon is battling two separate, long-running, and resource-draining internal conflicts (Anglophone crisis, Boko Haram). This level of military overstretch is not typical for all autocracies and creates both grievances and opportunities for military plotters stationed far from the capital.
*   **Specific, Acute Trigger:** The situation is not one of general decay but of an acute crisis triggered by a specific event: the highly contentious October 2025 election. This focuses discontent and provides a clear window of opportunity and legitimacy for potential plotters.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a base rate from long-serving personalist autocracies, suggesting a ~4% probability over the ~14-month horizon (equivalent n ≈ 50, reflecting a moderately firm prior based on a specific but limited reference class).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The fraudulent election and Biya's extreme age have created an acute and undeniable succession crisis.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Regional coup contagion has lowered the barrier to action.
    *   (↑ Small) Popular unrest provides a potential pretext for military intervention.
    *   (↓ Large) The regime's 40-year history of sophisticated coup-proofing, centered on the loyal Presidential Guard, remains a formidable obstacle.
    *   (↓ Small) The political opposition is fragmented and lacks the power to coordinate with military factions effectively.
*   **Net effect:** The powerful upward pressures from the immediate succession crisis significantly outweigh the historical stability factors. The posterior should move sharply upward from the low base rate, reflecting a situation of heightened, acute risk.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Unusual movements or deployments of the Presidential Guard (GP) or Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR) in or around the capital, Yaoundé.
    *   Reports of arrests or dismissals of senior military officers or cabinet members.
    *   President Biya fails to appear at a key state function or is unseen for an extended period, fueling health rumors.
    *   Public statements of loyalty to "the constitution" rather than "the president" from key military commanders.
    *   Escalation of protest suppression, indicating loss of control through normal policing.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Successful and visible crackdown on opposition leaders, ending protests without military dissent.
    *   President Biya appears in public looking healthy and in command.
    *   Key potential successors (Franck Biya, Ngoh Ngoh) make prominent, coordinated appearances demonstrating regime unity.
    *   The military's focus remains demonstrably on the Anglophone and northern regions, with no shift in posture towards the capital.
    *   France or another key international partner issues a strong, explicit statement of support for the Biya government.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Opacity:** The inner workings of the Cameroonian regime are notoriously opaque. Reliable information on military factionalism or the president's health is scarce, and rumors are rampant.
*   **Palace Coup vs. Military Coup:** A "palace coup" where one elite faction (e.g., Ngoh Ngoh's) replaces Biya with a handpicked successor (e.g., Franck Biya) might not meet the "armed group seizing control" criteria if it's presented as a constitutional transfer of power due to health, even if coerced.
*   **The 7-Day Rule:** The resolution criteria require control for 7+ days. A coup attempt could be launched and fail within this window (e.g., a failed putsch by a mid-level officer), which would not trigger a "Yes" resolution.
*   **The Presidential Guard (GP):** The loyalty and effectiveness of the GP is the single biggest uncertainty. If they remain loyal to the Biya clan, a coup is nearly impossible. If a faction of the GP is co-opted, a coup becomes highly probable. Their actions are the key variable.

**Final Research Summary:** The fraudulent October 2025 election has transformed Cameroon's chronic succession risk into an acute crisis, significantly increasing the probability of a coup before 2026; however, this is strongly counteracted by one of Africa's most resilient and sophisticated coup-proofing systems.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate for this situation is from the reference class of "Personalist Autocracies with Leaders in Power >30 Years," which suggests an annual probability of a coup attempt of around 3-4%. Given the forecast horizon of approximately 14 months, this translates to a baseline probability of about 4-5%. This base rate is chosen because it reflects the specific characteristics of Cameroon's political situation under Paul Biya, who has been in power for over 40 years.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Cameroon under Paul Biya fits well into the reference class of long-serving personalist autocracies, where power is highly centralized and succession is often a source of instability.
   - Differences: The current situation in Cameroon is marked by an acute succession crisis due to Biya's advanced age and the recent contentious election, which are not typical of all cases in the reference class. These factors increase the likelihood of a coup compared to the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Fraudulent Election and Succession Crisis**: The likelihood of a coup is higher given the acute succession crisis and the perception of electoral fraud. This evidence increases the probability.
   - **Regional Coup Contagion**: Recent coups in neighboring countries reduce the perceived costs of a coup in Cameroon, increasing the probability.
   - **Sophisticated Coup-Proofing**: Biya's regime has a strong coup-proofing apparatus, which decreases the probability.
   - **Military Grievances and Popular Unrest**: These factors create a conducive environment for a coup, increasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 4% probability translates to odds of 0.04 / 0.96 = 0.0417.
   - Likelihood ratio: Considering the strong evidence for increased coup risk (succession crisis, regional contagion) versus the mitigating factor of coup-proofing, let's assume a likelihood ratio of 3:1 in favor of a coup.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0417 × 3 = 0.1251.
   - Posterior probability = 0.1251 / (1 + 0.1251) ≈ 11.1%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might overestimate the impact of recent coups in neighboring countries, as each country's political dynamics are unique.
   - Alternative scenario: A palace coup or a constitutional transfer of power might occur without meeting the criteria for a "successful coup" as defined.
   - Adjustments: Consider the possibility of a non-violent transfer of power or a failed coup attempt, which would not resolve the question as "Yes."

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final forecast probability for a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026 is adjusted to reflect both the heightened risk and the mitigating factors.

Final: 11%

# Will there be a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the reference class of "personalist autocracies with leaders in power >30 years" as my primary base rate, as it most closely matches Cameroon's situation under Paul Biya (in power since 1982).

- Historical data suggests coup attempts (successful or not) in such regimes occur at approximately 3-4% annually
- With a ~14-month forecast horizon (from now until December 2025), this translates to a baseline probability of ~4-5%
- This reference class is particularly relevant because it captures the unique dynamics of long-entrenched personalist regimes facing succession challenges

I'll start with a prior probability of 4.5% over the forecast period, which represents the base rate for successful coups in this specific type of regime over a similar timeframe.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Long-serving autocratic leader (Biya has ruled for 43 years, typical of the reference class)
- Sophisticated coup-proofing mechanisms developed over decades
- Ethnic and regional balancing used to maintain power
- Controlled elections used to maintain facade of legitimacy

**Key differences that matter:**
- **Extreme age factor:** At 92, Biya is exceptionally old even for long-serving autocrats, creating an immediate succession crisis
- **Acute trigger event:** The recent fraudulent October 2025 election has created a specific crisis point
- **Multiple simultaneous security challenges:** Fighting both Boko Haram and Anglophone separatists, stretching military resources
- **Regional contagion:** Recent successful coups in neighboring former French colonies create a "demonstration effect"

These differences, particularly Biya's extreme age and the acute post-election crisis, significantly increase the coup risk compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Fraudulent October 2025 election and subsequent protests**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - A contested, fraudulent election is a classic trigger for coups
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Fraudulent elections often occur without leading to coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 - This significantly increases coup probability

**Evidence 2: Biya's extreme age (92) and visible frailty**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Physical incapacity of the leader is a strong coup predictor
- P(E|~H): Low (~0.15) - Regimes with physically capable leaders rarely face coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~6.3 - This dramatically increases coup probability

**Evidence 3: Sophisticated coup-proofing mechanisms (Presidential Guard, ethnic balancing)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - Successful coups rarely occur against well-protected regimes
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Regimes with effective coup-proofing typically avoid coups
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 - This significantly decreases coup probability

**Evidence 4: Regional coup contagion in former French colonies**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Coups often cluster regionally
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Regional patterns exist independent of specific country outcomes
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75 - This moderately increases coup probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 4.5% (odds of 0.047:1), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on fraudulent election and protests:**
- Prior odds: 0.047:1
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.047 × 3.0 = 0.141:1
- Posterior probability: 0.141/(1+0.141) = 12.4%

**Update on Biya's extreme age and frailty:**
- Prior odds: 0.141:1
- Likelihood ratio: 6.3
- Posterior odds: 0.141 × 6.3 = 0.888:1
- Posterior probability: 0.888/(1+0.888) = 47.0%

**Update on sophisticated coup-proofing:**
- Prior odds: 0.888:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.888 × 0.25 = 0.222:1
- Posterior probability: 0.222/(1+0.222) = 18.2%

**Update on regional coup contagion:**
- Prior odds: 0.222:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.222 × 1.75 = 0.389:1
- Posterior probability: 0.389/(1+0.389) = 28.0%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 28%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting the impact of Biya's age and the election crisis
- Historical data shows most succession crises in personalist regimes don't result in coups
- The Presidential Guard's effectiveness may be underestimated
- The 7-day criterion for resolution means failed coup attempts don't count

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A "palace coup" where Biya is replaced by a family member through constitutional means
- A negotiated transition where elites agree on a successor to avoid instability
- Protests being effectively suppressed without military involvement
- International pressure leading to a power-sharing arrangement

**Best alternative forecast:**
A much lower probability (~10%) could be justified by emphasizing Cameroon's 40+ years without a successful coup and the sophisticated security apparatus. The counterargument is that this stability was maintained by Biya himself, whose extreme age now creates unprecedented vulnerability.

**Adjustments:**
Given the strict resolution criteria (armed group seizing control for 7+ days) and Cameroon's sophisticated coup-proofing, I should moderate my estimate somewhat. However, the acute succession crisis and post-election instability remain powerful factors.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence, base rates, and potential biases, I assess there is a significant but still minority chance of a successful coup in Cameroon before 2026. The combination of Biya's extreme age, the fraudulent election, and regional contagion creates an unusually high-risk environment, but this is partially offset by sophisticated coup-proofing mechanisms.

Final: 25%

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is not just "Sub-Saharan African countries" but more specifically "personalist autocracies with leaders in power for over 30 years." Paul Biya's 41-year rule places Cameroon squarely in this category. These regimes are characterized by strong coup-proofing but extreme fragility during succession periods.
*   **Base Rate Calculation:** The research report suggests an annual coup attempt probability of 3-4% for this reference class. However, the current situation is not a random year; it is the immediate aftermath of a highly contentious election, a known catalyst for coups. Data suggests coup risk spikes significantly in such periods. Therefore, I will establish a conditional prior for this specific high-risk 1.5-month period (Nov 13, 2025, to Dec 31, 2025). A conservative estimate would be that the risk during this crisis window is several times the annualized average.
*   **Initial Prior (P(H)):** I will set the prior probability of a successful coup within this specific ~48-day window at **5%**. This is significantly higher than a pro-rata share of the annual 3-4% rate, reflecting the acute crisis context described in the report. This corresponds to prior odds of 5/95, or 1/19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Cameroon exhibits classic features of the reference class: a long-serving, aging autocrat, patronage networks, and a recent, allegedly fraudulent election serving as a trigger for instability. The regional environment, with recent coups in other former French colonies, is also a common factor that can lower the threshold for military intervention.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Extreme Leader Age:** At 92, Biya is an outlier even among long-serving autocrats. His physical frailty makes the succession crisis not a future problem but an immediate and unavoidable one, dramatically increasing the incentives for pre-emptive action by elite factions.
    *   **Proven Coup-Proofing:** Biya's regime has survived for over four decades due to a sophisticated and multi-layered security apparatus, particularly the loyal and well-equipped Presidential Guard (GP). This is a powerful force for the status quo that has successfully neutralized past threats.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the report and their impact on the initial 5% prior.

*   **Evidence 1: Acute and Escalating Post-Election Crisis.** (Protests, international condemnation, hardline government response).
    *   P(E | H): Very high. A successful coup would almost certainly arise from, and be justified by, this exact scenario of a legitimacy crisis and public unrest.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. The regime could still survive by successfully repressing the protests, or the crisis could resolve in another manner (e.g., Biya's natural death).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (coup). This evidence significantly increases the probability. Let's estimate the LR as ~4.

*   **Evidence 2: Sophisticated and Historically Effective Coup-Proofing.** (The Presidential Guard's role).
    *   P(E | H): Low. For a coup to succeed, this formidable system must either be defeated, circumvented, or, most likely, co-opted by a powerful internal faction.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. The existence and track record of this system is the primary reason the regime has been stable for 40 years.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H (no coup). This is the most powerful piece of evidence against a coup. Let's estimate the LR as ~1/3. The system's strength is discounted somewhat because its loyalty may fracture during an internal succession struggle among the elites it is designed to protect.

*   **Evidence 3: Elite Fragmentation and Succession Rivalries.** (Franck Biya vs. Ferdinand Ngoh Ngoh).
    *   P(E | H): Very high. A coup would likely be the result of one of these factions making a move to secure power.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. The elites could also find a non-coup pact to manage the succession or could be held in check by the existing power balance.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderately favors H. This internal division turns the coup-proofing apparatus from a monolithic defense into a potential weapon for internal rivals. Let's estimate the LR as ~2.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

I will update the prior odds using the likelihood ratios from the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1/19 (corresponding to P=5%).
*   **Step 1: Update for the Acute Crisis (LR ≈ 4):**
    *   Posterior Odds = (1/19) * 4 = 4/19.
    *   New Probability ≈ 4 / (4 + 19) = 4/23 ≈ 17.4%.
*   **Step 2: Update for Elite Fragmentation (LR ≈ 2):**
    *   Posterior Odds = (4/19) * 2 = 8/19.
    *   New Probability ≈ 8 / (8 + 19) = 8/27 ≈ 29.6%.
*   **Step 3: Update for Coup-Proofing (LR ≈ 1/3):**
    *   Posterior Odds = (8/19) * (1/3) = 8/57.
    *   **Final Posterior Probability** ≈ 8 / (8 + 57) = 8/65 ≈ **12.3%**.

The combination of powerful competing factors moves the probability significantly upward from the base rate but keeps it well below 50%, reflecting that regime survival remains the most likely single outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Argument for a Lower Forecast (<10%):** I might be underestimating the resilience of Biya's system. For 40 years, it has managed elite competition and neutralized threats. The key actors may fear a chaotic civil war more than they desire supreme power, leading them to stick with the status quo or a negotiated settlement. The protests may be easily contained, removing the pretext for a coup.
*   **Argument for a Higher Forecast (>20%):** I might be overweighting the historical success of the coup-proofing system and underestimating how much Biya's extreme age and the blatant electoral fraud have changed the calculus for all actors. The system was designed to protect a strong Biya; it may not function to manage a war of succession between his lieutenants. A pre-emptive strike by one faction may be seen as the only rational move, making a coup highly likely.
*   **Conclusion:** The current forecast of ~12% seems to be a reasonable balance. It acknowledges that the situation is highly volatile and the risk is acute, but it also respects the immense institutional barriers to a successful coup. The short timeframe (ending Dec 31, 2025) concentrates this risk.

### 6. Final Forecast

The situation in Cameroon as described presents a classic case of heightened coup risk: an acute succession crisis triggered by a fraudulent election involving a 92-year-old autocrat. This significantly elevates the probability above a standard base rate. However, this is counteracted by one of the continent's most time-tested and sophisticated coup-proofing systems. The final probability reflects the tension between these two powerful, opposing forces during a very short, high-stakes period. My final estimate is that the strong upward pressures from the crisis slightly outweigh the historical resilience of the regime.

Final: 12%
