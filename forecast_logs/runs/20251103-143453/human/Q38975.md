### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Enron Prosecutions of Major Western CEOs:** The period from 2006 (Skilling's conviction) to 2024 provides a relevant reference class. In this ~18-year period, across the thousands of companies in the specified indices, the number of senior executives imprisoned for corporate (not personal) crimes is extremely low. Notable cases are rare; for example, no major US bank CEO was jailed after the 2008 crisis. This suggests a base rate of well under one such event per year across all listed indices combined, perhaps in the range of **0.05–0.15 events per year**.
2.  **German Corporate Crime Prosecutions:** Germany has a few high-profile ongoing cases (VW, Wirecard). Historically, however, long prison sentences for top executives of major corporations have been rare. Cases often end in fines, suspended sentences, or acquittals after lengthy trials. The 2023 suspended sentence for former Audi CEO Rupert Stadler is a recent example. This suggests a very low base rate for *imprisonment* specifically within the DAX40 class, likely lower than the US rate.
3.  **Major Corporate Scandal Prosecutions (Global):** Looking at major global scandals over the past 20 years (e.g., LIBOR, VW emissions, Wells Fargo, Petrobras, Olympus), the pattern is consistent: junior/mid-level employees are sometimes imprisoned, but top-tier C-suite executives from the parent company rarely are. The process from scandal-to-imprisonment is multi-year and fraught with legal challenges. This class implies that for a "Yes" to occur, a major scandal must have broken years ago and the legal process must be in its final stages.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-20** Ongoing trial of former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun continues with complex testimony. No verdict is anticipated before mid-2026, well after the resolution date. ↓
*   **2025-09-15** Health-related delays continue to plague the start of former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn's trial for market manipulation. It is now highly improbable the trial will even begin, let alone conclude with a prison sentence, before 2026. ↓
*   **2025-07-23** The UK Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Tom Hayes for Libor rigging. While not a senior executive per the question's definition, this sets a higher bar for proving dishonesty in complex financial cases, potentially chilling future prosecutions. ↓
*   **2025-06-01** US Department of Justice officials reiterated a focus on corporate enforcement but recent major actions have primarily resulted in large corporate fines and Deferred Prosecution Agreements (DPAs), not executive prison sentences. ↔

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Legal Process Duration (Large):** The single largest driver making a "No" outcome likely. The timeline from investigation to indictment, trial, conviction, sentencing, and exhaustion of initial appeals typically spans 5-10 years for complex corporate crime. With less than two months remaining, any case not already at the sentencing stage has virtually no chance of resolving to "Yes".
2.  **Burden of Proof (Large):** Proving specific intent (*mens rea*) for a senior executive in a vast corporation is exceptionally difficult. Prosecutors must show the executive knew about and directed the criminal action, cutting through layers of delegation. This high bar leads to acquittals, plea deals for lesser charges, or a focus on prosecuting lower-level employees.
3.  **Defendant Resources (Moderate):** Executives of major public companies can afford the best legal defense teams in the world. These teams are skilled at creating delays, challenging evidence, and negotiating favorable settlements (e.g., fines, suspended sentences) that avoid prison time.
4.  **Corporate vs. Individual Liability (Moderate):** A strong trend, particularly in the US and UK, is to hold the corporation liable with massive fines or DPAs, while avoiding the costly and uncertain prosecution of individuals. This satisfies public/political pressure for accountability without needing to meet the high criminal burden of proof for an individual.
5.  **Political & Public Will (Small):** While a major new scandal could theoretically increase pressure for swift justice, this mechanism is too slow to affect the outcome within the short remaining timeframe. Existing political will has not been sufficient to accelerate current cases to a conclusion.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
1.  **Extremely Short Horizon:** The most critical difference. The question resolves in under two months. Unlike a forecast made in 2021, we are not speculating about future investigations. We are assessing the final outcome of a very small, known set of late-stage legal cases.
2.  **Lack of Viable Candidates:** In the early 2000s (Enron/Worldcom era), there was a pipeline of high-profile executives heading to trial. Currently, the pipeline of senior executives from the specified indices who are convicted and awaiting a prison sentence before Jan 1, 2026, appears empty. The most prominent candidates (Winterkorn, Braun) are not realistically on a path to imprisonment within the timeframe.
3.  **Post-Hayes Legal Environment:** The overturning of Tom Hayes's conviction in the UK creates legal headwinds for prosecutors in complex financial cases, potentially making them more cautious and strengthening the hand of the defense in any ongoing or future cases.
4.  **Prevalence of Suspended Sentences:** The June 2023 suspended sentence for former Audi CEO Rupert Stadler (a VW subsidiary) in a related emissions case provides a strong, recent precedent for German courts handling these matters without imprisonment, even after a conviction.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the historical rarity, a forecaster in 2021 might have started with a low prior (e.g., 15-20%) for the 5-year period, with an equivalent n of ~20, reflecting a stable but low-frequency phenomenon.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↓ **(Large):** The remaining time horizon is <2 months, collapsing the window of possibility. The slow, multi-year nature of the legal process means any case not already concluded is effectively ruled out.
    *   ↓ **(Large):** The primary candidates are not viable. Winterkorn's trial is indefinitely delayed; Braun's trial will not conclude in time. There are no other known public candidates at the sentencing phase.
    *   ↓ **(Moderate):** The Stadler suspended sentence and the Hayes overturned conviction serve as recent, powerful evidence that the path to *imprisonment* specifically is becoming more difficult, even when wrongdoing is established.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The posterior should be revised significantly lower from an already low prior, approaching a floor probability.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   News of a surprise plea bargain from a senior executive in a previously non-public investigation that includes immediate imprisonment.
    *   An unexpected and sudden announcement that Martin Winterkorn's trial will begin immediately and be fast-tracked (extremely unlikely).
    *   A major financial market collapse or scandal that triggers an unprecedented, rapid political/legal response against a specific, named executive.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Official confirmation that the Winterkorn trial is postponed until 2026 or later.
    *   Any major procedural ruling in the Wirecard trial that further extends its expected timeline.
    *   The passage of time; every day that passes without news of an imminent sentencing makes a "Yes" resolution less likely.

### Caveats & pitfalls
1.  **Information Asymmetry:** We are reliant on public information. A sealed indictment or a non-public investigation could exist, though a plea deal leading to imprisonment in <2 months without prior public reporting is highly improbable.
2.  **Definitional Gotcha (Crime Type):** The resolution criteria exclude crimes like personal insider trading. A conviction must be for actions taken *in a corporate capacity*, such as accounting fraud to benefit the company's stock price.
3.  **Definitional Gotcha (Imprisonment Starts):** The sentence must *begin* before Jan 1, 2026. A conviction or sentencing in December 2025 where the executive is ordered to report to prison in January 2026 would not count.
4.  **Black Swan Event:** The possibility of a sudden, shocking confession and plea deal in a new scandal cannot be completely ruled out, but its probability is vanishingly small given standard legal procedure.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of this event is extremely low. The historically low base rate is compounded by an exceptionally short time horizon and a clear lack of viable, late-stage legal cases against senior executives from the specified indices.

To forecast the probability of any senior executives of major public companies being imprisoned for corporate crimes before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for senior executives being imprisoned for corporate crimes is extremely low. Historical data from the post-Enron era (2006 onwards) shows very few high-profile convictions of senior executives, especially in major indices like S&P 500, FTSE 100, DAX 40, etc. The base rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.05–0.15 events per year. Given the rarity of such events, a reasonable prior probability for any such event occurring in a given year is around 5-10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the rarity of executive imprisonments. However, it differs in that the time horizon is extremely short (less than two months), and there are no known viable candidates for imprisonment within this timeframe. This makes the probability even lower than the historical base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Ongoing Trials:** The trials of former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun and former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn are ongoing, but neither is expected to conclude with imprisonment before 2026. This evidence decreases the probability.
- **Legal Environment:** The recent overturning of Tom Hayes's conviction and the suspended sentence for Rupert Stadler suggest a legal environment less conducive to imprisoning senior executives. This further decreases the probability.
- **US DOJ Focus:** The US DOJ's focus on corporate fines and DPAs rather than imprisoning executives suggests a continuation of the trend away from individual accountability. This is neutral to slightly negative evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of around 5%, the overwhelming evidence against a "Yes" outcome (due to the short timeframe and lack of viable candidates) suggests a significant downward revision. The likelihood ratios for the evidence are heavily skewed towards decreasing the probability.

- **Prior Odds:** 0.05 / 0.95 = 0.0526
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the evidence, let's assume a likelihood ratio of 0.1 (strong evidence against the event occurring).
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.0526 * 0.1 = 0.00526
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.00526 / (1 + 0.00526) ≈ 0.0052 or 0.52%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The probability is very low, but not zero. Consideration of a black swan event (e.g., a sudden plea deal) is necessary, though highly improbable.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** The only plausible scenario for a "Yes" outcome would be an unexpected, rapid legal development, which is unlikely given the current legal processes.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of public information about any imminent imprisonments supports the low probability.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, the current evidence, and the short timeframe, the probability of any senior executives being imprisoned for corporate crimes before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Probability Analysis: Will any senior executives of major public companies be imprisoned for corporate crimes before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for senior executives of major public companies being imprisoned for corporate crimes over a specific time period.

**Historical data points:**
- Jeffrey Skilling (Enron) was imprisoned in 2006
- Very few high-profile convictions of corporate executives since then
- No major convictions of bank executives after the 2007-2008 financial crisis
- Tom Hayes (not a senior executive) was imprisoned for LIBOR fixing
- Generally, executives have escaped imprisonment even when their companies faced sanctions

Looking at the period from 2006 to 2021 (when the question was posted), across the thousands of companies in the specified indices (S&P500, FTSE100, DAX40, CAC40, FTSE MIB, Nikkei 22), there were extremely few cases of senior executives being imprisoned for corporate crimes.

**Prior probability calculation:**
- Approximately 1-2 cases over a 15-year period across thousands of companies
- For a 5-year window (2021-2026), this would suggest a base rate of approximately 0.33-0.67 cases
- Converting to probability: ~5-10% chance of at least one case in the 5-year period

I'll use a prior of **7%** based on this historical frequency.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The legal frameworks for prosecuting corporate crime remain largely unchanged
- The burden of proof for establishing criminal intent at the executive level remains high
- Companies still have significant resources for legal defense
- Regulatory preference for corporate fines over individual prosecution continues

**Key differences:**
- We are now in November 2025, with less than 2 months remaining before the resolution date
- Any case not already at the sentencing phase has virtually no chance of resulting in imprisonment before January 2026
- The most prominent potential cases (Wirecard, VW) are not progressing at a pace that would lead to imprisonment within the timeframe
- Recent precedents (like the suspended sentence for former Audi CEO Rupert Stadler) suggest a continued reluctance to imprison executives

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Time horizon**
- P(E|H): If an executive will be imprisoned before 2026, we would expect their case to be in final stages now = 0.95
- P(E|~H): If no executive will be imprisoned, we would expect no cases in final stages = 0.99
- Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.99 = 0.96 (slightly negative)
- With less than 2 months remaining, any case not already at sentencing has virtually no chance of completing in time

**Evidence 2: Status of prominent cases**
- P(E|H): If an executive will be imprisoned, we would expect at least one prominent case to be near conclusion = 0.9
- P(E|~H): If no executive will be imprisoned, we would expect all prominent cases to be delayed or not progressing toward imprisonment = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.95 = 0.95 (negative)
- Winterkorn's trial is delayed, Braun's trial will not conclude in time, and no other known candidates are at the sentencing phase

**Evidence 3: Recent legal precedents**
- P(E|H): If an executive will be imprisoned, we would expect recent precedents to support this outcome = 0.7
- P(E|~H): If no executive will be imprisoned, we would expect recent precedents to favor non-imprisonment outcomes = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.9 = 0.78 (strongly negative)
- The Stadler suspended sentence and Hayes overturned conviction indicate increasing difficulty in securing imprisonment

**Evidence 4: Lack of news about imminent sentencing**
- P(E|H): If an executive will be imprisoned soon, we would expect news coverage = 0.95
- P(E|~H): If no executive will be imprisoned, we would expect no such news = 0.99
- Likelihood ratio: 0.95/0.99 = 0.96 (slightly negative)
- The absence of news about any imminent sentencing is evidence against imprisonment occurring

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 7%/93% = 0.075

Updating with Evidence 1 (time horizon):
- Posterior odds = 0.075 × 0.96 = 0.072
- Posterior probability = 0.072/(1 + 0.072) = 6.7%

Updating with Evidence 2 (status of prominent cases):
- Posterior odds = 0.072 × 0.95 = 0.0684
- Posterior probability = 0.0684/(1 + 0.0684) = 6.4%

Updating with Evidence 3 (recent legal precedents):
- Posterior odds = 0.0684 × 0.78 = 0.0533
- Posterior probability = 0.0533/(1 + 0.0533) = 5.1%

Updating with Evidence 4 (lack of news):
- Posterior odds = 0.0533 × 0.96 = 0.0512
- Posterior probability = 0.0512/(1 + 0.0512) = 4.9%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of non-public investigations that could suddenly become public
- There could be plea deals being negotiated in secret that might result in immediate imprisonment
- I might be overlooking cases in countries with faster judicial processes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A surprise confession and immediate imprisonment agreement could occur (though extremely unlikely)
- A judge could unexpectedly deny bail pending appeal after a recent conviction
- A previously unknown investigation could suddenly reach conclusion

**Best alternative forecast:**
The best case for a higher probability would be that there are ongoing investigations we don't know about that are about to conclude. However, given the typical timeline of corporate crime cases and the public nature of prosecutions against major company executives, this seems highly implausible within the remaining timeframe.

After considering these possibilities, I believe my forecast may still be slightly too high given the extremely short time remaining. I'll adjust downward slightly.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the historical rarity of senior executive imprisonments, the extremely short time remaining before resolution (less than 2 months), the lack of viable candidates at the sentencing phase, and recent legal precedents favoring non-imprisonment outcomes, I assess the probability as very low.

Final: 3%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is the imprisonment of a senior executive from a major public company for corporate crimes. The most appropriate reference class is the historical frequency of such events in developed economies since the last major wave of such prosecutions in the early 2000s (Enron, Worldcom).

The background and research report note that since Jeffrey Skilling's imprisonment in 2006, such events have been extremely rare. No major US bank CEO was imprisoned after the 2008 financial crisis, and other scandals (e.g., LIBOR, VW emissions) have rarely led to prison time for the most senior executives.

Based on this history, a reasonable base rate is approximately **0.1 such events per year** across the combined pool of ~1000 companies in the specified indices. For the original 5-year period of the question (2021-2025), this base rate would imply a prior probability of at least one event occurring of roughly 40% (`1 - e^(-0.1 * 5)`). This serves as our starting point for the entire period.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is fundamentally different from the base case (a forecast made at the start of 2021) due to the **time horizon**. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, which is less than two months from the current date (November 3, 2025).

The core mechanisms that make these prosecutions rare—high burden of proof, vast defendant resources, long legal timelines, and a preference for corporate fines—remain the same. However, the fact that 58 of the 60 months in the resolution period have passed without a positive event is itself extremely strong evidence. We are no longer forecasting a 5-year period, but a 2-month period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
We must update our prior based on the evidence that has accumulated, particularly the status of known legal cases and the passage of time.

*   **Evidence 1: Passage of Time.** 97% of the resolution period (58 out of 60 months) has passed without the event occurring. This drastically reduces the probability. If we assume events are uniformly distributed in time (a simplification), the initial 40% probability for the 5-year period would be reduced to a small fraction for the remaining 2 months. A simple proration of the annual rate gives a starting point for the remaining period: `P(event in 2 months) ≈ (0.1 events/year) * (2/12 years) ≈ 1.7%`.

*   **Evidence 2: Status of Key Candidates.** The most prominent public candidates for imprisonment are not on a path to resolve in time.
    *   **Martin Winterkorn (former VW CEO):** His trial is indefinitely delayed due to health reasons and is highly unlikely to even begin, let alone conclude, before 2026. This effectively removes him as a candidate.
    *   **Markus Braun (former Wirecard CEO):** His ongoing trial is complex and a verdict is not expected before mid-2026. This also removes him as a candidate.
    *   This evidence has a very strong negative likelihood ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H) << 1). If an imprisonment were to happen (H), it's highly unlikely that the most visible candidates would be simultaneously ruled out. This evidence forces us to revise the probability significantly downward from the 1.7% estimate.

*   **Evidence 3: Lack of a Public Pipeline.** For an executive to be imprisoned in the next two months, their case would almost certainly need to be at the final stage (i.e., convicted, sentenced, and appeals exhausted). There are no known public cases involving senior executives from the specified indices that are at this stage. The legal process from indictment to the start of a prison sentence typically takes years, not weeks.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the time-adjusted prior of **1.7%**. This represents the average probability for any given 2-month period based on the historical base rate.

Now, we introduce the powerful evidence that the known pipeline is empty. The 1.7% probability was an average, composed of times when a candidate was nearing sentencing and times when no one was. We are definitively in the latter state. This means the true probability must be much lower than the average.

The only remaining paths to a "Yes" resolution are:
1.  A surprise guilty plea in a currently non-public investigation that includes immediate imprisonment.
2.  A senior executive in a non-US/German jurisdiction (e.g., Italy, France, Japan) is at the final stage of a case that is not widely reported in English-language media.

The probability of these scenarios is very low, but not zero. The evidence about the known candidates removes the most likely paths to a "Yes" resolution, likely eliminating >90% of the remaining probability mass.

*   **Conceptual Update:**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Prior Odds (for 1.7%) ≈ 1.7 / 98.3 ≈ 0.0173
    *   Likelihood Ratio (for "known pipeline is empty") is very small, perhaps 0.1 or less.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.0173 * 0.1 = 0.00173
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.00173 / 1.00173 ≈ 0.17%

This calculation suggests a probability below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a sub-1% probability. Could I be wrong? The primary blind spot is information asymmetry, particularly regarding legal proceedings in non-anglophone countries (France, Italy, Japan). While a quick search reveals no imminent candidates, a case could exist. The Metaculus community forecast is currently 1%, which is a valuable signal from a large group of forecasters who may have access to different information or perspectives. My own bottom-up estimate, assigning a small (e.g., 0.2%) but non-zero probability to an unknown case in each of the non-US/German jurisdictions, sums to a figure close to 1%. This suggests that while my initial calculation of <0.2% is plausible, accounting for the "unknown unknowns" across several different legal systems pushes the forecast slightly higher. A 1% forecast reasonably captures the extremely low probability while not being overconfidently close to zero.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate of such events is very low. The vast majority of the resolution period has passed without an event. The most prominent potential candidates have been effectively ruled out by legal delays. The only remaining possibility is a surprise event or a late-stage case that is not widely known, which is highly improbable but not impossible. Therefore, the final probability is extremely low.

Final: 1%
