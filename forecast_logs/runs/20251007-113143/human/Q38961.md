### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: New or Escalating Conflicts (UCDP, 1989-2024).** This class includes any year in which a new conflict began and caused >5,000 battle-related deaths, or an existing conflict saw a "substantial escalation" (defined here as a >100% increase in deaths from the prior year to cross the 5,000 threshold). Analysis of UCDP data suggests such an event occurs in approximately 10-12 of the 36 years in this period.
    -   **Base Rate:** **~28-33% per year.**
    -   **Reasoning:** This is the most direct reference class. It captures both new wars (e.g., Iraq 2003) and major escalations (e.g., Syria post-2011, Ethiopia 2021-2022).
    -   **Limitations:** The definition of "substantial escalation" is subjective. The nature of warfare has changed (e.g., drone proliferation), potentially altering lethality dynamics.

-   **Reference Class 2: Any Year with at least one >5,000-death conflict.** This is a broader class, simply asking how often *any* conflict, new or old, crosses this threshold. This happens much more frequently, in at least 25 of the 36 years from 1989-2024.
    -   **Base Rate:** **~70% per year.**
    -   **Reasoning:** This provides an upper bound, reflecting the general prevalence of high-intensity conflict. The question requires a *new* or *escalating* conflict, making this class less precise but useful for context on the overall conflict environment.
    -   **Limitations:** Does not distinguish between ongoing high-intensity wars and the specific shock event (new war/escalation) the question asks about.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*As of 2025-10-07, with a focus on the last 6 months.*
-   **2025-09-22** Sudan peace talks collapse — ↑ — Failure of Jeddah-led negotiations for a ceasefire in El Fasher increases the likelihood of a final, bloody assault on the city, a major escalation point.
-   **2025-09-15** Philippines invokes mutual defense treaty with US after naval clash — ↑ — A lethal encounter in the South China Sea escalates tensions with China, creating a pathway to a new, high-intensity conflict, though direct war remains unlikely.
-   **2025-08-30** Ukraine launches major drone swarm offensive on Russian logistics hubs — ↑ — Represents a tactical escalation, but death toll remains primarily military and diffuse. Increases risk of a disproportionate Russian response that could escalate the conflict.
-   **2025-07-18** Israel-Hezbollah cross-border fire intensifies significantly — ↑ — Tit-for-tat strikes move beyond established patterns, raising the risk of a full-scale war in Lebanon, which would rapidly cross the 5,000 death threshold.
-   **2025-06-10** Ethiopia and Eritrea sign border demilitarization pact — ↓ — Reduces a key flashpoint for a new interstate war in the Horn of Africa, allowing both states to focus on internal stability issues instead of external conflict.
-   **2025-05-20** UN reports famine conditions worsening in Yemen despite truce — ↔ — While a humanitarian disaster, the formal truce is largely holding, preventing a *new* escalation of combat-related deaths relevant to the question's criteria.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Great Power Intervention/Proxy Conflict (Large):** Direct or indirect involvement by the US, China, or Russia can dramatically escalate a regional conflict's lethality by providing advanced weaponry, intelligence, and logistical support (e.g., Ukraine, Syria).
-   **Proliferation of Cheap, Lethal Technology (Moderate):** The widespread availability of sophisticated drones, loitering munitions, and anti-tank guided missiles allows non-state actors and smaller armies to inflict casualties at a rate previously reserved for major powers, accelerating escalation.
-   **Collapse of a Major State/Ceasefire (Large):** The breakdown of a fragile state (e.g., Sudan) or the failure of a key ceasefire (e.g., Israel-Hezbollah) can unleash violence that rapidly surpasses the 5,000-death threshold.
-   **Domestic Political Instability (Moderate):** An embattled regime may initiate an external conflict to rally domestic support (a "diversionary war"), turning a political crisis into a lethal one.
-   **Successful International Mediation (Moderate):** Concerted diplomatic efforts, particularly when backed by major powers, can de-escalate crises or enforce ceasefires, preventing conflicts from reaching the threshold (e.g., past efforts in the Balkans).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Historically High Number of Active Conflicts:** UCDP data for 2023/2024 shows a post-1946 peak in the number of state-based conflicts. This creates more potential flashpoints for a "substantial escalation" than in a typical year from the 1990s or 2000s.
-   **Simultaneous Great Power Tensions:** Unlike most of the post-Cold War era, tensions are high concurrently in Europe (Russia/NATO), the Middle East (US/Iran), and East Asia (US/China). This raises the risk of a regional conflict escalating via great power entanglement.
-   **Weakened International Institutions:** The UN Security Council is frequently deadlocked, reducing its capacity for effective conflict mediation and de-escalation compared to previous decades.
-   **Normalization of High-Intensity Warfare:** The wars in Ukraine and Gaza have re-acclimated the international system to large-scale conventional warfare with high casualty counts, potentially lowering the threshold for other actors to resort to similar levels of violence.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with the base rate from Reference Class 1, suggesting a prior around **30%** (equivalent n ≈ 10-15 observations), reflecting the historical frequency of such events.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↑ (Large): The current geopolitical environment features a record number of conflicts and simultaneous great power rivalries, creating more potential escalation pathways than the historical average.
    -   ↑ (Moderate): The high-intensity conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza are ongoing, and a sudden escalation in either (e.g., new front, new belligerent) remains a constant, plausible threat.
    -   ↑ (Small): The collapse of recent peace talks in Sudan and rising Israel-Hezbollah tensions are active, near-term risks for escalation.
    -   ↓ (Small): We are in the final quarter of 2025. The window for a *new* war to start from scratch and reach 5,000 deaths is closing, shifting the focus more towards escalation of existing conflicts.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the current risk is higher than the historical average. The posterior should move **significantly upward** from the ~30% prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Formal declaration of mobilization by a major regional power (e.g., Iran, Turkey, a major European state).
    -   Sustained, large-scale (>72 hours) combat between Israel and Hezbollah beyond the border regions.
    -   A Chinese naval quarantine or "no-sail zone" declared around Taiwan.
    -   Collapse of the Sudanese Armed Forces or Rapid Support Forces command structure, leading to city-wide battles for control of Khartoum or Port Sudan.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   A durable, internationally monitored ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah.
    -   Successful UN or African Union intervention leading to a renewed, enforced ceasefire in Sudan.
    -   Significant de-escalatory talks and military-to-military communication between the US and China.
    -   The onset of harsh winter conditions in Ukraine significantly slowing offensive operations on both sides without a major strategic shift.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Data Lag & Opacity:** Casualty figures from active war zones are notoriously unreliable, often used for propaganda, and subject to significant retrospective revision. UCDP data for 2025 will not be finalized until well into 2026.
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** "Substantial escalation" is not a formally defined UCDP term. A resolution may depend on subjective interpretation by credible sources of whether a change in conflict intensity qualifies.
-   **Black Swan Events:** The analysis is based on known flashpoints. An unexpected coup, major terrorist attack (e.g., a 9/11-scale event), or environmental disaster could trigger a new conflict not currently on the radar.
-   **Distinguishing Battle Deaths:** The resolution specifies "deaths," which UCDP typically interprets as "battle-related deaths." Care must be taken to distinguish these from deaths due to conflict-related disease or famine, which may not count unless specified.

Final Research Summary: The historical base rate for a new or escalating war killing 5,000 people in a year is moderate (~30%). However, the current environment—characterized by a record number of ongoing conflicts, intense great power rivalry, and several active flashpoints—points to a substantially higher-than-average risk for the remainder of 2025.

To forecast the probability of a new war or a substantial escalation to a previous war killing at least 5,000 people in 2025, we will follow the outlined Bayesian reasoning steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate is from Reference Class 1, which considers years with new conflicts or substantial escalations resulting in over 5,000 deaths. This occurs in approximately 28-33% of years from 1989-2024. Therefore, the initial prior probability is around 30%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current geopolitical environment is characterized by a high number of active conflicts and great power tensions, similar to years with high conflict escalation.
   - Differences: The current year has a record number of conflicts and simultaneous great power tensions, which are higher than the historical average, suggesting a higher risk of escalation.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Sudan peace talks collapse and Israel-Hezbollah tensions increase the likelihood of escalation.
   - The Ukraine conflict and potential US-China tensions in the South China Sea also contribute to the risk.
   - The Ethiopia-Eritrea pact and the holding truce in Yemen slightly decrease the risk.
   - Overall, the evidence suggests a higher likelihood of escalation compared to the base rate.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 30%, the evidence of increased geopolitical tensions and active conflicts suggests a significant upward adjustment.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (qualitatively assessed as >1 due to increased tensions).
   - Posterior probability is adjusted upward from the prior, reflecting the increased risk.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: While the evidence suggests an increased risk, the exact probability is uncertain due to potential data inaccuracies and unforeseen events.
   - Alternative scenarios: A major diplomatic breakthrough or unexpected de-escalation could reduce the risk.
   - Adjustments: Given the uncertainties and potential for unexpected de-escalation, the probability should not be excessively high.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and uncertainties, the final forecast reflects a higher probability than the base rate but accounts for potential de-escalation scenarios.

Final: 45%

# Probability of a New War or Substantial Escalation Killing 5,000+ in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use Reference Class 1 from the research report: "New or Escalating Conflicts (UCDP, 1989-2024)" with a base rate of approximately 28-33% per year. This reference class directly matches our question, capturing both new wars and major escalations that cross the 5,000 death threshold.

I'll use 30% as my prior probability, which represents the historical frequency of such events over the past 36 years according to Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) data.

Prior probability: P(H) = 30%
Prior odds: 30:70 or 0.43:1

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The international system still operates under similar structural constraints (UN Security Council, international law framework)
- Great power competition remains a driver of proxy conflicts
- Regional powers continue to pursue their interests through military means when diplomacy fails

**Differences from base case:**
- We're already in October 2025, leaving only ~3 months for a new war to start and reach 5,000 deaths
- Current data shows a historically high number of active conflicts (more potential escalation points)
- Multiple simultaneous great power tensions (Russia/NATO, US/Iran, US/China)
- Weakened international institutions compared to much of the post-Cold War period
- Normalization of high-intensity warfare from Ukraine and Gaza conflicts
- Advanced weapons technology (drones, precision munitions) has proliferated, potentially increasing lethality

These differences suggest the risk is higher than the historical average, particularly for escalation of existing conflicts rather than entirely new wars given the limited time remaining in 2025.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Limited time remaining in 2025**
- P(E|H): Moderate. Even with only 3 months left, an escalation of an existing conflict could rapidly cross the 5,000 death threshold.
- P(E|~H): High. Less time means fewer opportunities for a new conflict to emerge and escalate.
- Likelihood ratio: < 1 (decreases probability)

**Evidence 2: Record number of active conflicts in 2023-2024**
- P(E|H): Very high. More active conflicts create more potential flashpoints for escalation.
- P(E|~H): Low. It would be unusual to have so many active conflicts without any crossing the escalation threshold.
- Likelihood ratio: > 1 (increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Recent collapse of Sudan peace talks**
- P(E|H): High. Failed peace talks often precede major escalations.
- P(E|~H): Moderate. Many peace talks fail without leading to immediate escalation.
- Likelihood ratio: > 1 (increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Intensifying Israel-Hezbollah cross-border fire**
- P(E|H): High. This is a classic pre-war escalation pattern.
- P(E|~H): Moderate. Such exchanges have occurred before without full-scale war.
- Likelihood ratio: > 1 (increases probability)

**Evidence 5: Philippines-China naval clash and US treaty invocation**
- P(E|H): Moderate. Creates pathway to conflict but with restraints.
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high. Great powers have strong incentives to avoid direct war.
- Likelihood ratio: ≈ 1 (neutral)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update based on the strongest evidence: the record number of active conflicts combined with intensifying flashpoints in Sudan and Israel-Hezbollah.

If we assign a likelihood ratio of approximately 1.5 (moderately strong evidence favoring escalation):

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
Posterior odds = 0.43 × 1.5 = 0.645

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability = 0.645 / (1 + 0.645) = 0.392 or about 39%

Now, let's adjust for the limited time remaining in 2025 (likelihood ratio of 0.9):

Updated posterior odds = 0.645 × 0.9 = 0.5805
Updated posterior probability = 0.5805 / (1 + 0.5805) = 0.367 or about 37%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent events (recency bias)
- The research report might overstate the historical frequency of 5,000+ death escalations
- I might be underestimating the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons and economic interdependence
- The definition of "substantial escalation" is subjective and may affect resolution

**Alternative forecast:**
A more pessimistic forecaster might argue for 50%+ probability, citing:
- The Israel-Hezbollah situation is uniquely volatile with Iran potentially becoming directly involved
- Sudan's conflict has all the ingredients for a massive escalation (failed state, competing factions, regional interests)
- Ukraine conflict could see a dramatic escalation if NATO becomes more directly involved

Rebuttal: While these scenarios are plausible, history shows that most conflicts remain contained below the 5,000 death threshold. Additionally, great powers have strong incentives to prevent escalation to full-scale war.

**Tail risks:**
- A major terrorist attack triggering large-scale military response
- Accidental escalation from misinterpreted military movements
- Collapse of a nuclear-armed state leading to civil war

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 40% to account for the multiple active flashpoints that could escalate rapidly.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 40%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "New or Escalating Conflicts (UCDP, 1989-2024)," which finds that a new war or a substantial escalation causing over 5,000 deaths occurs in about 10-12 of the 36 years. This yields a base rate of approximately **30%** for any given full year.

However, the forecast is being made on October 7, 2025. The event has not yet occurred in the first 280 days of the year. We must adjust the prior for the remaining 85 days. Assuming a uniform probability of the event occurring throughout the year, the conditional probability of it happening in the final 85 days, given it hasn't happened yet, can be calculated.

Let H be the event happening in 2025. P(H) = 0.30.
Let E be the evidence that it hasn't happened by Oct 7.
The probability of the event happening in the remainder of the year is P(H in last 85 days) = 0.30 * (85/365) ≈ 0.07.
The probability of the event not having happened by Oct 7 is P(E) = P(not H) + P(H in last 85 days) = 0.70 + 0.07 = 0.77.
The conditional probability P(H|E) = P(H and E) / P(E) = 0.07 / 0.77 ≈ 9.1%.

So, my initial time-adjusted prior is **9%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current geopolitical environment is significantly more volatile than the 1989-2024 average. The research report highlights several key differences:
*   **Historically high number of active conflicts:** This creates more potential candidates for escalation.
*   **Simultaneous great power tensions:** Unlike most of the post-Cold War era, tensions between the US, China, and Russia are high across multiple theaters.
*   **Weakened international institutions:** The UN's ability to mediate and de-escalate is diminished.

These factors suggest that the "true" probability for 2025 was likely higher than the 30% historical average. If we assume the true probability for 2025 was closer to 40%, the time-adjusted prior would be approximately 13.4%. I will therefore start my evidence-based update from a prior of **13%**. This corresponds to prior odds of 0.13 / (1 - 0.13) ≈ 0.15.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the research report for their impact on the probability of the event occurring in the final ~3 months of 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Sudan peace talks collapse (Sep 22).** This is a strong positive indicator (↑↑). The failure of negotiations directly increases the likelihood of a major, bloody assault on El Fasher, a scenario that could easily surpass 5,000 deaths in a short period. The likelihood of seeing this news is much higher if a major escalation is imminent (P(E|H) is high) than if the conflict continues its grinding status quo (P(E|~H) is moderate). **Likelihood Ratio > 2.**
*   **Evidence 2: Israel-Hezbollah cross-border fire intensifies (Jul 18).** This is also a strong positive indicator (↑↑). A full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah is a primary candidate for this event. The report notes that strikes are moving "beyond established patterns," which is a key sign that deterrent red lines are being tested or eroded. This evidence makes a future where the event happens look much more plausible. **Likelihood Ratio > 2.**
*   **Evidence 3: Ethiopia and Eritrea sign border demilitarization pact (Jun 10).** This is a significant negative indicator (↓↓). It effectively removes a major potential flashpoint for a new interstate war from the list of likely candidates for the remainder of 2025. This evidence makes the world where the event *doesn't* happen more likely. **Likelihood Ratio < 1.**
*   **Evidence 4: Philippines/SCS clash & Ukraine drone offensive.** These are weak positive indicators (↑). They contribute to global instability but are less likely to lead to a new conflict or escalation that kills 5,000 people *before December 31, 2025*. They slightly increase the probability. **Likelihood Ratio slightly > 1.**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will update my prior odds of 0.15 based on the net effect of the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 0.15
*   The two strongest pieces of positive evidence (Sudan, Israel/Hezbollah) point toward active, plausible scenarios. The negative evidence (Ethiopia/Eritrea) removes one potential scenario. The net effect is strongly positive. I will apply a combined likelihood ratio of approximately 2.5 to represent the fact that two of the most plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution are currently very active.
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
*   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.15 × 2.5 = 0.375
*   **Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)**
*   Posterior Probability ≈ 0.375 / 1.375 ≈ 27.3%

This update moves the probability from a prior of 13% to a posterior of around 27%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~27% is higher than the Manifold market's 22.7%. Could I be overreacting to the news?
*   **Argument for a lower forecast:** Brinkmanship is common. Both Israel and Hezbollah have powerful deterrents against a full-scale war. The conflict in Sudan could remain a brutal stalemate rather than escalating into a single, catastrophic battle for El Fasher. The time constraint of ~85 days is significant; with each passing week, the probability should decrease.
*   **Argument for my forecast:** The market may be under-weighting the severity of the specific indicators mentioned in the report (collapse of talks, strikes beyond normal patterns). These are not just background noise; they are concrete events on the causal path to escalation. My bottom-up analysis, where I estimated a ~10% chance from Sudan and a ~10% chance from Israel/Hezbollah, plus ~5% from other sources, also lands in the mid-20s, providing confidence in this range.
*   **Conclusion:** My analysis suggests the risk is substantial. The 27% figure reflects the presence of at least two highly plausible scenarios that could unfold before the year's end. I will adjust slightly downward to account for the strong pull of the status quo and the time constraint, but remain above the market.

### 6. Final Forecast
The time-adjusted base rate is low (~13%), but the current evidence, particularly from the active and deteriorating situations in Sudan and the Israel-Lebanon border, strongly suggests a higher-than-baseline risk for the remainder of 2025. These two flashpoints represent clear and plausible paths to an event that would meet the resolution criteria. While de-escalation is always possible, the current trajectory is negative. My final probability reflects a synthesis of the base rate and this strong, recent evidence.

Final: 26%
