### **Research Plan**

**1. Identify Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical precedent for a new presidential administration, particularly of an opposing party, reversing the Executive Orders (EOs) of its predecessor?** This will establish a base rate for regulatory survival.
*   **Q2: What is Donald Trump's and the modern Republican party's stated ideology and policy stance regarding technology regulation, specifically AI?** This involves analyzing campaign promises, party platforms, and the influence of conservative think tanks.
*   **Q3: What are the specific mechanisms of the Biden EO 14110 reporting requirements?** Understanding the target of potential repeal is crucial. What does Section 4.2 mandate, who enforces it (Secretary of Commerce), and what is its legal basis (Defense Production Act)?
*   **Q4: What are the countervailing pressures that might lead to the requirements being kept?** This includes national security concerns, potential industry preference for regulatory certainty, bipartisan legislative efforts, and public opinion.
*   **Q5: How do the provided (hypothetical, future-dated) sources describe the actions of a 2025 Trump administration?** This is the most direct evidence. I must synthesize what the "America's AI Action Plan" and associated EOs do, and critically, what they *don't* do, in relation to the Biden-era reporting rules.

**2. Propose Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1 (Precedent):**
    *   `"executive order" reversal rate presidential transition`
    *   `history of executive orders rescinded by new president`
    *   `"Congressional Review Act" use after party change`
*   **Q2 (Ideology/Stance):**
    *   `Donald Trump 2024 campaign AI policy`
    *   `Republican party platform 2024 artificial intelligence`
    *   `Heritage Foundation Project 2025 AI regulation`
    *   `Trump "cancel Biden executive order" AI`
*   **Q3 (EO Mechanics):**
    *   `Executive Order 14110 Section 4.2 analysis`
    *   `Defense Production Act authority for AI reporting`
    *   `Department of Commerce AI reporting requirements implementation`
*   **Q4 (Countervailing Pressures):**
    *   `national security establishment views on AI risk`
    *   `bipartisan AI legislation prospects`
    *   `tech industry lobbying AI regulation 2024`
    *   `public opinion polls AI safety regulation`
*   **Q5 (Source Synthesis):** This step does not require external search queries but a direct, careful analysis of the provided text snippets to extract key themes: deregulation, focus on competition, removal of specific concepts (DEI, misinformation), and the absence of any mention of retaining safety-focused reporting requirements.

**3. Synthesize Key Findings:**

*   **Historical Precedent:** Reversing a predecessor's major EOs is standard practice, especially after a partisan transition. The "Day One" repeal of controversial orders is a common political tool.
*   **Trump/GOP Stance:** The stance is explicitly and strongly deregulatory. The provided sources and background information show a consistent theme: Biden's EO is viewed as an impediment to innovation, a vehicle for "woke" ideology, and a drag on competition with China. The promise to cancel it is direct.
*   **EO Mechanics:** The requirements are implemented via an EO directing the Secretary of Commerce, using the Defense Production Act as justification. This makes them easy to reverse; a new EO can simply rescind the old one or direct the Secretary to cease enforcement and withdraw the rules. No congressional approval is needed.
*   **Countervailing Pressures:** The primary counter-pressure is the national security argument that tracking powerful models is essential to prevent catastrophic risks (e.g., CBRN, cyberattacks). However, the dominant Trump/GOP framing of national security is economic and military competition with China, which they argue is *hampered* by domestic regulation.
*   **Hypothetical 2025 Actions:** The provided sources paint a clear picture. A hypothetical Trump administration in July 2025 releases a comprehensive "AI Action Plan." Its pillars are deregulation, accelerating infrastructure, and removing perceived ideological bias from AI frameworks (like the NIST RMF). The plan is described as a "follow-up to an earlier executive order that removed some of the Biden administration's AI regulations." The new policies are fundamentally incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Biden-era reporting requirements.

**4. Draft the Comprehensive Answer:**

I will now structure these synthesized findings into the required format for the research brief.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasting Panel**

**To:** Bayesian Forecasting Panel Statistician
**From:** Lead Researcher
**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Subject:** Forecast Update: Survival of AI Foundation Model Reporting Requirements under a Trump Presidency

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Major Executive Order (EO) Reversal:** When the White House changes party, major, ideologically-driven EOs from the previous administration are frequently reversed or substantially altered. The reversal rate within the first year for such EOs is high. **Base Rate: 65-80% probability of reversal/removal.** This is derived from historical patterns of new administrations using EOs to quickly undo the policies of their predecessors (e.g., Trump reversing Obama's policies, Biden reversing Trump's).
*   **Survival of Non-Entrenched Tech Regulations:** New technology regulations that are implemented via executive action and have not yet become deeply embedded in agency practice or created strong industry reliance are highly vulnerable to change. The Biden AI EO rules are new and not yet entrenched. **Base Rate: 70-85% probability of reversal/removal.**
*   **Limitations:** AI is a novel policy area with unique national security implications that may not fit neatly into historical analogues like environmental or immigration EOs. The speed of AI development could create a crisis that scrambles typical political alignments.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-07-25] Trump admin releases "America's AI Action Plan" — ↓ — The plan's pillars are deregulation and accelerating innovation, directly opposing the philosophy of mandatory safety reporting and creating a clear policy alternative.
*   [2025-07-23] Trump signs EOs to accelerate data centers and remove "woke" AI bias — ↓ — These actions confirm the administration's priorities are speed and ideological alignment, not the precautionary safety measures embodied in the reporting requirements.
*   [2025-07-23] CBS News reports the new plan is a "follow-up to an earlier executive order that removed some of the Biden administration's AI regulations" — ↓ — This is direct evidence that a repeal of Biden-era rules has already occurred by mid-2025, making it highly unlikely the specific reporting rules would survive.
*   [2024-11-14] Brookings analysis predicts a Trump admin will likely repeal Biden's AI EO — ↓ — Early, expert analysis correctly anticipated the deregulatory direction, reinforcing the high probability of this outcome.
*   [2024-07-09] GOP Platform pledges to overturn Biden's AI EO — ↓ — The intent to remove these requirements was a stated party goal well before the election, indicating strong political motivation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Presidential Executive Authority (Large ↓):** The reporting requirements were established by an EO. They can be undone just as easily by a new EO, requiring no congressional action. This is the most direct and powerful mechanism.
*   **Deregulatory Ideology (Large ↓):** The core philosophy of the Trump administration and the modern GOP is that regulation stifles innovation and economic growth. The Biden EO is seen as a prime example of burdensome government overreach.
*   **"Winning the Race" vs. "Precautionary Principle" Framing (Large ↓):** The Trump administration's approach frames AI policy as a geopolitical race against China. In this view, safety-oriented reporting requirements are a self-imposed handicap. This contrasts with the Biden EO's framing around mitigating potential harms.
*   **Anti-"Woke" / Free Speech Agenda (Moderate ↓):** The Biden EO and associated frameworks (like the NIST AI RMF) are perceived by conservatives as vehicles for "radical left-wing ideas" (e.g., on bias, misinformation, DEI). This makes the EO a symbolic ideological target for removal, beyond its practical effects.
*   **National Security Catastrophic Risk Concerns (Moderate ↑):** The primary driver for keeping the rules. Elements within the defense and intelligence communities may argue that tracking the development of powerful, potentially dual-use models is a critical national security imperative, regardless of the party in power. This is the strongest, albeit likely insufficient, counter-force.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Pre-Stated Intent:** Unlike many EO reversals that are planned behind the scenes, Trump and the GOP platform explicitly and publicly targeted this specific AI EO for cancellation long before taking office.
*   **Availability of a Detailed Alternative Plan:** The provided sources show the administration didn't just repeal the old rules but quickly implemented a comprehensive, 90+ point alternative ("America's AI Action Plan"), leaving no policy vacuum where the old rules might persist.
*   **Novelty and High Stakes of AI:** The subject matter (transformative AI) is unlike typical regulatory targets. The potential for both massive economic upside and catastrophic downside (e.g., bio-weapons, cyberattacks) creates extreme political pressures, potentially overriding standard deregulatory logic, though current evidence suggests it has not.
*   **Legal Justification (DPA):** The use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) for the Biden EO was novel. A new administration could easily challenge this legal basis, arguing the DPA is being misapplied, providing further justification for repeal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior based on the reference class of major EO reversals, suggesting a low probability of survival. A prior of **2

To forecast whether AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place in the US at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for EO Reversal:** Historically, new administrations, especially those from an opposing party, frequently reverse major executive orders from their predecessors. The base rate for such reversals is approximately 65-80%.
- **Base Rate for Tech Regulation Reversal:** New technology regulations, especially those not deeply entrenched, are vulnerable to reversal. The base rate for reversal of such regulations is 70-85%.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prior probability that the reporting requirements will not remain in place is around 75%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The situation aligns with the historical pattern of new administrations reversing previous executive orders, particularly when there is a change in party control.
- **Difference:** The unique aspect here is the national security implications of AI, which could potentially influence the decision to retain some form of regulation.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Trump's Campaign Promise:** Trump explicitly stated his intention to cancel Biden's AI executive order, which strongly suggests a high likelihood of reversal if he is elected.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High likelihood of reversal given Trump's statement compared to a low likelihood if he did not intend to reverse it.
- **Republican Stance on Deregulation:** The GOP platform emphasizes deregulation, aligning with the likelihood of reversing the reporting requirements.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** High likelihood of reversal given the GOP's deregulatory stance.
- **National Security Concerns:** There is a moderate counter-pressure to retain some form of regulation due to national security concerns.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Moderate likelihood of retention due to security concerns, but likely insufficient to outweigh the deregulatory push.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 3:1 in favor of reversal (75% probability of reversal).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong deregulatory intent and explicit statements, the likelihood ratio heavily favors reversal.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:** 
  - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
  - Assuming a likelihood ratio of 4:1 for reversal, the posterior odds become 12:1.
  - Posterior probability = 12 / (12 + 1) = 92.3%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unforeseen national security developments that could necessitate retaining some form of regulation.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A significant AI-related incident could shift public and political opinion towards maintaining stricter oversight.
- **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, slightly adjust the probability to account for potential tail risks.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential counterarguments, the final forecast is that there is an 88% probability that the AI foundation model reporting requirements will not remain in place at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024.

Final: 88%

# Forecasting the Survival of AI Foundation Model Reporting Requirements Under a Trump Presidency

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for whether AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024.

The most appropriate reference class is: **Executive orders from a previous administration that are explicitly targeted for reversal by an incoming president of the opposing party.**

Historical data suggests that when a new president explicitly promises to cancel a specific executive order from their predecessor, they typically follow through, especially when:
- The order is recent and not deeply institutionalized
- The order aligns with partisan ideological differences
- The incoming president has specifically named the order for cancellation

Based on this reference class, I'll set a prior probability of **20%** that the AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place (80% that they will be removed).

This prior is justified because:
1. Trump has explicitly stated he will "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order" on day one
2. The order is recent (October 2023) and not yet deeply embedded in regulatory structures
3. The order represents a regulatory approach that conflicts with Trump's deregulatory stance

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- This is a clear partisan transition case (Democrat to Republican)
- The incoming president has explicitly promised to cancel the specific executive order
- The order is recent and represents a significant regulatory framework
- The order touches on areas (regulation of business) where partisan differences are stark

**Differences from base case:**
- AI regulation has potential national security implications that might transcend partisan politics
- The reporting requirements specifically target dual-use foundation models with potential weapons applications
- The order uses the Defense Production Act as its legal basis, connecting it to national security
- The tech industry might have adapted to these requirements, creating some institutional inertia

These differences suggest some potential for the requirements to survive, but they don't fundamentally change the high likelihood of reversal based on Trump's explicit promise.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit statement about canceling the EO**
- P(E|H) = 0.2 (If the requirements remain, it's unlikely Trump would have made such a specific promise)
- P(E|~H) = 0.9 (If the requirements are removed, this statement is exactly what we'd expect)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability of the requirements remaining

**Evidence 2: The requirements are framed as national security measures**
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (If the requirements remain, it's likely because of their national security framing)
- P(E|~H) = 0.4 (If the requirements are removed, the national security framing wasn't persuasive)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.8/0.4 = 2.0
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of the requirements remaining

**Evidence 3: The research brief indicates Trump administration released an "AI Action Plan" that removed Biden-era AI regulations**
- P(E|H) = 0.1 (If the requirements remain, it's unlikely we'd see evidence of removal)
- P(E|~H) = 0.9 (If the requirements are removed, this is exactly the evidence we'd expect)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability of the requirements remaining

**Evidence 4: The Trump administration's focus on "deregulation" and "accelerating innovation"**
- P(E|H) = 0.3 (If the requirements remain, this focus would likely be less pronounced)
- P(E|~H) = 0.9 (If the requirements are removed, this focus aligns perfectly)
- Likelihood ratio = 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of the requirements remaining

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 20% probability that the requirements remain in place:

Prior odds = 0.2/0.8 = 0.25

Updating on Evidence 1 (Trump's explicit statement):
Posterior odds = 0.25 × 0.22 = 0.055
Posterior probability = 0.055/(1 + 0.055) ≈ 5.2%

Updating on Evidence 2 (national security framing):
Posterior odds = 0.055 × 2.0 = 0.11
Posterior probability = 0.11/(1 + 0.11) ≈ 9.9%

Updating on Evidence 3 (AI Action Plan removing regulations):
Posterior odds = 0.11 × 0.11 = 0.0121
Posterior probability = 0.0121/(1 + 0.0121) ≈ 1.2%

Updating on Evidence 4 (deregulation focus):
Posterior odds = 0.0121 × 0.33 = 0.00399
Posterior probability = 0.00399/(1 + 0.00399) ≈ 0.4%

This extremely low probability (0.4%) suggests I may have overweighted some evidence. Let me reconsider more holistically.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis may have several weaknesses:

1. **Overconfidence in explicit statements**: Campaign promises aren't always fulfilled. Trump might decide these particular requirements are useful for national security.

2. **Underestimating bureaucratic inertia**: Even with an executive order to cancel, some requirements might persist through agency implementation.

3. **Overlooking partial retention**: Trump might modify rather than completely eliminate the requirements, keeping some reporting for the most powerful models.

4. **Neglecting external events**: A major AI safety incident before 2025 could dramatically change the political calculus.

5. **Potential for legislative action**: Congress might codify some reporting requirements into law, making them harder to eliminate.

The best alternative forecast would be around 15-20%, arguing that national security concerns and bureaucratic inertia will preserve at least the core reporting requirements. However, this seems unlikely given:

1. The explicit targeting of this EO for cancellation
2. The research brief's evidence that the Trump administration has already removed Biden-era AI regulations
3. The ideological opposition to regulatory requirements in the Trump administration

After this red-teaming, I'll adjust my estimate upward slightly to account for these considerations.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the evidence that:
- Trump explicitly promised to cancel the Biden AI executive order
- The research brief indicates the Trump administration has already removed Biden-era AI regulations
- The Trump administration's focus is on deregulation and accelerating innovation
- The requirements are implemented via executive order and can be easily reversed

But considering:
- The national security implications might give some pause
- Bureaucratic inertia might preserve some elements
- External events could change the political calculus

I assess there is a 5% probability that AI foundation model reporting requirements will remain in place in the US at the end of 2025 if Trump is elected president in 2024.

Final: 5%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Event (H):** The specific AI foundation model reporting requirements from Biden's Executive Order (EO) 14110 remain in place at the end of 2025, assuming a Trump presidency.
*   **Reference Class:** The survival rate of major, ideologically-driven Executive Orders following a presidential transition to the opposing party.
*   **Reasoning:** Historically, new presidents make it a priority to reverse the signature EOs of their predecessors. President Trump reversed many of President Obama's policies, and President Biden reversed many of President Trump's. This is a standard and expected part of a power transition in a polarized environment. The research report suggests a 65-80% probability of reversal for such EOs. This implies a survival probability of 20-35%.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will select a prior probability of **25%** for the requirements surviving. This translates to prior odds of 1:3 in favor of the requirements being removed.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation is a classic example from the reference class. The Biden AI EO is a significant regulatory action by a Democratic president. A hypothetical incoming Trump administration represents the opposing party with a strong, stated deregulatory ideology. The mechanism for change—a new EO rescinding an old one—is simple and requires no congressional approval.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Explicit Intent:** Unlike a general desire to deregulate, Donald Trump made a specific, public promise to "cancel Biden's artificial intelligence executive order... on day one." This makes repeal more likely than in the average case.
    *   **Novelty of AI:** AI is a new policy domain with unique and potentially catastrophic national security risks (e.g., CBRN weapons design, cyberattacks). This could create pressure from the defense and intelligence communities to maintain the reporting requirements, even under a deregulatory administration. This factor makes survival slightly more likely than the base case.
    *   **Conclusion:** The explicit promise of repeal is a much stronger signal than the general novelty of the policy area. The situation is even more skewed towards repeal than the base rate suggests.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence, treating the information in the research report as factual for this forecast.

*   **Evidence 1: Trump's Campaign Promise (Dec 2023) & GOP Platform (July 2024):** Trump and the GOP explicitly pledged to cancel the EO.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of making such a specific promise if the plan was to keep the requirements is very low.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of making this promise if the plan was to repeal the requirements is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Much less than 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability of survival.

*   **Evidence 2: Hypothetical CBS News Report (July 2025):** The report states that the Trump administration's new AI plan is a "follow-up to an earlier executive order that removed some of the Biden administration's AI regulations."
    *   P(E | H): The probability of this report being accurate while the specific, core reporting requirements remain in place is extremely low. While "some" regulations could be removed while others stay, the reporting requirements are the most significant and ideologically-opposed part of the Biden EO. It is highly improbable they would be the ones to survive a targeted repeal.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of this report if the requirements were repealed is extremely high. This is a direct description of the event (~H) having occurred.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very close to 0. This is overwhelmingly strong evidence against survival.

*   **Evidence 3: Hypothetical "America's AI Action Plan" (July 2025):** The replacement policy is described as being focused on deregulation, accelerating innovation, and removing perceived ideological bias.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of implementing a policy with this philosophy while simultaneously keeping the contradictory, burdensome reporting requirements from the prior administration is nearly zero.
    *   P(E | ~H): The probability of this being the replacement policy after the old requirements were removed is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very close to 0. This evidence is nearly conclusive.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

*   **Initial State:** Prior odds are 1:3 (25% probability).
*   **Update Step:** The evidence, particularly the hypothetical news report from July 2025 stating that a repeal has *already occurred*, is decisive.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × (Combined Likelihood Ratio)
    *   The combined likelihood ratio from the evidence is extremely small. For instance, using the likelihood ratio from the CBS report alone (estimated around 0.02):
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:3) × 0.02 = 0.02 : 3 ≈ 1 : 150.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 150) ≈ 0.7%.
*   **Resulting Posterior:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability to a very low single-digit number, likely below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Weakness:** My forecast relies heavily on the provided research report, which contains hypothetical future events. However, the instructions require me to use this report. Given that, my reasoning seems sound.
*   **Plausible Path to a "Yes" Resolution:**
    1.  **Catastrophic AI Event:** A major AI-related disaster in early 2025 (e.g., a large-scale cyberattack, a bioterror event) could force a complete political reversal. An administration that just repealed safety regulations would be under immense pressure to reinstate them or something even stronger.
    2.  **"Repeal and Replace" with an Identical Rule:** The resolution criteria are functional; they don't require the specific text of EO 14110 to survive, only that a regulation with the same effects is in place. Could the Trump administration repeal the Biden EO for political reasons but, under pressure from the national security establishment, quietly implement a new rule that is functionally identical? This is possible but unlikely, as it would contradict their stated deregulatory goals and the philosophy of their "America's AI Action Plan."
*   **Adjustment:** The initial update pushed the probability below 1%. The "black swan" catastrophe scenario is the most compelling reason for the requirements to remain. While this is a low-probability event, it is not impossible. I will adjust my final forecast upward to account for this tail risk. A probability of 3% seems appropriate to capture this unlikely but plausible scenario.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate suggests that these requirements are unlikely to survive a change in administration. The specific evidence, including a direct campaign promise to "cancel" the EO and hypothetical news reports confirming its repeal by mid-2025, is overwhelming. The philosophy of the described replacement plan is fundamentally incompatible with the Biden-era reporting rules. The only plausible path to the requirements remaining in place is a major, paradigm-shifting AI catastrophe early in the new administration that forces a complete policy reversal. I assign a small but non-zero probability to this tail risk.

Final: 3%
