### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Annual US Poultry Depopulations during the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b Epizootic (2022-2024):** This is the most relevant reference class as it covers the period of the current, ongoing outbreak of the specific viral clade.
    *   **2022:** ~58.8 million birds affected. This was the initial, explosive wave of the outbreak.
    *   **2023:** ~30.0 million birds affected (calculated from CDC/USDA data). This represented a significant decrease, suggesting potential adaptation or a lull in viral pressure.
    *   **2024:** >50 million birds affected (per WATT AgNet source for the full year). This indicates a major resurgence, particularly in the latter half of the year.
    *   **Base Rate Range:** This class suggests an annual total between **30 million and 60 million birds**. The mean is approximately 46 million, but the high variance indicates significant year-to-year fluctuation.
    *   **Limitations:** With only three data points, this reference class is small and volatile. It may not fully capture long-term dynamics like viral evolution or industry adaptation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-03-05** ↑ In the first two months of 2025, over 750,000 birds were culled in California's San Joaquin Valley alone, confirming continued high activity in a key poultry region.
*   **2025-02-25** ↑ A surge in cases that began in late 2024 continued into early 2025, with 134 new flock detections reported in the 30 days prior, indicating widespread and accelerating transmission.
*   **2025-01-09** ↑ Reporting confirmed that 2024 losses exceeded 50 million birds, with California being the hardest-hit state, establishing a high-momentum entry into 2025.
*   **2024-11-20** ↑ Major outbreaks were confirmed on commercial farms in California (Fresno, Merced, Stanislaus counties), including one flock of 2.1 million birds, demonstrating the virus's ability to breach large-scale biosecurity.
*   **2024-11-08** ↑ The cumulative total for the outbreak since 2022 surpassed 105 million birds across 48 states, highlighting the virus's now-endemic nature and broad geographic reservoir in North America.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Wild Bird Migration (Large):** The primary vector for introducing the virus into new regions. The spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) migrations are peak risk periods for poultry facilities along migratory flyways.
2.  **Biosecurity Breaches (Large):** The effectiveness of on-farm measures to prevent contamination from wild birds or other farms is the main line of defense. Failures, even minor ones, can lead to catastrophic flock infections.
3.  **Poultry Farm Density (Moderate-Large):** High concentrations of farms in states like Iowa, California, and Minnesota facilitate rapid farm-to-farm spread once the virus is introduced into a region, amplifying the total impact.
4.  **Virus Evolution (Large, High Uncertainty):** The H5N1 virus can mutate, potentially altering its transmissibility, pathogenicity, or ability to persist in the environment. The current clade (2.3.4.4b) has proven highly successful and persistent.
5.  **Surveillance and Culling Policy (Large, but Stable):** The USDA's standing policy to depopulate all affected and exposed birds is the direct mechanism translating infection into the resolved number. A change in this policy (e.g., to vaccination) is unlikely in 2025 but would be a paradigm shift.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Endemic Viral Reservoir:** Unlike previous HPAI outbreaks that were eventually stamped out, the 2.3.4.4b clade is now considered endemic in North American wild bird populations. This creates a constant, year-round source of viral pressure, reducing the likelihood of a return to pre-2022 "zero" years.
*   **Unprecedented Mammalian Spillover:** The widespread detection of H5N1 in dairy cattle and other mammals since 2024 is a novel feature of this outbreak. While the direct impact on birds is unclear, it complicates the epidemiological landscape, increases environmental viral load, and may create new, unmonitored transmission pathways.
*   **Accumulated Industry Experience:** The US poultry industry has now been managing this specific threat for over three years. Biosecurity protocols have been heightened, and there is greater awareness. However, the 2024 resurgence shows this adaptation is not foolproof against high viral pressure.
*   **Geographic Saturation:** By the start of 2025, the virus had been detected in commercial or backyard flocks in nearly all 50 states. This broad geographic footprint means few regions are "naive" and outbreaks can emerge almost anywhere.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior distribution centered on the 2022-2024 mean of ~46 million birds, with significant variance reflecting the observed range of 30M to 60M (equivalent n≈3).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The intense surge in cases during late 2024 and early 2025 provides strong, recency-weighted evidence that viral activity and pressure are currently at or above the peak levels seen in 2022.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** The virus is now endemic in wild birds, making the lower-bound outcome of 2023 (~30M) less likely than a repeat of the higher-impact years (2022, 2024).
    *   **↑ Small:** The novel spread in mammals adds a layer of complexity and potential for sustained environmental contamination, arguing against a rapid return to a low-outbreak state.
    *   **↓ Small:** Enhanced industry biosecurity and experience may prevent the absolute worst-case scenarios, but this effect appears to be overwhelmed by the current viral pressure.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the posterior should shift significantly upward from the prior mean. The high momentum entering 2025 makes a total in the upper end of, or potentially exceeding, the 30M-60M reference class range more probable than a total in the lower end.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Multiple large (>1 million birds) commercial flock detections in March-May during the spring migration.
    *   High prevalence rates (>5%) of HPAI detected in wild bird surveillance programs (e.g., USDA, USGS).
    *   Confirmed outbreaks in Iowa or Ohio, the top two egg-producing states, which have massive, dense flocks.
    *   Reports of lateral, farm-to-farm spread within a county or region.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A quiet spring 2025 migration season with significantly fewer detections than in 2023 or 2024.
    *   USDA APHIS reports showing a sustained multi-week decline in new flock detections.
    *   Any announcement of a federal or state-level pilot program for poultry vaccination.
    *   Evidence from genetic sequencing that the dominant circulating strain is becoming less pathogenic in poultry.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Extreme Skewness (Lumpiness):** The annual total is highly sensitive to single outbreak events. One infection in a 5-million-bird egg-laying complex can equal hundreds of smaller farm outbreaks. The final number will be driven by a few key events.
*   **Resolution Data Lag:** The resolution is based on the "Confirmation Date" in the USDA table. This date can lag the actual culling by days or weeks, potentially shifting birds culled in late December 2025 into the 2026 data, or vice-versa.
*   **Policy Stability Assumption:** This forecast assumes the "depopulate all affected and exposed" policy remains unchanged. Any shift towards a "vaccinate-to-live" strategy would fundamentally alter the outcome, though this is highly unlikely for 2025.

To forecast the number of farmed birds that will be killed in the United States due to bird flu in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the annual US poultry depopulations during the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b epizootic from 2022 to 2024. The data shows:
- 2022: ~58.8 million birds
- 2023: ~30.0 million birds
- 2024: >50 million birds

The mean of these years is approximately 46 million birds, with a range of 30 to 60 million birds. This reflects significant year-to-year fluctuation, indicating high variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b remains active and is now considered endemic in North America. However, the situation differs due to the virus's endemic nature, the recent resurgence in late 2024, and the novel mammalian spillover, which complicates the epidemiological landscape.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **↑ Large:** The surge in cases in late 2024 and early 2025 suggests high viral activity, increasing the likelihood of higher outcomes.
- **↑ Moderate:** The endemic status of the virus in wild birds makes lower outcomes less likely.
- **↑ Small:** The spread in mammals adds complexity, suggesting sustained environmental contamination.
- **↓ Small:** Improved biosecurity might reduce the worst-case scenarios but is likely overwhelmed by current viral pressures.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Given the prior centered around 46 million birds and the evidence suggesting increased viral activity, the posterior distribution should shift upward. The high momentum entering 2025 makes outcomes in the upper range of the reference class more probable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Consideration of tail risks and alternative scenarios:
- **Tail Risk:** A major outbreak in a densely populated poultry region could push numbers significantly higher.
- **Alternative Scenario:** A quiet spring migration could reduce numbers, but this seems less likely given current trends.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the number of birds killed in 2025 are:

P10: 35 million  
P20: 40 million  
P40: 50 million  
P60: 55 million  
P80: 60 million  
P90: 65 million

# Forecasting the Number of Farmed Birds Killed Due to Bird Flu in the US in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the annual US poultry depopulations during the current H5N1 outbreak (2022-2024) as my primary reference class:
- 2022: ~58.8 million birds
- 2023: ~30.0 million birds
- 2024: >50 million birds (reported as exceeding 50 million)

This gives a mean of approximately 46 million birds with a range of 30-60 million birds. This reference class is most appropriate because:
- It represents the same viral strain (H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b)
- It covers the current epizootic period
- It reflects the consistent US policy of depopulating affected flocks

The distribution appears right-skewed with a median likely around 50 million birds.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The same viral strain (H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b) continues to circulate
- The USDA's depopulation policy remains unchanged
- The US poultry industry structure is consistent
- Wild bird reservoirs continue to serve as the primary introduction vector

**Key differences:**
- The virus is now firmly endemic in North American wild birds, unlike the early phase of the outbreak
- There's unprecedented mammalian spillover (dairy cattle, other mammals) creating new transmission pathways
- The industry has accumulated 3+ years of experience with this specific threat
- The virus has already been detected in nearly all 50 states, creating a broad geographic footprint
- 2025 is starting with high momentum, with significant outbreaks in late 2024 continuing into early 2025

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher numbers:**
- Strong upward momentum: The surge in cases during late 2024 and early 2025 (134 new flock detections in 30 days prior to Feb 25, 2025) suggests 2025 is starting with high viral pressure (likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring above-median outcomes)
- Endemic status: The virus being established in wild bird populations means constant pressure, making the lower-bound outcome of 2023 (~30M) less likely (likelihood ratio ~2:1 against the lower end)
- Mammalian spillover: Novel spread in mammals adds complexity and potential for sustained environmental contamination (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring above-median outcomes)
- Early 2025 data: Over 750,000 birds culled in California's San Joaquin Valley alone in just the first two months confirms continued high activity (likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring above-median outcomes)

**Evidence for lower numbers:**
- Enhanced biosecurity: The industry has improved protocols after three years of experience (likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 favoring below-median outcomes)
- Potential adaptation: Some farms may have implemented more effective prevention measures (likelihood ratio ~1.1:1 favoring below-median outcomes)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 46 million birds with significant variance (30-60 million range):

First update - High momentum entering 2025:
- Prior: Mean = 46 million, with significant probability mass in 30-60 million range
- Likelihood: The evidence of high activity in late 2024/early 2025 strongly favors the upper half of the distribution
- Posterior: Shifts upward to approximately 52-53 million, with more probability mass in the 45-65 million range

Second update - Endemic status and mammalian spillover:
- Prior: Mean = 52-53 million
- Likelihood: These factors make sustained viral pressure more likely throughout 2025
- Posterior: Further shifts upward to approximately 55 million, with increased probability in the 50-70 million range

Third update - Industry adaptation:
- Prior: Mean = 55 million
- Likelihood: Improved biosecurity provides a small moderating effect
- Posterior: Slight downward adjustment to 53-54 million, but still with significant right skew

The final posterior distribution has a mean around 54 million birds, with more probability mass in the upper half of the historical range and extending beyond it.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent evidence (recency bias) from late 2024/early 2025
- The small sample size (only 3 years) in the reference class creates high uncertainty
- I haven't fully accounted for the "lumpiness" of outbreaks - a few large farm infections can dramatically change the total
- Potential policy changes (e.g., vaccination) could significantly alter outcomes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Lower scenario (~30-35 million)**: If spring migration brings fewer infections than expected and industry adaptations prove more effective, we could see a year similar to 2023.
- **Higher scenario (~80-100 million)**: If the virus affects multiple large egg-laying operations (5+ million birds each) or shows increased transmissibility, we could see unprecedented totals.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: Novel mutations increasing transmissibility or the virus affecting several mega-farms could push totals to 100+ million
- Lower tail: A sudden decline in viral fitness or unexpected policy shift could reduce totals below 25 million

After considering these factors, I should widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the upper tail.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 32,000,000
P20: 40,000,000
P40: 50,000,000
P60: 58,000,000
P80: 70,000,000
P90: 85,000,000

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the annual number of birds culled in the United States during the ongoing HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b epizootic, which began in 2022. This provides a narrow but highly specific set of data points for the current viral landscape.

*   **2022:** ~58.8 million birds
*   **2023:** ~30.0 million birds
*   **2024:** >50 million birds (estimated ~55 million for modeling)

This reference class gives a mean of approximately 48 million and a median of 55 million. However, with only three data points, the variance is extremely high, and the distribution is volatile. My prior distribution is therefore centered around this 48-55 million range but is very wide to reflect the high year-to-year uncertainty.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in 2025 has several key differences from the 2022-2024 baseline period, which justify a significant update to the prior.

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental drivers remain the same: the virus is primarily spread by migratory wild birds, biosecurity at poultry facilities is the main defense, and the USDA's policy is to cull all affected and exposed flocks.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Endemic Viral Reservoir:** Unlike previous outbreaks, this H5N1 clade is now considered endemic in North American wild birds. This creates a constant, year-round source of viral pressure, making a return to very low numbers (<20 million) highly unlikely. This raises the floor of the forecast distribution.
    *   **High Momentum:** The research report indicates that the surge in cases from late 2024 continued with high intensity into early 2025. This provides strong evidence that 2025 is starting under high viral pressure, making a repeat of the lower-impact 2023 scenario less probable.
    *   **Mammalian Spillover:** The novel and widespread detection of H5N1 in dairy cattle since 2024 indicates a higher environmental viral load and potentially new, unmonitored transmission pathways. This adds a significant wildcard and increases the probability of extreme, high-impact scenarios (i.e., it fattens the right tail of the distribution).

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of new information relative to the base rate.

*   **Evidence:** Intense surge in cases in late 2024 and early 2025 (e.g., "134 new flock detections reported in the 30 days prior" to Feb 25, 2025).
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment:** This evidence makes higher outcomes much more likely. A year with a total above the previous record of ~59M is now significantly more probable than a year with a total below the average of ~48M. This evidence provides a strong upward push on the entire distribution.
*   **Evidence:** Endemic status of the virus in wild birds.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment:** This makes very low outcomes (<30 million) much less likely. It suggests that 2023's total of 30 million should be viewed as a low-end possibility (a "good" year) rather than a central tendency. This truncates the left tail of the distribution.
*   **Evidence:** Industry adaptation and improved biosecurity.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment:** This provides a slight downward pressure, primarily by potentially capping the most extreme outcomes. However, the major outbreaks in late 2024 demonstrate that these measures can be overwhelmed by high viral pressure, so the effect is considered small.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A wide distribution centered around 48-55 million.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence, particularly the high momentum entering 2025, strongly favors a higher total for the year.
*   **Posterior:** The prior distribution is updated by shifting it significantly to the right.
    *   The **median** of the posterior distribution moves upward from the ~55 million of the base rate to a value exceeding the previous record of ~59 million.
    *   The **left tail** is trimmed, as a low-impact year like 2023 is now less plausible.
    *   The **right tail** becomes fatter and extends further, reflecting the increased uncertainty and potential for catastrophic outcomes due to the endemic virus and mammalian spillover. The distribution becomes more right-skewed.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is heavily influenced by the reported surge in early 2025. A key risk is that this surge could have been the tail end of the winter season, and the virus activity might have dropped off sharply afterward. If the spring migration was unexpectedly mild and biosecurity measures proved more effective than in 2024, the final number could be closer to 40-50 million.

Conversely, I might be underestimating the upside risk. The total number is dominated by a few large outbreaks. A single biosecurity failure at a massive egg-laying complex in a dense state like Iowa could add 5-10 million birds to the total in one event. A cascade of such events could lead to a year that dwarfs all previous records, potentially exceeding 150 million. My distribution's right tail must be wide enough to account for this "lumpy" and high-impact risk. My final percentiles reflect this by placing the P90 at a value more than double the 2023 total.

P10: 35000000
P20: 42000000
P40: 58000000
P60: 75000000
P80: 100000000
P90: 130000000
