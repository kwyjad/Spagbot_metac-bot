### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Routine Judicial Resignations in Pakistan:** In a normal year, politically motivated resignations from Pakistan's superior courts are extremely rare, approaching a base rate of **0-1 per year**. Judges typically serve until the mandatory retirement age (65 for the Supreme Court, 62 for High Courts). Resignations that do occur are usually for personal or health reasons, not as a form of protest. The total number of superior court judges is approximately 215-220 (17 in the Supreme Court, ~200 across the five High Courts), making any resignation a statistically rare event.
2.  **Judicial Resistance during Constitutional Crises (2007 PCO):** The most relevant, albeit extreme, reference class is the 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) under General Pervez Musharraf. When Musharraf suspended the constitution and demanded judges take a new oath, a significant number refused. Approximately **60 judges of the superior courts** were removed from office for their refusal. While technically a removal/refusal to take an oath rather than a voluntary resignation, it serves as a historical precedent for a mass exodus of judges on a point of principle. This suggests a plausible, high-end ceiling for judicial departures during a systemic crisis.
3.  **Individual Protest Resignations (Historical):** There are isolated instances of individual senior judges resigning over disagreements with the executive or military establishment. These are rare but not unprecedented. This reference class suggests a low number of resignations, perhaps **1-3 judges**, typically those with a strong reputation for independence or who are being directly targeted. The current situation has already met this threshold.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-10-21] Parliament passes the 26th Amendment, capping the Chief Justice's tenure. — ↑ — Precedent for major judicial "reforms" by the current government, setting the stage for more drastic action and heightening tensions with the judiciary.
*   [2025-03-14] Imran Khan challenges High Court judge transfers in the Supreme Court. — ↑ — Highlights that the transfer of judges was a contentious issue even before the 27th Amendment gave the government more explicit power to do so.
*   [2025-11-13] The 27th Amendment is passed, overhauling the judiciary and military command. — ↑ (large) — The primary trigger event, representing a fundamental assault on judicial independence and the direct cause of the crisis.
*   [2025-11-13] Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resign in protest. — ↑ (large) — The resignation of two highly respected senior judges establishes a credible and principled opposition, potentially encouraging others to follow.
*   [2025-11-14] Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns. — ↑ — Shows the protest is not confined to the Supreme Court, broadening the base of judicial resistance and increasing pressure on other High Court judges.
*   [2025-11-15] Opposition alliance TTAP, led by Imran Khan, calls for nationwide protests. — ↑ — Increases political pressure and public scrutiny on the judiciary, potentially emboldening judges considering resignation and framing those who stay as collaborators.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Principled Stand/Judicial Conscience:** Judges with a strong commitment to constitutionalism and judicial independence may resign rather than be complicit in what they see as the dismantling of the rule of law. The first three resignations exemplify this. (Size: Large)
2.  **Solidarity and Peer Pressure:** As more judges resign, particularly senior ones, a cascade effect can occur. Remaining judges may feel pressure from their peers and the legal community (Bar Associations) to join the protest to avoid being seen as legitimizing an unconstitutional order. (Size: Moderate to Large)
3.  **Government Coercion and Incentives:** The government can use the new powers (e.g., forced transfers) to sideline or intimidate independent-minded judges, effectively encouraging their resignation. Conversely, it can offer promotions or favorable positions to compliant judges, incentivizing them to stay. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Career and Pension Calculations:** Judges nearing retirement may be less willing to sacrifice their pensions and benefits by resigning. Younger judges have a longer career to consider, making the decision more complex; they might resign on principle or stay to "fight from within." (Size: Moderate, acts as a brake)
5.  **Bar Association Activism:** The stance of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Pakistan Bar Council is critical. A strong, unified call for resignations and nationwide protests by lawyers (as in 2007) would dramatically increase pressure on judges to step down. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Constitutional Amendment vs. Extra-Constitutional Order:** The 2007 crisis was triggered by a military dictator's extra-constitutional PCO. This crisis is driven by a *constitutional amendment* passed by a civilian parliament. This provides a veneer of legality that may make it harder for some judges to justify resignation, as they would be defying a formal change to the constitution itself.
*   **Lack of a Single Judicial Figurehead:** The 2007 Lawyers' Movement was galvanized by the removal of a specific, popular Chief Justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. The current crisis is more abstract, centered on the principle of judicial independence rather than the fate of one individual, which may make it harder to mobilize mass support.
*   **Systemic vs. Targeted Attack:** The 27th Amendment is a systemic restructuring of the judiciary's power (e.g., creating a new Constitutional Court), not just an attempt to remove a few "inconvenient" judges. This fundamental change may provoke a stronger, more widespread reaction from the judiciary as a whole than a targeted attack would.
*   **Pre-existing Political Polarization:** The judiciary was already deeply embroiled in political battles, particularly concerning cases against Imran Khan. This pre-existing polarization may mean some judges are already seen as aligned with the government or opposition, influencing their decision to resign or stay based on political calculations as much as principle.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior centered very low, reflecting the rarity of resignations (e.g., a Poisson distribution with λ ≈ 0.5, equivalent n=10). The prior should, however, have a fat tail to account for the possibility of a 2007-style crisis.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   The 27th Amendment is a fundamental, systemic shock to judicial independence. (↑, Large)
    *   The immediate resignation of two respected SC justices and one HC justice is a very strong signal that this is a major crisis of conscience, not a minor dispute. This moves the count from 0 to 3. (↑, Large)
    *   The mobilization of the political opposition (TTAP) and civil society increases the political cost for judges who remain. (↑, Moderate)
    *   The "veneer of constitutionality" (vs. the 2007 PCO) may provide cover for judges who wish to stay, acting as a counterweight. (↓, Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly pushes the estimate up from the near-zero base rate. The prior should be updated significantly upwards. The initial three resignations form a new floor. The key question is the magnitude of the subsequent wave, which is likely to be smaller than the 2007 precedent but significantly larger than a normal year. The posterior distribution should be centered in the single digits (e.g., 5-10 total) but with a tail extending into the teens.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The Supreme Court Bar Association or Pakistan Bar Council issues a statement explicitly calling for judges to resign.
    *   Another senior Supreme Court justice resigns, signaling a potential cascade.
    *   Large-scale, sustained protests by lawyers' associations erupt in major cities.
    *   The government attempts to use its new transfer powers, provoking a backlash.
    *   Reports of coordinated dissent or a "rebel" faction emerging within the judiciary.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Bar Associations issue divided or weak statements, condemning the amendment but not calling for resignations.
    *   No further resignations occur within the next 1-2 weeks, suggesting the initial wave is contained.
    *   The government successfully appoints new, compliant judges to the new Constitutional Court without major protest.
    *   Protests called by the opposition fail to gain significant traction.
    *   Key senior judges release statements committing to working within the new system.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria specify "resign." A judge who is transferred against their will and then goes on "long leave" or is effectively sidelined might not officially count but represents the same phenomenon.
*   **Information Opacity:** Decisions are being made behind closed doors. We may not be aware of threats, inducements, or back-channel negotiations that could influence a judge's decision.
*   **Volatility:** The situation is highly fluid. A single event, such as a violent crackdown on protesters or a defiant ruling by a remaining judge, could rapidly alter the calculations for everyone involved.
*   **Data Lag:** Official announcements of resignations may lag the actual decision, potentially causing resignations that occurred in December to be reported in January.
*   **Distinguishing Protest from Retirement:** A judge nearing retirement age might time their departure to coincide with the protest, blurring the lines between a standard retirement and a politically motivated resignation.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts who will resign during late 2025, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Routine Judicial Resignations in Pakistan:** The base rate for politically motivated resignations is extremely low, typically 0-1 per year. This reflects the norm where judges serve until mandatory retirement.
   - **Judicial Resistance during Constitutional Crises (2007 PCO):** A high-end reference is the 2007 crisis, where approximately 60 judges were removed. This provides an upper bound for a systemic crisis.
   - **Individual Protest Resignations (Historical):** Historically, 1-3 judges might resign over disagreements, which aligns with the current situation where three judges have already resigned.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a significant constitutional change, similar to the 2007 crisis, suggesting potential for more resignations.
   - **Differences:** The 27th Amendment is a constitutional change, not an extra-constitutional order, which may reduce the likelihood of mass resignations compared to 2007.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **27th Amendment:** A major systemic change that undermines judicial independence, increasing the likelihood of resignations.
   - **Resignations of three judges:** Strong signal of crisis, suggesting more may follow.
   - **Political and civil pressure:** Increases likelihood of further resignations.
   - **Veneer of constitutionality:** May decrease likelihood, as judges might justify staying.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Start with a low base rate, reflecting rarity of resignations.
   - **Evidence:** The amendment and initial resignations push the estimate up significantly.
   - **Posterior:** Centered around 5-10 resignations, with a tail extending into the teens.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence:** Consider the possibility of fewer resignations if the government effectively manages dissent.
   - **Tail risks:** A sudden escalation in protests or government actions could lead to more resignations.
   - **Alternative forecast:** A scenario with minimal further resignations if the initial wave is contained.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast is adjusted to account for potential tail risks and uncertainties.

P10: 3  
P20: 4  
P40: 6  
P60: 8  
P80: 10  
P90: 12

# Forecast: How many judges on Pakistan's Superior Courts will resign during late 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll consider three reference classes for my prior:

1. **Normal-year judicial resignations in Pakistan**: Typically 0-1 politically motivated resignations per year
2. **The 2007 PCO crisis under Musharraf**: ~60 judges removed/refused to take oath
3. **Individual protest resignations**: Historical pattern of 1-3 judges resigning over principles

Given the current situation is clearly not a normal year but also not (yet) as extreme as 2007, I'll use a prior distribution centered between these reference points. The 2007 crisis represents an extreme upper bound, while the normal-year rate is too low given the constitutional crisis.

**Prior distribution**: 
- Median (P50): 5 judges
- Shape: Right-skewed (more probability mass on lower values, with a long tail for extreme scenarios)
- Variance: Moderate to high, reflecting significant uncertainty

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference cases**:
- Like 2007, this involves a fundamental change to judicial independence
- The mechanism of protest resignation is consistent with historical individual cases
- The judiciary is facing direct pressure from the executive/military

**Key differences**:
- The 27th Amendment has a veneer of constitutionality (unlike the 2007 PCO)
- Three judges have already resigned, establishing a floor and a precedent
- No single judicial figurehead like Chief Justice Chaudhry in 2007
- The amendment is systemic rather than targeted at specific judges
- Pre-existing political polarization may affect judges' decisions

These differences suggest we should expect more resignations than in a normal year but fewer than the 2007 crisis.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast upward**:
- Three judges (two Supreme Court, one High Court) have already resigned (strong evidence, +3 to baseline)
- The amendment fundamentally alters judicial independence (very strong evidence, 3x likelihood of higher values)
- Opposition calling for nationwide protests (moderate evidence, 1.5x likelihood of higher values)
- The amendment allows forced transfers of judges (moderate evidence, 1.5x likelihood of higher values)
- Resignations have crossed court boundaries (Supreme Court to High Court) (moderate evidence, 1.5x likelihood)

**Evidence pushing forecast downward**:
- Constitutional veneer makes it harder to justify resignation (moderate evidence, 0.7x likelihood of higher values)
- No unified judicial leadership figure like in 2007 (weak evidence, 0.9x likelihood of higher values)
- Career/pension considerations may deter some judges (moderate evidence, 0.8x likelihood of higher values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 5 judges, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

1. **Update on existing resignations**: Three judges have already resigned, establishing a floor. This shifts the distribution rightward, with a new minimum of 3.

2. **Update on fundamental alteration of judicial independence**: This is the core driver that could lead to more resignations. The likelihood ratio strongly favors higher values (3x).
   - Prior median: 5 judges
   - After update: ~8-9 judges

3. **Update on constitutional veneer and career considerations**: These factors moderate the upward pressure (combined factor of ~0.6x for higher values).
   - After update: ~6-7 judges

The posterior distribution is still right-skewed but with more mass in the 5-10 range, a median around 6-7, and a tail extending into the teens.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating cascade effects if more senior judges resign
- I might be overestimating the importance of the "constitutional veneer"
- The timeline is short (November-December 2025), which limits how many judges might complete resignation processes
- I haven't fully accounted for government countermeasures to prevent resignations

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Low scenario (3-4 judges)**: No further resignations occur as the government successfully stabilizes the situation
- **High scenario (15-20 judges)**: A cascade effect occurs where each resignation emboldens others, particularly in specific courts

**Adjustments**:
- Widening my distribution to account for cascade possibilities
- Slightly lowering my median estimate to account for the limited time window
- Ensuring my P10 remains at 3 (the current floor)

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3
P20: 4
P40: 5
P60: 7
P80: 10
P90: 14

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the total number of resignations from Pakistan's superior courts in November and December 2025 following a constitutional crisis.

There are two relevant reference classes:
1.  **Normal Year Resignations:** In a typical year, politically motivated resignations are exceptionally rare, with a base rate near zero (0-1). This serves as a low-end anchor but is not representative of the current crisis situation.
2.  **2007 Constitutional Crisis (PCO):** The most relevant historical analogue is the 2007 crisis under General Musharraf. When he issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO), approximately 60 judges were removed for refusing to take a new oath. While not strictly "resignations," this event represents a mass departure on principle and provides a plausible, albeit extreme, upper bound for a judicial revolt.

My prior distribution, before considering the specific evidence of this crisis, would be a low-integer distribution with a very fat tail. The median would be low (perhaps 2-3), but the mean would be higher (perhaps 5-7) to account for the small but real possibility of a 2007-style mass departure.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the 2007 crisis in that it involves a fundamental challenge to judicial independence by the executive/military establishment, prompting a crisis of conscience for judges.

However, there are crucial differences:
*   **"Veneer of Legality":** The current changes are enacted via a constitutional amendment passed by parliament, not an extra-constitutional military decree. This provides a legal justification for judges who choose to remain, making a mass resignation less likely than in 2007 when compliance meant legitimizing an illegal order. This is a strong factor pushing the forecast *down* relative to the 2007 precedent.
*   **Systemic vs. Targeted Attack:** The 27th Amendment is a deep, systemic restructuring of the judiciary's power. This could be perceived as a more fundamental threat than the 2007 PCO, potentially provoking a stronger principled reaction from a wider group of judges, pushing the forecast *up*.

On balance, the "veneer of legality" is the more powerful factor, suggesting the total number of departures will be significantly lower than the ~60 seen in 2007.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
1.  **The 27th Amendment:** This is the primary trigger. Its sweeping nature makes a significant number of protest resignations far more likely than the base rate of zero. (Strong upward pressure).
2.  **Initial Resignations (Nov 13-14):** The immediate resignation of two respected Supreme Court justices (Shah and Minallah) and one High Court justice (Mirza) is very strong evidence. It establishes a floor of 3 for the final count and confirms this is a major crisis, not a minor dispute. It makes a subsequent "cascade" of further resignations plausible. (Strong upward pressure).
3.  **Time Elapsed (Nov 15 - Dec 7):** Approximately three weeks have passed since the initial wave of resignations with no further announcements. This is a powerful piece of counter-evidence. A rapid, large-scale cascade, as might have been expected in the immediate aftermath, has not materialized. This suggests that many judges have made the calculation to stay, and the initial momentum has stalled. (Strong downward pressure on the number of *additional* resignations).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A low-integer distribution with a fat tail, acknowledging the 2007 precedent.
*   **Update 1 (Amendment + 3 Resignations):** The initial evidence dramatically shifts the distribution. The prior possibility of 0, 1, or 2 resignations is eliminated. The floor becomes 3. The likelihood of a total in the 5-15 range increases substantially. The probability of a 2007-style event (>20) also increases from its very low base. As of November 15, a forecast centered around 6-8 with a wide tail would have been reasonable.
*   **Update 2 (Time Lag):** The subsequent three weeks of inaction act as a strong dampening factor. Each day without a new resignation makes the "large cascade" hypothesis less likely. The posterior distribution must be revised downwards from the peak uncertainty of mid-November. The probability mass now concentrates on numbers slightly above the current count of 3.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The final posterior distribution is anchored at 3. The median is likely just above this, reflecting the chance of a few more "stragglers" or a small, delayed second wave. The distribution is right-skewed, but the tail is much thinner than it was in mid-November.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Why could the forecast be too low?** I might be underestimating the potential for a coordinated second wave of resignations. Judges could be waiting for a specific trigger, such as a call to action from the Bar Associations or the government's first use of its controversial new powers. Such an event could cause another 3-5 judges to resign before the end of the year. My upper percentiles must account for this possibility.
*   **Why could the forecast be too high?** The three judges who resigned may be the only ones willing to take such a drastic step. The time lag could indicate that the protest has been effectively contained, and everyone else has decided to work within the new system. The final number could remain at 3.
*   **Adjustment:** My reasoning heavily weights the time lag as evidence against a large cascade. This seems correct. However, the risk of a small, coordinated second wave is non-trivial. My distribution should therefore have its median near 4-5, with a tail that allows for a total of 6-8, but assigns low probability to numbers in the double digits. The proposed percentiles reflect this by centering the distribution around 4 while allowing for a reasonable chance of reaching 5 or 6.
