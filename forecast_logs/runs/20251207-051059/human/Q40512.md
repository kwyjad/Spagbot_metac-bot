Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Reference Class & Base Rate:** What is the historical frequency of countries announcing a move of their capital? What is the typical timeline from serious discussion to official announcement? What is the success rate of such proposals?
2.  **Iran-Specific Precedent:** Has Iran seriously considered moving its capital before? If so, what were the proposals, what were the outcomes, and what were the key obstacles that prevented action?
3.  **Current Political & Economic Drivers:** What are the current priorities of President Pezeshkian's administration and Supreme Leader Khamenei? How does the country's economic situation (e.g., budget, inflation, sanctions) affect the feasibility of a mega-project like relocating the capital?
4.  **Problem Urgency:** How acute are the ecological pressures (water scarcity, land subsidence, pollution) on Tehran? Is the perception of this crisis among the elite reaching a tipping point that would override economic and political inertia?
5.  **Logistical & Procedural Hurdles:** What would the official process for announcing a new capital entail? Would it require a Majlis vote, a presidential decree, or the Supreme Leader's approval? Is there any evidence of a formal process (e.g., a committee, feasibility studies) currently underway?
6.  **Resolution Criteria Analysis:** What constitutes an "official announcement"? How can we distinguish between political rhetoric and a binding decision to move to a *specific location*?

### **Step 2: Proposed Search Queries**

1.  **Reference Class:**
    *   `countries that moved their capital city list`
    *   `capital relocation timeline analysis`
    *   `failed attempts to move national capital`
    *   `cost of building a new capital city`
2.  **Iran-Specific Precedent:**
    *   `Iran plan to move capital from Tehran history`
    *   `Iran capital relocation debate 2013 Majlis`
    *   `Supreme Leader Khamenei on moving capital`
    *   `obstacles to moving Iran's capital`
3.  **Current Political & Economic Drivers:**
    *   `President Pezeshkian economic policy 2025`
    *   `Iran budget 2025-2026 details`
    *   `Iran 7th national development plan priorities`
    *   `political factions Majlis Iran 2025`
4.  **Problem Urgency:**
    *   `Tehran land subsidence rate 2025`
    *   `Iran water crisis latest report`
    *   `Tehran pollution and seismic risk government response`
5.  **Logistical & Procedural Hurdles:**

    *   `potential new capital locations Iran analysis`
6.  **Resolution Criteria Analysis:**
    *   `powers of Iranian president vs supreme leader`
    *   `official government announcements Iran procedure`

### **Step 3: Synthesis of Key Findings**

My research indicates that while the ecological pressures on Tehran are severe and acknowledged at the highest levels, the path to an official announcement of a new capital is blocked by immense, and likely insurmountable, short-term obstacles. Historically, such moves are rare, incredibly expensive, and take years of planning, none of which appears to be in place. Iran's own past attempts have failed due to these same factors. The current administration's stated focus is on fiscal austerity and inflation control, which is fundamentally at odds with the colossal expenditure required for a capital move. The President's comments appear to be more of a long-term warning and a framing of the problem's severity rather than a statement of imminent policy. The extremely short timeline to resolution (<1 month) makes the required political and logistical alignment virtually impossible.

### **Step 4: Draft Research Brief**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern Capital Relocations:** Since 1950, fewer than 15 countries have successfully relocated their capitals (e.g., Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Indonesia). This suggests a base rate of a country announcing a new capital in a given year is well under 1%. These projects are typically multi-decade endeavors, driven by strong political will (often in autocratic or single-party states) and significant state resources. The timeline from serious proposal to official announcement of a specific site is typically 3-10 years.
2.  **Failed/Stalled Proposals:** The number of countries that have discussed or proposed moving their capital is much higher than those that have succeeded. Discussions in countries like Egypt, South Korea, and Argentina have spanned years or decades without resolution. This suggests a high failure rate for such proposals.
3.  **Iran's Own History:** Iran has debated moving its capital for over a decade. A 2013 law tasked a council with studying the feasibility, but it produced no definitive action due to prohibitive costs, political infighting, and the lack of a consensus alternative. This specific reference class suggests a very high probability of inertia and a low probability of a breakthrough announcement.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-11** Pezeshkian urges parliament to pass a "no-deficit" budget. ↓ This signals extreme fiscal constraint, making a multi-billion dollar mega-project like a new capital politically and economically non-viable in the short term.
*   **2024-10-22** Pezeshkian submits a fiscally conservative $98.5b budget bill. ↓ The budget focuses on inflation and implementing the existing development plan, with no apparent allocation for a capital relocation feasibility study or initial work.
*   **Mid-2024 (assumed)** Pezeshkian states moving the capital is "no longer optional." ↑ This is the strongest recent evidence for the "Yes" case, indicating presidential-level acknowledgement of the crisis and potential will to act.
*   **2024-07-05** Pezeshkian, a "reformist," wins the presidency. ↔︎ His focus is on domestic economic and social issues, but he lacks the power to unilaterally enact such a major policy without the Supreme Leader's backing.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Economic Constraints (Large ↓):** Iran's economy is under severe strain from sanctions, inflation, and structural issues. The government's stated priority is fiscal austerity. Announcing a new capital, a project costing tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, is directly contrary to this priority.
2.  **Political Inertia & Factionalism (Large ↓):** Such a monumental decision would require consensus among competing political factions (in the Majlis, military, and clergy) and, crucially, the Supreme Leader. Past attempts have failed due to this infighting. There is no evidence this has changed.
3.  **Ecological Crisis (Moderate ↑):** The drivers—water depletion, land subsidence, seismic risk—are real, severe, and worsening. This creates a powerful long-term incentive to move and provides the justification for the rhetoric. However, slow-moving crises rarely trigger rapid, expensive action.
4.  **Presidential Advocacy (Small ↑):** Pezeshkian's statement puts the issue on the agenda. However, the Iranian president's power is limited, especially on strategic matters requiring massive budgets. His words may be more about problem-framing than policy-setting.
5.  **Lack of Preparatory Work (Large ↓):** An announcement of a *specific location* requires years of feasibility studies, site selection, and planning. There is no public evidence that this work has been completed or is even underway at an advanced stage. An announcement by Jan 2026 is logistically improbable.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Acute Ecological Pressure:** Unlike many historical capital moves motivated by political or developmental goals (e.g., Brasilia, Astana), the primary driver here is existential environmental threat, which could theoretically accelerate the timeline.
*   **Severe Economic Weakness:** In contrast to resource-rich nations that built new capitals during economic booms (e.g., Kazakhstan, Nigeria), Iran is attempting to consider this from a position of profound economic weakness and international isolation.
*   **Complex Theocratic Governance:** The decision-making process is not that of a single autocrat. It requires alignment between an elected president, an elected parliament, and the unelected Supreme Leader and his associated councils, making decisive action much harder than in cases like Myanmar or Kazakhstan.
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question's deadline of less than one month is exceptionally short compared to the multi-year timelines observed in the reference class, making any outcome other than "No" a massive outlier.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 2-5%) based on the rarity of such events (base rate) and Iran's own history of failure on this issue. The "equivalent n" is moderate, as past failures are strong evidence.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Pezeshkian's "no longer optional" rhetoric: ↑ (small, as it's likely posturing without a concrete plan).
    *   Severe and public fiscal austerity measures (budget focus): ↓ (large, directly contradicts the required spending).
    *   Lack of any public reports of a site-selection committee or feasibility study: ↓ (large, this is a prerequisite for an announcement).
    *   The extremely short time remaining until the deadline: ↓ (large, makes the necessary political and bureaucratic steps nearly impossible).
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The strong negative signals from economic constraints and lack of logistical groundwork should significantly reduce the already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Formation of a high-level state council or committee to finalize a location.
    *   A public statement of support for the move from the Supreme Leader's office.
    *   Leaked reports or official discussion in the Majlis about specific candidate cities.
    *   Any mention of a budget allocation, even for studies, in a revised budget or decree.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continued public emphasis by all government branches on the "no-deficit" budget and inflation.
    *   Statements from other senior officials dismissing the idea as impractical for now.
    *   No follow-up statements from the President's office on the capital issue.
    *   The deadline passing with no relevant announcements.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Rhetoric vs. Intent:** Pezeshkian's statement could be political maneuvering to highlight the failures of past administrations or to pressure for more environmental funding, rather than a literal statement of intent to announce a move.
*   **"Official Announcement" Ambiguity:** The resolution criteria hinge on an "official announcement." A vague statement of intent would not suffice, but a presidential speech naming a city might, even if the Majlis hasn't voted. The authority to make a "final" announcement is concentrated with the Supreme Leader.
*   **Black Swan Event:** A catastrophic earthquake in Tehran, while unlikely, could force an emergency declaration and a snap decision, bypassing all normal political and economic logic.
*   **Information Opacity:** The

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Historically, the relocation of national capitals is a rare event. Since 1950, fewer than 15 countries have successfully moved their capitals. This suggests a base rate of less than 1% per year for any country to announce a new capital.
- **Iran-Specific Context:** Iran has considered moving its capital for over a decade without success. The 2013 law to study feasibility did not lead to action due to costs and political challenges. This history suggests a very low probability of an announcement.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the rarity and Iran's history, a reasonable prior probability might be around 2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation in Iran is similar to other countries that have considered moving capitals due to ecological or political reasons.
- **Differences:** The ecological crisis in Tehran is severe, but Iran's economic constraints and political structure make decisive action difficult. The short timeline until the deadline further complicates the likelihood of an announcement.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Pezeshkian's Statement:** The president's comment that moving the capital is "no longer optional" suggests awareness but lacks concrete action. This slightly increases the probability but is likely more rhetoric than intent.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Small increase.
- **Economic Constraints:** Iran's focus on fiscal austerity and a "no-deficit" budget strongly suggests that a capital move is not feasible in the short term.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Large decrease.
- **Lack of Preparatory Work:** No evidence of feasibility studies or site selection indicates logistical unpreparedness for an announcement.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Large decrease.
- **Short Timeline:** Less than a month remains, making the necessary political and bureaucratic steps nearly impossible.
  - **Likelihood Ratio:** Large decrease.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 2% probability translates to odds of 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 0.0204.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence overwhelmingly points towards a decrease in probability.
  - **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × (small increase) × (large decrease) × (large decrease) × (large decrease) ≈ 0.0204 × 0.5 × 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.0000102.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.0000102 / (1 + 0.0000102) ≈ 0.00102 or 0.102%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden political shift or external pressure that could lead to an announcement.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A catastrophic event in Tehran could force an emergency decision, but this is unlikely.
- **Rebuttals:** The lack of preparatory work and economic constraints are strong counterarguments to any sudden announcement.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability of Iran announcing a new capital location before January 3, 2026, is extremely low.

Final: 0.1%

# Will Iran announce a new capital location before January 3, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a country announcing a new capital location within a specific timeframe.

Looking at the reference class of capital relocations:
- Since 1950, fewer than 15 countries have successfully relocated their capitals (Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Indonesia, etc.)
- This suggests a base rate of a country announcing a new capital in any given year is well under 1%
- The timeline from serious proposal to official announcement typically spans 3-10 years
- Iran specifically has debated moving its capital for over a decade without resolution

Given these factors, I'll set a prior probability of 3%. This reflects:
- The general rarity of capital relocations globally
- Iran's own history of failed attempts
- The extremely short timeframe (less than 1 month until the January 3, 2026 deadline)

**Prior probability: 3%** (odds of 3:97 or about 1:32)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other countries that considered relocations, Iran faces legitimate ecological pressures (water scarcity, land subsidence)
- The issue has been acknowledged at the highest levels of government
- There is historical precedent for Iran changing its capital over centuries

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline constraint:** Most successful capital relocations had years of planning before announcement; we have less than a month until the deadline
- **Economic situation:** Unlike countries that built new capitals during economic booms (Kazakhstan, Nigeria), Iran faces severe economic constraints, sanctions, and fiscal austerity
- **Governance complexity:** Iran's theocratic system requires alignment between the president, parliament, and Supreme Leader, making decisive action harder than in more autocratic systems
- **Urgency vs. preparation:** While the ecological crisis is severe, there's no evidence of completed feasibility studies or site selection processes that would precede an announcement

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's statement that relocating the capital is "no longer optional"**
- P(E|H): If Iran is about to announce a new capital, we would expect such statements (0.9)
- P(E|~H): Even if Iran is not about to announce a new capital, such statements could be made to highlight the problem's severity (0.4)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.4 = 2.25
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Iran's severe fiscal constraints and budget austerity**
- P(E|H): If Iran is about to announce a new capital, we would rarely see extreme budget austerity (0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Iran is not about to announce a new capital, we would often see such budget constraints (0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.8 = 0.125
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Lack of public reports on site selection or feasibility studies**
- P(E|H): If Iran is about to announce a new capital, we would rarely see no preparatory work (0.05)
- P(E|~H): If Iran is not about to announce a new capital, we would often see no preparatory work (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.9 = 0.056
- This evidence very strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short time remaining until deadline**
- P(E|H): If Iran is about to announce a new capital, we would rarely be this close to the deadline with no signals (0.05)
- P(E|~H): If Iran is not about to announce a new capital, we would often be this close to the deadline with no signals (0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This evidence very strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3:97 (or 0.031), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on Evidence 1 (Pezeshkian's statement):**
- Prior odds: 0.031
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 2.25 = 0.07
- Posterior probability: 0.07/(1+0.07) = 6.5%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Fiscal constraints):**
- Prior odds: 0.07
- Likelihood ratio: 0.125
- Posterior odds: 0.07 × 0.125 = 0.00875
- Posterior probability: 0.00875/(1+0.00875) = 0.87%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Lack of preparatory work):**
- Prior odds: 0.00875
- Likelihood ratio: 0.056
- Posterior odds: 0.00875 × 0.056 = 0.00049
- Posterior probability: 0.00049/(1+0.00049) = 0.049%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Short timeframe):**
- Prior odds: 0.00049
- Likelihood ratio: 0.053
- Posterior odds: 0.00049 × 0.053 = 0.000026
- Posterior probability: 0.000026/(1+0.000026) = 0.0026%

This extremely low probability (0.0026%) seems too confident given inherent uncertainties. I should adjust for model uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be underestimating the urgency of Tehran's ecological crisis, which could force an emergency announcement
- There could be non-public preparations already underway that would enable a faster announcement
- I might be overestimating the fiscal constraints - a capital announcement doesn't require immediate funding
- The resolution criteria only requires an announcement, not actual implementation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A catastrophic environmental event in Tehran could trigger an emergency announcement (low probability)
- A surprise political development (e.g., Supreme Leader directive) could accelerate the timeline
- The announcement could be purely symbolic with no real implementation plan

**Adjustments needed:**
My sequential Bayesian updates may have compounded to create an unrealistically low probability. While the evidence strongly points against an announcement, I should account for unknown unknowns and the possibility of surprise developments.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my final forecast upward from the calculated 0.0026% to 1%, which still reflects the very low likelihood but acknowledges some residual uncertainty.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate of capital relocations, Iran's specific context, the strong evidence against an imminent announcement (fiscal constraints, lack of preparatory work, extremely short timeframe), and accounting for potential blind spots, I assess the probability that Iran will announce a new capital location before January 3, 2026 at 1%.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The appropriate reference class is the frequency with which modern nation-states announce a relocation of their capital city. Since 1950, fewer than 15 countries have successfully relocated their capitals. With roughly 200 countries in the world, this gives us a rough annual base rate:

(15 relocations / 75 years) / 200 countries = 0.001, or 0.1% per country per year.

The question asks about a specific, short timeframe: from today (December 7, 2025) to January 3, 2026, which is less than one month. The monthly base rate would be approximately 0.1% / 12 ≈ 0.008%.

However, Iran is not a random country; it is one where the topic is under active discussion at the presidential level. A more specific reference class is "countries that have seriously debated moving their capital." This class has a very high failure/stall rate (e.g., Egypt, South Korea, Argentina, and Iran itself for the past decade). Even within this group, the probability of a definitive announcement in any given month is extremely low.

Given this, a generous prior probability P(H) for an announcement in the next month might be set at **0.5%**. This is significantly higher than the raw base rate but reflects that the topic is at least on the agenda. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:199.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** Iran faces severe problems with its current capital (overcrowding, pollution, environmental degradation), which are common drivers for capital relocation discussions. The conversation is being driven from the top political levels.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Driver Type:** The primary driver in Tehran is an acute ecological crisis (land subsidence, water depletion), which is more of an existential threat than the political or developmental goals that drove moves in places like Brazil or Kazakhstan. This could theoretically increase urgency.
    *   **Economic Context:** Unlike many countries that built new capitals during economic booms, Iran is facing a severe economic crisis, with high inflation and a government publicly committed to fiscal austerity. This makes the colossal expense of a new capital (hundreds of billions of dollars) seem prohibitive.
    *   **Governance Structure:** Decision-making in Iran is complex, requiring alignment between the President, the Majlis (parliament), and the Supreme Leader. This creates far more political inertia than in autocratic states that have moved capitals by decree (e.g., Myanmar).
    *   **Timeline:** The most critical difference is the extremely short timeframe of less than one month. Capital relocations are multi-year, often multi-decade, projects. An announcement within weeks would be a massive outlier compared to any historical precedent.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the hypothesis that Iran announces a new capital location before Jan 3, 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's statement that moving the capital is "no longer optional."**
    *   P(E | H): High. If an announcement were imminent, we would expect such framing.
    *   P(E | ~H): Also high. This is common rhetoric for highlighting a severe, long-term problem without a concrete short-term plan. It serves to pressure for more resources or blame past inaction.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): Slightly > 1.** This evidence weakly increases the probability but is far from conclusive.

*   **Evidence 2: The government's stated focus on a "no-deficit" budget and fiscal austerity (Oct-Nov 2025).**
    *   P(E | H): Very low. It is highly improbable that a government would be preparing to announce one of the most expensive projects imaginable while its core public message is extreme fiscal restraint.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. This is precisely the expected behavior of a government grappling with immediate economic crises and *not* planning a massive new expenditure.
    *   **LR: << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The lack of any public reports of preparatory work (e.g., a finalized site-selection study, a high-level committee's recommendation).**
    *   P(E | H): Very low. An announcement of a *specific location* requires that a location has been chosen through a complex, multi-year process. It is extremely unlikely such a process could conclude without any public footprint.
    *   P(E | ~H): Very high. This is the status quo, consistent with the issue remaining stalled as it has for over a decade.
    *   **LR: << 1.** This evidence also strongly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with a prior of 0.5% (odds of 1:199).

1.  **Pezeshkian's rhetoric:** This weak positive signal might slightly increase the odds, perhaps to 1:100 (a probability of ~1%).
2.  **Fiscal Austerity & Lack of Prep:** These two pieces of evidence are overwhelming. Combined, their likelihood ratio is extremely small, perhaps 1/100 or less. Applying this to the updated odds:
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR ≈ (1:100) × (1/100) = 1:10,000.
    *   This corresponds to a posterior probability of 0.01%.

The formal update suggests the probability is near zero. The combination of immense cost, political inertia, lack of groundwork, and an impossibly short timeline makes a "Yes" outcome extraordinarily unlikely through any normal process.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible path to a "Yes" outcome would bypass all normal processes. The decision could have already been made in secret by the Supreme Leader and his inner circle, with the announcement timed for political effect (e.g., a major distraction). The opacity of the Iranian regime means we cannot entirely rule out such a "bolt from the blue" scenario.
*   **Black Swan Event:** A catastrophic earthquake in Tehran could trigger an emergency announcement, though the probability of such an event in the next month is itself very low.
*   **Rebuttal:** Even a secret decision by the Supreme Leader would require years of secret planning to select a specific site, which would be difficult to conceal entirely. Furthermore, announcing such a costly project during a period of economic hardship could backfire politically.
*   **Adjustment:** The core forecast remains extremely low. However, to account for the non-zero chance of an opaque, top-down surprise decision or a black swan event, the final probability should be slightly higher than the near-zero result from the formal update. A probability of 1% acknowledges these tail risks without contradicting the overwhelming weight of the evidence. It reflects an event that would be a major surprise (1-in-100) but is not completely outside the realm of possibility for this type of political system.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such an announcement is extremely low. While the ecological pressure on Tehran is a real and powerful driver, the overwhelming evidence—the government's focus on fiscal austerity, the lack of any visible preparatory work, the immense political and financial hurdles, and the critically short timeframe of less than one month—points strongly against an announcement. The only plausible path to a "Yes" is a surprise decree from the highest level of leadership, an event which is by nature unpredictable but has a very low probability.

Final: 1%
