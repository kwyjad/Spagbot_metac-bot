### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Affirmance of Unanimous Appellate Rulings:** The Supreme Court reviews cases where it may disagree with the lower courts. However, when multiple lower courts, including a federal appellate court, have ruled unanimously on the core legal question, the Supreme Court affirms more often than it reverses. A rough base rate for affirmation in such circumstances is **65-75%**. In this case, three lower courts (CIT, D.D.C., and the Federal Circuit) found the tariffs unlawful, creating a strong presumption that the Supreme Court will affirm this outcome.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on "Major Questions":** Recent jurisprudence shows the Court is increasingly skeptical of executive agencies claiming broad, transformative power based on ambiguous or old statutes (the "major questions doctrine"). Cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) exemplify this trend. Using IEEPA to impose sweeping tariffs, a power traditionally reserved for Congress, fits the definition of a major question. In such cases over the last decade, the Court has ruled against the executive's broad interpretation roughly **60-70%** of the time.
3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Presidential National Security Powers:** Historically, the Court has shown significant deference to the President in matters of foreign policy and national security (e.g., *Dames & Moore v. Regan*). This reference class would suggest a high probability of upholding the President's actions, perhaps **70-80%**. However, this deference has been eroding, and classifying trade deficits as a national emergency stretches the traditional boundaries of this deference, making this reference class a weaker fit than the others.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-29** U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms that the tariffs are unlawful in a 7-4 decision. ↑ (for Tariffs unlawful) — A major appellate court ruling against the government strengthens the legal case against the tariffs and provides momentum for the challengers.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court agrees to hear the consolidated cases on an expedited schedule. ↑ (for Tariffs unlawful) / ↓ (for No 2025 ruling) — The Court's urgency signals the issue's national importance and its desire to resolve the legal uncertainty, likely because the lower court rulings created a significant problem for the executive. It also makes a 2025 ruling more likely.
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments are held at the Supreme Court. ↑↑ (for Tariffs unlawful) — This is the most direct evidence of the justices' thinking. Subsequent reporting is a key input.
*   **2025-11-13** Mondaq reports that justices "from across the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism" about the administration's arguments during oral arguments. ↑↑↑ (for Tariffs unlawful) — This is the strongest signal available. Bipartisan skepticism from the bench during oral argument is a powerful predictor that the government's position will fail.
*   **2025-12-06** Washington Post reports a ruling could come "before the end of the year." ↓ (for No 2025 ruling) — Reinforces the likelihood of a decision before the January 1, 2026 deadline, reducing the probability of the "No 2025 ruling" outcome.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Statutory Interpretation (Textualism):** The Court's conservative majority favors textualism. The IEEPA does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties." It authorizes the President to "regulate" foreign commerce. Challengers argue this does not encompass the power to tax imports, a power the Constitution grants to Congress. This textual ambiguity likely favors a narrow reading of presidential power. (Large impact, favors "Unlawful").
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court is likely to view the unilateral imposition of billions of dollars in tariffs as an issue of "vast economic and political significance." Under this doctrine, the Court would require a clear statement from Congress delegating such authority, which is absent in IEEPA. (Large impact, favors "Unlawful").
3.  **Separation of Powers:** The case pits inherent executive authority in foreign emergencies against Congress's enumerated constitutional power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" and "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations." Justices are likely to be protective of Congress's core constitutional powers. (Large impact, favors "Unlawful").
4.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court could differentiate between the "trafficking tariffs" and the "reciprocal tariffs." The former are tied to a more traditional national security threat (drug cartels), while the latter (addressing trade deficits) are a purely economic concern framed as an emergency. This provides a path for a "Mixed ruling." (Moderate impact, favors "Mixed ruling").
5.  **Judicial Deference to Executive on National Security:** The government's main argument will lean on the Court's historical deference to the President's judgment in declared national emergencies. Some justices may find this compelling, especially concerning the trafficking tariffs. (Moderate impact, favors "Lawful" or "Mixed ruling").
6.  **Judicial Calendar:** The Court heard arguments in November. While a decision by Dec 31 is possible for an expedited case, many decisions from that period are released in the spring. The sheer logistical challenge of writing opinions and dissents could push the decision into 2026. (Moderate impact, favors "No 2025 ruling").

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** No prior president has used IEEPA to impose broad tariffs. This lack of historical precedent weakens the executive's claim that the power is inherent in the statute.
*   **Ascendance of the Major Questions Doctrine:** Unlike in past decades when deference to the executive was stronger, the current Court has a well-developed and frequently used doctrinal tool to limit executive overreach in areas of major economic significance.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** The declaration of a trade deficit as a "national emergency" is highly unusual and transparently economic, making it harder to justify under a national security statute compared to traditional threats like terrorism or foreign conflict.
*   **Expedited Supreme Court Review:** The speed at which the Court took up and scheduled the case is notable. It underscores the massive economic disruption and legal chaos caused by the tariffs, increasing the pressure for a swift, definitive ruling on the merits rather than a procedural punt.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the base rate of Supreme Court affirmation of unanimous lower courts, suggesting a ~70% probability of "Tariffs unlawful." (Equivalent n≈3, a moderately strong prior).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑↑↑ **Oral Argument Skepticism:** The report of bipartisan skepticism is extremely strong evidence against the government's position. This is the largest update, strongly favoring "Unlawful."
    *   ↑↑ **Major Questions Doctrine Applicability:** The facts of this case are a textbook fit for the Court's recent major questions jurisprudence. Large update towards "Unlawful."
    *   ↑ **Potential for a Split Ruling:** The different justifications for the two sets of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) provide a plausible off-ramp for a "Mixed ruling." Small update towards "Mixed ruling."
    *   ↑ **Tight Deadline:** The short time between oral argument (Nov 5) and the resolution date (Jan 1) creates a non-trivial chance of slippage. Moderate update towards "No 2025 ruling."
*   **Net effect:** The evidence powerfully reinforces and strengthens the prior. The posterior probability for **"Tariffs unlawful"** should increase significantly. The probability for "Mixed ruling" and "No 2025 ruling" should be seen as the primary, albeit much smaller, alternative outcomes.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (favoring Unlawful/Mixed):**
    *   Leaks from the Court (rare) suggesting a majority opinion striking down the tariffs is circulating.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars arguing against the tariffs on textualist or separation-of-powers grounds.
    *   Absence of any news, as the status quo is the reporting on skeptical oral arguments.
*   **DOWN indicators (favoring Lawful/Other/No Ruling):**
    *   Reports that the justices are deeply divided or that the opinion assignment is contentious, which could delay a ruling past the deadline.
    *   The administration rescinding or modifying the tariffs, which could be an attempt to moot the case and lead to an "Other ruling."
    *   The Court releasing its December opinions with these cases not among them, increasing the odds of "No 2025 ruling."

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Oral Arguments Are Not Votes:** While highly indicative, justices have been known to change their minds after arguments during internal deliberations.
*   **Resolution Deadline is Tight:** A decision in a major, complex case in under two months from argument is fast. Any delay in drafting opinions could easily push the ruling into January 2026, resolving this question as "No 2025 ruling."
*   **"Other Ruling" Possibility:** The Court could devise a procedural exit, such as dismissing the writ as improvidently granted or remanding on a narrow technical ground without reaching the merits of IEEPA's scope, although this seems unlikely given the expedited review.
*   **Complexity of a "Mixed Ruling":** The Court could

To forecast how the Supreme Court will rule on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Tariffs unlawful**: The base rate for the Supreme Court affirming unanimous lower court rulings is approximately 65-75%. Given that three lower courts have ruled the tariffs unlawful, this is a strong prior.
- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Court shows deference to presidential national security powers, suggesting a base rate of 20-30% for upholding such actions.
- **Mixed ruling**: The possibility of a mixed ruling is less common but plausible given the different justifications for the tariffs. A base rate of 10-15% is reasonable.
- **Other ruling**: Procedural dismissals or technical grounds are rare, suggesting a base rate of 5-10%.
- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, the base rate for no ruling by the end of 2025 is low, around 5-10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- The current case involves unprecedented use of IEEPA for tariffs, which differs from typical national security cases, reducing the likelihood of deference.
- The major questions doctrine has gained prominence, making it more likely the Court will rule against broad executive power claims.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Oral Argument Skepticism**: Strong bipartisan skepticism during oral arguments significantly increases the likelihood of "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Major Questions Doctrine**: The applicability of this doctrine strongly favors "Tariffs unlawful."
- **Expedited Review**: The urgency of the case increases the likelihood of a 2025 ruling, reducing "No 2025 ruling."
- **Judicial Calendar**: The tight schedule slightly increases the chance of "No 2025 ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Tariffs unlawful**: Starting with a prior of 70%, the strong evidence from oral arguments and the major questions doctrine increases this to around 85%.
- **Tariffs lawful**: The prior of 25% is reduced to around 10% due to strong evidence against the government's position.
- **Mixed ruling**: The prior of 12% remains stable at around 10% due to the possibility of distinguishing between tariff types.
- **Other ruling**: The prior of 7% remains stable at around 5% due to the unlikelihood of procedural dismissals.
- **No 2025 ruling**: The prior of 8% is reduced to around 5% due to the expedited schedule and reports of a likely decision by year-end.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consideration of overconfidence: The strong evidence for "Tariffs unlawful" could lead to overconfidence. Adjusting slightly to account for potential surprises or procedural issues.
- Alternative scenarios: A mixed ruling remains plausible if the Court distinguishes between tariff types.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format

Tariffs lawful: 10%  
Tariffs unlawful: 80%  
Mixed ruling: 8%  
Other ruling: 2%  
No 2025 ruling: 0%

# Analysis: Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For each option, I'll establish an appropriate base rate:

**Tariffs unlawful (Prior: 65%)**
- Multiple lower courts (CIT, D.D.C., Federal Circuit) have unanimously ruled against the tariffs
- The Supreme Court affirms lower court rulings in ~70% of cases with unanimous lower court decisions
- The Court's recent "major questions doctrine" jurisprudence has limited executive power in cases of vast economic significance (~65-70% ruling against executive overreach)

**Mixed ruling (Prior: 15%)**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases
- There's a natural distinction between the "trafficking tariffs" (more security-focused) and "reciprocal tariffs" (purely economic)
- Historical base rate for split decisions in complex administrative law cases is ~15-20%

**No 2025 ruling (Prior: 10%)**
- While the Court expedited the case, the timeline is tight (November arguments to December decision)
- Historically, ~10-15% of complex cases argued in November/December slip to January

**Tariffs lawful (Prior: 8%)**
- Historical deference to executive in national security (~20-30%)
- However, this is significantly reduced by unanimous lower court rulings against the government

**Other ruling (Prior: 2%)**
- Procedural dismissals or non-merits rulings are rare in expedited cases of national importance
- Base rate of ~2-5% for such outcomes in similar high-profile cases

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major questions doctrine cases, this involves an agency claiming broad power without explicit statutory authorization
- Similar to other cases with unanimous lower court rulings against the government
- Follows pattern of expedited cases of national economic importance

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented use of IEEPA for broad tariffs - no direct historical precedent
- Extremely high economic stakes affecting global trade relationships
- Unusual bipartisan skepticism reported during oral arguments
- Exceptionally clear reporting that justices "from across the ideological spectrum" expressed skepticism
- Tight timeline between November arguments and year-end resolution

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence: Unanimous lower court rulings against tariffs**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = ~90% (Very likely to see unanimous lower court rulings if the legal case against tariffs is strong)
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = ~15% (Unlikely to see unanimous lower court rulings if tariffs are legally sound)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 6:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Bipartisan judicial skepticism during oral arguments**
- P(E|Tariffs unlawful) = ~85% (Highly likely to see bipartisan skepticism if the legal case is weak)
- P(E|Tariffs lawful) = ~10% (Very unlikely to see bipartisan skepticism if the legal case is strong)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 8.5:1 favoring "Tariffs unlawful"

**Evidence: Expedited review schedule**
- P(E|No 2025 ruling) = ~30% (Even with expedition, tight timeline creates risk of delay)
- P(E|Any 2025 ruling) = ~80% (Expedition increases likelihood of 2025 resolution)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 2.7:1 favoring "2025 ruling" over "No 2025 ruling"

**Evidence: Distinct legal bases for different tariff types**
- P(E|Mixed ruling) = ~80% (Very likely to see this distinction if Court will issue mixed ruling)
- P(E|Uniform ruling) = ~40% (Still somewhat likely to see this distinction even with uniform ruling)
- Likelihood ratio ≈ 2:1 favoring "Mixed ruling" over uniform ruling

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with "Tariffs unlawful" (65% prior):

**Update on bipartisan skepticism during oral arguments:**
- Prior odds: 65:35 ≈ 1.86:1
- Likelihood ratio: 8.5:1
- Posterior odds: 1.86 × 8.5 ≈ 15.8:1
- Posterior probability: 15.8/(1+15.8) ≈ 94%

This is too extreme given uncertainty, so I'll moderate to ~80% after considering:
- Oral arguments aren't perfect predictors
- The Court sometimes surprises observers
- The tight timeline creates procedural uncertainty

**Update on "No 2025 ruling" (10% prior):**
- The expedited schedule suggests urgency
- However, the tight timeline (Nov 5 arguments to Dec 31 deadline) creates real risk
- Washington Post reporting a ruling "before the end of the year" increases confidence
- Updating from 10% to ~8% given the expedition evidence

**Update on "Mixed ruling" (15% prior):**
- The distinct legal bases for different tariff types provides a natural compromise
- However, the reported bipartisan skepticism suggests broader concerns about statutory authority
- Updating from 15% to ~10% given the strength of the skepticism evidence

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Oral argument reporting could be incomplete or biased
- The Court might find a narrow statutory interpretation that upholds some tariff authority
- Political considerations might influence timing (delaying to 2026)
- The "major questions doctrine" application might be less straightforward than assumed

**Alternative forecast considerations:**
- A higher probability of "No 2025 ruling" could be justified given the tight timeline
- A higher "Mixed ruling" probability could be justified if the Court seeks a compromise
- The Court could surprise with a narrow ruling upholding some tariff authority

**Adjustments:**
- Reducing "Tariffs unlawful" slightly to account for these uncertainties
- Increasing "No 2025 ruling" slightly to account for timeline risks
- Maintaining a modest probability for "Mixed ruling" given the natural dividing line

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:
- Tariffs unlawful: ~78%
- Mixed ruling: ~10%
- No 2025 ruling: ~8%
- Tariffs lawful: ~3%
- Other ruling: ~1%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 78%  
Mixed ruling: 10%  
No 2025 ruling: 8%  
Tariffs lawful: 3%  
Other ruling: 1%  
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will primarily use two reference classes:
1.  **Supreme Court Affirmance of Lower Courts:** The background shows that three lower courts (the Court of International Trade, the D.D.C. District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) have all ruled the tariffs unlawful. Historically, when lower courts are in agreement on a legal question, the Supreme Court tends to affirm their decisions. A reasonable base rate for affirmation in such cases is approximately 70%. This suggests a high prior probability for the "Tariffs unlawful" option.
2.  **The Major Questions Doctrine:** This case, involving the executive branch using an old statute (IEEPA) to implement a policy of "vast economic and political significance" (sweeping tariffs), is a textbook example of where the current Court applies the major questions doctrine. In recent years, the Court has ruled against broad executive interpretations in such cases about 60-70% of the time. This also supports a high prior for "Tariffs unlawful."

Synthesizing these, I will set a prior that heavily favors "Tariffs unlawful," while acknowledging other possibilities.
*   P(Unlawful): 65%
*   P(Lawful): 15% (This represents a full reversal of the lower courts)
*   P(Mixed): 10% (A partial reversal/affirmance)
*   P(Other): 5% (Procedural outcomes are always possible)
*   P(No 2025 ruling): 5% (Slippage past the deadline is possible)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
This case is similar to the base case scenarios in that it involves a challenge to executive authority that has been rejected by lower courts and implicates a major question of statutory interpretation. However, there are key differences:
*   **Two Types of Tariffs:** The case involves two distinct sets of tariffs—"trafficking tariffs" with a national security rationale and "reciprocal tariffs" with a purely economic one. This structural difference makes a "Mixed ruling" more plausible than in a case challenging a single, uniform policy.
*   **Unprecedented Use of IEEPA:** The use of IEEPA for broad tariffs is novel, meaning the executive cannot rely on historical precedent. This strengthens the challengers' argument that the President is exceeding his statutory authority.
*   **Expedited Review:** The Supreme Court's decision to grant expedited review signals the issue's urgency and makes a merits decision in 2025 more likely, thus decreasing the prior probability of "No 2025 ruling" or "Other ruling."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key new evidence provided in the timeline and reports.

*   **Evidence:** The Mondaq report that justices "from across the ideological spectrum expressed skepticism" about the administration's arguments during oral arguments.
*   **Likelihood Assessment:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence.
    *   **P(E | Tariffs unlawful):** Very High. Widespread skepticism is exactly what one would expect to observe if the Court is preparing to strike down the tariffs.
    *   **P(E | Tariffs lawful):** Very Low. It is highly improbable that the Court would uphold the tariffs after such a negative reaction during arguments.
    *   **P(E | Mixed ruling):** Moderate. The skepticism could have been directed primarily at the weaker "reciprocal tariffs" argument, leaving room to uphold the "trafficking tariffs."
*   **Evidence:** The Supreme Court granted expedited review, and the Washington Post reported a ruling could come "before the end of the year."
*   **Likelihood Assessment:** This evidence primarily weighs against the "No 2025 ruling" option.
    *   **P(E | No 2025 ruling):** Low. The Court is signaling its intent to rule quickly.
    *   **P(E | Any 2025 merits ruling):** High.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
I will now update my priors based on the evidence.

*   **Initial State:** P(Unlawful) = 65%, P(Lawful) = 15%, P(Mixed) = 10%, P(Other) = 5%, P(No 2025 ruling) = 5%.
*   **Update for Expedited Review:** The Court's urgency reduces the chance of delay or a procedural punt. I will lower P(No 2025 ruling) and P(Other) and redistribute that probability to the merits outcomes. This might shift the distribution to roughly: P(Unlawful) 68%, P(Lawful) 16%, P(Mixed) 11%, P(Other) 2%, P(No 2025 ruling) 3%.
*   **Update for Oral Arguments:** This is the most significant update. The report of cross-ideological skepticism is a strong signal against the government's position.
    *   Let's consider the odds of "Lawful" vs. "Not Lawful." The prior odds are 16:84, or about 1:5. The likelihood ratio of this evidence (skepticism) given "Not Lawful" vs. "Lawful" is very high, perhaps 10:1. This would make the posterior odds for "Lawful" roughly 1:50, or ~2%.
    *   The probability mass must shift from "Lawful" primarily to "Unlawful." The "Mixed" ruling option also becomes a more likely alternative than a full "Lawful" ruling.
*   **Resulting Posterior:** After this update, the probability for "Unlawful" increases dramatically, while "Lawful" plummets. "Mixed" remains the most plausible alternative on the merits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a high probability of "Tariffs unlawful." I must challenge this for overconfidence.
*   **Risk 1: Oral arguments are not definitive.** While strong predictors, justices can change their minds. The media report could also overstate the consensus.
*   **Risk 2: The "Mixed ruling" is a compelling alternative.** The Court often seeks narrow rulings. Distinguishing between the two types of tariffs is a clear path to a compromise that rebukes the broadest assertion of executive power (reciprocal tariffs) while granting some deference on the more traditional national security issue (trafficking tariffs). I may be underestimating this option.
*   **Risk 3: The timeline is very tight.** An argument on November 5 leaves less than two months for a decision by December 31. For a complex, contentious case, drafting opinions and dissents can easily cause a delay into January 2026. The 3% estimate for "No 2025 ruling" might be too low.

Considering these risks, I will slightly decrease the probability of a complete "Unlawful" ruling and increase the probabilities for "Mixed ruling" and "No 2025 ruling" to better reflect these key uncertainties.

### 6. Final Normalization
After red teaming, I will adjust my final probabilities to reflect a robust but not overconfident forecast.

*   **Tariffs unlawful:** Remains the strong favorite due to the overwhelming weight of evidence (lower courts, major questions doctrine, oral arguments). (78%)
*   **Mixed ruling:** The most significant alternative scenario on the merits. I increase its share to reflect its plausibility as a judicial compromise. (13%)
*   **No 2025 ruling:** The tight deadline is a real constraint. I increase this probability to account for potential slippage. (5%)
*   **Tariffs lawful:** Remains a tail risk, highly unlikely given the evidence. (2%)
*   **Other ruling:** A procedural exit is also a tail risk, made less likely by the expedited review. (2%)

The sum of these probabilities is 100%.

Tariffs lawful: 2%
Tariffs unlawful: 78%
Mixed ruling: 13%
Other ruling: 2%
No 2025 ruling: 5%
