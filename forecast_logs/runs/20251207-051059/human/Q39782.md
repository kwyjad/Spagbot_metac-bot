### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Longest Field Goal by Season (2015-2024).** In the last decade, the longest field goal in a regular season has typically fallen in the 60-63 yard range. The median longest kick during this period is approximately 61 yards. However, the distribution has a significant right tail, highlighted by Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021. This class suggests a baseline expectation centered around 61-62 yards, with a ~10% chance of exceeding 65 yards in a given season.
*   **Reference Class 2: All-Time Longest Regular Season Field Goals (>63 yards).** Historically, kicks of 64+ yards are exceptionally rare events. Prior to the hypothetical 2025 season, only two such kicks had ever been made (Matt Prater, 64 yards in 2013; Justin Tucker, 66 yards in 2021). This reference class treats any kick in this range as a black swan event, with a base rate of occurring roughly once every 5-10 seasons.
*   **Limitations:** Both reference classes are drawn from a period before the 2025 "K-ball" rule change. The rapid improvement in kicking talent and coaching aggressiveness in recent years (2021-2024) suggests that even the most recent data may understate current probabilities for extreme-length field goals.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-09** Cam Little kicks a 70-yard field goal in a preseason game. — ↑ — Establishes a new, albeit unofficial, benchmark for plausible maximum distance and demonstrates the potential impact of the new K-ball rule and elite leg strength.
*   **2025-09-08 to 2025-10-01** (Weeks 1-4) Two field goals of 64 and 65 yards are made. — ↑ — Indicates that the conditions for exceptionally long kicks are not isolated to a single player or situation; suggests a systemic environmental shift.
*   **2025-09-22** (approx. Week 3) Cam Little sets the official NFL regular-season record with a 68-yard field goal. — ↑ (large) — This is the most crucial development. It sets the current mark to beat at 68 yards, fundamentally changing the question from "how long will the longest kick be?" to "will anyone break the new 68-yard record?"

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **K-Ball Rule Change (Large):** The new rule allowing teams to practice with and "break in" kicking balls all week is the primary new mechanism. Softer, more pliable footballs are known to travel farther when kicked. This is a structural change affecting all 32 teams.
*   **Kicker Talent & Specialization (Large):** A new generation of kickers is entering the league with unprecedented leg strength, a result of year-round specialization from a young age. Players like Cam Little and others represent a potential step-change in human capability for this skill.
*   **Favorable Environmental Conditions (Moderate):** Altitude (e.g., Denver), warm weather, enclosed domes, and strong tailwinds remain critical situational factors. A record attempt requires a confluence of an elite kicker and at least one of these environmental enhancers.
*   **Game Situation & Coaching Philosophy (Moderate):** The vast majority of record-length attempts occur at the end of a half or game, where a low-probability attempt is the only option. The increasing league-wide accuracy on 50+ yard kicks has made coaches more willing to attempt FGs from what was previously considered "no man's land."
*   **Data-Driven Analytics (Small):** Teams increasingly use analytics to model the probability of success for long field goals based on kicker, weather, and field conditions, potentially encouraging attempts in optimal, high-leverage situations.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **A New Record Already Exists:** The current 2025 season's longest kick (68 yards) has already surpassed the all-time record from the start of the year (66 yards). The baseline for this specific season is already an extreme outlier compared to the historical reference class.
*   **The "K-Ball" Rule Is a Regime Change:** Unlike incremental improvements in training, this rule is a discrete, league-wide change to equipment preparation that did not exist in the reference class period. Its effect appears to be concentrated on maximum distance rather than overall accuracy.
*   **Demonstrated 70-Yard Capability:** Little's 70-yard preseason kick provides concrete proof of concept that the previously understood limits of placekicking are being breached. This reduces the uncertainty around whether such a kick is physically possible in a game setting.
*   **High Frequency of Extreme Kicks:** Having three kicks of 64+ yards (64, 65, 68) occur within the first part of a single season is unprecedented and strongly suggests the impact of a new systemic factor (the K-ball rule).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A distribution for the season's longest FG based on 2015-2024 data, centered around 62 yards with a long tail extending to a plausible maximum of 67 yards (equivalent n ≈ 10 seasons).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The new K-ball rule fundamentally alters the physics of the ball, shifting the entire distribution of potential maximum distances to the right.
    *   (↑ Large) The 68-yard kick already made sets a hard floor for the final result and provides powerful evidence of the magnitude of the K-ball/talent effect. The posterior must have zero mass below 68 yards.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The 70-yard preseason kick and other 64+ yard kicks provide corroborating evidence, increasing confidence that the 68-yarder was not a complete fluke and that an even longer kick is plausible.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior distribution should be dramatically shifted to the right. The prior is effectively obsolete. The new distribution should be concentrated on 68 yards, with a significant probability mass on 69, 70, and possibly 71 yards, reflecting the chance of the new record being broken in the season's final weeks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Games played by elite strong-legged kickers (e.g., Cam Little, Wil Lutz, Brandon Aubrey) in Denver or in a dome.
    *   Aforementioned teams facing end-of-half or end-of-game situations from their own 45-50 yard line.
    *   Weather reports indicating strong, steady tailwinds for games involving kickers with demonstrated range.
    *   Media reports or coach interviews discussing a willingness to attempt a record-breaking kick if the situation arises.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The current record of 68 yards remains unchallenged through Week 17.
    *   Key strong-legged kickers suffer injuries.
    *   Games in favorable locations (Denver, domes) are played in conservative fashion, with no end-of-half desperation attempts.
    *   Widespread cold or wintry weather across the league in late December, which makes the ball harder and shortens kick distance.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Limited Opportunities:** With the season dated December 7, 2025, there are only ~4 weeks of regular season games remaining. This drastically reduces the sample size of potential game situations for a record attempt.
*   **Extremely High Bar:** A 68-yard field goal is already an immense achievement. Surpassing it requires a near-perfect confluence of kicker strength, technique, adrenaline, and environmental conditions. The high bar makes 68 the most probable outcome.
*   **Risk Aversion:** A missed 69-yard attempt gives the opponent excellent field position. In a close game with playoff implications, a coach may opt for a Hail Mary pass instead of a record FG attempt, even if the distance is technically possible.
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution is for the *regular season* only. Any potential longer kicks in the playoffs are irrelevant.

**Final Research Summary:** The 2025 season's longest field goal is already a record 68 yards, driven by a new rule change and elite talent. While this 68-yard mark is the most likely final outcome given the few weeks remaining, the same factors that produced it create a non-trivial probability of it being broken by a 69+ yard kick in a perfect situation.

To forecast the longest field goal of the 2025 NFL season, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Longest field goal by season (2015-2024), with a median around 61-62 yards and a significant right tail. Historically, a ~10% chance of exceeding 65 yards.
   - **Reference Class 2:** All-time longest regular season field goals (>63 yards), with such events being rare, occurring roughly once every 5-10 seasons.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** A distribution centered around 62 yards, with a long tail extending to 67 yards, reflecting historical data.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The base case reflects historical performance, with a focus on extreme outliers.
   - **Differences:** The 2025 season has already seen a 68-yard field goal, surpassing previous records, and the K-ball rule change is a significant factor not present in the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **K-Ball Rule Change:** Increases likelihood of longer kicks due to better ball preparation.
   - **68-Yard Record:** Sets a new benchmark, indicating a shift in the distribution towards longer distances.
   - **70-Yard Preseason Kick:** Demonstrates potential for even longer kicks, supporting the possibility of a new record.
   - **Multiple 64+ Yard Kicks:** Suggests systemic changes, increasing the likelihood of longer kicks.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 62 yards with a tail to 67 yards.
   - **Likelihood:** Strong evidence from the 68-yard kick and K-ball rule shifts the distribution rightward.
   - **Posterior:** Concentrated around 68 yards, with significant probability mass on 69-71 yards.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the limited opportunities and high bar for breaking the 68-yard record.
   - **Tail Risks:** A perfect confluence of factors could lead to a 69+ yard kick.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** The 68-yard kick remains the longest, given the high bar and limited remaining opportunities.
   - **Adjustment:** Ensure the distribution reflects the possibility of no further record-breaking kicks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian update, the percentiles reflect a high likelihood of the 68-yard kick being the longest, with some chance of a longer kick.

P10: 68  
P20: 68  
P40: 68  
P60: 69  
P80: 70  
P90: 71

# Forecast: Longest Field Goal of the 2025 NFL Season

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use two reference classes:
- **Historical longest field goals per season (2015-2024)**: The median longest kick during this period was approximately 61 yards, with Justin Tucker's 66-yard record in 2021 representing the extreme.
- **All-time longest field goals**: Before 2025, only two kicks over 63 yards had been made in regular season history (Prater's 64 in 2013 and Tucker's 66 in 2021).

However, the most critical information is that **a 68-yard field goal has already been made in the 2025 regular season by Cam Little**. This immediately sets our floor at 68 yards.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- The physical limitations of human kicking ability still apply
- Environmental factors (altitude, wind, temperature) remain important
- Game situations dictating when long attempts are viable remain similar

**Key differences:**
- The "K-ball" rule change allowing teams to practice with and break in kicking balls all week is a fundamental change to equipment preparation
- Cam Little has already demonstrated 70-yard capability in preseason
- The 2025 season has already seen three kicks of 64+ yards in the first four weeks (including the 68-yarder)
- Only ~4 weeks of regular season remain as of December 7, 2025, limiting opportunities

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher values:**
- **K-ball rule change**: Strong evidence (LR ≈ 5:1) favoring longer kicks, as softer balls travel farther
- **Cam Little's 70-yard preseason kick**: Strong evidence (LR ≈ 3:1) that 70+ yards is physically possible
- **Three 64+ yard kicks already in 2025**: Strong evidence (LR ≈ 4:1) of a systemic shift in maximum distances

**Evidence for lower values:**
- **Limited remaining games**: Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 2:1) against a new record, as fewer opportunities remain
- **68 yards is already exceptional**: Moderate evidence (LR ≈ 2:1) that the current record will stand, as breaking it requires perfect conditions

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered around 61-62 yards with a tail extending to 67 yards, I must dramatically update given the evidence:

1. First update: The 68-yard kick already made shifts the entire distribution, setting a hard floor at 68 yards
2. Second update: The K-ball rule and demonstrated 70-yard capability in preseason extends the plausible range to 70-71 yards
3. Third update: Limited remaining games reduces the probability of exceeding 68 yards

The posterior distribution is now:
- Centered at 68 yards (the current record)
- With significant probability mass at 69-70 yards
- Small but non-negligible probability at 71+ yards
- Zero probability below 68 yards

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be overestimating the impact of the K-ball rule if the early-season long kicks were primarily due to random chance
- I could be underestimating the likelihood of perfect conditions occurring in the remaining games
- The 70-yard preseason kick might not translate to regular season capability due to different pressure and game situations

**Alternative forecast:**
A more conservative view would place higher probability on 68 yards (90%+) with minimal chance of improvement. However, this ignores the demonstrated capability and the clear trend of multiple long kicks already this season.

**Tail risks:**
- Extremely favorable conditions (Denver + strong tailwind + dome) could enable a 72+ yard kick
- All remaining games could feature unfavorable weather, preventing any further record attempts

## 6. Final Percentiles

After careful consideration of the evidence and remaining uncertainty, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 69
P80: 70
P90: 71

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is the longest field goal made in each NFL regular season. Looking at the last decade (2015-2024), the longest field goal has typically been between 60 and 63 yards. The median for this period is approximately 61 yards. This distribution is right-skewed, with an exceptional data point being Justin Tucker's 66-yard NFL record in 2021. A prior based on this data would suggest a mean around 62 yards with a small but non-zero probability of reaching 66-67 yards in any given season.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2025 season is fundamentally different from the historical reference class, rendering the base rate almost obsolete.
*   **Similarity:** The fundamental mechanics of kicking, game situations (end of half/game), and favorable environmental conditions (altitude, domes, wind) that enable long kicks are still the same.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Rule Change:** The new "K-ball" rule, allowing teams to prepare kicking balls all week, is a structural change that did not exist in the base rate period. This is believed to increase the travel distance of the ball, shifting the entire distribution of possible kick lengths to the right.
    2.  **Record Already Broken:** The most critical difference is that the all-time record has already been broken *this season*, with Cam Little's 68-yard field goal. This sets a hard floor for the final value. The forecast is no longer about the distribution of longest kicks in a season, but about the conditional probability of this new 68-yard record being surpassed in the remaining weeks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several pieces of evidence dramatically update the prior distribution.
*   **Cam Little's 68-yard FG (Very Strong Upward Evidence):** This is the single most important fact. It sets the current value at 68 yards. The final answer cannot be lower. This forces the posterior distribution to have zero mass below 68.
*   **Multiple 64+ Yard FGs in Weeks 1-4 (Strong Upward Evidence):** The fact that two other kicks of 64 and 65 yards were made early in the season indicates the 68-yarder was not a complete fluke. It suggests a systemic shift (likely the K-ball rule) has made such distances more attainable for multiple kickers.
*   **Cam Little's 70-yard Preseason FG (Moderate Upward Evidence):** This serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating that a 70-yard kick is within the realm of physical possibility under game-like conditions. It provides a plausible anchor for a new record if one were to be set.
*   **Limited Time Remaining (Strong Downward Pressure):** The forecast is being made on December 7, 2025. There are only about four weeks left in the regular season. This drastically reduces the number of opportunities for another record-breaking attempt, significantly increasing the likelihood that the 68-yard kick will stand as the season's longest.
*   **Late-Season Weather (Moderate Downward Pressure):** Games in December and January are often played in colder weather, which makes the football harder and reduces kicking distance. This works against the possibility of a new record.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered around 62 yards, with a tail extending to ~67.
*   **Likelihood Application:** The evidence from the 2025 season (the K-ball rule and the flurry of 64+ yard kicks, culminating in the 68-yarder) is so strong that it completely overwhelms the prior. The prior is discarded in favor of a new posterior conditioned on the current record.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior is now a discrete distribution with a floor of 68 yards. The central question becomes: What is the probability of a 69+ yard kick in the final ~4 weeks?
    *   The factors enabling the 68-yarder are still present (talent, K-balls).
    *   However, the limiting factors (few remaining opportunities, cold weather, coaching conservatism in high-stakes games) are significant.
    *   I estimate the probability that the record is broken again to be approximately 25%.
    *   This leads to a probability distribution like: P(longest=68) ≈ 75%; P(longest=69) ≈ 15%; P(longest=70) ≈ 7%; P(longest≥71) ≈ 3%.
    *   The mode and median of the posterior distribution are both 68 yards.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Potential Blind Spot:** Am I underestimating the impact of the K-ball rule? Perhaps the 70-yard preseason kick is the true signal, and a 69 or 70-yarder is highly probable if a top kicker gets any reasonable opportunity, even in cold weather. This would shift the distribution right, making 69 the median.
*   **Counterargument/Rebuttal:** The confluence of factors needed for a record is extreme: a specific game situation (end of half/game), a coach willing to risk the field position on a miss, a kicker with elite leg strength, and favorable (or at least not terrible) conditions. The limited number of games remaining makes the probability of all these aligning again quite low. The arguments for the record holding at 68 (time, weather, coaching) seem more compelling than the potential for an even more extreme outcome. Therefore, I will maintain a high probability (≈75%) that 68 remains the longest.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at 68 yards, with a small tail for longer kicks.
*   P(X=68) ≈ 0.75
*   P(X=69) ≈ 0.15 (Cumulative P(X≤69) ≈ 0.90)
*   P(X=70) ≈ 0.07 (Cumulative P(X≤70) ≈ 0.97)
This structure dictates the percentiles. The value remains 68 until we pass the 75th percentile. The 80th and 90th percentiles fall into the range where the outcome is 69.

P10: 68
P20: 68
P40: 68
P60: 68
P80: 69
P90: 69
