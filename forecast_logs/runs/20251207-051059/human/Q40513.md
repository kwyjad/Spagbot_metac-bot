### Reference class & base rates
- **1. Post-Election / Lame-Duck Appropriations Cycles (Divided Government):** In years with divided government, especially following a midterm or presidential election, appropriations are often delayed and contentious. Finalizing spending typically requires a "lame-duck" session after the November election. In these scenarios, it is common for most or all bills to be bundled into a large omnibus package passed in late December, or for Congress to pass a series of Continuing Resolutions (CRs) pushing the fight into the new year. The base rate for passing *individual* bills (outside of a package) in December is very low. The base rate for passing a major package *before* Christmas is perhaps 50%, but this is usually driven by a desire to avoid a holiday shutdown, a deadline that does not exist here.
- **2. Appropriations Cycles Following a Government Shutdown:** Shutdowns signal significant political dysfunction and partisan disagreement. In the aftermath, the focus is typically on ending the immediate crisis, often via a CR. The subsequent negotiations to complete the full-year appropriations are protracted. For example, after the 2018-2019 shutdown, the final deal was not signed until mid-February 2019. The base rate of passing additional, non-emergency appropriations bills in the immediate month following the end of a major shutdown (before the next CR deadline) is near zero.
- **3. Appropriations Cycles with a Non-December CR Deadline:** When Congress passes a CR that extends funding into the new year (e.g., late January or February), it explicitly removes the pressure to complete work before the holiday recess. The action-forcing deadline becomes the CR expiration date. In these cases, the base rate for enacting any of the remaining appropriations bills in December is extremely low. The legislative calendar is dominated by the desire to adjourn for the holidays.

**Derived Base Rate:** Combining these classes, the situation is a post-shutdown environment with a CR deadline in late January. The historical base rate for enacting any of the *remaining, more controversial* appropriations bills before January 1 is very low, likely **0**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-11-08] CR passed, ending shutdown — ↓ — The CR funds the government until Jan 30, 2026, removing any fiscal cliff or action-forcing deadline before the end of the calendar year.
- [2025-11-08] Three FY26 bills enacted — ↓ — Congress passed the three least controversial bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA). This clears the easy work, leaving only the nine most contentious bills for future negotiation.
- [2025-10-01] FY2026 begins; government shuts down — ↓ — The failure to pass any bills by the deadline, leading to the longest shutdown in history, indicates extreme partisan gridlock and makes future compromise more difficult.
- [2025-08-01] Senate passes MilCon-VA bill — (neutral) — Bipartisan passage of one of the "easy" bills over the summer showed normal process was possible, but this momentum was lost leading into the shutdown.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Congressional Calendar & Holiday Recess:** Congress is scheduled to be in session for very few days in December. The powerful incentive for members to return to their districts for the holidays makes substantive, complex legislative work highly unlikely. (Large driver ↓)
- **CR Deadline in Late January:** The primary action-forcing mechanism for appropriations is a funding deadline. With the current CR not expiring until January 30, 2026, there is no credible threat of a shutdown to force a deal before December 31. (Large driver ↓)
- **Contentiousness of Remaining Bills:** The three enacted bills are typically the most bipartisan. The remaining nine include the most politically charged bills, such as Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, and Homeland Security, which contain major disagreements on policy riders and spending levels. (Large driver ↓)
- **Negotiating Strategy (Omnibus vs. Minibus):** The remaining nine bills will almost certainly be negotiated as a single package (omnibus) or a few smaller packages (minibuses). Assembling such a package is a complex and time-consuming process, making a December completion date unrealistic. (Moderate driver ↓)
- **Post-Shutdown Political Environment:** The recent month-long shutdown has likely hardened partisan positions and eroded trust, making the compromises needed to pass the remaining bills more difficult to achieve. (Moderate driver ↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **"Easy" Bills Already Enacted:** Unlike many historical instances where all 12 bills are unresolved, here the three least controversial have been "peeled off" and passed. This concentrates all remaining political friction into the outstanding bills, making the next step much harder than average.
- **Extreme Length of Preceding Shutdown:** The background states this was the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This suggests the level of political disagreement is exceptionally high, exceeding that of previous reference class examples.
- **Lack of a "Forcing" Event in December:** In many lame-duck sessions, the end of the calendar year coincides with the end of a Congress or a CR deadline. Here, the only deadline is the arbitrary end of the calendar year, which has no procedural weight compared to the Jan 30 CR expiration.
- **Clear Path to Deferral:** The passage of the CR through late January was a deliberate choice to postpone the difficult negotiations until after the holidays. This signals a clear, mutually agreed-upon intent from leadership to not resolve the remaining bills in 2025.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with a prior centered on **0 additional bills** (for a total of 3), with a high degree of confidence (equivalent n of ~10-15), based on the reference class of post-shutdown appropriations with a CR extending into the new year.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - The CR deadline of Jan 30, 2026 is a **large (↓)** piece of evidence, as it removes all urgency for a December deal.
    - The impending holiday recess is a **large (↓)** piece of evidence, as it severely constrains legislative time and motivation.
    - The fact that the 9 remaining bills are the most contentious ones is a **large (↓)** piece of evidence against quick resolution.
    - The extreme bitterness from the historic shutdown is a **moderate (↓)** piece of evidence, suggesting compromise is less likely.
- **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior should be very heavily concentrated on **0 additional bills being enacted**, for a final resolved number of 3.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - House and Senate leadership announce a surprise "Christmas miracle" framework for the remaining 9 bills.
    - Key committee chairs and ranking members issue joint statements of significant progress.
    - The congressional holiday recess is postponed or cancelled to continue negotiations.
    - Credible media reports of a tentative deal on a "minibus" containing 2-3 of the remaining bills.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Leadership announces the legislative schedule for the remainder of December with no mention of appropriations votes.
    - Partisan press conferences blaming the other side for the lack of progress on the remaining bills.
    - Key appropriators state that work will resume "in the new year."
    - Congress adjourns for the holiday recess on schedule.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **"Christmas Miracle" Deal:** While highly improbable, congressional leaders could theoretically strike a sudden, unexpected deal to clear the decks before the new year. The probability is low but not zero.
- **Leadership Intentions:** The strategic calculations of the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader are not fully public. A hidden political incentive could exist to force a deal, though no such incentive is apparent.
- **Definition of "Enacted":** The resolution criteria are clear (enacted as full-year regular appropriations). This avoids ambiguity around further CRs. The key is that both chambers must pass the exact same text and the President must sign it before Jan 1, 2026.
- **Potential for a "Clean" Bill:** It's conceivable one of the less-controversial remaining bills (e.g., Energy and Water Development) could be passed "clean" without policy riders, but this is unlikely without a broader agreement.

**Final Research Summary:** The combination of a non-imminent CR deadline, the impending holiday recess, and the highly contentious nature of the nine remaining bills makes it extremely unlikely that any further appropriations will be enacted before 2026. The three bills passed in November are almost certain to be the final total for the 2025 calendar year.

To produce a probabilistic forecast for the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from historical appropriations cycles following a government shutdown with a CR extending into the new year. The base rate for enacting additional bills in such a scenario is very low, likely 0, due to the lack of urgency and the contentious nature of the remaining bills.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation aligns with the base case: a post-shutdown environment with a CR deadline in late January. The differences include the extreme length of the preceding shutdown and the fact that the least controversial bills have already been enacted, leaving the most contentious ones.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The CR deadline of January 30, 2026, and the impending holiday recess are strong pieces of evidence against additional bills being enacted in December.
   - The contentiousness of the remaining bills and the hardened partisan positions post-shutdown further decrease the likelihood of additional enactments.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 0 additional bills, the evidence strongly supports this position. The posterior distribution remains heavily concentrated on 0 additional bills being enacted before 2026.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of a "Christmas miracle" deal or hidden political incentives is necessary, but these scenarios are deemed highly improbable. The forecast remains robust against these low-probability events.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the overwhelming evidence and historical context, the forecast is heavily skewed towards 0 additional bills being enacted. The percentiles reflect this concentration.

P10: 0  
P20: 0  
P40: 0  
P60: 0  
P80: 0  
P90: 1

# Forecasting How Many FY 2026 Appropriations Bills Will Be Enacted Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the base rate of appropriations bills passed after a major government shutdown but before the end of the calendar year.

The most relevant reference class is post-shutdown appropriations cycles with a CR extending into the next calendar year. In such scenarios, the historical pattern shows that after the initial bills passed to end the shutdown (typically the least controversial ones), additional bills rarely pass before the new year unless there's an imminent deadline.

Based on the background information, 3 bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-VA) along with a CR extending through January 30, 2026. The prior distribution for additional bills being enacted before January 1, 2026 is heavily concentrated at 0, with a small probability of 1-2 more bills.

Prior mean: 0 additional bills (3 total)
Prior spread: 0-2 additional bills, with ~90% probability on 0

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We have a divided government situation with significant partisan tensions
- A CR has been passed extending funding into the next year (January 30, 2026)
- The "easy" bills have already been enacted, leaving only the more contentious ones
- There is no forcing mechanism (like a funding cliff) before the end of the year

**Differences from base rate:**
- This shutdown was described as "the longest federal government shutdown in US history," suggesting even deeper partisan divides than typical
- The CR extends well into January (Jan 30), removing any pressure to act in December
- Three bills have already been enacted, which is actually more progress than is typical immediately after a shutdown
- The remaining nine bills are specifically the most contentious ones, making them harder to pass than a random subset

These differences generally strengthen the case for 0 additional bills being passed before 2026.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pointing to lower numbers:**
- The CR extending to January 30, 2026 removes any deadline pressure before the new year (strong downward pressure, ~5:1 likelihood ratio favoring 0)
- Congress typically has limited session days in December due to the holiday recess (moderate downward pressure, ~3:1 likelihood ratio favoring 0-1)
- The remaining bills are the most contentious ones, as the "easy" bills were already enacted (strong downward pressure, ~4:1 likelihood ratio favoring 0)
- The historic length of the shutdown indicates extreme partisan gridlock (moderate downward pressure, ~2:1 likelihood ratio favoring 0-1)

**Evidence pointing to higher numbers:**
- Three bills have already been enacted, showing some capacity for agreement (weak upward pressure, ~1.2:1 likelihood ratio favoring 1-2 over 0)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered on 0 additional bills, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. First update - CR deadline: The January 30 deadline strongly favors 0 additional bills
   - Prior: ~80% on 0, 15% on 1, 5% on 2+
   - Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 favoring 0
   - Posterior: ~95% on 0, 4% on 1, 1% on 2+

2. Second update - Most contentious bills remain: This further strengthens the case for 0
   - Prior: ~95% on 0, 4% on 1, 1% on 2+
   - Likelihood ratio: ~4:1 favoring 0
   - Posterior: ~98% on 0, 1.5% on 1, 0.5% on 2+

3. Third update - Holiday recess constraints: This reinforces the low probability
   - Prior: ~98% on 0, 1.5% on 1, 0.5% on 2+
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring 0
   - Posterior: ~99% on 0, 0.8% on 1, 0.2% on 2+

The posterior distribution is now heavily concentrated on 0 additional bills being enacted before January 1, 2026, meaning the total would remain at 3 bills.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a "Christmas miracle" deal where leadership decides to clear the decks before the new year
- There could be specific bills among the remaining nine that are less contentious and could be broken out individually
- I may be overweighting the importance of the CR deadline and underweighting other political incentives

**Alternative scenario:**
The most plausible alternative is that congressional leadership decides to pass 1-2 additional bills before the holiday recess to show progress. The Defense bill is sometimes prioritized separately, and Energy & Water is often less contentious.

However, even considering this scenario, the evidence for 0 additional bills remains overwhelming:
- The lack of a forcing mechanism before January
- The clear signal sent by passing a CR into late January
- The historical pattern of post-shutdown legislative inactivity
- The limited December legislative calendar

After this consideration, I'll slightly adjust my distribution to account for a small possibility of 1-2 additional bills.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given that 3 bills have already been enacted, and we're forecasting how many of the 12 total bills will be enacted before 2026, my percentiles represent the total number of bills (not additional ones):

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class for this forecast is **U.S. appropriations cycles that follow a government shutdown and involve a Continuing Resolution (CR) that pushes the funding deadline into the next calendar year.**

*   **Rationale:** This reference class captures the two most critical structural elements of the current situation. First, a preceding shutdown indicates a high level of partisan acrimony and difficulty in reaching agreements. Second, a CR with a deadline in late January (like the one in the scenario) deliberately removes the pre-holiday "fiscal cliff" that would otherwise force action in December. In these situations, Congress has historically shown a strong preference to adjourn for the holidays and postpone difficult negotiations until the new deadline approaches.
*   **Distribution:** Based on this reference class, the base rate for enacting *additional* (i.e., beyond those already passed) regular appropriations bills in December is extremely low. The overwhelming historical precedent is for zero additional bills to be passed under these conditions. Therefore, my prior distribution is sharply peaked at the current number of enacted bills, which is **3**. The mean and median of this prior are both 3, with very little variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is not just similar to the base case; it is an extreme example of it, with several factors suggesting an even lower probability of action than the historical average.

*   **Similarities:** Like past instances, a funding deadline has been punted past the new year, and Congress is approaching a holiday recess.
*   **Differences (that reinforce the base rate):**
    1.  **Historic Shutdown Length:** The background states this was the "longest federal government shutdown in US history." This implies that the level of partisan disagreement is exceptionally high, making compromise even less likely than in typical post-shutdown scenarios.
    2.  **Contentiousness of Remaining Bills:** The three bills already enacted (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are typically the least controversial. This means the nine remaining bills are the most difficult ones (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security), concentrating all the political conflict into the final package. This makes a quick resolution much harder.
    3.  **Clear Intent to Delay:** Passing a CR through January 30 was a deliberate strategic choice by leadership in both parties to postpone the fight. This signals a mutual understanding that no deal was imminent and that work would resume in 2026.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

All major pieces of evidence strongly suggest that the final number of bills enacted in 2025 will remain at 3.

*   **CR Deadline (Jan 30, 2026):** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It removes any credible, action-forcing deadline before December 31. This makes the outcome of "0 additional bills" (total of 3) vastly more likely than any other outcome. (Strong downward pressure on passing more bills).
*   **Congressional Calendar:** It is early December. There are very few legislative days remaining before the holiday recess. The incentive for members of Congress to remain in Washington to negotiate complex and contentious bills, rather than return to their districts, is virtually non-existent. (Strong downward pressure).
*   **Nature of Remaining Bills:** As noted, the nine remaining bills contain the most significant disagreements on spending levels and policy riders. Assembling a compromise on these bills is a multi-week (if not multi-month) process, not something that can be accomplished in the few remaining legislative days. (Strong downward pressure).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A very strong prior centered at 3 enacted bills, based on the historical reference class. Let's model this as P(Total=3) ≈ 90%.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence (Jan 30 CR deadline, holiday calendar, contentious bills) is highly consistent with legislative inaction and thus with the outcome of 3 bills. The evidence is highly inconsistent with a sudden burst of productivity to pass more bills. The likelihood ratio P(Evidence | Total=3) / P(Evidence | Total>3) is very high.
*   **Posterior:** Applying the evidence to the prior confirms and strengthens the initial assessment. The posterior distribution remains very sharply peaked at 3. The probability mass for any outcome greater than 3 is very small, existing only to account for highly improbable "Christmas miracle" scenarios. The posterior mean is slightly above 3, but the median and mode remain firmly at 3.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Main Risk to Forecast:** The primary risk is a "Christmas Miracle" scenario where congressional leaders and the White House unexpectedly strike a grand bargain on the remaining nine bills to clear the legislative slate before the new year. This could be driven by a desire to project an image of functionality after the damaging shutdown or to avoid another funding fight early in an election year.
*   **Plausibility:** This scenario is highly improbable. The structural incentives (no deadline, holiday recess) and the political environment (extreme bitterness post-shutdown) are aligned against it. The path of least resistance for all parties is to wait until January.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Minibus):** A slightly more plausible, but still unlikely, scenario is that a deal is reached on a small "minibus" of 2-3 of the next-least-controversial bills. This would be a minor "win" without resolving the biggest fights.
*   **Adjustment:** My initial posterior is perhaps overconfident in placing >95% probability on exactly 3. To account for these low-probability but high-impact "miracle" scenarios, I will assign a small amount of probability mass to higher outcomes. I estimate an 85% chance of no further action (total=3), a 5% chance of a small minibus deal (total≈6), and a 10% chance of a full omnibus deal (total=12). This creates a long right tail. Based on this, my P10 through P80 will be 3, but the P90 will capture the minibus scenario.
