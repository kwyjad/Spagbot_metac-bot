### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Iran-IAEA negotiations over contested access (2002-present):** Iran has a long history of treating IAEA access as a bargaining chip, not an obligation. Agreements are typically the result of protracted negotiations, often lasting months or years, and are tied to broader geopolitical deals (e.g., the JCPOA). The base rate for Iran making a sudden, unilateral concession on access, especially after being attacked, is very low, likely **<10%** within any given 30-day period of contention.
2.  **Post-conflict nuclear inspection agreements:** In cases where a country's nuclear program has been militarily targeted (e.g., Iraq's Osirak reactor in 1981, Syria's Al Kibar facility in 2007), the targeted nation has typically responded with defiance and denial rather than immediate cooperation. Full cooperation often only comes after regime change (e.g., Iraq post-2003, Libya 2003). The base rate for a regime allowing inspections of a bombed site within six months, without major external coercion or incentives, is extremely low, estimated at **<5%**.
3.  **Major diplomatic reversals on short notice:** States can and do make rapid policy shifts in response to overwhelming pressure or a "golden bridge" offer. However, these are rare events. Given the current context, this class is less applicable but suggests a non-zero probability. A ballpark rate for such a reversal in a high-stakes national security standoff is perhaps **5-15%**.

*Limitations:* The current scenario is unique due to the direct, overt US bombing of core Iranian nuclear sites, making historical analogues imperfect. The short timeframe (25 days) significantly constrains the potential for complex diplomatic maneuvering.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-06-24:** Iran's parliament overwhelmingly votes to suspend IAEA cooperation. **↓** — Signals a unified, hardline domestic political consensus against inspections, making a reversal difficult.
*   **2025-09-03:** IAEA report confirms Iran's increased enrichment prior to the strike. **↓** — Reinforces the international community's desire for access, but also highlights what Iran wants to conceal, increasing its resistance.
*   **2025-09-09:** Iran and IAEA announce a deal to resume inspections. **↑** — Demonstrates that a deal is technically and politically possible, even in the post-war environment.
*   **2025-10-20:** Iran scraps the September inspection deal. **↓↓** — A very strong negative signal. It indicates that either the initial deal was a feint or that internal hardliners have veto power and are willing to use it. Rebuilding trust from this point is extremely difficult.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Iranian Domestic Politics (Hardliner Dominance):** The war and US bombing likely consolidated the power of hardline factions who view cooperation as capitulation. Allowing inspections could be framed as a national humiliation. **(Large driver towards NO)**
2.  **Need for Sanctions Relief/Humanitarian Aid:** Iran's economy and infrastructure are likely damaged post-war. The regime may trade access for significant economic or humanitarian concessions, which could be framed domestically as a victory. **(Moderate driver towards YES)**
3.  **Strategic Ambiguity:** By denying access, Iran maintains uncertainty about the status of its 400kg of 60% enriched uranium. Is it secure? Damaged? Dispersed? This ambiguity is a form of leverage and deterrence. **(Large driver towards NO)**
4.  **International (P5+1) Cohesion and Pressure:** A unified international front offering a clear "access-for-relief" package could create a powerful incentive. Conversely, any division (e.g., by Russia or China) would reduce pressure on Tehran. **(Moderate driver towards YES)**
5.  **Technical/Logistical Reality at the Sites:** The sites are heavily damaged. Iran may be physically unable to provide safe access or may use the damage as a pretext to delay indefinitely while they sanitize or move materials. **(Moderate driver towards NO)**
6.  **Supreme Leader's Decision:** Ultimately, the decision rests with Ayatollah Khamenei. A strategic calculation that a short-term deal is necessary to buy time, rebuild, and de-escalate could override hardline objections. **(Potentially large driver, but direction is uncertain)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Direct US Military Strike:** Unlike previous standoffs over sanctions or covert action, this follows a direct, overt, and destructive US attack. This dramatically raises the political stakes of "capitulation" for the Iranian regime.
*   **Known Stockpile in a Compromised Location:** The IAEA has a specific estimate of a significant quantity of highly enriched uranium located in bombed-out facilities. This creates a unique and urgent proliferation risk that differs from disputes over access to undeclared sites.
*   **Recent Failed Agreement:** The September deal and its October collapse is a fresh wound. It's highly unusual to attempt to renegotiate the exact same access deal just two months after the previous one was publicly voided by one party.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The 25-day window to resolution is exceptionally tight for this type of negotiation, which typically takes months. A "Yes" would require a pre-existing backchannel or a sudden, dramatic policy shift.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior based on the reference class of Iran-IAEA disputes, where quick concessions are rare. A prior of **~15%** with an equivalent n of ~20 seems reasonable, reflecting a fairly strong belief based on past behavior.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The US bombing and subsequent hardline consolidation create a political environment hostile to cooperation.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The public scrapping of the October deal demonstrates bad faith or internal veto power, making a new deal in 25 days highly improbable.
    *   **↓ (Small):** The short timeframe severely limits the possibility of the complex diplomacy usually required to broker such an agreement.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The September deal proves an agreement is *possible* in principle, but its failure is more significant than its brief existence.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points downward. The posterior probability should be significantly lower than the prior, likely moving into the very low single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (YES):**
    *   Unscheduled, high-level meetings between Iranian and E3/US officials in a neutral location (e.g., Oman, Geneva).
    *   Reports of a major humanitarian aid or financial relief package being prepared by Western powers, explicitly linked to IAEA access.
    *   A speech by the Supreme Leader or President of Iran using language of "pragmatism," "national interest," or "de-escalation."
    *   Sudden softening of anti-Western rhetoric in Iranian state media.
*   **DOWN indicators (NO):**
    *   Public statements from Iranian officials (e.g., Foreign Minister, head of AEOI) reiterating that cooperation is suspended indefinitely.
    *   Satellite imagery or intelligence reports suggesting activity at the bombed sites (e.g., debris removal, attempts to move containers) without IAEA presence.
    *   Continuation of the status quo; no high-level diplomatic contact.
    *   New domestic legislation in Iran adding further conditions or prohibitions on IAEA cooperation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves on an "announcement of an agreement," not the inspection itself. A symbolic, non-binding announcement is more plausible than a fully detailed technical agreement.
*   **Opacity of Iranian Regime:** Decision-making is highly centralized and opaque. A sudden reversal based on the Supreme Leader's calculus is always possible and difficult to predict from the outside.
*   **Backchannel Diplomacy:** A deal could be negotiated in secret and announced suddenly, making it appear as if no progress was being made until the last minute.
*   **Physical State of Sites:** The actual condition of the uranium stockpile is unknown. If it has been destroyed, contaminated, or moved, the entire premise of the inspection changes, and Iran has no incentive to allow access.
*   **Deception:** Iran could announce a deal with no intention of following through, simply to buy time or achieve a short-term diplomatic goal, which would still resolve this question as "Yes."

**Final Research Summary:**
Given the extremely short timeframe, the recent public collapse of a similar deal, and a post-war political climate in Iran that frames cooperation as capitulation, the probability of a new inspection agreement being announced before 2026 is very low. A "Yes" outcome would require a sudden and dramatic strategic reversal by Iran's leadership, likely prompted by a major, currently unseen incentive.

To forecast the probability of Iran allowing the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for Iran making a sudden, unilateral concession on IAEA access, especially after being attacked, is very low. Historical data on Iran-IAEA negotiations and post-conflict nuclear inspection agreements suggest a base rate of less than 10% for such events occurring within a short timeframe. Given the context of a recent military conflict and the suspension of cooperation, a prior probability of **5%** seems reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with historical patterns where Iran uses IAEA access as a bargaining chip, and post-conflict scenarios where targeted nations resist inspections.
- **Differences:** The direct US military strike and the known stockpile in compromised locations create a unique urgency and risk, but also increase Iran's resistance to inspections.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Iran's suspension of cooperation (June 2025):** Strongly decreases probability. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **September 2025 deal announcement:** Slightly increases probability. Likelihood ratio slightly greater than 1.
- **October 2025 deal collapse:** Strongly decreases probability. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **Short timeframe (25 days):** Decreases probability. Likelihood ratio less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 5% (odds of 0.05/0.95 ≈ 0.0526), the evidence largely points towards a decrease in probability:
- **Suspension of cooperation and deal collapse:** Strong negative evidence, reducing odds significantly.
- **September deal:** Minor positive evidence, but outweighed by negative factors.

Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (combined effect of evidence)
Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability is likely to be very low, around 1-2%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden diplomatic breakthrough or backchannel negotiations.
- **Alternative scenarios:** A major incentive or geopolitical shift could prompt a reversal.
- **Rebuttals:** The recent collapse of a deal and hardliner dominance make such scenarios unlikely.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final calibrated probability of Iran allowing IAEA inspections before 2026 is **2%**.

Final: 2%

# Will Iran allow the IAEA to inspect its stockpile of enriched uranium before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on Iran's historical behavior regarding IAEA inspections, particularly following military actions against its nuclear facilities.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- Iran's past compliance with IAEA inspection requests during periods of high tension
- Countries' willingness to allow nuclear inspections after military strikes on their facilities
- Iran's specific pattern of using IAEA access as a bargaining chip

Based on the research report, Iran has a long history of treating IAEA access as a negotiating tool rather than an obligation. The base rate for Iran making unilateral concessions on access, especially after being attacked, is very low (<10% within any 30-day period). For countries whose nuclear facilities have been militarily targeted, the base rate for allowing inspections within six months without major incentives is estimated at <5%.

Given that we have about 25 days until the end of 2025, and considering Iran's recent actions (particularly scrapping the September inspection deal in October), I'll set a prior of **8%** - low, but not impossible.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Iran continues its pattern of using IAEA access as a bargaining chip
- The Iranian parliament has shown unified opposition to inspections
- The timeline follows Iran's typical pattern of prolonged negotiations

**Key differences:**
- The severity of the attack (direct US bombing with bunker-busters) is unprecedented
- The extremely short timeframe (25 days) is much tighter than typical negotiation periods
- A deal was reached in September but scrapped in October, showing unusual volatility
- The known stockpile of 400kg of 60% enriched uranium creates unique urgency

These differences generally make cooperation less likely than the base rate would suggest, particularly the recent scrapping of a similar deal and the extremely short timeframe remaining.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Iran's parliament voted overwhelmingly to suspend IAEA cooperation**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this vote would be somewhat unlikely (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this vote would be very likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (strong evidence against inspections)

**Evidence 2: Iran and IAEA announced a deal in September 2025**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, a previous agreement is quite likely (~0.7)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, a previous agreement is moderately likely (~0.4)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.4 = 1.75 (moderate evidence for inspections)

**Evidence 3: Iran scrapped the inspection deal in October 2025**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, scrapping a previous deal is unlikely (~0.2)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, scrapping a previous deal is very likely (~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25 (strong evidence against inspections)

**Evidence 4: The extremely short timeframe (25 days)**
- P(E|H): If Iran will allow inspections, this short timeframe makes it difficult (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Iran won't allow inspections, this short timeframe makes that outcome likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (strong evidence against inspections)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 8% (odds of 0.087):

First update (parliamentary vote):
- Prior odds: 0.087
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.087 × 0.33 = 0.029
- Posterior probability: 0.029/(1+0.029) = 2.8%

Second update (September deal):
- Prior odds: 0.029
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75
- Posterior odds: 0.029 × 1.75 = 0.051
- Posterior probability: 0.051/(1+0.051) = 4.9%

Third update (deal scrapped in October):
- Prior odds: 0.051
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.051 × 0.25 = 0.013
- Posterior probability: 0.013/(1+0.013) = 1.3%

Fourth update (short timeframe):
- Prior odds: 0.013
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.013 × 0.33 = 0.004
- Posterior probability: 0.004/(1+0.004) = 0.4%

This extremely low probability (0.4%) seems too confident given the inherent uncertainties. Let me reconsider.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Backchannel diplomacy**: Secret negotiations could be happening that would result in a sudden announcement.

2. **Desperate economic situation**: Iran might be under severe economic pressure after the war, making them more willing to compromise for sanctions relief.

3. **Overweighting recent events**: I may be giving too much weight to the October deal collapse.

4. **Symbolic vs. substantive agreement**: The question resolves on an announcement, not actual inspections. Iran could announce a deal with no intention of following through.

5. **Supreme Leader's calculus**: Decision-making is highly centralized and the Supreme Leader could make a sudden strategic reversal.

Given these considerations, my probability of 0.4% is likely too low. While the evidence strongly points against an agreement, the opacity of Iranian decision-making and the possibility of backchannel diplomacy suggest I should adjust upward.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, I believe there is a very low but non-negligible chance that Iran will announce an agreement to allow IAEA inspections before 2026. The strongest factors against this are the recent scrapping of a similar deal, the extremely short timeframe, and the political difficulty for the regime to appear to capitulate after being bombed.

However, I must account for the possibility of unseen diplomatic efforts and Iran's history of surprising policy shifts. I'll adjust my final probability to 3%.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the history of Iran-IAEA negotiations over contested nuclear access, particularly during periods of high tension. These negotiations are consistently protracted, with Iran treating access as a strategic bargaining chip rather than a simple obligation. The research report notes that the base rate for Iran making a sudden concession on access within a 30-day period of contention is low, likely below 10%. A second reference class, post-conflict nuclear inspection agreements (e.g., Iraq, Syria), shows that defiance is the norm and cooperation is extremely rare without major political shifts like regime change. This suggests an even lower base rate.

Given these factors, a conservative prior probability P(H) of **10%** is appropriate. This reflects the inherent difficulty and rarity of achieving a rapid breakthrough in nuclear negotiations with Iran. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:9 in favor of no agreement.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical base case in several critical ways that make an agreement *less* likely:

*   **Direct Military Attack:** Unlike standoffs driven by sanctions or covert actions, this follows a direct and destructive US military strike on Iran's primary nuclear sites. This dramatically increases the domestic political cost for the Iranian regime to be seen as "capitulating" to Western demands, making cooperation a matter of national honor and defiance.
*   **Recent Public Failure:** Iran publicly announced and then, just six weeks later, publicly scrapped a nearly identical agreement (Sept 9 deal, cancelled Oct 20). This recent failure indicates that the political obstacles that killed the first deal are likely still in place and that the trust required to broker a new deal in such a short time is virtually non-existent.
*   **Extremely Short Timeframe:** The question resolves in ~25 days. This is an exceptionally short window for the complex, high-stakes diplomacy required to overcome the current impasse.

The one factor that makes an agreement slightly *more* plausible than in some past cases is the low bar for resolution: an "announcement of an agreement," which could be symbolic or deceptive, is easier to achieve than a fully implemented inspection.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the key evidence:

*   **Evidence 1: The US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025.**
    *   This evidence is far more likely if Iran refuses to cooperate (P(E|~H) is high) than if it agrees (P(E|H) is low). Defiance is a natural response to being attacked; cooperation can be framed as surrender.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This evidence significantly decreases the probability of an agreement.

*   **Evidence 2: Iran's public cancellation of the previous inspection deal on October 20, 2025.**
    *   This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It is highly consistent with continued non-cooperation (~H). It is very inconsistent with reaching a new, stable agreement just two months later (H). Why would the political calculus that led to the cancellation suddenly reverse?
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly less than 1. This evidence massively decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The resolution criteria is an "announcement," not a completed inspection.**
    *   This lowers the bar for a "Yes" outcome. Iran could make a tactical, non-binding announcement to buy time or achieve a short-term diplomatic goal. This makes a "Yes" resolution more plausible than it would otherwise be.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This evidence slightly increases the probability relative to a stricter resolution criterion.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We begin with a prior probability of 10% (odds of 1:9).

1.  **Initial Prior:** 10% (Odds 1:9)
2.  **Update with Evidence (US bombing & scrapped deal):** The combined weight of these two pieces of evidence is immense. They suggest that the political environment in Tehran is fundamentally opposed to a deal. A conservative estimate for the combined likelihood ratio of this evidence would be around 1/10, meaning these facts are 10 times more likely if no deal is reached.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = (1/9) × (1/10) = 1/90.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 90) ≈ 1.1%.

3.  **Update with Counter-Evidence (low resolution bar):** The fact that only an "announcement" is needed offers a path to a "Yes" through a deceptive or symbolic agreement. This might make a "Yes" outcome, say, 2-3 times more likely than it would be otherwise.
    *   Final Odds = (1/90) × 3 = 3/90 = 1/30.
    *   Final Probability = 1 / (1 + 30) ≈ 3.2%.

This structured update moves the probability from a low 10% to a very low ~3%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome, and the primary way this forecast could be wrong, is a sudden, secret "grand bargain." The post-war situation in Iran might be far more desperate than is publicly known. The regime, facing a severe crisis, could trade a symbolic announcement of IAEA cooperation for a massive, life-saving package of sanctions relief or humanitarian aid. This decision would be made by the Supreme Leader, overriding hardline objections, and would be invisible to outside observers until it was announced. The recent failed deal could even be interpreted as a hardliner attempt to block a deal the leadership wanted, a fight the leadership has since won. While this scenario is plausible given the opacity of the regime, it is a low-probability tail risk. The default assumption must be that the public signals of defiance and the recent deal-breaking reflect the true political reality.

### Final Forecast
The probability of Iran announcing an IAEA inspection agreement before 2026 is extremely low. The political humiliation from the recent US military strike, combined with the fresh memory of Iran itself scrapping a similar deal in October, creates a formidable barrier to any new agreement. The extremely short timeframe further reduces the chances of a diplomatic breakthrough. The only plausible path to a "Yes" is a sudden, pragmatic reversal by Iran's top leadership driven by severe, non-public pressures, likely resulting in a symbolic announcement. This possibility, while remote, prevents the probability from being near zero.
