### Reference class & base rates
1.  **U.S. Animal Health-Related Import Suspensions:** The U.S. frequently uses temporary import bans to manage animal disease risks (e.g., Avian Influenza, Foot-and-Mouth Disease, BSE). These bans vary widely in duration. Short-term bans over procedural issues or localized, quickly-contained outbreaks can last weeks to a few months. Major disease outbreaks (e.g., BSE in Canada/UK) can lead to bans lasting years or even decades. Given this ban has already lasted ~7 months, it has moved out of the "short-term procedural" class. A ballpark base rate for a disease-related ban being lifted within 9 months might be **20-30%**.
2.  **Previous New World Screwworm (NWS) Incidents:** NWS has been eradicated from the U.S. and Mexico, but a permanent sterile fly barrier is maintained at the Panama-Colombia border. Occasional re-introductions north of the barrier are treated as serious emergencies. Historical responses to NWS detections in previously free areas (e.g., Florida Keys 2016) involve rapid, intense quarantine and eradication efforts lasting several months. The 2016 Florida outbreak was declared eradicated after ~6 months. This suggests that once containment is verified, restrictions can be lifted relatively quickly. The base rate for resolving an NWS-related quarantine/trade restriction within 9 months appears higher, perhaps **50-60%**.
3.  **Major U.S.-Mexico Agri-Trade Disputes:** Disputes between the U.S. and Mexico over agricultural trade (e.g., avocados, tomatoes, sugar) are common. They are often driven by a mix of legitimate sanitary concerns and underlying economic protectionism. Resolution typically involves high-level political negotiation and can be unpredictable, but the immense economic stakes often force a resolution within 6-18 months. This class suggests a resolution is likely, but the timing is uncertain.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-04** USDA Secretary states she is "pleased with Mexico's efforts" and that "every day...we get a little bit closer." — ↑ — Positive diplomatic signal, but lacks a concrete timeline, suggesting progress is being made but the finish line isn't imminent.
*   **2025-07-09** U.S. re-imposes suspension after a brief reopening. — ↓ — Demonstrates USDA's extremely low tolerance for risk and that a single negative data point can completely reset the clock. This makes a new reopening decision fragile.
*   **2025-07-07** U.S. briefly reopens border to Mexican livestock. — ↑ — Shows that a mechanism for reopening exists and there was, at one point, sufficient confidence on the U.S. side to proceed.
*   **2025-05-11** U.S. initially suspends imports of live cattle from Mexico. — ↓ — The precipitating event, starting the clock on a complex technical and political process for reversal.
*   **2025-04-26** USDA Secretary threatens port closures if Mexico doesn't cooperate on NWS eradication efforts. — (neutral) — Provides context that U.S. posture was aggressive even before the outbreak, indicating high-level political sensitivity to the issue.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Epidemiological Verification:** (Large) The single most important driver. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) must be convinced that Mexico has contained the outbreak and that surveillance is adequate to detect new cases. This is a technical, not political, judgment.
2.  **Bureaucratic Inertia & Holiday Slowdown:** (Large) The timeline for resolution is less than 25 days and includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Government agency work, especially non-emergency actions, typically slows dramatically. This is a major obstacle to a pre-2026 resolution.
3.  **Economic Pressure:** (Moderate) The U.S. cattle industry, particularly feedlots in the Southern Plains, relies on feeder cattle from Mexico. The halt creates significant supply chain disruptions and financial losses. Mexican ranchers have lost their primary export market. This creates powerful lobbying pressure on both sides for a swift resolution.
4.  **Political & Diplomatic Capital:** (Moderate) The relationship between USDA Secretary Rollins and her Mexican counterpart is crucial. The positive statements in November suggest a constructive relationship, but lifting the ban requires a significant expenditure of political trust, especially after the July false start.
5.  **Success of Eradication Efforts:** (Moderate) The effectiveness of Mexico's response, particularly the deployment of the sterile insect technique and enhanced surveillance, directly impacts the epidemiological data APHIS needs to see. Progress here is a prerequisite for any discussion of reopening.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Existing Binational Infrastructure:** Unlike a new disease outbreak, the U.S. and Mexico have a long-standing joint commission for screwworm eradication (COMEXA). This provides established channels for communication, data sharing, and coordinated response, which should accelerate resolution compared to a typical SPS ban.
*   **The Failed Reopening:** The July 7-9 reopening and immediate re-closure is a significant deviation. It indicates that the U.S. is not only cautious but has been "burned" once, likely raising the evidentiary bar for any subsequent reopening to an exceptionally high level.
*   **Extreme Time Compression:** The question resolves in under one month, during a major holiday period. Most reference class cases for disease-related bans play out over many months or years, not a few weeks. This makes bureaucratic friction a much larger factor than usual.
*   **High Economic Interdependence:** The scale of the U.S.-Mexico live cattle trade (over 1 million head annually) is massive. The economic pain is acute and immediate, creating more intense pressure for a solution than in cases involving less integrated markets.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the NWS reference class (base rate ~50-60% for resolution within 9 months), and given we are already at month 7, a neutral prior of **~40%** seems plausible. This acknowledges the existing cooperative framework but also the duration to date.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓) **Extreme Time Constraint & Holidays:** The 25-day window is the most powerful piece of evidence against. Bureaucracies do not move this fast in December.
    *   (↓) **The July "False Start":** This event likely created institutional scarring at USDA/APHIS, increasing risk aversion and the burden of proof on Mexico.
    *   (↑) **Positive Diplomatic Tone (Nov 4):** Secretary Rollins' comments are a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for reopening. It keeps the possibility alive.
    *   (↑) **Intense Economic Pressure:** Constant, powerful lobbying from U.S. and Mexican industry provides a strong incentive to find a solution quickly.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly favors a downward update. The procedural and timeline-based obstacles are concrete and severe, while the positive signals are largely rhetorical at this stage. The posterior should move **significantly down** from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a high-level meeting between USDA/APHIS and Mexican (SADER/SENASICA) officials.
    *   A joint technical briefing from COMEXA declaring a specific region "provisionally free" of NWS.
    *   USDA/APHIS publishing a Federal Register notice proposing a rule change to lift the suspension.
    *   Statements from U.S. cattle industry groups (e.g., NCBA) expressing confidence in Mexico's control measures.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Continued silence from USDA and SADER through mid-December.
    *   Reports of any new NWS cases detected in northern Mexico.
    *   Statements from U.S. officials emphasizing the need for "continued vigilance" or "more work to be done."
    *   Diversion of Mexican cattle exports to other markets (if any exist), suggesting they expect a long-term ban.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The key data on NWS surveillance and containment in Mexico is not public. We are relying on the public statements of officials, which can be political.
*   **"Reopen" Definition:** The resolution requires imports to be "permitted to resume." This could be a partial reopening (e.g., from specific certified NWS-free zones) which would still count as "Yes." A full border-wide reopening is not required.
*   **Black Swan Risk:** A new, unrelated animal disease outbreak in Mexico would make reopening impossible and is an unforecastable risk.
*   **Political Override:** While the decision is ostensibly technical, a last-minute political decision from the White House or Secretary's office could override the standard APHIS process, though this is unlikely.
*   **Data Lag:** News of a reopening might not be widely reported on the day it happens. The official decision could be made in late December but only become public knowledge in early January.

**Final Research Summary:**
The immense economic and political pressure to reopen the border is battling an extremely short, holiday-interrupted timeline and a risk-averse USDA. While the underlying disease situation may be improving, the bureaucratic and procedural hurdles to lifting the ban in the next 25 days are formidable, making a "No" resolution more likely.

To forecast the probability of the United States reopening cattle imports from Mexico before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for resolving an NWS-related quarantine/trade restriction within 9 months is estimated at 50-60%. Given that we are already at month 7, a neutral prior of around 40% seems plausible. This accounts for the existing cooperative framework between the U.S. and Mexico but also acknowledges the duration of the ban so far.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a disease-related import suspension, similar to past cases where bans were lifted after containment was verified.
   - Differences: The current situation is complicated by the failed reopening in July, which likely increased the evidentiary bar for reopening. Additionally, the timeline is extremely compressed due to the upcoming holidays, which is atypical for such cases.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Extreme Time Constraint & Holidays**: The short timeline and holiday period make it unlikely for bureaucratic processes to move quickly. This is a strong piece of evidence against reopening, decreasing the probability.
   - **The July "False Start"**: The re-imposition of the ban after a brief reopening indicates a high level of caution and risk aversion, further decreasing the probability.
   - **Positive Diplomatic Tone (Nov 4)**: While the USDA Secretary's positive comments are encouraging, they lack a concrete timeline, providing only a slight increase in probability.
   - **Intense Economic Pressure**: The economic impact on both U.S. and Mexican cattle industries creates pressure for a resolution, slightly increasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 40%, the evidence strongly favors a downward update due to the procedural and timeline-based obstacles. The positive signals are largely rhetorical and do not outweigh the significant challenges.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted downward significantly.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the potential for a last-minute political decision to override technical processes. However, this is deemed unlikely given the USDA's risk-averse stance.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a higher probability if there were indications of a rapid bureaucratic process or a political intervention, but current evidence does not support this.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final forecast reflects a significant decrease from the prior probability due to the formidable procedural and timeline challenges.

Final: 15%

# Will the United States reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to estimate the probability that the US will reopen cattle imports from Mexico in the next 25 days (by December 31, 2025).

The most relevant reference class is previous US animal health-related import suspensions, particularly those involving New World Screwworm (NWS). Looking at the research report:

- NWS-related quarantines have historically been resolved within ~6 months (like the 2016 Florida Keys outbreak)
- The current ban has already been in place for ~7 months (since May 11, 2025)
- There was a brief reopening in July that was quickly reversed after another NWS case

Given that this ban has lasted longer than typical NWS quarantines but shorter than major disease outbreaks (which can last years), and considering we're already 7 months in, I'll start with a prior of **40%** that the ban will be lifted before 2026.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The underlying issue is a legitimate animal health concern (NWS)
- There's significant economic pressure to resolve the situation
- There's an established binational infrastructure (COMEXA) for addressing screwworm issues
- The USDA Secretary has made positive statements about Mexico's containment efforts

**Key differences:**
- Extremely compressed timeline: Only 25 days remain until 2026, including major holidays
- The failed July reopening creates additional caution from US authorities
- The holiday period (Christmas/New Year's) will significantly slow bureaucratic processes
- The ban has already lasted longer than typical NWS quarantines

These differences, particularly the compressed timeline during the holiday season, significantly reduce the likelihood of resolution compared to the base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: USDA Secretary's November 4 statement**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted soon, it's very likely (~90%) the Secretary would make positive statements
- P(E|~H): Even if the ban won't be lifted soon, the Secretary might still make positive diplomatic statements (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 90/60 = 1.5
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Failed July reopening and immediate re-closure**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted by December 31, it's somewhat unlikely (~30%) we would have seen a failed reopening
- P(E|~H): If the ban won't be lifted by December 31, a failed reopening is more likely (~70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 30/70 = 0.43
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Extremely short timeline with holiday period**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted by December 31, it's very unlikely (~15%) we would be facing such a compressed timeline during holidays
- P(E|~H): If the ban won't be lifted by December 31, this timeline constraint is very likely (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 15/90 = 0.17
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Economic pressure from both countries**
- P(E|H): If the ban will be lifted soon, we would expect strong economic pressure (95%)
- P(E|~H): Even if the ban won't be lifted soon, we would still expect economic pressure (85%)
- Likelihood ratio: 95/85 = 1.12
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 40% (odds of 0.67:1), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on timeline/holiday constraint:**
- Prior odds: 0.67:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.17
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 0.17 = 0.11
- Posterior probability: 0.11/(1+0.11) = 10%

**Update on failed July reopening:**
- Prior odds: 0.11:1
- Likelihood ratio: 0.43
- Posterior odds: 0.11 × 0.43 = 0.047
- Posterior probability: 0.047/(1+0.047) = 4.5%

**Update on Secretary's positive statements:**
- Prior odds: 0.047:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- Posterior odds: 0.047 × 1.5 = 0.071
- Posterior probability: 0.071/(1+0.071) = 6.6%

**Update on economic pressure:**
- Prior odds: 0.071:1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.12
- Posterior odds: 0.071 × 1.12 = 0.079
- Posterior probability: 0.079/(1+0.079) = 7.3%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 7%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

- I may be overestimating the impact of the holiday period. High-priority trade issues might still be processed.
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a partial reopening (e.g., from specific NWS-free zones), which would still count as "Yes."
- There could be unpublicized progress in Mexico's containment efforts that would enable a faster resolution.
- Political pressure might override normal bureaucratic timelines.

However, I also need to consider:
- The failed July reopening likely created institutional caution that would make USDA require overwhelming evidence before trying again.
- The research report indicates no concrete timeline has been announced as of November 4.
- The question requires official permission to resume imports, not just an announcement of future reopening.

After considering these factors, I believe my estimate of 7% may be slightly too low. I'll adjust it upward slightly to account for the possibility of political intervention or a partial reopening.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I forecast a 10% probability that the United States will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026.

Final: 10%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the resolution time for trade restrictions related to New World Screwworm (NWS) outbreaks. The research report notes that a 2016 NWS outbreak in Florida was declared eradicated in about 6 months. This suggests that once containment is technically verified, restrictions can be lifted relatively quickly. This specific ban has been in place since May 11, 2025, for approximately 7 months. Given that a 6-9 month resolution timeframe is plausible based on this reference class, we are currently in the "hot zone" where a resolution might be expected. Therefore, a neutral starting point, absent other evidence, is that there is a significant chance of resolution in the near term.

I will set the prior probability P(H) at **50%**. This reflects a coin-flip chance that the resolution would occur in the next month (i.e., before the 8-month mark), assuming this case is typical for an NWS-related restriction nearing its expected resolution time. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   The issue is a technically-driven animal health concern (NWS), which has established eradication protocols.
*   The U.S. has a strong incentive to resolve the issue to protect its own livestock industry.

**Differences:**
*   **Failed Reopening:** The most significant difference is the attempted reopening on July 7, followed by an immediate re-imposition of the ban on July 9. This event likely broke trust, increased the level of caution at the USDA, and raised the evidentiary bar for any future reopening to an exceptionally high level.
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The question resolves in 24 days (from Dec 7 to Dec 31). This is a very short window for bureaucratic and regulatory processes to conclude.
*   **Holiday Period:** This 24-day window is bisected by the Christmas and New Year's holidays, a period during which government agency work, especially non-emergency actions, typically slows dramatically.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their effect on the prior.

*   **Evidence 1: The 24-day, holiday-season timeline.**
    *   This is strong evidence against reopening. It is highly improbable that the necessary technical reviews, risk assessments, and official rule-making (e.g., a Federal Register notice) can be completed in such a short period, especially during the holidays.
    *   P(E | H) is low; P(E | ~H) is high.
    *   The likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1. This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The failed reopening in July.**
    *   This "institutional scar" makes the USDA highly risk-averse. They will demand an overwhelming amount of evidence from Mexico that the problem is solved, likely including a sustained period of negative surveillance results. This makes a quick decision less likely.
    *   P(E | H) is lower than it would be without this event; P(E | ~H) is higher.
    *   The likelihood ratio is less than 1. This evidence **strongly decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Positive diplomatic statements and economic pressure.**
    *   The USDA Secretary's positive tone on Nov 4 ("pleased with Mexico's efforts") and the immense economic pressure from both U.S. and Mexican industries are forces pushing for a resolution. These factors create the political will to overcome bureaucratic hurdles.
    *   P(E | H) is high (this pressure is likely what would cause a rapid resolution); P(E | ~H) is also reasonably high (the pressure exists regardless, and diplomatic language can be used to smooth things over even if a solution is far off).
    *   The likelihood ratio is greater than 1, but not extremely so. This evidence **moderately increases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the prior odds of 1:1 (50% probability).

1.  **Initial Prior:** 1:1 odds.
2.  **Update for Failed Reopening:** This event makes a quick resolution much harder. I'll estimate this makes a pre-2026 resolution about 3 times less likely (Likelihood Ratio ≈ 0.33).
    *   Posterior odds = 1:1 × 0.33 = 0.33:1 ≈ 1:3.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1+3) = 25%.
3.  **Update for Timeline/Holidays:** This is another major obstacle. I'll estimate this also makes a resolution about 3 times less likely (LR ≈ 0.33).
    *   Posterior odds = 1:3 × 0.33 = 0.33:3 ≈ 1:9.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1+10) = 10%.
4.  **Update for Positive Factors (Pressure/Diplomacy):** These forces are pushing hard in the other direction. They might make a resolution 3 times *more* likely than it would be otherwise (LR ≈ 3.0).
    *   Posterior odds = 1:9 × 3.0 = 3:9 = 1:3.
    *   Final probability = 1 / (1+3) = 25%.

The posterior probability settles around 25%, indicating that while a resolution is possible due to strong political and economic drivers, it is unlikely given the procedural and timeline constraints.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if I am underestimating the power of political will and economic necessity. A plausible alternative scenario is that the technical work is already complete, and officials are simply waiting for a politically opportune moment before the end of the year to make an announcement. This could be framed as a "Christmas gift" to the struggling cattle industry.

Furthermore, the resolution does not require a full reopening. A "Yes" could be triggered by a partial reopening, for example, allowing imports from specific northern Mexican states certified as NWS-free. This is a lower bar to clear and could be achieved more quickly.

However, the arguments against a pre-2026 reopening are very concrete. The USDA's primary mandate is to protect U.S. agriculture, and after the July false start, its institutional bias will be heavily skewed toward caution. Rushing a decision before the holidays for political or economic reasons, only to be wrong again, would be a major institutional failure. Therefore, the most likely path is to wait for more data and make a decision in the new year. My 25% forecast accounts for the possibility of a political override or a partial reopening but weights the procedural hurdles more heavily.

### 6. Final Forecast
The forecast balances the strong economic and political pressure for reopening against the formidable obstacles of a very short, holiday-interrupted timeline and a highly risk-averse USDA. The failed reopening in July significantly raised the bar for the evidence required, making a rapid decision unlikely. While a politically-driven or partial reopening before year-end is possible, it is improbable.

Final: 25%
