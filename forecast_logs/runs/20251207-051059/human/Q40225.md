### Reference class & base rates
*   **Planned Capital City Relocations:** Countries occasionally move their capitals (e.g., Brazil to Brasília, Kazakhstan to Astana, Myanmar to Naypyidaw). This process is typically a multi-decade project focused on relocating government functions and civil servants, not a rapid, mass evacuation of the general population from the former capital. The base rate for a capital relocation triggering a forced evacuation of >100,000 residents from the old capital within a single year is effectively **0%**.
*   **Large-Scale, Non-Acute Disaster Evacuations:** Governments sometimes order evacuations for slow-moving environmental or industrial reasons. Examples include relocations for dam construction (China's Three Gorges Dam) or contamination (Chernobyl). These are exceptionally rare, politically costly, and logistically intensive, often taking years to plan and execute. A base rate for a state ordering a rapid (<1 month) evacuation of its own capital for a chronic environmental issue like drought is extremely low, likely **<1%**.
*   **Pre-emptive Natural Disaster Evacuations:** Evacuations are common ahead of acute, predictable disasters like hurricanes. However, drought and land subsidence are chronic, slow-moving crises. An evacuation is a measure of last resort, not a standard response. The base rate for a major city evacuation due to drought is near zero; most governments resort to extreme rationing and water importation first. This class suggests a base rate of **<1%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-14] President Pezeshkian explicitly links continued drought to a potential evacuation of Tehran, setting a conditional trigger (no rain by Nov 21). (↑) — Dramatically raises the stakes by creating a specific, public ultimatum and tying his credibility to a drastic action.
*   [2025-11-21] The date for Pezeshkian's rain deadline passes. (↑) — The condition for considering more drastic measures (rationing, potential evacuation) has now been met, increasing pressure on the government to act on its warning.
*   [2025-01-07] Government formally states intent to relocate the capital to the Makran coast, citing environmental pressures. (↑) — Moves the long-standing debate from theoretical to official government policy, providing a strategic justification for a potential evacuation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Severity of Water Crisis (Large ↑):** The primary driver. If Tehran's reservoirs are truly nearing depletion with no short-term alternative, the government may be forced into a humanitarian evacuation to prevent catastrophic public health outcomes. This is the most powerful argument for "Yes".
*   **Presidential Credibility (Moderate ↑):** President Pezeshkian has publicly and repeatedly staked his reputation on this issue, culminating in a specific threat. Failure to act after the stated deadline passes could make him appear weak and ineffective.
*   **Logistical & Financial Capacity (Large ↓):** Evacuating, housing, and supporting 100,000 people with less than a month's notice is a monumental undertaking for any state, let alone one under severe economic sanctions. The lack of infrastructure and resources is a primary inhibitor.
*   **Political & Institutional Resistance (Large ↓):** Such a radical and disruptive move would face immense pushback from within the Iranian establishment (e.g., the IRGC, conservative factions), the bureaucracy, and Tehran's powerful economic elite. It risks massive social and political instability.
*   **Supreme Leader's Approval (Decisive ↑/↓):** No decision of this magnitude can be implemented without the explicit backing of the Supreme Leader. His approval would override all other resistance; his opposition or silence would kill the initiative entirely.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Trigger:** Unlike typical capital relocations driven by development or political strategy, this action is framed as an emergency response to an existential environmental threat (water scarcity), justifying a radically compressed timeline.
*   **Method:** The proposal is for a mass *evacuation* of residents, not the typical, gradual *relocation* of government ministries and civil servants seen in the reference class. This is a fundamentally different and more drastic action.
*   **Pace:** The base rate cases involve planning horizons of years or decades. The current scenario posits a decision and an order within weeks, a pace completely at odds with historical precedent for state-led relocations.
*   **Public Commitment:** A head of state has publicly tied a potential evacuation to a specific, near-term condition (lack of rainfall by a certain date), creating a focal point for political pressure that is absent in most historical cases.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The reference classes suggest a very low prior, near 1-2%, reflecting the extreme rarity of such an event. The prior should be strong (high "n") given the powerful structural constraints.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) President Pezeshkian's explicit, conditional threat of evacuation.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The passing of the rain deadline, fulfilling the stated condition.
    *   (↓ Large) The immense, likely insurmountable, logistical and financial barriers to a rapid evacuation.
    *   (↓ Large) The high potential for political backlash and social unrest, creating powerful incentives for inaction.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The availability of less drastic intermediate measures (e.g., severe rationing, emergency water transport) before resorting to evacuation.
*   **Net effect:** The recent rhetoric significantly pulls the probability up from a near-zero baseline, making an improbable event seem plausible. However, the powerful real-world constraints act as a strong ceiling. The posterior should be significantly higher than the prior, but remain firmly in the "unlikely" range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   An official statement of support for the plan from the Supreme Leader's office.
    *   Reports of military/IRGC units being mobilized for logistical support (transport, temporary housing).
    *   State media beginning a public campaign to prepare Tehran residents for an evacuation order.
    *   Announcement of specific relocation zones or designated host cities for evacuees.
    *   Implementation of extreme water rationing (e.g., water available only a few hours per day).
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Government officials begin to "walk back" or soften the President's evacuation rhetoric.
    *   Announcements of major alternative solutions, such as large-scale desalination projects or water pipelines.
    *   Leaked reports of high-level political infighting over the plan's feasibility or wisdom.
    *   A complete lack of observable logistical preparations in the coming weeks.
    *   Significant rainfall over the basins supplying Tehran.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Precision:** The resolution requires an "order" for an evacuation. A "recommendation," a voluntary relocation incentive program, or a symbolic move of a few government offices would not resolve as Yes.
*   **Information Opacity:** Official information from Iran is tightly controlled. Distinguishing genuine preparations from political posturing or propaganda will be difficult.
*   **Scale:** The 100,000-person threshold is crucial. A smaller, more manageable "pilot" evacuation would not meet the criteria.
*   **Logistical Reality vs. Political Decree:** The government could issue an *order* that is logistically impossible to carry out and is largely ignored by the populace. The question resolves on the *order* itself, not its successful implementation.
*   **Internal Power Dynamics:** The analysis assumes Pezeshkian has the agency to drive this. The true decision-maker is the Supreme Leader, whose calculus is opaque.

**Final Research Summary:** The President's escalating rhetoric has made a previously unthinkable evacuation order a plausible scenario, driven by a genuine water crisis. However, the extreme logistical, financial, and political barriers to executing such a plan before 2026 make it highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for a government ordering a rapid evacuation of its capital due to a chronic environmental issue like drought is extremely low, likely less than 1%. This is because such evacuations are rare, politically costly, and logistically challenging. Historical examples of capital relocations or evacuations due to environmental issues are scarce and typically involve long-term planning rather than rapid execution.

**Initial Prior:** 1% (0.01 probability)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The situation involves a chronic environmental issue (water scarcity), similar to other rare cases of large-scale evacuations for environmental reasons.

**Differences:**
- The current scenario involves a public ultimatum by the President, linking the lack of rainfall to a potential evacuation, which is unusual compared to historical cases.
- The urgency and public commitment to a specific timeline (by November 21) are atypical for such decisions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **President's Ultimatum (↑ Large):** The explicit threat of evacuation if conditions are not met increases the likelihood of the event occurring. This is a strong piece of evidence that suggests a higher probability than the base rate.
  - Likelihood Ratio: High, as such public commitments are rare and suggest serious consideration.
  
- **Passing of the Rain Deadline (↑ Moderate):** The deadline for rain has passed, fulfilling the condition set by the President, increasing the pressure to act.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Moderate, as it fulfills the stated condition for considering evacuation.

- **Logistical and Financial Barriers (↓ Large):** The immense challenges in executing such an evacuation within a short timeframe significantly decrease the likelihood.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Low, as these barriers are substantial and historically prevent such actions.

- **Political Resistance (↓ Large):** Potential backlash from political and economic elites in Iran reduces the probability.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Low, as internal resistance is a strong deterrent.

- **Supreme Leader's Approval (Decisive ↑/↓):** The Supreme Leader's stance is crucial. Without his support, the probability is very low.
  - Likelihood Ratio: Unknown, but decisive if known.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Given the prior probability of 1% and the mixed evidence, we adjust the probability upwards due to the President's ultimatum and the passing of the rain deadline, but the increase is tempered by the significant logistical and political barriers.

**Posterior Odds Calculation:**
- Prior Odds = 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 0.0101
- Likelihood Ratio (qualitative estimate): Considering the evidence, let's assume a moderate increase, say a factor of 3.
- Posterior Odds = 0.0101 × 3 ≈ 0.0303
- Posterior Probability = 0.0303 / (1 + 0.0303) ≈ 0.0294 or 2.94%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The probability remains low due to significant barriers, but the President's public commitment cannot be ignored.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** The Supreme Leader's approval could drastically change the probability. If he supports the evacuation, the probability would increase significantly.
- **Rebuttals:** The logistical and political challenges are substantial and historically prevent such actions, supporting a low probability.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering all factors, the probability of Iran announcing an evacuation of Tehran before 2026 is adjusted to reflect the increased likelihood due to recent developments but remains low due to substantial barriers.

Final: 3%

# Will Iran announce an evacuation of Tehran before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify appropriate reference classes:

- **Capital city evacuations due to environmental crises**: Extremely rare historically. No major capital has been evacuated due to drought or subsidence.
- **Large-scale evacuations for slow-moving environmental disasters**: Very rare, typically occurring over years (e.g., Three Gorges Dam in China), not as emergency orders.
- **Government follow-through on evacuation threats**: Governments occasionally make dramatic statements about potential evacuations but rarely follow through with actual orders.

Given these reference classes, I'll set a very low prior probability of **2%**. This reflects the extreme rarity of capital city evacuations for non-acute disasters, while acknowledging that some precedent exists for government-ordered relocations in extreme circumstances.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Environmental threats to cities are common globally
- Governments frequently discuss relocations but rarely implement them
- The logistical challenges of moving large populations remain enormous

**Key differences:**
- The Iranian President has explicitly tied evacuation to a specific trigger condition (no rain by November 21, 2025)
- The trigger condition has now been met (as of the scenario date)
- Tehran faces a genuine water crisis that threatens basic habitability
- The government has already formally announced intent to relocate the capital
- The timeframe is extremely compressed (less than a month until resolution)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's explicit evacuation threat**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If an evacuation is ordered, it would likely be preceded by exactly this kind of public warning
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Political rhetoric often exceeds actual policy implementation
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: The rain deadline has passed**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - An evacuation order would likely follow the trigger condition
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - The deadline passing doesn't necessarily force action
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Formal government statement on capital relocation**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - An evacuation would align with this longer-term goal
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Many countries announce relocations without evacuations
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Logistical and financial constraints**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - An evacuation would need to overcome these constraints
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - These constraints typically prevent such actions
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.22 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 5: Political resistance and stability concerns**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - An evacuation would need to overcome political opposition
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Political resistance typically blocks such dramatic actions
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38 (significantly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2:98 (or 0.0204:1)

First update (President's threat):
- Prior odds × LR = 0.0204 × 3.0 = 0.0612
- New probability = 0.0612/(1+0.0612) ≈ 5.8%

Second update (rain deadline passing):
- Prior odds × LR = 0.0612 × 1.14 = 0.0698
- New probability = 0.0698/(1+0.0698) ≈ 6.5%

Third update (formal relocation statement):
- Prior odds × LR = 0.0698 × 2.0 = 0.1396
- New probability = 0.1396/(1+0.1396) ≈ 12.2%

Fourth update (logistical constraints):
- Prior odds × LR = 0.1396 × 0.22 = 0.0307
- New probability = 0.0307/(1+0.0307) ≈ 3.0%

Fifth update (political resistance):
- Prior odds × LR = 0.0307 × 0.38 = 0.0117
- New probability = 0.0117/(1+0.0117) ≈ 1.2%

However, this seems too low given the explicit threat and deadline. The evidence of the President's statement and the passing deadline should carry more weight in this specific context. Adjusting the likelihood ratios to reflect this:

- President's threat: LR = 4.0 (instead of 3.0)
- Rain deadline passing: LR = 1.5 (instead of 1.14)

Recalculating:
- Prior odds = 0.0204
- After President's threat: 0.0204 × 4.0 = 0.0816
- After rain deadline: 0.0816 × 1.5 = 0.1224
- After formal statement: 0.1224 × 2.0 = 0.2448
- After logistical constraints: 0.2448 × 0.22 = 0.0539
- After political resistance: 0.0539 × 0.38 = 0.0205

Final posterior probability = 0.0205/(1+0.0205) ≈ 2.0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the severity of Tehran's water crisis. If the situation is truly catastrophic, the government might have no choice but to act.
- I might be overestimating the rationality of decision-making. Political factors could drive an evacuation order even if implementation is impossible.
- The Supreme Leader's position is unknown and could override all other considerations.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The government might announce a "phased evacuation" that technically meets the criteria but is designed to be implemented over years.
- A limited evacuation of specific neighborhoods might be ordered as a symbolic gesture.
- External factors (e.g., unexpected rainfall) could render the threat moot.

**Best alternative forecast:**
A stronger case for a higher probability (10-15%) would emphasize:
- The President has publicly committed to action after a specific deadline
- The water crisis may be more severe than publicly acknowledged
- The government might issue an order knowing it cannot be fully implemented
- The resolution criteria only require an order, not successful implementation

Rebuttal: While these points have merit, they don't overcome the fundamental logistical impossibility of evacuating millions of people in weeks, nor the political suicide such an order would represent.

After this consideration, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of a symbolic or limited evacuation order that technically meets the criteria.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the extremely short timeframe (less than a month until 2026), I assess that an evacuation order for Tehran is highly unlikely but not impossible. The President's explicit threat creates a non-zero probability, but the enormous practical and political barriers make implementation extremely improbable.

Final: 4%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a government-ordered, rapid evacuation of a significant portion of its own capital city's population due to a chronic environmental crisis. I will use the reference class of "Large-Scale, Non-Acute Disaster Evacuations."
-   Historical examples like relocations for dam projects (Three Gorges) or contamination (Chernobyl) are exceptionally rare, planned over years, and politically fraught.
-   Evacuations for chronic issues like drought are virtually unheard of; governments typically resort to extreme rationing and other measures first.
-   The combination of a *capital city*, a *chronic* (not acute) cause, a *rapid* timeline (<1 month), and a *large scale* (100,000 people) makes this an event of extreme rarity.
-   A base rate of **1%** is appropriate, reflecting that such an event is structurally and historically improbable but not strictly impossible. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
-   The situation involves a government grappling with a severe, slow-moving environmental problem, which aligns with the reference class.
-   The immense logistical, financial, and political costs that make the base rate so low are all present and potent in the case of Tehran.

**Differences:**
-   **Public Presidential Commitment:** The most significant difference is that Iran's President has publicly and repeatedly tied his credibility to taking drastic action, including a potential evacuation, and linked it to a specific condition (no rain by Nov 21) that has now been met. This creates a focal point of political pressure that is absent in most historical cases, which are typically debated behind closed doors for years.
-   **Framing as an Acute Emergency:** The rhetoric frames the chronic water crisis as an impending catastrophe, attempting to justify an emergency response that bypasses the normal multi-year planning process. This is a crucial deviation from the "slow-moving" nature of the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that Iran announces the evacuation, and ~H be the alternative.

*   **Evidence 1: President Pezeshkian's explicit, conditional threat of evacuation.**
    *   P(E | H): A government planning such a drastic step would very likely signal its intentions beforehand to prepare the populace and justify the action. This evidence is highly likely if H is true.
    *   P(E | ~H): A government *not* planning an evacuation might still use such threats as a political bluff to spur action on other fronts (e.g., water conservation) or to shift blame for the crisis. However, making such a specific public threat and then failing to act carries a high credibility cost.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** > 1. This evidence strongly **increases** the probability from the base rate.

*   **Evidence 2: The lack of observable, large-scale logistical preparations as of December 7, 2025.**
    *   The timeframe for the order is less than one month away (before Jan 1, 2026). Evacuating 100,000 people requires a massive, visible logistical effort: mobilizing transport, preparing temporary housing, organizing food and water distribution, and launching a public information campaign.
    *   P(E | H): It is extremely unlikely that an evacuation of this scale could be ordered in the next three weeks with no visible preparations underway now. Such an operation cannot be kept secret or launched instantaneously.
    *   P(E | ~H): If no evacuation is planned, it is perfectly normal that no preparations would be visible.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** << 1. This is very strong evidence that **decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with the Prior:** We begin with a 1% probability (1:99 odds) based on the extreme rarity of such an event.
2.  **Update with Political Rhetoric:** The President's statements are a powerful new factor. They make the unthinkable a subject of serious, public discussion. This evidence is strong enough to multiply the prior odds several times over, moving the probability from 1% into the 10-20% range. Let's take an interim probability of 15%. This reflects a situation where an extremely unlikely event has been made plausible by political commitment.
3.  **Update with Lack of Preparations:** Now, we must confront this 15% probability with the reality on the ground. The complete absence of logistical preparations is a powerful counter-signal. It suggests that the rhetoric is not being translated into action. This evidence is strong enough to drastically reduce the updated probability. A reduction of 80-90% seems warranted. Applying an 80% reduction to our 15% interim forecast: 15% * (1 - 0.80) = 3%.

The posterior probability should be significantly lower than the high point suggested by the rhetoric alone, but still higher than the initial base rate, as the political situation remains volatile.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis hinges on the idea that a lack of visible preparation is definitive proof. What if I'm wrong?
-   **Alternative Scenario:** The President could issue the *order* for purely political reasons, knowing it cannot be successfully implemented. The resolution criteria hinge on the *order* itself, not its execution. This would be a way to fulfill his public threat, blame others (hardliners, foreign powers) for the inevitable failure, and still appear decisive. In this scenario, fewer logistical preparations would be needed beforehand.
-   **Counter-argument:** Even a "symbolic" order to evacuate 100,000 people would cause immense panic and chaos. The regime would be unlikely to risk such instability unless it had some plan to manage the fallout, and we see no evidence of even that. However, the possibility of a politically motivated, logistically unsupported order cannot be dismissed entirely.
-   **Adjustment:** This "symbolic order" scenario is the most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution. It forces me to keep the probability higher than the 1-2% suggested by logistical constraints alone. The political pressure on the President is real, and this offers a potential, albeit risky, escape route. I will therefore nudge my forecast slightly higher to account for this possibility.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such an event is extremely low (~1%). The President's aggressive and specific rhetoric has created a unique political situation, significantly increasing the chances of a drastic action. However, the extremely short timeline (less than one month) and the complete lack of observable preparations for such a monumental logistical task provide very strong evidence against the event occurring. The most probable outcome is that the government pursues a less drastic "off-ramp," such as severe water rationing or a symbolic relocation of a single ministry. The small but non-trivial possibility of a politically motivated but logistically unworkable *order* being issued prevents the probability from being near-zero.

Final: 5%
