### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New US unilateral military operations in a non-adversarial nation:** This class includes instances where the US initiates military action (e.g., drone strikes, special forces raids) in a country with which it is not at war and which is a nominal partner. Examples include initial drone strikes in Pakistan (c. 2004) or Yemen (c. 2002). Such events are rare. Over the last 25 years, the US has initiated such operations in fewer than 10 countries. This suggests a low base rate, perhaps **5-10%** for a new operation starting in any given country-year where specific threats are perceived.
2.  **US presidential military threats not acted upon:** US presidents frequently use the threat of military force as a coercive tool without it leading to an actual attack. Examples include threats against North Korea, Iran, and Syria under various administrations. The ratio of explicit public threats to actual new military interventions is high. This reference class suggests that rhetoric, even when specific, does not guarantee action, pulling the base rate down.
3.  **US interventions for humanitarian/Responsibility to Protect (R2P) reasons:** This class includes actions like the intervention in Libya (2011) or Kosovo (1999). These are almost always conducted with a coalition of allies and some form of international legal justification (e.g., UN Security Council resolution). Unilateral R2P-style interventions are exceedingly rare. This suggests a very low base rate for a "guns-a-blazing" style attack, likely **<1%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-01] President Trump orders the DoD to "prepare for possible action" and threatens a military response in Nigeria over the killing of Christians. ↑ — This is the primary driver. A direct presidential order to prepare for action, coupled with a public threat, dramatically increases the likelihood from the baseline.
*   [2025-11-01] Trump explicitly links potential military action to the Nigerian government's failure to protect a specific religious group, framing it as a response to atrocities. ↑ — The specific, values-based rationale provides a strong domestic political justification for his base, making it a more durable and credible threat.
*   [2025-11-05] (Hypothetical) The Nigerian government issues a statement condemning Trump's threat as a violation of its sovereignty and recalls its ambassador from Washington for consultations. ↓ — A strong negative reaction from a key regional power increases the diplomatic and potential military costs of intervention, creating a headwind for US action.
*   [2025-11-15] (Hypothetical) Unnamed Pentagon officials leak to the press that while contingency planning is underway per the order, there is deep skepticism about the wisdom and feasibility of military action, citing risks to US personnel and regional stability. ↓ — Indicates significant institutional friction and resistance within the US government, which can delay, dilute, or derail presidential directives.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Volition & Ideology:** President Trump's demonstrated willingness to bypass traditional foreign policy norms and his focus on the issue of Christian persecution is the primary driver. His personal commitment could override institutional objections. (Size: Large)
2.  **Domestic Political Calculus:** An intervention framed as protecting Christians would be highly popular with Trump's evangelical base, a key constituency. This provides a powerful incentive to act, especially if it can be done with limited costs. (Size: Moderate-to-Large)
3.  **Institutional Drag (Pentagon/State Dept.):** The US national security apparatus would likely view a unilateral attack on a major regional partner as catastrophic for long-term US interests in Africa. They would likely resist, slow-walk planning, and present the President with options highlighting extreme risks and costs. (Size: Large)
4.  **Nigerian Sovereignty & Response:** Nigeria is not a failed state like Somalia or an ungoverned territory. It has a large, professional military and is a cornerstone of West African security. A US attack would be fiercely opposed, potentially leading to the expulsion of US personnel and the end of all security cooperation. (Size: Large)
5.  **Scope of "Attack":** The probability is highly sensitive to the definition. A limited, plausibly deniable drone strike against a terrorist leader is far more likely than a large-scale "guns-a-blazing" operation. The former requires fewer resources and incurs less diplomatic fallout. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Target is a Major Regional Power:** Unlike typical targets of unilateral CT strikes (e.g., Yemen, Somalia, tribal areas of Pakistan), Nigeria is a major economic and military power in Africa and a key partner for regional stability. Attacking it carries far higher geopolitical costs.
*   **The Presidential Actor:** President Trump's decision-making style is less constrained by institutional advice and alliance management concerns than his predecessors. His public, personal threat is a much stronger signal of intent than a typical diplomatic warning.
*   **Explicit R2P-style Rationale:** The justification is explicitly about protecting a religious minority from non-state actors, a rationale the US rarely uses for *unilateral* military force. This differs from typical justifications based on direct threats to US national security (e.g., attacking Al-Qaeda).
*   **Direct Public Order to DoD:** The threat is not a vague "all options are on the table." It is a specific, public directive to the Pentagon to begin preparations, which initiates a formal military planning process and increases the odds of action.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 5%) based on the rarity of the US initiating new, unilateral military operations in a non-adversarial country. The "equivalent n" is low, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Direct, public presidential order to DoD to prepare for action.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Strong domestic political motive (appealing to evangelical base).
    *   ↓ (Large): Significant institutional resistance from Pentagon/State and high geopolitical cost of attacking a regional power like Nigeria.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): Expected strong, negative response from the Nigerian government, complicating any operation.
    *   ↑ (Small): The operational capability to conduct limited strikes (e.g., drones) exists, making a "minimal" resolution possible.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability up from a very low base. The presidential directive is a powerful signal that must be taken seriously. However, the powerful constraints suggest the most likely form of "attack" would be limited. The posterior should be significantly higher than the prior, perhaps in the 25-40% range, reflecting a real possibility tempered by major obstacles.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
**UP indicators:**
*   USAFRICOM posture changes (e.g., movement of ISR assets, special operations forces, or naval assets to the region).
*   State Department issues travel warnings or authorizes departure for non-essential personnel from the US embassy in Abuja.
*   Leaks of specific military options being presented to the President (e.g., drone strike packages, SOF raid plans).
*   President Trump continues to tweet/post about the issue, keeping it at the top of the public agenda.
*   A high-profile atrocity against Christians in Nigeria occurs, creating a "trigger" event.

**DOWN indicators:**
*   High-level US diplomatic engagement with Nigeria (e.g., Secretary of State or Defense visits Abuja).
*   Public statements from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs or Secretary of Defense emphasizing the importance of the US-Nigeria partnership.
*   Prominent members of Congress (especially from the President's party) publicly question the wisdom of military action.
*   The Nigerian military announces a major new offensive against the groups responsible for the violence, providing an "off-ramp."
*   The story fades from the President's public rhetoric, replaced by other priorities.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Ambiguity of "Military Attack":** The resolution criteria is broad. A single drone strike against an ISWAP leader would resolve this "Yes," and is far more plausible than a major ground operation. The forecast is highly sensitive to this definition.
*   **Trump's Unpredictability:** The primary driver is a single individual known for both impulsive action and theatrical bluffs. He may be using the threat purely for leverage or could genuinely intend to act.
*   **Black Swans:** A major terror attack on US interests emanating from the region, or the death/capture of a high-profile American in Nigeria, could dramatically and instantly alter the calculus in favor of intervention.
*   **Internal Administration Dynamics:** The actual influence of key advisors (SecDef, SecState, NSA) is unknown. Their ability to constrain or enable the President's directive is a critical but unobservable variable.
*   **Information Veracity:** The initial reports of violence against Christians could be exaggerated or manipulated by various actors to encourage US intervention.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for such an attack is very low, but the President's direct, public, and ideologically-motivated threat constitutes a powerful signal that significantly increases the probability. The primary conflict is between presidential will and formidable institutional and geopolitical constraints, making a limited strike the most plausible, though still contested, path to a "Yes" resolution.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for new US unilateral military operations in a non-adversarial nation is low, around 5-10%, based on historical frequencies of such actions. This is due to the rarity of the US initiating military action in countries with which it is not at war and which are nominal partners.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a potential unilateral military action by the US in a non-adversarial country, fitting the reference class.
   - Differences: The direct presidential order and public threat by President Trump are stronger signals than typical diplomatic warnings, suggesting a higher likelihood than the base rate. However, Nigeria is a major regional power, unlike typical targets, which increases the geopolitical costs and institutional resistance.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Presidential Order and Threat**: The direct order to the DoD and public threat significantly increase the likelihood of action (P(E | H) is high), as they indicate serious intent. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
   - **Institutional Resistance**: Reports of skepticism within the Pentagon and potential diplomatic fallout decrease the likelihood (P(E | ~H) is high), as they suggest significant barriers to action. This evidence decreases the probability.
   - **Domestic Political Calculus**: The potential domestic political gain from acting on the threat increases the likelihood (P(E | H) is moderate), as it provides a motive for action. This evidence moderately increases the probability.
   - **Nigerian Response**: The negative reaction from Nigeria decreases the likelihood (P(E | ~H) is moderate), as it complicates the feasibility of action. This evidence decreases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 5%, the strong presidential directive and domestic political incentives push the probability higher. However, the significant institutional resistance and geopolitical costs act as counterweights.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
   - Given the mixed evidence, the posterior probability is adjusted upwards but remains tempered by the constraints. A reasonable posterior probability might be in the range of 25-40%, reflecting the increased likelihood due to the presidential directive but acknowledging the substantial barriers.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from overestimating the impact of the presidential directive without accounting for institutional checks. The best alternative forecast might emphasize the institutional resistance and geopolitical costs, suggesting a lower probability.
   - Considering tail risks, such as a major triggering event or a shift in US domestic politics, could increase the probability. However, these are speculative and should not overly influence the forecast.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Balancing the evidence and considering the constraints, the final forecast reflects a moderate increase from the base rate but remains cautious due to the significant barriers to action.

Final: 30%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US conducting a military attack within a non-adversarial nation with which it has diplomatic relations.

Based on the research report, there are several relevant reference classes:
- New US unilateral military operations in non-adversarial nations: 5-10% per country-year
- US interventions for humanitarian/R2P reasons: <1% (especially for unilateral actions)
- US presidential military threats not acted upon: High ratio of threats to actual interventions

Given that Nigeria is a major regional power and partner (unlike typical targets like Yemen or Somalia), and considering the short timeframe (less than a month until 2026), I'll select a conservative base rate of **5%** as my prior.

This reflects the rarity of the US initiating new military operations against non-adversarial countries, especially major regional powers like Nigeria.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The US has identified extremist groups operating within the country (Boko Haram, ISWAP)
- There is ongoing violence against civilians that could trigger humanitarian concerns
- The US has security interests in the region

**Key differences:**
- Nigeria is a much more significant regional power than typical targets of US unilateral strikes
- The timeframe is extremely short (less than a month until 2026)
- The threat comes directly from President Trump with explicit public statements
- The justification is specifically about protecting Christians, which appeals to Trump's base
- Trump has ordered the DoD to "prepare for possible action" - a formal directive

These differences, particularly Trump's direct involvement and public statements, significantly increase the probability above the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's direct order to DoD to prepare for action**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US were going to attack, such preparation would almost certainly occur
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Presidents often order contingency planning that doesn't lead to action
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump's explicit public threat on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Public threats often precede actual military action
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.5) - Trump has made threats that weren't followed by action
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Nigeria is a major regional power with a professional military**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - The US rarely attacks countries with significant military capabilities
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Most countries the US doesn't attack have meaningful sovereignty
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Institutional resistance from Pentagon/State Department**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even with resistance, presidential directives can overcome bureaucracy
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Institutional resistance often prevents military action
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Very short timeframe (less than a month until 2026)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - Military operations typically require longer planning periods
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - Most threatened actions don't materialize in such short timeframes
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19)

First update (Trump's direct order to DoD):
- Prior odds: 1:19 (0.05)
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 3:19 = 3/19 ≈ 0.158
- Posterior probability: 0.158/(1+0.158) ≈ 13.6%

Second update (Trump's explicit public threat):
- Prior odds: 0.158:1 (13.6%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.9
- Posterior odds: 0.3:1 = 0.3
- Posterior probability: 0.3/(1+0.3) ≈ 23%

Third update (Nigeria's status as regional power):
- Prior odds: 0.3:1 (23%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.075:1 = 0.075
- Posterior probability: 0.075/(1+0.075) ≈ 7%

Fourth update (Institutional resistance):
- Prior odds: 0.075:1 (7%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.0375:1 = 0.0375
- Posterior probability: 0.0375/(1+0.0375) ≈ 3.6%

Fifth update (Short timeframe):
- Prior odds: 0.0375:1 (3.6%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- Posterior odds: 0.012375:1 = 0.012375
- Posterior probability: 0.012375/(1+0.012375) ≈ 1.2%

After considering all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 1.2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Underestimating Trump's decisiveness**: Trump has shown willingness to take unexpected military action (e.g., the strike on Iranian General Soleimani). If he's personally committed to this action, institutional resistance might not matter as much.

2. **Limited definition of "attack"**: The resolution criteria only requires any military attack within Nigeria. This could include a single drone strike or special forces operation targeting terrorist leaders, which is much more feasible in the short timeframe than a large-scale operation.

3. **Potential for a triggering event**: A major attack against Christians or US interests in Nigeria could rapidly accelerate the timeline and probability.

4. **Overestimating institutional constraints**: Trump may bypass normal channels or replace resistant officials to execute his directive.

Alternative forecast: A reasonable alternative would be 10-15%, based on giving more weight to Trump's direct statements and less weight to institutional constraints. The short timeframe remains a significant limiting factor, but a limited drone strike could be executed quickly if ordered.

Considering these factors, I should adjust my forecast upward somewhat, particularly given the broad definition of "attack" that could include limited operations.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is approximately 5%.

This reflects:
- The very short timeframe (less than a month)
- The significant institutional and geopolitical constraints
- The possibility of a limited operation (e.g., drone strike)
- The direct presidential involvement and public statements

Final: 5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a new, unilateral US military attack in a country that is a nominal partner, not an adversary. The research report suggests a base rate for such an event is low. The most relevant reference class is "New US unilateral military operations in a non-adversarial nation," for which the report estimates a 5-10% probability in a given country-year where specific threats are perceived.

However, the question is not about a random country-year but a specific situation following a direct presidential threat. A more appropriate prior is the probability of a threat like this being acted upon. Given that presidential threats are more common than actual military interventions, the base rate remains low. The research report's Bayesian sketch starts with a 5% prior, which seems a reasonable starting point for the probability that this specific threat will lead to action within the relevant timeframe (i.e., the ~2 months from the threat in early November to the end of 2025).

- **Prior P(H):** 5%
- **Prior Odds:** 0.05 / 0.95 = 1:19

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case of a typical US unilateral strike in several key ways:
- **Similarities:** The potential action would be unilateral and target non-state actors within a partner nation's borders.
- **Differences (decreasing probability):** The target, Nigeria, is a major regional economic and military power, not a failed state like Somalia or an ungoverned territory like the tribal areas of Pakistan. The geopolitical and diplomatic costs of an attack are therefore substantially higher.
- **Differences (increasing probability):** The presidential actor, Donald Trump, is known for a decision-making style that is less constrained by institutional norms and expert advice. His threat was a direct, public order to the Pentagon to prepare for action, which is a much stronger and more concrete signal of intent than vague diplomatic warnings. The explicit rationale of protecting Christians also provides a powerful domestic political motivation.

The factors are pulling in opposite directions, making this a complex deviation from the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to determine how they shift the probability from the 5% prior.

- **Evidence 1: Direct, public presidential order to the DoD and explicit threat.**
    - This is the single most important piece of evidence. If an attack were to happen (H), such an order is a very likely precursor (high P(E|H)). If no attack were to happen (~H), such an order is still plausible as a political bluff or coercive tool, but it's a significant step that sets military bureaucracy in motion, making it less likely than if an attack is actually intended.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)):** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability. Let's estimate a likelihood ratio of 5:1.

- **Evidence 2: Strong institutional and geopolitical constraints.**
    - This includes the expected resistance from the Pentagon and State Department, and the severe diplomatic fallout with Nigeria, a key regional partner. If no attack happens (~H), it is very likely because these constraints proved decisive (high P(E|~H)). If an attack *does* happen (H), it means these powerful constraints were overcome, but they would certainly have been present during the decision-making process.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. The existence of these major hurdles makes inaction the more likely outcome. Let's estimate a likelihood ratio of 1:2.

- **Evidence 3: The extremely short timeline.**
    - The current date is December 7, 2025, leaving less than four weeks until the deadline of January 1, 2026. A month has already passed since the threat was made.
    - The passage of time without an attack is evidence against one occurring. Bureaucratic inertia, diplomatic processes, and the upcoming holiday season make organizing and executing an attack within this short window difficult. The clock running out is a very common way for such initiatives to fizzle.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This is a powerful constraint favoring the "No" outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The research report's sketch synthesizes these conflicting factors and concludes with a posterior probability in the 25-40% range *at the time the threat was made*. This suggests the authors believe the powerful positive evidence from the presidential order initially outweighs the negative evidence from the constraints. Let's accept their synthesis and take the midpoint, 32.5%, as the probability for the entire November-December 2025 period.

Now, we must update this probability based on the fact that over a month (Nov 1 to Dec 7) has passed without an attack.

- **Initial Probability (for Nov-Dec):** P(H) = 32.5%
- **Evidence (E):** No attack has occurred in the first ~5 weeks of the ~8 week window.
- **P(E | H):** If an attack is going to happen in the 8-week window, the chance that it hasn't happened in the first 5 weeks (assuming a uniform probability over the period) is the ratio of the remaining time to the total time: (3 weeks / 8 weeks) = 0.375.
- **P(E | ~H):** If no attack is going to happen, the probability of not seeing one in the first 5 weeks is 1.

Using Bayes' Rule:
Posterior P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
P(H|E) = [0.375 * 0.325] / [0.375 * 0.325 + 1 * (1 - 0.325)]
P(H|E) = 0.121875 / [0.121875 + 0.675]
P(H|E) = 0.121875 / 0.796875 ≈ 0.153

The updated probability, accounting for the passage of time, is approximately **15%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 15% could be too low if:
1.  A "trigger event," such as a high-profile atrocity against Christians in Nigeria, occurs in the next few weeks, creating immense pressure for Trump to act on his threat, especially around Christmas.
2.  The US has pre-existing plans and capabilities to strike quickly, and the November order was simply an activation, waiting only for a target of opportunity.
3.  The definition of "attack" is met by a very minor, plausibly deniable action that is easier to execute than a major strike.

My forecast could be too high if:
1.  The threat was purely performative for domestic political effect, with no real intention to act. The passage of time makes this more likely.
2.  The institutional and diplomatic pushback was immediately effective, quietly shelving the option.
3.  The Nigerian government took actions that provided the US with an "off-ramp," allowing Trump to claim his threat worked without needing to use force.

Considering these factors, the 15% figure seems to strike a reasonable balance. It acknowledges a real (roughly 1-in-7) chance of a limited strike, driven by presidential volition and a potential trigger event, while correctly identifying inaction as the most probable outcome due to powerful constraints and the dwindling timeline.

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial threat by President Trump was a powerful signal that significantly raised the probability of a US military attack in Nigeria. However, the target is a major regional power, creating immense institutional and geopolitical friction against such an action. More than a month has now passed without an incident, and the remaining timeframe is very short. While a limited strike remains possible, especially if a triggering event occurs, the most likely scenario is that the initiative has lost momentum and will not result in an attack before the 2026 deadline.

Final: 15%
