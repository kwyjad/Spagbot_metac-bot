### Reference class & base rates
1.  **DOJ Prosecutions of Former Presidents, VPs, or Congressional Leaders:** In modern U.S. history, the base rate for a new administration's DOJ announcing a prosecution of a former President, Vice President, or top-tier congressional leader (Speaker, Senate Leader) from the opposition party is effectively 0%. While investigations have occurred (e.g., Iran-Contra, Whitewater), the norm against politically-motivated prosecutions of past top-level leadership has been exceptionally strong.
2.  **Politically-Charged DOJ Investigations of High-Profile Political Opponents:** A broader class includes investigations into any prominent political opponent, not just former top leaders. This has a higher, but still very low, base rate. Examples like the investigation into Senator Ted Stevens (later overturned) or the scrutiny of IRS targeting under Obama exist, but are rare and often originate from inspectors general or career prosecutors, not as explicit top-down political directives. A ballpark base rate might be <5% for any given administration.
3.  **Authoritarian Regimes Prosecuting Former Leaders:** A less relevant but informative reference class is the behavior of new governments in less-established democracies or authoritarian states. In these cases, the prosecution of former leaders is common. While the U.S. is not in this category, Trump's rhetoric and proposed actions move the context slightly in this direction, making the U.S. historical base rate a potentially less reliable guide.

*Limitations*: The sample size for Class 1 is extremely small, making the base rate brittle. The current political environment, particularly the precedent of a former president being prosecuted, may render historical comparisons less applicable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-01-20]** Donald Trump inaugurated for a second term. — ↑ — This is the necessary precondition for the scenario, initiating a transfer of power at the DOJ and enabling the fulfillment of campaign promises.
*   **[2025-03-12]** (Inferred) A new, Trump-loyalist Attorney General is confirmed by the Senate after a contentious process. — ↑ — The installation of an AG willing to disregard institutional norms is the primary mechanism for a politically directed investigation, overcoming potential resistance from career staff.
*   **[2025-06-26]** Pew Research report on Trump's 2024 victory coalition published. — ↔ — This is background context, confirming the political landscape but not directly impacting the probability of a specific DOJ action.
*   **[2025-07-03]** House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivers a high-profile speech opposing a Trump administration policy. — ↑ (small) — Public opposition from a high-profile Democrat on the target list could serve as a political irritant, potentially accelerating or justifying a retaliatory investigation.
*   **[2025-09-08]** Rep. Eric Swalwell named Ranking Member of a Judiciary Subcommittee on Jan 6. — ↑ (small) — Swalwell, an impeachment manager, taking a prominent role investigating Trump-related events places him in direct opposition and makes him a more visible target for retribution.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Desire for Retribution:** Trump has explicitly and consistently stated his intent to use the DOJ to "go after" political opponents. This is the primary driver. (Size: Large ↑)
2.  **Loyalist Control of DOJ:** A second-term Trump administration would prioritize appointing loyalists to key positions (AG, division heads), bypassing the institutional "guardrails" of the DOJ that have historically resisted political pressure. (Size: Large ↑)
3.  **Need for a Plausible Legal Predicate:** The DOJ cannot simply announce an investigation without a pretext. A "hook" is needed, such as a congressional referral, an inspector general report, or a re-interpretation of an existing issue (e.g., Hunter Biden's business dealings, origins of the Russia investigation). (Size: Moderate ↓, as it requires effort to create).
4.  **Political Calculation and Risk of Backlash:** The administration may weigh the benefits of satisfying its base against the risks of appearing tyrannical, creating a permanent cycle of retaliatory prosecutions, and potentially alienating moderate voters. (Size: Small ↓, as polarization may mute the backlash).
5.  **Short Timeline:** The resolution date is before Jan 1, 2026. While announcing an *investigation* is fast, building a case for *prosecution* takes significant time. The short horizon favors the announcement of an investigation over an indictment. (Size: Small ↓).
6.  **Pressure from Political Allies and Base:** Hardline allies and media figures will likely exert significant public pressure on the Trump administration to follow through on its campaign promises, making it politically costly for Trump *not* to act. (Size: Moderate ↑).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Campaign Promises:** Unlike any modern predecessor, Trump has made the prosecution of political rivals a central and explicit campaign promise, framing it as "retribution."
*   **Precedent of Prosecuting a Former President:** The multiple indictments and prosecutions of Donald Trump post-presidency have shattered the long-standing norm against this practice. This makes a retaliatory action seem less like a violation of norms and more like an "evening of the score."
*   **"Project 2025" and Personnel Vetting:** The existence of a pre-vetted pool of personnel (like those proposed in Project 2025) committed to executing a president's agenda, including at the DOJ, is a significant departure from past transitions.
*   **Weakened Institutional Norms:** The political polarization and stress-testing of institutions during Trump's first term and its aftermath suggest that traditional "guardrails" within the government are weaker than in prior reference class periods.
*   **Broad Target List:** The resolution criteria include not just a former President/VP, but a wide range of congressional leaders and impeachment managers, increasing the number of potential targets and thus the probability that at least one is selected.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A very low prior (<5%) is appropriate, anchored on the historical base rate of near-zero for such an event in the U.S. (equivalent n=~20-25 historical administrations).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Trump's explicit and repeated vows of retribution are a radical departure from historical precedent.
    *   ↑ (Large): The norm against prosecuting former presidents has already been broken (by Trump's own prosecution), making retaliation more plausible.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): The likely installation of a loyalist AG and DOJ leadership specifically chosen to overcome institutional resistance.
    *   ↑ (Small): The broad list of potential targets (presidents, VPs, leaders, 16 impeachment managers) creates more opportunities for an investigation to be launched against at least one individual.
    *   ↓ (Small): The short timeline to resolution (<14 months from inauguration) constrains the ability to build a complex case for *prosecution*, though not for announcing an *investigation*.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides a powerful, multi-faceted argument against the historical base rate. The posterior probability should be updated significantly upward from the very low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements by President Trump or the Attorney General targeting specific individuals on the list.
    *   House Judiciary or Oversight committees, led by Republicans, announcing new investigations and making criminal referrals to the DOJ.
    *   Leaks from within the DOJ about the creation of a special task force or the opening of a preliminary inquiry.
    *   Prominent conservative media figures beginning a coordinated campaign calling for the investigation of a specific Democrat.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The new Attorney General making strong public statements affirming DOJ independence and adherence to norms.
    *   President Trump becoming consumed by other major priorities (e.g., economic crisis, foreign conflict), diverting political capital.
    *   Leaks from career DOJ officials indicating they are resisting political pressure.
    *   Key Republican congressional leaders publicly or privately advising against such a move.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Investigation vs. Prosecution:** The question resolves on an "investigation OR prosecution." Announcing an investigation is a much lower bar and more probable than securing an indictment for a prosecution within the timeframe.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Reality:** Trump's threats may be performative rhetoric for his base rather than a firm policy intention he is willing to expend significant political capital on.
*   **Definition of "Announcement":** The resolution hinges on "credible sources report[ing]" an announcement. This could be a formal DOJ press conference, a leak to a major news outlet, or a statement from the AG. The ambiguity could affect resolution.
*   **Target Selection:** An investigation into a lower-profile former impeachment manager (e.g., one no longer in Congress) is more likely and carries less political risk than a direct investigation of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. The question resolves YES for any of them.
*   **Scenario Fidelity:** This analysis assumes a second Trump term proceeds as expected based on campaign rhetoric. Unforeseen events could dramatically alter priorities and constraints.

**Final Research Summary:** The historical base rate for such an event is near zero, suggesting a very low prior. However, the unique context of a second Trump presidency—defined by explicit promises of retribution, the shattering of prior norms, and the intent to install loyalist leadership—provides overwhelming evidence for a significant upward revision.

To forecast the probability of the Department of Justice announcing an investigation or prosecution of a high-profile Democrat before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Historically, the base rate for the DOJ announcing a prosecution of a former President, Vice President, or top-tier congressional leader from the opposition party is effectively 0%. However, for politically charged investigations of high-profile political opponents, a broader class, the base rate is slightly higher but still very low, estimated at <5%.
- **Chosen Prior:** Given the broader class and the unique political context, we start with a prior probability of 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a new administration with potential motivations for politically charged actions, similar to past administrations.
- **Differences:** The explicit campaign promises by Trump to pursue political opponents, the precedent of prosecuting a former president, and the installation of loyalist DOJ leadership are significant deviations from historical norms.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Trump's Campaign Promises:** The explicit and repeated vows of retribution are a radical departure from historical precedent, increasing the likelihood of such actions. (Likelihood ratio: Large ↑)
- **Precedent of Prosecuting a Former President:** The norm against prosecuting former presidents has been broken, making retaliation more plausible. (Likelihood ratio: Large ↑)
- **Loyalist DOJ Leadership:** The installation of a loyalist AG and DOJ leadership increases the likelihood of politically motivated actions. (Likelihood ratio: Moderate ↑)
- **Short Timeline:** The short timeline to resolution constrains the ability to build a complex case for prosecution, though not for announcing an investigation. (Likelihood ratio: Small ↓)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 5% probability translates to odds of 0.05 / 0.95 = 0.0526.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly greater than 1, suggesting a substantial increase in probability.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.0526 × (e.g., 5) = 0.263.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.263 / (1 + 0.263) ≈ 20.8%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast accounts for significant deviations from historical norms but remains cautious due to the unprecedented nature of the scenario.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of Trump's rhetoric being more performative than actionable, or unforeseen events diverting priorities.
- **Adjustment:** Given the potential for unforeseen events and the ambiguity in the resolution criteria, a slight downward adjustment is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all factors, the final calibrated probability is adjusted to reflect both the base rate and the impact of the evidence.

Final: 18%

# Probability Analysis: DOJ Investigation of High-Profile Democrats

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for the DOJ announcing an investigation or prosecution of a high-profile Democrat (as defined) before 2026.

The most appropriate base rate comes from historical precedent of incoming administrations investigating or prosecuting high-ranking officials from the previous administration or opposition party. In modern U.S. history, this rate has been extremely low, approaching zero. While investigations of political figures have occurred (Whitewater, Iran-Contra, etc.), formal DOJ investigations or prosecutions of former presidents, vice presidents, or congressional leadership from the opposing party are virtually unprecedented.

Given the specific criteria and the historical norm against such actions, I'll set a prior of approximately **5%**. This reflects the extremely rare nature of such events while acknowledging they aren't theoretically impossible.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The DOJ still maintains institutional norms and procedures that resist political interference
- Career prosecutors and officials within DOJ provide some resistance to politically-motivated cases
- Legal standards for investigations and prosecutions remain unchanged
- Constitutional separation of powers remains in place

**Key differences from base case:**
- Trump has explicitly and repeatedly promised to prosecute political opponents, unlike any previous president
- The norm against prosecuting former presidents has been broken by Trump's own prosecution
- Project 2025 and similar efforts suggest a more coordinated approach to installing loyalists in key positions
- The target list is unusually broad (including 16 impeachment managers), increasing the chance of at least one investigation
- Unprecedented polarization has weakened institutional norms that previously prevented such actions

These differences significantly increase the likelihood compared to the historical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's explicit campaign promises of retribution**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If DOJ will investigate Democrats, Trump's promises are exactly what we'd expect
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - Even if no investigations occur, such rhetoric could be used purely for political effect
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This evidence significantly increases probability

**Evidence 2: Precedent of prosecuting a former president (Trump)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Breaking this norm makes reciprocal action more likely
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - The norm could be broken without triggering retaliation
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.6
- This evidence moderately increases probability

**Evidence 3: Broad list of potential targets**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - More targets increases likelihood of finding at least one viable case
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.6) - Even with many targets, institutional resistance could prevent action
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.5
- This evidence moderately increases probability

**Evidence 4: Short timeline (14 months from inauguration to resolution)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - Investigations can be announced quickly, though prosecutions take longer
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Limited time reduces ability to build cases, especially complex ones
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75
- This evidence slightly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5%/95% = 0.053

First update (Trump's explicit promises):
Posterior odds = 0.053 × 2.4 = 0.127
Posterior probability = 0.127/(1+0.127) ≈ 11.3%

Second update (Precedent of prosecuting former president):
Posterior odds = 0.127 × 1.6 = 0.203
Posterior probability = 0.203/(1+0.203) ≈ 16.9%

Third update (Broad list of targets):
Posterior odds = 0.203 × 1.5 = 0.305
Posterior probability = 0.305/(1+0.305) ≈ 23.4%

Fourth update (Short timeline constraint):
Posterior odds = 0.305 × 0.75 = 0.229
Posterior probability = 0.229/(1+0.229) ≈ 18.6%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 19%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting campaign rhetoric versus actual governance constraints
- The institutional resistance within DOJ may be stronger than anticipated
- Trump might prioritize other agenda items over investigations of Democrats
- Congressional Republicans might discourage such actions to avoid setting precedents

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Trump could satisfy his base through other means (e.g., policy wins) without investigations
- A major crisis (economic, international) could divert attention and resources
- Trump might focus investigations on non-politicians (e.g., media figures, bureaucrats) instead

**Underappreciated factors:**
- The question resolves on "investigation OR prosecution" - the bar for an investigation is much lower
- The broad target list includes many former impeachment managers who aren't household names, making them easier targets with less political blowback
- The question requires only an announcement before 2026, not a completed investigation

After considering these factors, I believe my estimate of 19% is slightly low. The ease of announcing an investigation (versus completing a prosecution), combined with the broad target list and explicit campaign promises, suggests a higher probability is warranted.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, historical precedent, and the specific resolution criteria, I adjust my final probability to 25%. This reflects the unprecedented nature of Trump's explicit promises, the broken norm of prosecuting former presidents, and the broad list of potential targets, while still acknowledging the significant institutional barriers and historical norms against such actions.

Final: 25%

Here is a structured probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the historical frequency of a new U.S. presidential administration using the Department of Justice (DOJ) to announce an investigation or prosecution of a high-level political opponent from the previous administration (former President, VP, or Congressional leader).

In modern U.S. history (post-WWII), this has almost never happened. There is a powerful and long-standing norm against such actions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power and prevent cycles of "victor's justice." While some investigations involving political figures have occurred (e.g., Whitewater, Iran-Contra), they were typically not initiated as a direct, politically-motivated act by a new administration against its predecessors.

Therefore, the historical base rate is extremely low, effectively close to 0%. For the purpose of a Bayesian update, I will set the initial prior probability **P(H) at 3%**. This acknowledges that the event is not impossible but is profoundly contrary to historical precedent. This corresponds to prior odds of approximately 1-to-32.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs dramatically from the historical base case in several key ways:

*   **Explicit Rhetoric:** Donald Trump is the first modern presidential candidate to explicitly and repeatedly campaign on a promise of "retribution," vowing to use the DOJ to investigate and prosecute his political rivals. This signals a clear intent to break with historical norms.
*   **Shattered Precedent:** The norm against prosecuting a former president has already been broken by the multiple state and federal indictments of Donald Trump himself. This makes a retaliatory action seem less like a violation of a sacred norm and more like a tit-for-tat escalation, providing political cover.
*   **Personnel Strategy:** A second Trump administration would likely prioritize installing loyalists in key DOJ positions, a strategy informed by plans like "Project 2025." This is intended to overcome the institutional resistance from career officials that might have tempered such actions in the past.
*   **Broad Target List:** The resolution criteria are not limited to a former president. They include a wide range of over 20 individuals, including congressional leaders and former impeachment managers. This broadens the "attack surface," making it much more likely that a plausible legal pretext can be found for at least one person on the list.

These differences are so significant that they suggest the historical base rate is a weak guide, and a substantial upward update is required.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate the evidence, assuming a Trump administration has been in power since January 20, 2025, and the current date is November 10, 2025.

*   **Evidence 1: Trump's intent, the broken precedent, and loyalist staffing.**
    *   This combination of motive, political cover, and means makes the event (H) far more likely than in any historical case. If H were to happen, these conditions would almost certainly be present. P(E1 | H) is very high. If H does not happen (~H), it would be despite these powerful drivers, implying other significant obstacles exist.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H) is very large. This evidence provides a massive upward update from the 3% prior.

*   **Evidence 2: The broad list of potential targets.**
    *   This increases the probability of a "Yes" resolution. The chance of finding a pretext to investigate *one of twenty* people is much higher than for just one or two. This acts as a multiplier on the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The elapsed time.**
    *   As of November 10, 2025, ten months of the administration have passed with no such announcement. The resolution window closes in less than two months.
    *   P(E3 | H): If an announcement was planned for 2025 (H), it is somewhat surprising it hasn't happened yet. One might expect such a move early in the term to demonstrate resolve.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): If no announcement is planned for 2025 (~H), it is completely unsurprising that nothing has been announced by November.
    *   The likelihood ratio P(E3 | H) / P(E3 | ~H) is significantly less than 1. This is strong evidence *against* the event happening in the remaining time and requires a significant downward update.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a two-stage update.

**Stage 1: Initial Probability for 2025**
Starting with a 3% prior, the powerful evidence from Trump's intent, the broken precedent, and the broad target list would dramatically increase the probability. At the beginning of 2025, I would have estimated the probability of this event occurring *at some point during the year* to be quite high, perhaps around **60%**. This reflects the belief that the new political reality has largely overridden the historical base rate.

**Stage 2: Updating for Elapsed Time**
Now, we must update this 60% probability given that ten months have passed without an announcement. We are calculating P(Event in Nov-Dec | No Event in Jan-Oct).

Let's model the timing. A politically motivated announcement is not random; it's strategic. It might come early (to show strength) or late (to set up the 2026 midterm cycle). I will estimate that, if the event were to happen in 2025, there was a 75% chance it would happen in the first ten months and a 25% chance it would happen in the final two months.

*   Initial P(Event in 2025) = 0.60
*   P(Event in Jan-Oct) = P(Event in 2025) * P(Timing is Jan-Oct | Event) = 0.60 * 0.75 = 0.45
*   P(Event in Nov-Dec) = P(Event in 2025) * P(Timing is Nov-Dec | Event) = 0.60 * 0.25 = 0.15

Now, we use the formula for conditional probability:
P(Event in Nov-Dec | No Event in Jan-Oct) = P(Event in Nov-Dec) / P(No Event in Jan-Oct)
P(Event in Nov-Dec | No Event in Jan-Oct) = 0.15 / (1 - 0.45) = 0.15 / 0.55 ≈ 0.272

This calculation results in a posterior probability of approximately **27%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Why might the forecast be too low?** The delay could be entirely strategic, intended to build a stronger case or to launch the announcement at the end of the year to dominate the news cycle heading into 2026. In this scenario, the inaction so far is not evidence against the event, but part of the plan.
*   **Why might the forecast be too high?** The inaction could signal that the administration is facing stronger-than-expected institutional or political resistance, or is simply too disorganized to execute on this promise. The rhetoric may have been performative, with little intent to follow through.
*   **Conclusion:** The 27% forecast seems to balance these competing possibilities. It acknowledges that the probability has decreased significantly as the year has progressed but correctly keeps the chance well above the historical base rate because of the unique political factors at play. The calculation is sensitive to the assumed 75/25 time distribution, but this seems like a reasonable estimate of the strategic trade-offs.

### 6. Final Forecast
The historical base rate for such an event is near-zero. However, the unique political context of a second Trump term—driven by explicit promises of retribution, the precedent of his own prosecution, and a strategy of staffing the DOJ with loyalists—makes this a highly plausible scenario. This justifies a very high initial probability for an event occurring in 2025.

However, the fact that ten months have passed without an announcement is strong evidence that the event is less likely than initially thought, or is planned for later. After updating for this elapsed time, the probability of an announcement in the final ~50 days of 2025 is substantially reduced. The final probability reflects a balance between the powerful drivers pushing for the event and the significant negative evidence of the ticking clock.

Final: 27%
