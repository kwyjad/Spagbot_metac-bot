### Reference class & base rates
1.  **IMF-Supported Stabilization Programs in High-Inflation Countries:** Argentina's program is supported by the IMF. Historically, the success of such programs in durably lowering inflation to moderate levels is mixed. A 2006 IMF working paper found that only about half of programs in low-income countries achieved their inflation objectives. For countries with chronic high inflation and structural issues like Argentina, the success rate is likely lower. **Base Rate: 20-30%** chance of achieving a specific, ambitious inflation target like <30% within two years.
2.  **Radical "Shock Therapy" Disinflation Attempts:** This class includes programs involving sudden, drastic fiscal austerity and monetary tightening, similar to Milei's approach. Examples include Bolivia (1985), Poland (1990), and Israel (1985). While some were successful in breaking hyperinflation, many struggled with sustained disinflation and faced severe recessions and political backlash. The base rate for achieving a sub-30% target within 24 months without major reversals is likely modest. **Base Rate: 25-40%**.
3.  **Argentine Economic Stabilization Plans (Post-1980):** Argentina has a long history of failed attempts to control inflation (e.g., Austral Plan, Convertibility Plan). These plans often achieved temporary success before collapsing due to political unsustainability, external shocks, or an inability to address underlying fiscal imbalances. This specific national history suggests a very low prior for success. **Base Rate: <15%**.

*Reasoning:* The most relevant class is a blend of #2 and #3. The radical nature of the reform is a key feature, but Argentina's unique history of institutional weakness and political volatility provides a strong pessimistic anchor. A blended base rate suggests a low probability of success, perhaps in the **15-25% range**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-14** IMF raises its 2025 inflation forecast for Argentina to 41.3%. ↓ — This is a direct, recent, and influential forecast from a key institutional actor, explicitly placing the year-end target above the 30% threshold.
*   **2025-07-07** OECD releases an optimistic survey, projecting a strong recovery and noting that the fiscal adjustment has been "key to taming high inflation." ↑ — Provides a strong counter-narrative to the IMF, suggesting the underlying mechanisms for disinflation are working as intended and will support continued progress.
*   **2025-03-13** Prime Economics report highlights the severe social costs (recession, poverty) of the shock therapy. ↓ — Older, but underscores the ongoing political and social fragility that could undermine the program's sustainability through the end of the year.
*   **2025-01-13** Santander report forecasts 2025 inflation will be "below 30%." ↑ — An early and very optimistic forecast, but its age (now 9 months old) reduces its weight compared to more recent data and IMF revisions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Fiscal Austerity ("Motosierra"):** The cornerstone of Milei's plan is eliminating the fiscal deficit, which has historically been monetized by the central bank, fueling inflation. Sustaining a fiscal surplus is the primary anchor. **Effect Size: Large**.
2.  **Monetary Policy:** The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) has ceased printing pesos to finance the treasury. This directly removes the primary source of inflation. The accumulation of foreign reserves is a key component of this mechanism's credibility. **Effect Size: Large**.
3.  **Exchange Rate Management:** The government implemented a large initial devaluation followed by a controlled "crawling peg." The future management of this peg and the eventual removal of currency controls ("cepo") is a major source of uncertainty. A disorderly exit could trigger a new inflationary spike. **Effect Size: Large**.
4.  **Political & Social Sustainability:** The austerity measures have caused a deep recession and increased poverty. The government's ability to maintain popular support and navigate congressional opposition and union-led protests is critical. A loss of political capital could force a policy reversal. **Effect Size: Large**.
5.  **Inflationary Inertia & Expectations:** After decades of high inflation, wage and price-setting behaviors are deeply entrenched. Breaking this "inertia" is key. The rapid initial drop in monthly inflation helps anchor expectations downwards, but a recovery in real wages could add new pressure. **Effect Size: Moderate**.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Fiscal Adjustment:** The speed and scale of the fiscal consolidation under Milei are more extreme than in most prior Argentine plans and many international examples. The achievement of a fiscal surplus in the first year is a significant departure.
*   **Strong Ideological Commitment:** Unlike previous technocratic or politically motivated plans, Milei's program is driven by a deep-seated libertarian ideology. This may give him greater resolve to withstand political pressure against austerity.
*   **Lack of Congressional Majority:** A key weakness. Unlike leaders who implemented successful shock therapies with strong legislative backing, Milei must govern via decrees and fragile alliances, making his reforms vulnerable to being blocked or reversed.
*   **External Environment:** The global environment is one of disinflation, which provides a helpful tailwind. However, Argentina remains largely cut off from international credit markets, limiting its financial buffer.
*   **Pace of Disinflation:** The drop in monthly inflation from 25.5% to low single digits within a year is exceptionally fast, potentially breaking inertial inflation more quickly than in historical cases.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A skeptical prior of ~20% is appropriate, anchored on Argentina's history of failed plans and the general difficulty of radical disinflation (equivalent n of ~5-10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ **(Large):** The dramatic and sustained reduction in monthly inflation throughout 2024 and into 2025 is powerful evidence that the core fiscal and monetary mechanisms are working.
    *   ↑ **(Moderate):** The government has, to date, maintained its fiscal targets and political resolve despite high social costs, suggesting a higher-than-usual commitment.
    *   ↓ **(Large):** The most recent IMF forecast (Oct 2025) explicitly projects 41.3% inflation for 2025, a significant piece of expert evidence against the <30% outcome.
    *   ↓ **(Moderate):** The unresolved issue of currency controls ("cepo") represents a major latent risk of a future inflationary spike before the end of the year.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The real-world data on monthly inflation is very positive, but the primary institutional forecast is negative. The posterior should likely increase from the very low base rate but remain below 50%. The recent IMF update acts as a strong cap on optimism, suggesting a final probability in the **30-45% range**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting YES is more likely):**
    *   Monthly inflation prints for Oct/Nov 2025 remain below 2.0%.
    *   The government successfully begins to unwind currency controls without a major run on the peso.
    *   Central bank foreign reserve accumulation continues or accelerates.
    *   Milei's approval ratings remain stable, mitigating risks of policy reversal.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting NO is more likely):**
    *   Monthly inflation re-accelerates to 3.0% or higher.
    *   Major strikes or social protests emerge that threaten political stability.
    *   The gap between the official and parallel ("blue") exchange rates widens significantly.
    *   Government fails to pass key legislation, signaling a loss of political control.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Lag & Revisions:** The final December 2025 inflation number will only be released by INDEC in mid-January 2026. The resolution is based on this specific, final report.
*   **Repressed Inflation:** The current low monthly inflation could be partially artificial due to the crawling peg and frozen utility tariffs. Adjusting these "relative prices" could release a wave of inflation before year-end.
*   **Political Volatility:** Argentina's political landscape is highly unpredictable. A sudden cabinet crisis, major legislative defeat, or judicial challenge could derail the economic program with very little warning.
*   **Forecast Unreliability:** As noted in the background, forecasts for Argentine inflation have been notoriously inaccurate. The IMF's 41.3% could be just as wrong as earlier, more pessimistic forecasts were.
*   **YoY Calculation:** The resolution depends on the year-over-year figure. This means a single inflationary shock in late 2025 could keep the YoY number above 30%, even if the monthly trend at that moment is low. The comparison is to the high-inflation months of late 2024.

### Final Research Summary
Milei's radical austerity has produced a remarkably rapid fall in monthly inflation, a strong signal that the program's core mechanisms are effective. However, this success is balanced by severe political and social risks and the major challenge of unwinding currency controls, leading key institutions like the IMF to forecast a year-end inflation rate (41.3%) that remains stubbornly above the 30% threshold.

To forecast whether Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class for this situation is a blend of radical "shock therapy" disinflation attempts and Argentina's historical economic stabilization plans. Given Argentina's history of failed attempts to control inflation and the mixed success of radical disinflation programs, a base rate of **15-25%** is appropriate. This reflects the low probability of success due to Argentina's unique economic and political challenges.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- Argentina's current situation involves radical fiscal and monetary reforms, similar to past shock therapy attempts.
- The country has a history of high inflation and economic instability, which aligns with the reference class.

**Differences:**
- The current administration under Milei has shown a strong ideological commitment to austerity, which may provide more resolve than previous attempts.
- The pace of disinflation has been rapid, with monthly inflation dropping significantly, which is unusual compared to historical cases.

These differences suggest a slightly higher probability of success than the base rate alone might indicate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **IMF Forecast (41.3% inflation for 2025):** This is a strong piece of evidence against the event, suggesting a likelihood ratio that decreases the probability.
- **OECD Optimistic Survey:** Suggests mechanisms for disinflation are working, increasing the probability.
- **Prime Economics Report on Social Costs:** Highlights political and social risks, decreasing the probability.
- **Santander Forecast (<30% inflation):** An optimistic but older forecast, slightly increasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 20% (odds of 0.25), we adjust based on the evidence:
- **IMF Forecast:** Strong negative evidence, likelihood ratio <1, decreases odds.
- **OECD Survey:** Moderate positive evidence, likelihood ratio >1, increases odds.
- **Prime Economics Report:** Moderate negative evidence, likelihood ratio <1, decreases odds.
- **Santander Forecast:** Slight positive evidence, likelihood ratio >1, slightly increases odds.

Given the conflicting evidence, the posterior probability should increase from the base rate but remain below 50%. A reasonable estimate is in the **30-45% range**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The IMF's forecast is a significant institutional opinion that should not be underestimated.
- **Tail Risks:** Political instability or a sudden economic shock could drastically alter the situation.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more pessimistic view might argue for a probability closer to 20%, citing Argentina's historical failures.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 35%

# Will Argentina's year-over-year inflation be below 30% for December 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes:

- **Argentina's historical inflation control success**: Argentina has a long history of failed stabilization attempts. Looking at post-1980 economic plans, the success rate for achieving sustained low inflation has been poor, suggesting a base rate of around 15%.

- **IMF-supported stabilization programs**: For countries with chronic high inflation like Argentina, IMF programs have mixed success, with perhaps 20-30% achieving ambitious inflation targets within two years.

- **Radical "shock therapy" disinflation attempts**: Programs similar to Milei's approach (Bolivia 1985, Poland 1990, Israel 1985) have a somewhat better track record, with perhaps 25-40% success rates for achieving targets like <30% within 24 months.

Given Argentina's specific history and institutional challenges, I'll use a **prior probability of 20%** that inflation will fall below 30% by December 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Argentina continues to face structural economic challenges that have plagued previous stabilization attempts
- The country has limited access to international credit markets
- There are significant political constraints on reform implementation

**Key differences**:
- The fiscal adjustment under Milei has been more extreme and successful than previous attempts
- Monthly inflation has already dropped dramatically from 25.5% to low single digits
- Milei has shown unusual ideological commitment to maintaining austerity despite social costs
- The global environment is currently disinflationary, providing a helpful tailwind

These differences suggest some positive adjustment to the base rate is warranted.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Rapid decline in monthly inflation**
- P(E|H): If inflation will be below 30% by Dec 2025, we would very likely (90%) see the rapid decline in monthly inflation that has occurred
- P(E|~H): If inflation will remain above 30%, we might still see this initial decline (40%) before it stalls or reverses
- Likelihood ratio: 90%/40% = 2.25
- This evidence increases the probability significantly

**Evidence 2: IMF's October 2025 forecast of 41.3% inflation for 2025**
- P(E|H): If inflation will be below 30%, we would rarely (15%) see the IMF forecasting 41.3% this late in the year
- P(E|~H): If inflation will remain above 30%, the IMF forecast is quite likely (80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 15%/80% = 0.19
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Fiscal surplus achievement and maintenance**
- P(E|H): If inflation will be below 30%, we would very likely (85%) see sustained fiscal discipline
- P(E|~H): If inflation will remain above 30%, fiscal discipline might still be maintained (50%) but with less effectiveness
- Likelihood ratio: 85%/50% = 1.7
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Unresolved currency controls ("cepo") issue**
- P(E|H): If inflation will be below 30%, we might still see delayed resolution of currency controls (40%)
- P(E|~H): If inflation will remain above 30%, delayed resolution is much more likely (80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 40%/80% = 0.5
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update on rapid inflation decline**:
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2.25 = 0.5625
- Posterior probability: 0.5625/(1+0.5625) ≈ 36%

**Update on IMF forecast**:
- Prior odds: 0.36/0.64 = 0.5625
- Likelihood ratio: 0.19
- Posterior odds: 0.5625 × 0.19 = 0.107
- Posterior probability: 0.107/(1+0.107) ≈ 10%

**Update on fiscal discipline**:
- Prior odds: 0.10/0.90 = 0.111
- Likelihood ratio: 1.7
- Posterior odds: 0.111 × 1.7 = 0.189
- Posterior probability: 0.189/(1+0.189) ≈ 16%

**Update on currency controls issue**:
- Prior odds: 0.16/0.84 = 0.190
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.190 × 0.5 = 0.095
- Posterior probability: 0.095/(1+0.095) ≈ 9%

After these updates, my posterior probability is approximately 9%. However, this seems too low given the significant progress already made. I may have overweighted some negative factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be overweighting Argentina's historical failures and underestimating the uniqueness of Milei's approach
- The IMF has consistently been too pessimistic about Argentina's inflation trajectory under Milei
- The calculation method for year-over-year inflation means December 2025 will be compared to December 2024, when inflation was already declining

**Alternative forecast**:
A more optimistic view would note that monthly inflation has already fallen dramatically, and if this trend continues, year-over-year inflation could easily fall below 30% by December 2025. The Manifold market at 61.2% reflects this optimism.

**Rebuttals**:
- While monthly inflation has fallen, unwinding currency controls remains a major hurdle that could trigger new inflationary pressures
- The IMF's recent forecast of 41.3% is a strong signal from experts with access to detailed data
- Social and political pressures could force policy reversals as the 2025 election approaches

Considering these factors, I should adjust my estimate upward from 9%, but remain below the Manifold market's 61.2%, which seems overly optimistic given the IMF forecast and remaining challenges.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability that Argentina's year-over-year inflation will be below 30% for December 2025 is 35%.

Final: 35%

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is a combination of (a) radical "shock therapy" disinflation programs in countries with chronic high inflation and (b) Argentina's own specific history of failed stabilization plans.
*   **Reasoning:** Historically, such programs have a low success rate. Argentina, in particular, has a dismal track record, with most plans failing due to political unsustainability or an inability to address root fiscal issues. While some international shock therapy examples succeeded (e.g., Poland, Israel in the 1980s), the Argentine context suggests a strong pessimistic anchor.
*   **Initial Prior (P(H)):** A low prior probability is warranted. Based on the research report's analysis, a base rate of **20%** is a reasonable starting point. This reflects a 1-in-5 chance that a plan of this type would succeed in meeting an ambitious inflation target within two years, viewed from the program's inception.
*   **Prior Odds:** A 20% probability corresponds to prior odds of 0.20 / (1 - 0.20) = **0.25 to 1**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The program faces challenges typical of the reference class: a severe recession, rising poverty, and political opposition, all of which threaten its sustainability. The reliance on controlling the exchange rate also echoes past plans that eventually failed when the peg broke.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the program's performance to date. Unlike many past Argentine failures, President Milei's administration has achieved and sustained a primary fiscal surplus for over a year and has successfully brought month-over-month inflation down from over 25% to low single digits. This demonstrated success is a significant deviation from the base case. The ideological conviction of the government may also provide more resilience to political pressure than in previous attempts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

We are forecasting from mid-October 2025, with only 2.5 months left in the resolution period.

*   **Evidence 1: Sustained Low Monthly Inflation (Strongly Positive)**
    *   The government has successfully navigated the first 9-10 months of 2025 while keeping monthly inflation low. This is powerful evidence that the core disinflationary mechanisms (fiscal and monetary discipline) are working.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of observing low monthly inflation for most of the year is very high if the year-end target of <30% is to be met.
    *   P(E | ~H): It is less likely to see such sustained low inflation if the year-end figure is to be >=30%, as this would require a major inflationary shock in the final quarter.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Significantly greater than 1. This evidence strongly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: IMF Forecast of 41.3% for 2025 (Strongly Negative)**
    *   On October 14, 2025, the IMF—a key institutional actor—forecasted year-end inflation at 41.3%. This is a direct, recent, and expert opinion against the proposition. The IMF is likely pricing in a high probability of a future shock, such as a devaluation upon exiting currency controls ("cepo") or adjustments to frozen utility tariffs.
    *   P(E | H): The IMF forecasting 41.3% is less likely if the final figure will be <30%. However, as the background notes, forecasts for Argentina have often been too pessimistic.
    *   P(E | ~H): The IMF forecasting 41.3% is very likely if the final figure will be >=30%.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Less than 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Political Incentives (Moderately Positive)**
    *   The government has an extremely strong political incentive to ensure the 2025 inflation figure is a success story. This makes it highly probable that they will delay any potentially inflationary adjustments (like exiting the "cepo" or raising tariffs) until January 2026, pushing the problem past the resolution date.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Greater than 1. This increases the probability by suggesting the government will actively manage the timing of shocks to meet the target.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 0.25 to 1 (20% probability).
2.  **Update on Track Record:** The evidence of sustained low monthly inflation is exceptionally strong. It demonstrates that, unlike the base case, this plan is working so far. This evidence warrants a very large update. A likelihood ratio of 10-to-1 is plausible.
    *   *Intermediate Odds:* 0.25 * 10 = 2.5 to 1.
    *   *Intermediate Probability:* 2.5 / (1 + 2.5) = 71.4%.
3.  **Update on IMF Forecast & Latent Risks:** The recent IMF forecast is a serious counter-signal. It implies that experts see a high chance of repressed inflation being released before year-end. We must discount our optimism. However, given the history of pessimistic forecast errors and the strong political incentive to delay shocks, we should not take the IMF forecast at face value. Let's assign this negative evidence a combined likelihood ratio of 0.5 (i.e., it halves the odds).
    *   *Posterior Odds:* 2.5 * 0.5 = 1.25 to 1.
    *   *Posterior Probability:* 1.25 / (1 + 1.25) = **55.6%**.

This final probability reflects a significant upgrade from the historical base rate due to the program's demonstrated success, tempered by the significant latent risks highlighted by the IMF.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence:** Am I overweighting the government's ability to control the timing of a crisis? An exit from currency controls could be forced by market pressure (e.g., a run on reserves), rather than chosen. A 56% probability implies this is a coin-flip situation, which seems appropriate.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The IMF is right. The economic situation is unsustainable, and the "coiled spring" of repressed prices (exchange rate, utilities) must be released in November or December. This would cause a large inflationary spike (e.g., a single month of 10%+ inflation), making the <30% annual target impossible. This scenario is plausible and is the primary reason the forecast is not higher.
*   **Comparison to Markets:** The Manifold market is at 61.2%. My forecast of ~56% is slightly more pessimistic, giving a bit more weight to the IMF's warning and the tail risk of a forced devaluation. The proximity suggests my reasoning is aligned with the general consensus of informed traders.

After this review, the 56% estimate feels slightly low. The government's political will to delay pain for 2.5 more months seems very high. I will nudge my forecast slightly higher to better reflect this.

### 6. Final Forecast

The forecast balances the impressive and sustained reduction in monthly inflation against the significant risks of a future shock from unwinding currency controls and other price freezes. While the IMF's recent pessimistic forecast is a major concern, the Argentine government's powerful political incentive to delay any such shock until after the December 2025 reporting period is a stronger factor. The program's success to date has significantly deviated from the pessimistic historical base rate.

Final: 60%
