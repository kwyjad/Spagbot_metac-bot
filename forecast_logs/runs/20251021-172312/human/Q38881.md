Here is my research plan.

**Step 1: Identify Core Questions**

1.  **Base Rate Analysis:** What is the historical frequency of terrorist attacks causing casualties in the United States? What is the frequency of attacks using novel or unconventional weapons? What is the documented history of malicious drone use or foiled drone plots in the U.S.?
2.  **Capability & Accessibility:** How easy is it for a potential attacker to acquire and weaponize a commercial drone? What are the technical barriers, costs, and required skills? How has the war in Ukraine affected the dissemination of this knowledge?
3.  **Intent & Motivation:** Are domestic or foreign terrorist organizations actively promoting, planning, or expressing intent to use drones for attacks within the U.S.? What does chatter and propaganda from these groups indicate?
4.  **Countermeasures & Security Posture:** What are the current capabilities of U.S. federal, state, and local law enforcement to detect, track, and neutralize small, hostile drones? How effective are these C-UAS (Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems) measures, particularly over civilian areas and soft targets?
5.  **Recent Developments & Legislation:** What is the current status and likely impact of legislative efforts to ban or restrict DJI drones (as per the provided sources)? Are there other recent, relevant incidents (foiled plots, attacks abroad) that could influence the situation in the U.S.?

**Step 2: Propose Search Queries**

1.  **Base Rate Analysis:**

    *   `"START" terrorist attacks United States statistics`
    *   `foiled terrorist plots United States FBI report`

**Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Base Rate:** Successful terrorist attacks with casualties in the U.S. are extremely rare, averaging less than one per year over the last decade. Attacks with novel weapons are rarer still. There have been zero recorded terrorist attacks using aerial drones that caused injury or death in the U.S. to date. There have been numerous incidents of malicious drone use (e.g., near airports, over infrastructure), and a few documented plots, but none have reached the attack stage with a viable weapon. This establishes a very low prior probability.
*   **Capability/Accessibility:** The barrier to entry is low and falling. Commercial drones are affordable. The war in Ukraine has served as a global, open-source R&D lab, with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for weaponization widely shared online. A motivated individual can acquire the hardware and knowledge to weaponize a drone with a small explosive or chemical payload.
*   **Intent:** Both foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and domestic violent extremists (DVEs) have demonstrated clear intent. FTOs have used drones extensively in conflict zones. The FBI and DHS consistently warn that DVEs, particularly lone actors, pose the most likely threat, as they may be inspired by FTO tactics and seek to replicate them domestically.
*   **Countermeasures:** C-UAS capabilities are advancing but are primarily deployed at high-security federal sites and military bases. Widespread, effective protection for soft targets (e.g., public gatherings, malls) is not yet a reality due to technical, legal, and cost challenges. This represents a significant vulnerability.
*   **Recent Developments:** The legislative push against DJI (the market leader) creates friction. As of October 2025, supply is tightening ahead of a potential ban, making it marginally harder to acquire the most popular models. However, this does not eliminate the vast number of existing drones or prevent the use of other brands. This is a minor downward pressure on probability, not a game-changer.

**Step 4: Draft the Comprehensive Answer**

***

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Successful Terrorist Attacks with Casualties in the U.S. (Post-9/11):** The rate is extremely low. Data from START's Global Terrorism Database shows fewer than 10 such attacks in most years, with many years having zero or one. The base rate of a successful casualty-producing attack of *any kind* in a given ~14-month period is low, perhaps 5-10%.
2.  **Foiled/Attempted Novel Weapon Terrorist Plots in the U.S.:** This class includes attempts with chemical, biological, or complex explosive devices. The rate of such plots reaching a credible attempt phase is exceptionally low, likely less than one per year. The vast majority are disrupted at an early stage. This suggests a base rate of <1% for a successful attack in the forecast period.
3.  **Malicious Aerial Drone Incidents in the U.S.:** The FAA and DHS report hundreds of unauthorized or malicious drone sightings annually, including flights over critical infrastructure, prisons, and major public events. However, to date, **zero** of these have been confirmed as terrorist attacks resulting in injury or death. The base rate for the specific event in question is historically zero.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-07-29] DJI reports import difficulties and supply shortages in the U.S. market. (↓) — Increases friction for attackers seeking the most common and capable commercial drones, potentially delaying or degrading attack capability.
*   [2025-10-16] Popular Mechanics highlights the looming Dec 23, 2025, deadline for a national security review of DJI. (↓) — Reinforces the supply chain pressure and legislative risk for DJI, a small deterrent factor for future acquisition by malicious actors.
*   [2024-12-XX] (Hypothetical based on sources) FY25 NDAA is passed, mandating the DJI security review. (↓) — Solidified the legislative pathway toward restricting DJI, initiating the countdown that is now creating market friction.
*   [2024-09-09] U.S. House passes the Countering CCP Drones Act. (↓) — Signaled strong political will to restrict DJI, a key enabler of the current supply chain pressures and a moderate long-term deterrent.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Proliferation of Capability & TTPs:** The war in Ukraine has hyper-accelerated the development and dissemination of drone weaponization techniques. This knowledge is easily accessible online. (Large ↑)
2.  **Low Cost & Accessibility:** Drones are consumer products, evading the strict controls placed on firearms or explosives. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for an attacker. (Large ↑)
3.  **Attacker Anonymity & Standoff Distance:** Drones allow an attacker to strike a target from a distance without a direct line of sight, increasing operational security and the likelihood of escape. (Moderate ↑)
4.  **Vulnerability of Soft Targets:** While C-UAS technology exists, its deployment for widespread civilian protection is minimal. Public gatherings, infrastructure, and VIPs remain highly vulnerable. (Moderate ↑)
5.  **Legislative & Supply Chain Friction:** Efforts to ban Chinese-made drones (specifically DJI) make acquiring the most popular and user-friendly platforms more difficult and expensive. (Small ↓)
6.  **Law Enforcement Disruption:** U.S. intelligence and law enforcement have a strong track record of disrupting complex terrorist plots before they are executed. (Moderate ↓)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Tactical Knowledge Transfer:** Unlike past novel threats (e.g., sarin gas), the TTPs for drone warfare are not secret; they are being refined daily in a major conflict and shared globally in near real-time.
*   **Consumer-Grade Weaponization:** The threat comes from modifying readily available consumer electronics, not from acquiring military-grade or highly controlled precursor materials. This bypasses traditional counter-proliferation regimes.
*   **Shift to Domestic Lone Actor Threat:** The primary threat profile, according to the FBI/DHS, is not a complex, foreign-directed plot (which has a higher disruption rate) but a lone actor or small cell inspired by online propaganda.
*   **Targeted Legislative Countermeasures:** The specific, ongoing legislative action against DJI is a novel countermeasure not present in historical reference periods for other weapons.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<1%) based on the historical rate of zero for this specific event type and the low rate of any casualty-producing terror attacks in the U.S. (Equivalent n > 100, reflecting strong evidence of the status quo).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Proliferation of TTPs from Ukraine drastically increases *capability*.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Vulnerability of soft targets and attacker advantages increase the *opportunity*.
    *   (↑ Small) Continued propaganda from FTOs/DVEs shows persistent *intent*.
    *   (↓ Small) Legislative action against DJI introduces minor *friction* on acquisition.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The strong historical record of plot disruption by law enforcement remains a key mitigator.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for increased capability and opportunity is substantial and should significantly push the probability up from the near-zero historical base rate. The posterior should be considerably higher than the prior, but remain low in absolute terms.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Specific, credible propaganda from ISIS, Al-Qaeda, or DVE groups explicitly calling for drone attacks in the U.S. and providing U.S.-specific TTPs.
    *   A foiled drone plot in the U.S. that progressed to the stage of acquiring/weaponizing a drone.
    *   A successful drone terror attack causing injury/death in a peer nation (e.g., UK, Canada, Australia).
    *   Reports of DVEs experimenting with or training on FPV drones.
*   **DOWN indicators

To forecast the probability of an aerial drone terrorist attack resulting in injury or death in the United States before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Historical Frequency of Terrorist Attacks in the U.S.:** The base rate for successful terrorist attacks causing casualties in the U.S. is low, with fewer than 10 such attacks in most years post-9/11. The base rate for attacks using novel weapons, including drones, is even lower, with no recorded incidents of drone attacks causing injury or death in the U.S. to date. Therefore, the initial prior probability is very low, around 1%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation shares the low historical frequency of successful terrorist attacks in the U.S., especially with novel weapons.
- **Differences:** The proliferation of drone technology and tactics from the Ukraine conflict, combined with the ease of acquiring and weaponizing drones, presents a new risk factor not present in historical data.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Proliferation of TTPs from Ukraine:** The widespread dissemination of drone weaponization techniques increases the likelihood of such an attack (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
- **Ease of Access to Drones:** The low cost and accessibility of drones increase the likelihood of an attack (P(E | H) > P(E | ~H)).
- **Legislative Actions Against DJI:** The potential ban on DJI drones introduces some friction, slightly decreasing the likelihood (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
- **Law Enforcement Disruption:** The strong track record of U.S. law enforcement in disrupting plots decreases the likelihood (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1% probability translates to odds of 1:99.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios for increased capability and opportunity are significant, while the mitigating factors are moderate.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:** Adjusting the prior odds with the likelihood ratios results in a posterior probability higher than the prior but still low in absolute terms.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must account for the unprecedented nature of drone proliferation and the potential for lone actors.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a successful attack in a peer nation influencing U.S. risk.
- **Adjustment:** Given the evidence, the probability should be adjusted upwards from the base rate but remain cautious due to mitigating factors.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Calibrated Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and adjustments, the final probability reflects a cautious increase from the historical base rate.

Final: 10%

# Will an aerial drone terrorist attack result in an injury or death in the United States before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a drone terrorist attack causing injury or death in the US before 2026 (approximately 14 months from now).

The most appropriate base rate comes from examining:
- Historical frequency of terrorist attacks causing casualties in the US
- Historical frequency of drone-based attacks specifically
- Rate of novel weapon adoption in terrorism

Based on the research report, there have been **zero recorded terrorist attacks using aerial drones that caused injury or death in the US to date**. The report indicates that successful terrorist attacks with casualties in the US are "extremely rare, averaging less than one per year over the last decade," and attacks with novel weapons are even rarer.

Given this historical data, I'll set a very low prior probability of **1%** for this event. This reflects:
- The zero historical instances of successful drone terrorist attacks in the US
- The generally low rate of successful terrorist attacks in the US
- The additional complexity of using a novel weapon system

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- US counterterrorism capabilities remain strong, with a good track record of disrupting plots before execution
- The general difficulty of executing successful terrorist attacks in the US persists
- Legal barriers to acquiring explosive materials remain in place

**Differences from base case:**
- **Increased accessibility**: Commercial drones are now widely available, affordable ($2,000 for high-quality models), and less regulated than firearms
- **Knowledge proliferation**: The Ukraine war has served as an "open-source R&D lab" with weaponization techniques widely shared online
- **Tactical advantages**: Drones allow attackers to maintain distance from targets, potentially evading traditional security measures
- **Soft target vulnerability**: Current counter-drone systems are primarily deployed at high-security sites, leaving many public areas vulnerable

These differences significantly increase both capability and opportunity for potential attackers compared to the historical base case.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Proliferation of drone weaponization knowledge from Ukraine**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - If a drone attack occurs, it's highly likely that knowledge from Ukraine would have contributed
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - This knowledge exists regardless, but without an attack
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.9 (strong increase in probability)

**Evidence 2: Low barriers to entry (cost, accessibility, regulation)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A successful attack would almost certainly leverage these advantages
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - These conditions exist regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.36 (moderate increase in probability)

**Evidence 3: Vulnerability of soft targets to drone attacks**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - An attack would likely target vulnerable areas
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - These vulnerabilities exist regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.29 (moderate increase in probability)

**Evidence 4: Legislative action against DJI drones**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.6) - An attack might still occur despite these restrictions
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - These restrictions are happening regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.75 (small decrease in probability)

**Evidence 5: Strong US law enforcement disruption capabilities**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If an attack occurs, it means law enforcement failed to disrupt it
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Law enforcement regularly disrupts plots
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38 (significant decrease in probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior odds = 0.01/0.99 = 0.0101

Updating with Evidence 1 (knowledge proliferation):
Posterior odds = 0.0101 × 1.9 = 0.0192
Posterior probability = 0.0192/(1+0.0192) = 0.0188 or ~1.9%

Updating with Evidence 2 (low barriers):
Posterior odds = 0.0192 × 1.36 = 0.0261
Posterior probability = 0.0261/(1+0.0261) = 0.0254 or ~2.5%

Updating with Evidence 3 (soft target vulnerability):
Posterior odds = 0.0254 × 1.29 = 0.0328
Posterior probability = 0.0328/(1+0.0328) = 0.0318 or ~3.2%

Updating with Evidence 4 (DJI restrictions):
Posterior odds = 0.0318 × 0.75 = 0.0239
Posterior probability = 0.0239/(1+0.0239) = 0.0233 or ~2.3%

Updating with Evidence 5 (law enforcement capabilities):
Posterior odds = 0.0233 × 0.38 = 0.0089
Posterior probability = 0.0089/(1+0.0089) = 0.0088 or ~0.9%

This seems too low given the significant capability and opportunity factors. Let me reconsider the strength of the evidence and the likelihood ratios.

The combined effect of the first three pieces of evidence (knowledge proliferation, low barriers, and target vulnerability) creates a substantially new threat landscape that wasn't present in the historical base rate. I believe I've underestimated their impact.

Let me adjust my calculation with more appropriate likelihood ratios:

Starting again with prior of 1% (odds of 1:99 = 0.0101)

Combined update for increased capability and opportunity (Evidence 1-3):
Likelihood ratio: ~4.0 (substantial increase reflecting the unprecedented nature of this threat)
Posterior odds = 0.0101 × 4.0 = 0.0404
Posterior probability = 0.0404/(1+0.0404) = 0.0388 or ~3.9%

Updating with Evidence 4 (DJI restrictions):
Posterior odds = 0.0388 × 0.8 = 0.0310
Posterior probability = 0.0310/(1+0.0310) = 0.0301 or ~3.0%

Updating with Evidence 5 (law enforcement capabilities):
Posterior odds = 0.0301 × 0.5 = 0.0151
Posterior probability = 0.0151/(1+0.0151) = 0.0149 or ~1.5%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of knowledge transfer from Ukraine, which represents an unprecedented dissemination of tactical knowledge
- I might be overestimating the effectiveness of US law enforcement in disrupting plots involving this novel attack vector
- I haven't fully accounted for the potential of lone-wolf actors who are harder to detect than organized groups
- The time horizon (14 months) is significant - giving potential attackers substantial time to plan and execute

**Alternative forecast and rebuttals:**
- A higher forecast (10-15%) would argue that the combination of capability, opportunity, and intent creates a substantial risk that hasn't been properly accounted for in my analysis
- Rebuttal: While the capability exists, the historical pattern shows extremely few successful terrorist attacks in the US, suggesting strong systemic barriers
- Counter-rebuttal: Novel attack vectors can bypass existing security systems designed for conventional threats

**Tail risks:**
- A successful drone attack abroad could inspire copycat attacks in the US
- Terrorist organizations might specifically prioritize drone attacks as a way to demonstrate technological sophistication
- The ongoing legislative efforts against DJI might create a "now or never" urgency for actors who already possess these drones

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast of 1.5% is too low. The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 15.4%, which seems high given the historical base rate, but indicates that others see substantial risk factors.

I'll adjust my forecast upward to account for these considerations, particularly the unprecedented nature of the threat landscape and the relatively long time horizon.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors - the zero historical base rate, the significantly increased capability and opportunity, the continued strong US security posture, and the time horizon of 14 months - I arrive at a final probability of 8%.

This reflects:
- A substantial increase from the near-zero historical base rate
- Recognition of the unprecedented nature of this threat vector
- Acknowledgment of the continued effectiveness of US counterterrorism efforts
- The relatively short time horizon (14 months)
- Alignment with the community forecast direction, though more conservative

Final: 8%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is successful terrorist attacks in the United States using novel or unconventional weapons that result in casualties. The narrowest class (drone attacks causing casualties) has a historical frequency of zero, which is an unhelpful starting point.
*   **Historical Frequency:** Data from the post-9/11 era shows that successful attacks with unconventional weapons (chemical, biological, complex explosives) are exceptionally rare. A reasonable estimate is a rate (λ) of approximately 0.1 such events per year.
*   **Timeframe Adjustment:** The question resolves "before 2026," and the current date is October 21, 2025. This leaves approximately 71 days, or 0.195 years.
*   **Prior Calculation:** Using a Poisson distribution, the probability of at least one event in this timeframe is P(H) = 1 - e^(-λt) = 1 - e^(-0.1 * 0.195) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.0195) ≈ 1.93%.
*   **Initial Prior:** I will set the initial prior probability at **2%**. This reflects the historical rarity of a successful unconventional attack occurring in the short remaining timeframe.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The United States maintains a robust and effective counter-terrorism and intelligence apparatus. This has historically been very successful at disrupting plots, which is a factor baked into the low base rate.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the unprecedented **democratization of capability**.
    *   **Knowledge Transfer:** The war in Ukraine has served as a real-world, open-source laboratory for weaponizing consumer drones. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are widely disseminated online, drastically lowering the technical skill required compared to building a chemical or biological weapon.
    *   **Accessibility:** The required hardware consists of consumer electronics that are cheap, legal, and readily available, bypassing the strict controls on firearms or explosive precursors.
    *   **Attacker Profile:** This new accessibility makes the tactic particularly suitable for lone actors or small cells, which are traditionally harder for intelligence agencies to detect and disrupt than larger, more complex conspiracies.

These differences strongly suggest that the historical base rate for "unconventional attacks" is likely too low for this specific threat.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event that a drone attack with casualties occurs before 2026. Let ~H be the event that it does not.

*   **Evidence 1: Proliferation of Drone Weaponization TTPs from Ukraine.**
    *   This evidence dramatically increases the *capability* of potential attackers. It makes the world in which H occurs far more plausible than the historical baseline suggests.
    *   P(E1 | H) is very high; a successful attacker would almost certainly leverage this accessible knowledge.
    *   P(E1 | ~H) is also high, as the knowledge exists whether or not an attack occurs.
    *   The key is that this evidence fundamentally changes the environment from which the base rate was drawn. It acts as a strong multiplier on the base rate. I estimate the Likelihood Ratio (LR) of this environmental shift to be substantial, perhaps between 5 and 10, meaning this threat is 5-10 times more likely than a generic unconventional weapon threat. This is a strong update **increasing** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: No successful attack in the first ~19 months of the resolution period.**
    *   This is strong evidence that the actual rate of such attacks, even in the new environment, remains low. If the rate were high, we would likely have seen an event (or a late-stage foiled plot) already.
    *   This evidence tempers the upward update from Evidence 1 and reinforces that while the threat is elevated, successful execution is still a rare event. This acts to **decrease** the probability from what it might have been at the start of the period. (Note: This is already incorporated by applying the rate to the short remaining time).

*   **Evidence 3: Legislative/Supply Chain Friction against DJI Drones.**
    *   The "Countering CCP Drones Act" and resulting supply shortages for DJI, the market leader, add a minor barrier for attackers. They may have to use less capable drones or find DJI models on a secondary market.
    *   P(E3 | H) < P(E3 | ~H). This evidence makes an attack slightly less likely.
    *   The LR is slightly less than 1. This is a small update **decreasing** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(H) = 2%, which corresponds to prior odds of 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 1:49.

2.  **Update for the "New Environment" (Evidence 1):** The core of the argument is that drone attacks are no longer in the same category as other "unconventional" attacks. The lowered barriers to entry and execution represent a fundamental shift. I'll use a conservative multiplier (Likelihood Ratio) of 7 to represent this shift.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1:49) × 7 = 7:49.
    *   Updated Probability = 7 / (7 + 49) = 7 / 56 = 12.5%.

3.  **Update for Minor Friction (Evidence 3):** The legislative action against DJI introduces a small hurdle. Let's apply a small downward modifier, reducing the probability by about 10% (equivalent to an LR of ~0.9).
    *   Final Probability ≈ 12.5% * 0.9 = 11.25%.

This step-by-step update moves the probability from a very low base rate of 2% to a final estimate of around 11-12%, reflecting a significantly elevated but still unlikely threat in the short remaining time.

*   **Argument for a Higher Probability (>12%):** The community forecast is higher (~15%). I might be underestimating the "lone actor" factor. A single, motivated individual can now access capabilities that previously required a sophisticated group. The low bar of "injury" (not death) makes a successful attack easier to achieve with a small, crude payload. Perhaps the risk is not constant but is increasing, making the final 71 days the most dangerous part of the entire period.
*   **Argument for a Lower Probability (<12%):** My 7x multiplier might be too aggressive. While TTPs are online, successfully building and deploying a weaponized drone without error or detection is still a significant challenge. The lack of any late-stage foiled plots in the US involving this specific method is telling; it suggests very few are even attempting it. Furthermore, the community forecast may not have fully updated for the fact that ~90% of the question's timeframe has passed without an incident.
*   **Conclusion:** My estimate of ~12% seems like a reasonable balance. It's significantly higher than the historical base rate would suggest, acknowledging the new threat landscape. However, it remains below the community forecast, giving weight to the strong counter-evidence that no such attack has yet occurred despite the capability being present for some time.

### Final Forecast

My analysis begins with a low base rate of 2% for an unconventional attack in the remaining ~70-day period. I then apply a significant upward update (a multiplier of ~7x) to account for the uniquely accessible nature of weaponized drone technology and knowledge, a factor that makes this threat far more plausible than historical precedents. This is slightly tempered by minor friction from legislative action against DJI drones. The resulting probability acknowledges a substantially increased risk but recognizes that a successful attack remains an unlikely event.

Final: 12%
