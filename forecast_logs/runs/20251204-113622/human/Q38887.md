### Reference class & base rates
-   **Waymo's own state expansion history:** This is the most relevant reference class. Waymo began rider-only service in Arizona (1 state) in 2020. It expanded to California (2 states) in 2023 and Texas (3 states) in 2024. This establishes a base rate of approximately **0.5 to 1 new state per year**. This rate is lumpy and reflects a multi-year process of mapping, testing, regulatory engagement, and scaling for each new location.
-   **New market entry for capital-intensive tech services:** This class includes services like initial 4G/5G rollouts or Starlink's country-by-country availability. These rollouts are constrained by physical hardware, local regulations, and significant capital expenditure. The base rate is slow and sequential, typically adding a few major markets per year, not dozens. This suggests a low number is likely.
-   **Ride-hailing service (Uber/Lyft) expansion:** This is a weaker, but informative, reference class. Uber/Lyft expanded very rapidly, but they leveraged existing infrastructure (cars, drivers, roads) and faced fewer novel regulatory hurdles. Waymo's model is fundamentally different due to the need to deploy and manage its own fleet and solve complex, location-specific technical challenges. This class suggests what's possible under fewer constraints, highlighting why Waymo's pace is necessarily slower.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-18] Waymo announces a planned expansion of its service territory to include the entire city of Austin, TX, by Q1 2026. — **↓** — This signals a focus on deepening operations in an existing state (TX) rather than entering a new one.
-   [2025-10-22] Media reports indicate Waymo has begun initial mapping operations in Atlanta, Georgia. — **↔** — While this identifies a potential 4th state, the historical timeline from mapping to public launch is over 12 months, making a Jan 1, 2026 launch highly improbable.
-   [2025-09-15] The California DMV releases its annual autonomous vehicle disengagement report, showing Waymo with continued strong safety metrics relative to competitors. — **↑** — Positive safety data strengthens the case for continued operation and future expansion, but has a small, indirect effect on the short-term timeline.
-   [2025-08-05] Waymo announces a new partnership with a major grocery chain for autonomous deliveries in the Phoenix metro area. — **↓** — This represents vertical expansion within an established market, diverting resources that could otherwise be used for horizontal expansion to new states.
-   [2025-07-01] A bill in the Florida legislature aimed at streamlining autonomous ride-hailing regulations fails to pass before the session ends. — **↓** — Highlights that even in potentially friendly states, the regulatory pathway is not guaranteed and can cause delays, reducing the probability of a surprise launch.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **State & Local Regulatory Approval (Large):** This is the primary gatekeeper. Each new state requires navigating a unique legal and political landscape. A lack of clear legislation or an outright ban is a hard stop. A permissive environment is a prerequisite but does not guarantee a launch.
-   **Mapping & Validation (Large):** Waymo must extensively map every street in a new operational design domain (ODD) and validate its system's performance in local conditions (e.g., unique intersection types, local driving norms). This process takes many months.
-   **Capital Allocation from Alphabet (Large):** Expansion is extremely expensive (vehicles, staff, facilities). Alphabet's willingness to continue funding Waymo's significant losses directly dictates the pace and scale of expansion.
-   **Fleet Availability & Logistics (Moderate):** Launching in a new city requires deploying, maintaining, and operating a fleet of hundreds of specialized vehicles. This is a significant operational lift that cannot be done overnight.
-   **Major Safety Incidents (Large):** A significant at-fault crash involving a Waymo vehicle, or even a competitor's, could trigger a regulatory crackdown, investigations, and a freeze on all expansion activities (as seen with Cruise in late 2023).
-   **Geographic & Climate Complexity (Moderate):** Waymo has thus far focused on "Sun Belt" cities with relatively mild weather. Expanding to states with significant snow, ice, or other adverse weather presents a major technical hurdle that likely requires a longer validation period.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The forecast resolves in under one month (Dec 4, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026). Given the long lead times for a new state launch (regulatory approval, mapping, fleet deployment), a new launch would almost certainly have been publicly announced by now. The lack of such an announcement is a powerful piece of evidence.
-   **Post-Cruise Competitive Landscape:** The dramatic failure and subsequent pause of competitor Cruise has made regulators more cautious but has also solidified Waymo's position as the market leader. This may give them more leverage in regulatory discussions but also incentivizes a cautious, "don't mess it up" approach to expansion.
-   **Focus on Operational Depth:** Recent announcements suggest a strategic shift from rapid geographic expansion ("going wide") to improving service and expanding ODDs within existing cities ("going deep"). This maximizes revenue and operational efficiency in proven markets before taking on new ones.
-   **Mature Technology Stack:** Waymo's technology is more mature than in its early days, which could theoretically shorten the technical validation period for new cities that are geographically similar to existing ones. However, this speed-up has not yet overcome the regulatory and logistical bottlenecks.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** The current number of states is 3 (AZ, CA, TX). Given the slow, observable base rate of ~0.5-1 state/year, the prior should be very heavily concentrated on 3. A plausible prior distribution might be P(3) = 0.95, P(4) = 0.05, P(<3) ≈ 0, P(>4) ≈ 0. This reflects a strong belief in the status quo over a short period, with an equivalent n of ~20.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The resolution date is less than a month away, and there has been no public announcement of an imminent launch in a new state.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Recent company actions (expanding in Austin, new partnerships in Phoenix) indicate a focus on deepening existing markets, not entering new ones.
    -   (↔ Small) Initial mapping in a potential 4th state (Georgia) is consistent with the long-term base rate but makes a launch within this forecast's horizon virtually impossible.
    -   (↓ Small) The failure of pro-AV legislation in other states reinforces that the regulatory path remains a significant, time-consuming hurdle.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior probability for the outcome being 3 should increase, moving closer to 1. The small probability assigned to 4 should decrease significantly.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   An official press release from Waymo announcing the immediate public launch in a new state (e.g., "Waymo One now open to the public in Atlanta"). This is the only indicator that truly matters.
    -   A joint announcement from Waymo and a state governor's office about an imminent launch.
    -   Sudden, large-scale movement of Waymo vehicles to a new, unannounced city, reported by local media.

-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Waymo blog post detailing Q1 2026 plans that focuses exclusively on existing markets.
    -   Any safety incident involving a Waymo vehicle that requires a fleet-wide pause or investigation.
    -   Alphabet Q4 earnings call (if it happens before resolution) emphasizing cost controls and a "disciplined" approach for Other Bets.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution requires service to be available to the "general public." A launch limited to employees, "trusted testers," or a waitlist in a new state would not count.
-   **Surprise "Paper Launch":** Waymo could technically launch in a very small, geofenced area of a new city just to claim a new state, but this is contrary to their established pattern of launching with a meaningful service area.
-   **Information Asymmetry:** We lack inside knowledge

To forecast the number of US states where Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available to the general public on January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** Waymo's historical expansion rate is approximately 0.5 to 1 new state per year. As of early 2024, Waymo operates in 3 states: Arizona, California, and Texas.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Given the historical rate and current operations, the base rate suggests a strong concentration on 3 states, with a small probability of expanding to a 4th state by January 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current situation aligns with the historical base rate, as Waymo has not announced any new state launches beyond Texas.
- **Difference:** The extremely short time horizon (less than a month) makes it unlikely for a new state launch to occur without prior public announcement.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **No Public Announcement:** The absence of a public announcement for a new state launch within the next month strongly suggests no expansion beyond the current 3 states.
- **Focus on Existing Markets:** Recent activities indicate a focus on deepening operations in existing states rather than expanding to new ones.
- **Mapping in Georgia:** While mapping in Georgia suggests potential future expansion, it is unlikely to result in a launch by January 2026.
- **Regulatory and Operational Hurdles:** The failure of pro-AV legislation in Florida and the complexity of launching in new states further reduce the likelihood of expansion within the forecast period.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior Distribution:** P(3 states) = 0.95, P(4 states) = 0.05.
- **Evidence Impact:** The evidence strongly supports the prior, reinforcing the likelihood of remaining at 3 states.
- **Posterior Distribution:** The probability of 3 states increases further, with a negligible chance of expanding to 4 states.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise announcement or a small-scale launch in a new state. However, this is unlikely given Waymo's historical patterns and the lack of indicators.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden regulatory change or strategic shift could alter the forecast, but these are low-probability events within the short timeframe.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecast is heavily skewed towards 3 states, with minimal probability for 4 states. The percentiles reflect this concentration:

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 3  
P80: 3  
P90: 3

# Forecasting Waymo's State Expansion by January 1, 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use Waymo's historical expansion rate as the primary base rate:
- 2020: Arizona (1 state)
- 2023: Added California (2 states total)
- 2024: Added Texas (3 states total)

This shows a pattern of approximately 0.5-1 states per year, with a current baseline of 3 states.

The mean of this prior is 3 states, with a very narrow variance given the short time horizon (less than 1 month until resolution) and the lengthy process required for new state launches.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Waymo continues to operate under the same business model and regulatory framework
- The technical challenges of mapping and validating new territories remain consistent
- Capital requirements for expansion remain high

**Differences from base case:**
- Extremely short time horizon (less than 1 month until resolution)
- Recent evidence suggests a strategic focus on deepening existing markets rather than expanding to new states
- The post-Cruise regulatory environment may have increased caution among both regulators and Waymo

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Key evidence affecting the forecast:

1. **No announced expansion plans for new states by January 2026** (↓↓↓)
   - Given the short timeframe and Waymo's pattern of announcing expansions months in advance, this strongly suggests no new states by January 1
   - Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors 3 states over 4+ states (10:1)

2. **Focus on expanding within existing states** (↓↓)
   - Recent announcement about expanding service in Austin, TX indicates resources directed to deepening rather than widening
   - Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors 3 states over 4+ states (3:1)

3. **Initial mapping in Georgia** (↑)
   - Shows potential future expansion, but mapping-to-launch typically takes 12+ months
   - Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors future expansion but not within this timeframe (1:1.2)

4. **Regulatory hurdles in other states** (↓)
   - Failed legislation in Florida demonstrates ongoing regulatory challenges
   - Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors status quo (2:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior heavily concentrated on 3 states (P(3) = 0.95, P(4) = 0.05):

First update using the strongest evidence - no announced expansion plans:
- Prior: P(3) = 0.95, P(4) = 0.05
- Likelihood ratio: 10:1 favoring 3 states
- Posterior: P(3) ≈ 0.995, P(4) ≈ 0.005

Second update using focus on existing markets:
- Prior: P(3) ≈ 0.995, P(4) ≈ 0.005
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1 favoring 3 states
- Posterior: P(3) ≈ 0.998, P(4) ≈ 0.002

The posterior distribution is now even more concentrated on 3 states, with only a tiny probability of 4 states, and effectively zero probability for other values.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Surprise announcement**: Waymo could make a last-minute announcement about a new state launch. However, this would be highly unusual given their historical pattern and the operational complexity.

2. **Definition of "available"**: The question specifies "available to the general public." Waymo sometimes launches with limited availability or waitlists, which might not qualify.

3. **Potential for contraction**: While unlikely, there's a small possibility Waymo could exit a market due to regulatory issues or strategic realignment, reducing the count below 3.

4. **Information asymmetry**: As an external observer, I lack inside information about Waymo's immediate plans.

Given these considerations, I should maintain a small but non-zero probability for outcomes other than 3 states, particularly allowing for a small chance of 4 states and an even smaller chance of 2 states.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the extremely short time horizon and the strong evidence pointing to status quo, my distribution is heavily concentrated around 3 states, with minimal probability mass elsewhere.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is Waymo's own history of state-level expansion for its rider-only service.
- **2020:** Launched in 1 state (Arizona).
- **2023:** Expanded to a 2nd state (California).
- **2024:** Expanded to a 3rd state (Texas).

This establishes a historical rate of approximately 0.5 to 1 new state per year. This process is slow and lumpy due to significant operational, technical, and regulatory hurdles in each new market. Given the current number of states is 3, and the forecast horizon is extremely short (less than one month), my prior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated on the status quo. A strong prior would be P(N=3) > 99%, with a tiny probability assigned to any change.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is fundamentally similar to the base case in that the major constraints on expansion—regulation, capital, mapping, and fleet logistics—remain in place. However, the situation is critically different due to the **extremely short time horizon**. The forecast is for January 1, 2026, and the provided context is dated December 4, 2025. A new state launch is a multi-month, if not multi-year, process. Any launch planned for January 1 would have been publicly announced and in a visible "trusted tester" phase well before December. The lack of such an announcement is a powerful signal that no launch is imminent.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several pieces of evidence, all of which reinforce the "no change" hypothesis.

-   **Evidence for No Change (Strong):** The resolution date is less than one month away. The long lead times required for a new state launch make a surprise launch in this window virtually impossible. The absence of a public announcement of an imminent launch is the strongest piece of evidence.
-   **Evidence for No Change (Moderate):** Recent company actions, such as expanding service within Austin (Nov 2025) and forming new delivery partnerships in Phoenix (Aug 2025), indicate a strategic focus on "going deep" in existing markets rather than "going wide" into new ones. This diverts resources and attention from new state expansion.
-   **Evidence for No Change (Moderate):** The report of initial mapping in Atlanta (Oct 2025) actually works against a near-term launch. It confirms that Georgia is a potential future market but also highlights that the process is in its earliest stages. Historically, the gap between initial mapping and public launch is well over a year.
-   **Evidence for No Change (Weak):** The failure of a pro-AV bill in Florida (Jul 2025) serves as a general reminder that the regulatory pathway is a significant and unpredictable bottleneck, making rapid, unannounced expansion unlikely.

There is no credible evidence pointing toward an increase or decrease from the current number of 3 states within the given timeframe.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
-   **Prior:** P(N=3) ≈ 99.9%, P(N≠3) ≈ 0.1%. This reflects the high inertia of the system over a short period.
-   **Likelihoods:** All the evidence presented is highly consistent with the outcome being 3 (L(Evidence | N=3) ≈ 1) and extremely inconsistent with the outcome being 4 or 2 (L(Evidence | N≠3) ≈ 0). A launch in a 4th state would require a secret, parallel effort that contradicts all public signals of the company's focus. A shutdown in an existing state would require a sudden, major negative event, for which there is no evidence.
-   **Posterior:** Applying the likelihoods to the already strong prior results in a posterior distribution that is even more sharply peaked at 3. The probability of the number of states being exactly 3 by January 1, 2026, is extremely high, well over 99.9%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Alternative Scenario (N=4):** Could Waymo execute a "surprise launch"? They might have been secretly preparing a fourth state in a very permissive regulatory environment and could announce it in late December. This would be a major departure from their established, cautious rollout strategy. Given the post-Cruise regulatory scrutiny, such a move would be risky and is therefore highly improbable.
-   **Alternative Scenario (N=2):** Could Waymo be forced to shut down service in one state? A major at-fault accident or a sudden regulatory reversal (like what Cruise experienced) could trigger a suspension. While this is a non-zero tail risk for any AV company, the provided evidence of "continued strong safety metrics" (Sep 2025) makes this extremely unlikely to occur in the next 28 days.
-   **Conclusion:** Both alternative scenarios are plausible in the abstract but are extremely low-probability events within the specific, short timeframe of this question. The central forecast of 3 is robust. The distribution is not a normal curve; it is a very sharp spike at N=3. Therefore, all percentiles from P10 to P90 should fall on this single value.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the number of states will not change from the current count of three in the less-than-one-month period before resolution. The long lead times for expansion and the lack of any announcements make an increase to four states a remote possibility. Similarly, a decrease to two states would require an unforeseen negative catalyst, which is also a remote tail risk. The probability distribution is thus extremely concentrated on the number 3.
