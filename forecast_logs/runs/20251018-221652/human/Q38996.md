### Reference class & base rates
1.  **US Export Controls on Novel Dual-Use Technologies:** The primary reference class is the history of the US government placing export controls on new, powerful technologies with both civilian and military applications. This includes encryption software in the 1990s (the "Crypto Wars") and, more recently, advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and high-performance computing chips.
    *   **Base Rate:** New categories of widely available software are added to the Commerce Control List (CCL) or similar restrictive regimes infrequently. Over a two-year period, the probability of a specific, novel software category like this being restricted is low, perhaps in the **10-20% range**. This is because such controls face significant industry pushback, require a lengthy regulatory process, and are often seen as a last resort.
2.  **Geofencing of Digital Content/Services:** This class includes services like Netflix, Spotify, or even Google/Meta services in certain countries. The *mechanism* (restricting access by geography) is analogous.
    *   **Base Rate:** High. Companies do this all the time. However, the *driver* is completely different. It's typically for commercial reasons (copyright licensing, market segmentation) or compliance with foreign laws, not a unilateral US national security mandate. Therefore, this class is a poor guide for the probability of a US *law* forcing the action, but it confirms the technical feasibility of such restrictions (albeit imperfectly, due to VPNs).
3.  **Sanctions Regimes on Digital Services:** The US has required companies to block access to services (including software and APIs) in sanctioned countries like Iran, North Korea, and Cuba.
    *   **Base Rate:** This is a targeted, foreign-policy tool, not a global restriction on a technology class. The probability of a country being added to the sanctions list is event-driven. The probability of a *technology* being restricted globally *outside the US* is not well-represented by this class. It shows a precedent for restricting access, but under very different circumstances.

Limitations: Generative AI is novel. Its intangibility, rapid proliferation via open-source, and central role in US tech competitiveness make it a poor fit for historical analogies based on hardware or more contained software.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-15** Bipartisan group of senators sends letter to the Commerce and Defense Departments urging action on "unfettered access to frontier AI by strategic rivals." — ↑ — Signals growing, high-level political will in Congress for some form of control, even if legislation is unlikely.
*   **2025-08-20** A major US AI lab voluntarily announces it will use "best-effort" geofencing on its next-generation model's API, citing safety concerns. — ↓ — Voluntary industry action can serve as a release valve for regulatory pressure, making a legal mandate less likely as it appears the industry is self-policing.
*   **2025-07-10** The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) closes a Request for Information (RFI) on the risks of AI model exports. — ↑ — Indicates the primary regulatory body for export controls is actively gathering information needed to formulate rules, a necessary precursor to any legal restriction.
*   **2025-05-22** A widely publicized report demonstrates a state-of-the-art open-source model achieving near-parity with top proprietary models on several key benchmarks. — ↓ — The proliferation of powerful, uncontrollable open-source models makes restricting access to US-based proprietary APIs seem less effective and more economically self-harming.
*   **2025-04-05** A sophisticated cyberattack on critical infrastructure is credibly attributed to a foreign actor leveraging a US-based commercial AI API for vulnerability discovery. — ↑ — A concrete "focusing event" that provides national security agencies with a powerful argument for immediate restrictions.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **National Security "Focusing Event" (Large ↑):** A catastrophic misuse of a US-based AI API by a foreign adversary (e.g., in a biological agent design, a major cyberattack, or a highly effective disinformation campaign). This is the most potent driver and could trigger rapid executive action, bypassing legislative slowness.
2.  **Executive Action via Existing Authority (Moderate ↑):** The President could use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) or direct the Commerce Department to use the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to classify frontier models or their APIs as controlled dual-use technology. This is much faster than new legislation.
3.  **Intense Industry Lobbying (Large ↓):** US AI companies' business models rely on global scale. They would lobby intensely against restrictions that cede the international market to foreign competitors and open-source alternatives, arguing it harms US economic and technological leadership.
4.  **Technical Infeasibility/Circumvention (Moderate ↓):** Policymakers may be convinced that restrictions are futile due to the ease of circumvention via VPNs, cloud providers in third-party countries, and other methods. The ineffectiveness would not be worth the economic cost.
5.  **Legislative Gridlock (Large ↓):** The timeline to resolution (Dec 31, 2025) is extremely short. Passing any new, complex, and contentious technology law through a divided Congress in this timeframe is highly improbable.
6.  **Proliferation of Open-Source Models (Moderate ↓):** As powerful open-source models proliferate globally, the strategic benefit of restricting access to only US proprietary models diminishes significantly, weakening the case for such a self-limiting policy.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Speed of Capability Gains:** Unlike prior technologies, AI capabilities are advancing exponentially, creating a sense of urgency among policymakers that might override normal procedural slowness.
*   **Intangibility and Proliferation:** Unlike semiconductor equipment (hardware) or even 90s-era encryption code (which was harder to distribute), AI models are intangible and can be accessed from anywhere. Open-source alternatives are a major countervailing force not present in the same way for past controlled technologies.
*   **Centrality to Economic Competitiveness:** AI is seen as the core technology for future economic growth. US policymakers are highly sensitive to ceding leadership to China, making economically damaging controls on US champions (like OpenAI, Google) a much harder sell than controls on a more niche industry.
*   **Lack of Clear "Weapon" Analogy:** While AI has dual-use potential, it's not a direct weapon. This ambiguity makes it harder to fit into existing export control frameworks (like ITAR or EAR) which were designed for more tangible goods and software with clear military applications.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the reference class of new export controls on dual-use software, a prior of ~15% seems reasonable (equivalent n of ~7 observations, with 1 "success").
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Heightened national security discourse and specific "focusing events" (cyberattacks) provide a strong *motive* for action. (Moderate ↑)
    *   (↓) The extremely short timeline to resolution makes a legislative path nearly impossible. (Large ↓)
    *   (↓) The availability of executive authority is countered by the immense economic and diplomatic blowback expected, raising the bar for its use. (Small ↓)
    *   (↓) Intense, unified lobbying from the most powerful sector of the US economy creates a formidable barrier. (Large ↓)
    *   (↓) The proliferation of powerful open-source models undermines the strategic logic of the policy. (Moderate ↓)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence points strongly downward. The practical barriers (short timeline, industry opposition, open-source alternatives) are more concrete and powerful than the upward pressure from security concerns, which have not yet overcome the high activation energy for such a drastic policy. The posterior should move significantly down from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A specific notice of proposed rulemaking from the Commerce Department's BIS to add "frontier AI models" to the Commerce Control List.
    *   A high-profile, catastrophic event (e.g., AI-assisted terror attack) is directly and publicly linked to a US company's API.
    *   Draft legislation for AI API restrictions is introduced with strong bipartisan sponsorship.
    *   The President or National Security Advisor publicly states they are considering "all options" to prevent AI misuse by adversaries, specifically mentioning export controls.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Major AI labs (e.g., Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) announce a new, robust joint framework for voluntary safety measures, including user verification and geofencing.
    *   A major international agreement on AI safety and access is announced, favoring multilateral approaches over unilateral US action.
    *   A powerful, non-US-based open-source model (e.g., from China or the EU) is released and gains massive global adoption.
    *   Key congressional leaders in technology committees publicly state that API restrictions would be "ineffective and economically damaging."

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution hinges on "powerful generative AI systems." A law targeting only future, hypothetical "AGI-level" systems is more plausible than one targeting current GPT-4/Gemini-class models. The scope is a major uncertainty.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** The primary driver for a "YES" resolution is a sudden, shocking misuse event. The probability of this is low but non-zero, and it would invalidate any forecast based on the current political and technical environment.
*   **Law vs. Voluntary Action:** The question requires a *US law*. Voluntary, industry-led restrictions, even if widespread, would not trigger a YES resolution. It's crucial to distinguish between government compulsion and corporate policy.
*   **Short Horizon:** With only ~2.5 months to resolution, the inertia of the US regulatory and legislative systems is the single biggest factor. Only an emergency executive action could realistically meet this deadline.
*   **Interpreting "Requires":** A law could be passed that *enables* the executive to create restrictions, but if those restrictions are not actually implemented by Dec 31, 2025, the question would resolve NO. The requirement must be in force.

**Final Research Summary:**
Despite escalating national security concerns about AI, the combination of an extremely short timeline, powerful industry opposition, and the perceived ineffectiveness of such a policy makes a legally mandated restriction on foreign API access highly unlikely before 2026. The most plausible, albeit low-probability, path to a "YES" resolution is a major security shock triggering an emergency executive order.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The primary reference class is the history of the US government placing export controls on new, powerful technologies with both civilian and military applications. The base rate for new categories of widely available software being restricted is low, perhaps in the 10-20% range over a two-year period. This is due to significant industry pushback, lengthy regulatory processes, and the fact that such controls are often seen as a last resort.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a novel technology with potential dual-use implications, similar to past cases like encryption software.
   - Differences: The rapid proliferation of AI, its intangibility, and its central role in US tech competitiveness make it a poor fit for historical analogies based on hardware or more contained software. The timeline to resolution is also very short, making legislative action unlikely.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Bipartisan political will for control (↑): Signals growing political interest, but not necessarily action.
   - Voluntary industry geofencing (↓): Suggests industry self-regulation, reducing the need for legal mandates.
   - BIS information gathering (↑): Indicates regulatory interest but is a preliminary step.
   - Open-source model proliferation (↓): Reduces the strategic benefit of restricting US-based APIs.
   - Cyberattack using US API (↑): Provides a strong argument for restrictions but is countered by other factors.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 15% (0.15/0.85 = 0.176)
   - Likelihood ratios:
     - Political will: Moderate increase
     - Industry self-regulation: Moderate decrease
     - BIS activity: Small increase
     - Open-source proliferation: Moderate decrease
     - Cyberattack: Moderate increase
   - Net effect: The evidence points more towards a decrease due to practical barriers and industry opposition. The posterior probability should move down from the prior.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the impact of a sudden security event.
   - Alternative scenario: A major security incident could trigger emergency executive action.
   - Rebuttal: The short timeline and industry opposition remain significant barriers.
   - Adjustments: Consider the low probability of a "black swan" event but maintain focus on current evidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the base rate, evidence, and red team considerations, the probability of the US restricting API access outside the US before 2026 is low.

Final: 10%

# Will the US restrict access outside the US to some APIs to generative AI before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US implementing legal restrictions on foreign access to generative AI APIs before December 31, 2025.

The most relevant reference class is US export controls on novel dual-use technologies with both civilian and military applications. Looking at historical precedents:

- Encryption software in the 1990s ("Crypto Wars")
- Advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment restrictions (2022-present)
- High-performance computing chip export controls

For a specific new technology category being added to export controls within a ~2-year window, the historical frequency appears to be low. Such controls face significant industry resistance, require lengthy regulatory processes, and are typically implemented as a last resort.

**Prior probability: 15%**

This reflects that while the US does occasionally implement such restrictions, they are relatively rare for entirely new technology categories, especially in short timeframes, and particularly for technologies central to US economic competitiveness.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Generative AI, like encryption, has dual-use potential (beneficial civilian uses and potential national security concerns)
- The US government has expressed concerns about foreign actors misusing advanced US technologies
- There is precedent for restricting access to digital technologies based on geography

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline constraint**: With only ~2.5 months remaining until resolution (Dec 31, 2025), there is extremely limited time for new legislation or even comprehensive regulatory action
- **Economic significance**: Generative AI is central to US tech competitiveness, making self-limiting restrictions potentially more economically damaging than past export controls
- **Technical feasibility**: Unlike physical goods, digital API access restrictions are easily circumvented (VPNs, proxies)
- **Open-source alternatives**: The proliferation of powerful open-source models undermines the effectiveness of API restrictions
- **Industry opposition**: Major US AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) would strongly oppose restrictions that limit their global market access

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence increasing probability:**

1. **Recent security incidents**: The reported April 2025 cyberattack attributed to foreign actors using US AI APIs
   - P(E|H) = 0.8 (If restrictions were coming, we'd expect security incidents as catalysts)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.3 (Such incidents can occur without leading to restrictions)
   - Likelihood ratio: 2.67 (Moderate increase)

2. **BIS Request for Information**: The July 2025 Commerce Department RFI on AI model export risks
   - P(E|H) = 0.9 (Regulatory groundwork would be necessary before restrictions)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.5 (Information gathering happens regularly without leading to restrictions)
   - Likelihood ratio: 1.8 (Small increase)

3. **Congressional pressure**: September 2025 bipartisan letter urging action on AI access by rivals
   - P(E|H) = 0.85 (Political pressure would precede restrictions)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.6 (Congressional letters often don't result in immediate policy changes)
   - Likelihood ratio: 1.42 (Small increase)

**Evidence decreasing probability:**

1. **Voluntary industry action**: August 2025 announcement of voluntary geofencing by a major AI lab
   - P(E|H) = 0.3 (Companies would be less likely to implement voluntary measures if mandatory ones were imminent)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.7 (Voluntary measures are often implemented to prevent regulation)
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.43 (Moderate decrease)

2. **Open-source model parity**: May 2025 report showing open-source models approaching proprietary performance
   - P(E|H) = 0.2 (Restrictions would be less likely if they'd be ineffective due to alternatives)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.8 (This development undermines the strategic case for restrictions)
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.25 (Strong decrease)

3. **Extremely short timeline**: Only ~2.5 months remain until resolution
   - P(E|H) = 0.1 (If restrictions were coming this quickly, we'd expect more concrete steps already)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.9 (The US regulatory process typically takes much longer)
   - Likelihood ratio: 0.11 (Very strong decrease)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15:85 (0.176), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on timeline constraint:**
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.11 = 0.019
- Posterior probability: 0.019 / (1 + 0.019) = 1.9%

**Update on open-source model parity:**
- Prior odds: 0.019
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 0.019 × 0.25 = 0.00475
- Posterior probability: 0.00475 / (1 + 0.00475) = 0.47%

This seems too low, as it doesn't adequately account for the possibility of emergency executive action. Let me recalibrate by considering the security incident evidence:

**Update on security incident:**
- Prior odds (returning to ~2%): 0.02
- Likelihood ratio: 2.67
- Posterior odds: 0.02 × 2.67 = 0.0534
- Posterior probability: 0.0534 / (1 + 0.0534) = 5.1%

The combined evidence suggests a very low probability, primarily due to the extremely short timeline and the questionable effectiveness of such restrictions given open-source alternatives.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of emergency executive action through IEEPA or other national security authorities, which could bypass normal regulatory timelines
- A major security incident in the next 2.5 months could trigger rapid action
- The definition of "restricting access" might be interpreted broadly (e.g., even minimal verification requirements)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Commerce Department might already have draft rules prepared that haven't been publicly disclosed
- The President could issue an executive order requiring geofencing as part of a broader national security directive
- A narrowly-targeted restriction (e.g., only for the most advanced models, or only for certain countries) might face less opposition

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should increase my probability slightly to account for the possibility of emergency executive action in response to a security crisis. However, the extremely short timeline remains the dominant constraint.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of the US legally restricting access outside the US to some generative AI APIs before December 31, 2025, is very low but not impossible.

The primary factors driving this assessment are:
1. The extremely short timeline remaining (only ~2.5 months)
2. The questionable effectiveness of such restrictions given open-source alternatives
3. The strong economic incentives against restricting US AI companies' global market access
4. The lack of concrete regulatory steps beyond information gathering

However, I acknowledge the non-zero possibility of emergency executive action in response to a major security incident.

Final: 7%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is the imposition of a new, significant export control regime on a widely available, dual-use software technology by the US government. Historical examples include encryption software in the 1990s and, more recently, certain software related to semiconductor design. These actions are rare, face significant industry opposition, and typically involve a lengthy regulatory or legislative process spanning years.

The question resolves on December 31, 2025, and the current date is October 18, 2025. This leaves an extremely short window of about 2.5 months. The base rate for any complex and contentious new regulation to be proposed, debated, and put into force within such a short period is exceedingly low, likely in the single digits. A legislative path is impossible. The only viable mechanism is an emergency executive action. Therefore, a time-adjusted prior probability is very low.

I will set the prior at **5%**. This reflects the immense inertia of the US regulatory system, which can only be overcome by extraordinary circumstances.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   Generative AI is a classic dual-use technology with clear applications in both civilian life and national security (e.g., cyber warfare, disinformation, potential for bioweapon design). This is the standard justification for export controls.
*   The US government possesses existing legal frameworks, such as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), that could be used by the executive branch to implement such restrictions without new legislation.

**Differences:**
*   **Timeline:** The most critical difference is the ~2.5 month window. Past precedents for tech export controls involved years of deliberation. This short timeline makes any normal process infeasible.
*   **Economic Stakes & Lobbying:** AI is considered fundamental to future US economic competitiveness. The leading companies (Microsoft/OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) are among the most powerful corporate entities in the world and would lobby fiercely against a policy that unilaterally cedes the global market to foreign and open-source competitors.
*   **Technical Ineffectiveness:** Unlike hardware (semiconductors) or even 1990s-era software, API access is notoriously difficult to geofence effectively due to VPNs and other circumvention tools. More importantly, the proliferation of powerful, globally available open-source models fundamentally undermines the strategic logic of restricting access only to US proprietary models. This makes the policy seem both economically damaging and futile.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several hypothetical recent developments.

*   **Evidence FOR restriction (increases probability):**
    *   **Cyberattack using US API (April 2025):** This is a powerful "focusing event." P(Event | Restriction) is high, as such an event provides the necessary political justification for an emergency action. P(Event | No Restriction) is lower, as the government could still choose other responses or deem API controls ineffective. This evidence strongly increases the probability.
    *   **Senators' Letter & Commerce RFI (July-Sept 2025):** These actions show the topic is under active consideration within the government. P(Signals | Restriction) is high. However, P(Signals | No Restriction) is also reasonably high, as these are often preliminary steps or political posturing that don't lead to immediate action. This evidence weakly increases the probability.

*   **Evidence AGAINST restriction (decreases probability):**
    *   **Powerful Open-Source Models (May 2025):** This is a crucial piece of evidence. The existence of potent, uncontrollable alternatives makes the proposed restriction seem ineffective and strategically unwise. P(OS Proliferation | Restriction) is low, as it makes the restriction less logical. P(OS Proliferation | No Restriction) is high, as it's a strong reason not to act. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
    *   **Voluntary Industry Geofencing (August 2025):** This action serves as a release valve for regulatory pressure. By self-policing, the industry can argue that a legal mandate is unnecessary. P(Self-Regulation | Restriction) is low. P(Self-Regulation | No Restriction) is high. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a **5% prior (1-to-19 odds)**, the evidence must be weighed.

The only plausible path to a "YES" resolution is a crisis-driven emergency executive order. The cyberattack in April provides a potential justification for this. However, the powerful counterarguments—especially the strategic futility created by open-source models and the immense economic blowback—act as massive brakes on such an action.

Let's model the "crisis path":
1.  **Probability of a new, major AI-related security crisis before year-end:** This is the primary trigger. Let's estimate this as a non-trivial **15%**.
2.  **Probability of this specific policy being the response, implemented in time:** Even if a crisis occurs, API restrictions are not the only option. Given the strong arguments against this policy's effectiveness, the government might choose other tools (e.g., sanctions, mandating security features). Let's estimate the probability of this specific response at **60%**.
3.  **Probability of action without a new crisis:** Given the timeline and inertia, this is extremely low. Let's say **1%**.

*   **Posterior Calculation:**
    P(YES) = P(Crisis Path) + P(No Crisis Path)
    P(YES) = [P(New Crisis) × P(Response | Crisis)] + P(Action | No Crisis)
    P(YES) = (0.15 × 0.60) + 0.01 = 0.09 + 0.01 = 0.10

This calculation suggests a posterior probability of **10%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 10% is substantially lower than the Manifold market's 36%. The market might be pricing in a higher risk of a "black swan" event or underestimating the institutional friction that prevents even an emergency order from being implemented quickly. They may also believe the national security apparatus can easily override economic concerns.

However, the argument from ineffectiveness due to open-source proliferation is fundamental. Why would the US shoot its own economic foot with a policy that adversaries can easily bypass? This logical barrier is immense. The timeline remains the single most powerful piece of evidence against a "YES" resolution. While I should update slightly towards the market to account for the "wisdom of the crowd" and potential information I lack, the structural factors pointing to "NO" are overwhelming. A small adjustment is warranted to reflect this uncertainty.

I will adjust my final forecast slightly upward from my calculated 10% to account for these tail risks and the market signal.

### 6. Final Forecast
The combination of an extremely short timeline, powerful industry opposition, and the questionable strategic effectiveness of the policy makes a legally mandated restriction on foreign API access highly unlikely before 2026. The only plausible path to a "YES" resolution is a major security shock that triggers an emergency executive order, an event which is itself unlikely and would still face significant headwinds. The structural barriers are more compelling than the political pressures.

Final: 12%
