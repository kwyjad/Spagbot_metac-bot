### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Peak Pandemic Years (2023-2024):** This is the most direct reference class. It represents the virus's behavior after the peak waves and with high global population immunity.
    *   **Base Rate:** Global reported deaths were ~125,000 in 2023 and are on track for an estimated 50,000-70,000 in 2024. This establishes a strong downward trend, suggesting a 2025 base rate in the range of **25,000 to 60,000 deaths**.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the current dynamics of viral evolution (less severe variants), population immunity, and decaying reporting infrastructure. The year-over-year halving provides a simple but powerful anchor.
    *   **Limitations:** The rate of decay in reporting systems may not be linear, potentially making this an overestimate.

2.  **Severe Seasonal Influenza (Global):** This class compares COVID-19 to another major global respiratory virus in an endemic state.
    *   **Base Rate:** The WHO estimates 290,000 to 650,000 deaths annually from seasonal influenza.
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides an upper-bound "endemic state" comparison for a severe respiratory virus. It helps contextualize the potential long-term mortality burden of COVID-19.
    *   **Limitations:** This refers to *estimated actual* mortality, not *reported* deaths, which is the resolution criterion. Global reporting for influenza deaths is far less systematic than it has been for COVID-19, making a direct comparison difficult. The resolution number for COVID-19 will be a fraction of the true mortality.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-10-15]** WHO notes the start of a Northern Hemisphere winter surge, primarily driven by the new Omicron subvariant FU.1, a descendant of the "FLiRT" variants. **(↑)** — Matters because it confirms expected seasonality and will contribute to deaths in the final quarter of 2025.
*   **[2025-09-05]** Updated annual COVID-19 booster campaigns begin in North America and Europe, but public health agencies report initial uptake figures are lower than in 2024. **(↓)** — Matters because lower vaccine protection among the vulnerable, while negative for health, will have a muted effect on *reported* death statistics if cases are mild and not officially recorded.
*   **[2025-07-20]** Several large middle-income countries (e.g., Brazil, India) transition from weekly to monthly or quarterly COVID-19 data releases to the WHO. **(↓)** — Matters because it degrades the quality and quantity of data flowing into the resolution source, directly suppressing the final reported number.
*   **[2025-06-10]** A WHO epidemiological update highlights that global testing and sequencing rates have fallen by over 90% since their peak, making variant tracking and case ascertainment increasingly difficult. **(↓)** — Matters because fewer tests mean fewer confirmed cases, which is a prerequisite for a death to be officially reported as COVID-19-related.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Reporting System Decay (Large ↓):** As the pandemic's urgency fades, national health bodies are defunding and dismantling dedicated COVID-19 surveillance systems. This is the single largest driver pushing the *reported* number down, likely faster than the decline in *actual* deaths.
2.  **Viral Evolution (Moderate ↑/↓):** The constant emergence of new, more immune-evasive variants (e.g., the FU lineage) drives seasonal/periodic waves of infection. The key uncertainty is severity; a variant with intrinsically higher virulence is a low-probability, high-impact risk (↑), but the established trend is stable or decreasing severity (↓).
3.  **Waning Population Immunity (Moderate ↑):** Immunity from past infections and vaccinations wanes over time. Combined with low uptake of annual boosters, this increases the pool of individuals susceptible to severe disease, especially the elderly and immunocompromised.
4.  **Seasonality (Small ↑):** COVID-19 has settled into a seasonal pattern, peaking in the winter in temperate climates. This creates a predictable, temporary increase in transmission and deaths during the final quarter of the year.
5.  **Availability of Therapeutics (Small ↓):** Antivirals like Paxlovid are widely available in high-income countries and reduce the risk of death in vulnerable populations. Their effect is largely stable and baked into the current baseline.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Reporting Infrastructure:** The quality and frequency of global reporting in 2025 is significantly more degraded than in the 2023-2024 reference period. The link between actual deaths and reported deaths is weaker than ever.
*   **Public Salience & Policy:** In 2025, COVID-19 is almost universally treated as one of several co-circulating respiratory viruses. There are virtually no public health mandates or widespread behavioral changes, unlike in early 2023 when some residual policies remained.
*   **Immunity Landscape:** The global population's "immunity wall" is more mature and complex than in 2023-24, built from multiple infections and vaccinations. This provides broad, albeit imperfect, protection against severe outcomes from variants that are antigenically similar to Omicron.
*   **Medical Management:** Clinical pathways for treating severe COVID-19 are now standardized and routine within hospital systems, making management more efficient than in the earlier reference period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** An initial prior could be anchored on the 2024 outcome (~60,000 deaths), with a strong belief in a continued downward trend. A log-normal distribution centered around **40,000 deaths** with moderate confidence (equivalent n of ~8) seems plausible.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **(↓ Large)** The accelerated decay of reporting systems in mid-2025 is the most significant new evidence, suggesting the final count will be a dramatic underrepresentation of reality.
    *   **(↓ Small)** Low booster uptake limits the potential for vaccination to further suppress mortality rates below the established trend.
    *   **(↑ Small)** The emergence of the FU.1 variant and the start of a winter wave are consistent with expectations and do not suggest a change in severity, thus only slightly nudging the estimate up.
    *   **(↓ Moderate)** Year-to-date data through Q3 2025 has shown a consistent daily death rate below that of 2024, reinforcing the strong downward trend.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the downward trend, with the decay in reporting being the key factor. The posterior should

To forecast the number of reported COVID-19 deaths globally in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the post-peak pandemic years (2023-2024), where reported deaths were ~125,000 in 2023 and are estimated at 50,000-70,000 in 2024. This suggests a 2025 base rate in the range of 25,000 to 60,000 deaths.
   - **Reasoning:** This base rate reflects the ongoing decline in reported deaths due to increased immunity, less severe variants, and reduced reporting infrastructure. The mean of this distribution can be centered around 40,000 deaths with a moderate variance reflecting uncertainty.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The ongoing decline in reported deaths due to improved immunity and less severe variants aligns with the base rate.
   - **Differences:** The reporting infrastructure is more degraded in 2025, potentially leading to underreporting. This difference suggests a downward adjustment from the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Reporting System Decay (Large ↓):** Significant reduction in data reporting frequency and quality suggests fewer deaths will be reported.
   - **Viral Evolution (Moderate ↑/↓):** New variants like FU.1 may cause seasonal surges but are not expected to increase severity significantly.
   - **Waning Population Immunity (Moderate ↑):** Could lead to more severe cases, but the impact on reported deaths is limited by underreporting.
   - **Seasonality (Small ↑):** Expected winter surge may slightly increase deaths in Q4.
   - **Availability of Therapeutics (Small ↓):** Continued availability of treatments like Paxlovid reduces mortality risk.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Log-normal distribution centered around 40,000 deaths.
   - **Evidence Update:** The large impact of reporting decay suggests a downward shift. The posterior distribution should reflect a lower mean, perhaps around 30,000 deaths, with increased variance due to uncertainty in reporting.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a more severe variant or unexpected reporting improvements.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A severe variant could increase deaths, but this is unlikely given current trends.
   - **Adjustment:** Maintain a conservative estimate with wider tails to account for these risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - The forecast should reflect the downward trend with consideration for reporting decay and seasonal effects.

P10: 20,000  
P20: 25,000  
P40: 30,000  
P60: 35,000  
P80: 40,000  
P90: 50,000

# Forecasting Global COVID-19 Deaths in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two main reference classes to establish my prior:

**Recent COVID-19 Death Trends (2022-2024):**
- 2022: ~1 million reported deaths globally
- 2023: ~125,000 reported deaths globally
- 2024: ~50,000-70,000 reported deaths (estimated/projected)

This shows a clear downward trend with roughly a halving of deaths each year. If this pattern continues, we'd expect approximately 25,000-35,000 deaths in 2025.

**Endemic Respiratory Viruses:**
For context, seasonal influenza causes an estimated 290,000-650,000 deaths annually, but only a small fraction of these are officially reported and confirmed. The reporting infrastructure for COVID is still more robust than for influenza, but is rapidly degrading.

Based on these reference classes, I'll use a prior centered around 30,000 reported COVID-19 deaths globally for 2025, with a moderately wide distribution reflecting uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- COVID-19 has established seasonal patterns similar to other respiratory viruses
- Population immunity continues to build through infections and vaccinations
- The virus continues to evolve with new variants that are generally more transmissible but not more severe

**Key differences:**
- Reporting infrastructure is degrading faster than in previous years, with several large countries moving to quarterly reporting
- Vaccine uptake for boosters is declining compared to previous years
- Testing rates have fallen by over 90% since peak, severely limiting case detection
- The FU.1 variant and other emerging variants may cause new waves

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing estimates lower:**
- Reporting system decay: Several large countries transitioning to monthly/quarterly reporting (strong downward pressure, ~50% reduction)
- 90% reduction in testing and sequencing globally (strong downward pressure, ~30-40% reduction)
- Lower booster uptake in 2025 compared to 2024 (modest downward pressure on reported deaths, ~10% reduction)

**Evidence pushing estimates higher:**
- Northern Hemisphere winter surge with FU.1 variant (modest upward pressure, ~20% increase)
- Waning immunity in vulnerable populations (modest upward pressure, ~15% increase)
- Continued viral evolution creating immune-evasive variants (uncertain impact)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 30,000 deaths:

**First update - Reporting system decay:**
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes lower values (~15,000-25,000) about 2x more likely than higher values
- Posterior shift: Center of distribution moves down to ~22,000

**Second update - Winter surge with FU.1 variant:**
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes higher values (~25,000-35,000) about 1.2x more likely
- Posterior shift: Center moves slightly up to ~24,000

**Third update - 90% reduction in testing:**
- Likelihood ratio: This evidence makes lower values (~10,000-20,000) about 1.5x more likely
- Posterior shift: Center moves down to ~18,000

The posterior distribution is now centered around 18,000 deaths, with a wider spread than my initial prior due to competing factors and uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the rate of reporting decay
- A more virulent variant could emerge, causing a significant spike in deaths
- The relationship between testing reduction and reported deaths may not be linear
- I haven't fully accounted for regional differences in reporting quality

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 35,000-40,000 deaths, arguing that:
- The reporting infrastructure decay will plateau rather than continue declining
- Winter surges might be more severe than anticipated
- The relationship between actual and reported deaths is stabilizing

**Rebuttal:**
While these points have merit, the evidence for continued degradation of reporting systems is strong, and the trend of halving deaths each year has been consistent. However, I should widen my distribution to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to be slightly wider and account for the possibility of both lower and higher outcomes:

P10: 8,000
P20: 12,000
P40: 17,000
P60: 22,000
P80: 32,000
P90: 45,000

Answering based on the provided information and a structured forecasting process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary base rate is the trend observed in recent post-peak pandemic years.
- **2023 Reported Deaths:** ~125,000 (per research report)
- **2024 Estimated Deaths:** 50,000-70,000, for a midpoint of 60,000 (per research report)

This establishes a strong year-over-year decay. The reduction from 2023 to 2024 is approximately 52% (60k / 125k ≈ 0.48). A simple extrapolation of this trend would suggest a 2025 figure around 60,000 * 0.48 = **28,800**.

My prior distribution will be a log-normal distribution centered around **30,000 deaths**, reflecting this baseline trend before considering the specific evidence for 2025. The spread will be moderately wide to account for the possibility of the decay rate changing.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The underlying viral dynamics are similar to 2023-2024. COVID-19 continues to circulate, evolve into new Omicron sub-lineages (like FU.1), and exhibit seasonality with winter surges. Population immunity remains high but complex and waning.
- **Differences:** The most significant difference in 2025 is the **accelerated decay of reporting infrastructure**. The research report explicitly states that testing has fallen over 90% from its peak and that large countries are reducing reporting frequency. This means the connection between *actual* deaths and *reported* deaths is weaker in 2025 than in the 2023-2024 base period. This is the single most important factor suggesting the final number will be lower than a simple trend extrapolation might predict.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The forecast is being made on November 11, 2025, so approximately 85% of the year has passed. The primary uncertainty lies in the magnitude of the Northern Hemisphere winter wave and the quality of reporting during that period.

- **(Strong ↓) Reporting System Decay:** The report's details about countries reducing reporting frequency and the massive drop in testing are the most powerful pieces of evidence. This strongly suggests the final *reported* number will be suppressed, regardless of the true number of deaths. This evidence pushes the entire distribution significantly lower.
- **(Moderate ↓) Year-to-Date Data:** The report confirms that the daily death rate through Q3 2025 was "consistently below that of 2024." This provides empirical validation for the downward trend and gives us a soft floor for the forecast. If we assume an average daily rate of ~75 deaths so far (a significant drop from 2024's average of ~164), then by Nov 11 (~314 days), roughly 23,500 deaths have already been reported.
- **(Small ↑) Winter Surge / FU.1 Variant:** The report mentions a winter surge driven by a new variant. This is an expected seasonal pattern. Without evidence of increased severity, this represents a predictable rise in the death rate for the final ~50 days of the year. It pushes the final number up from the year-to-date total but does not fundamentally alter the overall downward trend.
- **(Neutral/Small ↓) Low Booster Uptake:** While lower vaccination rates could lead to more *actual* severe outcomes, the report notes a "muted effect on *reported* death statistics." This reinforces the theme that if cases aren't confirmed via testing, associated deaths won't be officially reported.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at ~30,000 based on the 2023-2024 trend.
- **Updating with Evidence:** The overwhelming evidence of reporting system decay pushes the median of my forecast down. The year-to-date data provides a strong anchor and a soft floor.
- **Calculation Sketch:**
    - Deaths already occurred by Nov 11: Let's estimate ~24,000.
    - Remaining 51 days of 2025: This is the period of the winter surge. The baseline daily rate might be ~75. A surge could increase this by 50-100%. Let's model an average rate of 120 deaths/day for this period.
    - Additional deaths: 51 days * 120 deaths/day ≈ 6,120.
    - **Posterior Median Estimate:** 24,000 (YTD) + 6,120 (surge) ≈ **30,120**.
- My posterior distribution will be centered around **30,000**. The distribution will be right-skewed to account for the low-probability tail risk of the FU.1 variant being more severe than anticipated.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenario:** One could argue the decay is slowing and COVID-19 mortality has found a higher-than-expected endemic level. In this view, the winter surge could be more severe, and reporting might not be as poor as described, leading to a total closer to 45,000-50,000.
- **Rebuttal:** This scenario discounts the very specific and strong evidence in the report about the collapse of surveillance infrastructure. The question resolves on *reported* deaths, making the state of the reporting system a primary causal driver, perhaps more so than the virus's biological activity.
- **Tail Risks:**
    - **Right Tail:** A more virulent variant emerges in the final weeks, causing a sharp spike in deaths that temporarily reinvigorates reporting. This could push the total towards 45,000 or higher.
    - **Left Tail:** The reporting decay is even more severe than modeled. The winter surge is almost invisible in the data, with the final number barely climbing from the year-to-date figure. This places a soft floor around 26,000.
- **Adjustment:** My distribution accounts for this. The median is ~30,000, but the P90 is set at 45,000 to capture the "severe winter wave" risk, creating a pronounced right skew. The P10 is set close to the plausible year-to-date floor.
