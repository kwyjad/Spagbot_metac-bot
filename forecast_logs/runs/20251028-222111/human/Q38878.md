1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the number of infants reached by New Incentives' program can be derived from their historical performance and stated goals. Historically, New Incentives has been expanding its reach significantly, with a recent target of reaching an additional 2 million infants by the end of 2025. This target, combined with their past performance and current funding levels, provides a reasonable base rate.
   - Mean/Median: 2 million additional infants by end of 2025.
   - Variance: Given the uncertainties in program execution and external factors, a variance of ±500,000 infants is reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The base case assumes that New Incentives will continue its expansion as planned, supported by recent funding and operational transparency.
   - Differences: Potential differences include unforeseen logistical challenges, changes in funding allocation, or shifts in policy that could either hinder or accelerate their progress.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent funding from GiveWell and Open Philanthropy increases the likelihood of reaching or exceeding the target, suggesting a positive adjustment.
   - The organization's transparency and track record of meeting past targets also support a higher likelihood of success.
   - However, potential challenges in scaling operations in Nigeria could introduce risks that slightly lower the likelihood of reaching the upper end of the target.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Mean of 2 million with a variance of ±500,000.
   - Likelihood: Positive evidence from funding and past performance increases the probability of achieving the target, shifting the distribution slightly upwards.
   - Posterior: Adjusted mean of approximately 2.1 million, with a slightly reduced variance due to increased confidence from funding.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate potential operational challenges in Nigeria.
   - Tail risks: Political instability or health crises could significantly impact the program's reach.
   - Alternative forecast: A more conservative estimate might place the mean at 1.8 million, considering potential challenges.
   - Rebuttal: The strong funding and organizational track record support the higher estimate.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Considering the evidence and adjustments, the final percentiles are:
P10: 1,600,000
P20: 1,800,000
P40: 2,000,000
P60: 2,200,000
P80: 2,400,000
P90: 2,600,000

# Forecasting New Incentives' Infant Vaccination Reach by End of 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use New Incentives' historical growth and their stated expansion plans. From the research report, I note:
- Founders Pledge indicates "New Incentives plans to expand to reach an additional 2 million infants by the end of 2025"
- New Incentives is a GiveWell top charity with significant funding from GiveWell and Open Philanthropy

Without current enrollment numbers explicitly stated in the provided materials, I'll need to estimate based on their expansion plans. If they plan to reach "an additional 2 million infants by the end of 2025," this suggests they already had a substantial base of infants enrolled before this expansion plan was announced.

Based on my knowledge of similar GiveWell top charities and their scale, I'll estimate that New Incentives likely had reached approximately 500,000-1,000,000 infants before announcing their expansion plans. This gives us a prior distribution centered around 2.5-3 million infants by the end of 2025, with considerable uncertainty.

Prior distribution:
- Median: 2.75 million infants
- Variance: High, with a range of roughly 1.5-4 million infants

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- New Incentives continues to operate in Nigeria with a proven model
- They remain a GiveWell top charity with consistent funding
- Their core program of conditional cash transfers for vaccinations remains unchanged

**Differences that matter:**
- The scale of funding has increased significantly with Open Philanthropy committing $300 million total for GiveWell's recommendations (2023-2025)
- New Incentives has specific expansion plans mentioned in multiple sources
- The organization has likely gained operational experience that could improve efficiency
- However, scaling rapidly can introduce new challenges and inefficiencies

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers:**
1. Explicit expansion plan to reach "an additional 2 million infants by the end of 2025" (Founders Pledge) - This is strong evidence for at least 2 million additional infants, suggesting a likelihood ratio of 3:1 favoring the upper end of my prior.

2. Significant funding from Open Philanthropy and GiveWell - The $300 million commitment from Open Philanthropy to GiveWell's recommendations suggests substantial resources available. This provides a likelihood ratio of about 2:1 favoring higher numbers.

3. Multiple sources (GiveWell, Founders Pledge, Giving What We Can) consistently reference expansion plans - This consistency increases confidence in the expansion plans, with a likelihood ratio of 1.5:1 favoring higher numbers.

**Evidence supporting lower numbers:**
1. Scaling challenges - Rapid expansion often faces operational hurdles, suggesting a likelihood ratio of 1.5:1 favoring lower numbers.

2. Lack of specific recent progress updates in the provided materials - This uncertainty suggests a likelihood ratio of 1.2:1 favoring more conservative estimates.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 2.75 million infants, I'll update based on the strongest evidence: the explicit expansion plan to reach "an additional 2 million infants."

Prior: 2.75 million infants (median)
Likelihood ratio from expansion plan: 3:1 favoring higher numbers

Applying Bayes' rule conceptually:
- This shifts my distribution upward
- The median moves from 2.75 million to approximately 3.25 million
- The variance narrows somewhat as this evidence provides more certainty

Further updating with the funding evidence (2:1 likelihood ratio favoring higher numbers):
- This further shifts the distribution upward
- The median moves from approximately 3.25 million to 3.5 million

Accounting for scaling challenges (1.5:1 likelihood ratio favoring lower numbers):
- This moderates the upward shift slightly
- The median adjusts from 3.5 million to approximately 3.3 million

My posterior distribution now has:
- Median: 3.3 million infants
- Reduced variance compared to prior, but still significant uncertainty
- Slight positive skew (more uncertainty in the upper tail)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. I don't have the most recent data on New Incentives' current enrollment numbers, which creates significant uncertainty.
2. The impact of COVID-19 or other health crises in Nigeria could significantly affect vaccination programs.
3. Political instability or security concerns in Nigeria could impede expansion.
4. I may be overestimating the organization's capacity to scale effectively.

**Alternative forecast:**
A more conservative forecast might center around 2 million total infants, arguing that:
- The "additional 2 million" target might be aspirational rather than realistic
- Scaling challenges might be more severe than anticipated
- Funding might be spread across multiple GiveWell charities, limiting New Incentives' share

Rebuttal: The consistent mention of expansion plans across multiple reputable sources, combined with significant funding increases, makes the higher forecast more plausible. However, I should widen my uncertainty bands to account for these concerns.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: Exceptional execution and additional funding could push numbers above 4 million
- Lower tail: Significant operational challenges or external crises could limit growth to below 2 million

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll adjust my distribution to reflect appropriate uncertainty:

P10: 2,100,000
P20: 2,500,000
P40: 3,000,000
P60: 3,500,000
P80: 4,000,000
P90: 4,500,000

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate for this forecast is an extrapolation of New Incentives' recent growth, anchored by its publicly stated goals and funding context. This is a specific case where a broad reference class of "NGO growth" is less useful than the organization's own trajectory and plans.

*   **Data Points:**
    *   September 2022: ~300,000 infants enrolled.
    *   September 2023: ~1,000,000 infants enrolled.
    *   March 2024: ~1,600,000 infants enrolled.
*   **Growth Rate Calculation:** From September 2023 to March 2024 (6 months), the program grew by 600,000 infants, an average rate of **100,000 infants per month**.
*   **Initial Extrapolation (Prior):** The forecast date is late October 2025. The last data point is from March 2024. The period to project over is 21 months (April 2024 to December 2025). A simple extrapolation would be:
    *   `1,600,000 (start) + 21 months * 100,000/month = 3,700,000`
*   **Prior Distribution:** My initial prior is a distribution centered around **3.7 million**. The spread is determined by the uncertainty of sustaining this peak growth rate. A lower bound might involve growth slowing to the longer-term average (~67k/month), suggesting a total around 3.0M. An upper bound might involve slight acceleration. This prior is centered high, reflecting the most recent available data.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The base case assumes the peak growth rate of 100,000 infants/month can be sustained for nearly two years.

*   **Similarities:** The organization continues to operate with the same large-scale funding from GiveWell and Open Philanthropy, with a clear mandate to expand. The core intervention remains unchanged.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Scaling Challenges:** Extrapolating a peak growth rate is often a fallacy. As an organization scales, it faces logistical hurdles, hiring and training bottlenecks, and market saturation in the easiest-to-reach areas. This suggests the actual growth rate is likely to be lower than the peak rate.
    *   **S-Curve Growth:** Growth is rarely linear. The period of 100k/month growth may have been the steepest part of an "S-curve." The program could be entering a phase of slower, more mature growth.
    *   **Operational Risk:** The program operates in Northern Nigeria, an environment with inherent security and political risks that could disrupt operations.

These differences strongly suggest that the initial prior of 3.7M is likely an overestimate of the median outcome.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate one key piece of evidence against my prior.

*   **Evidence:** A May 2023 GiveWell report on the grant for 2023-2025 expansion states a goal of reaching an **additional 2.5 million infants** during this period.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The baseline at the start of 2023 was roughly 400,000 infants (extrapolated from 300k in Sep 2022).
    *   The target for the end of 2025 is therefore `400,000 + 2,500,000 = 2,900,000`.
*   **Likelihood Adjustment:** This explicit, well-vetted target from the primary funder is a very strong piece of evidence. It is much more consistent with a lower final number than my prior's median of 3.7M. This evidence suggests that the *average* growth rate over the three-year period was expected to be around 67,000/month, not the peak rate of 100,000/month. This evidence strongly pushes the entire distribution downwards.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Centered at 3.7M, based on a simple extrapolation of peak growth.
*   **Evidence:** The organization's own target for the same period is ~2.9M.
*   **Update:** I must significantly update my forecast downwards, using the 2.9M target as a strong anchor. However, the demonstrated ability to achieve a 100k/month rate (even if temporary) is evidence of high operational capacity, suggesting they are more likely to over-perform than under-perform this target.
*   **Posterior Distribution:**
    *   **Median:** I will set my median slightly above the target to account for the potential to over-perform, at **3.0 million**.
    *   **Shape:** The distribution should be right-skewed. The downside is capped by serious operational failures, while the upside includes the possibility of sustaining a higher-than-average growth rate.
    *   **Spread:**
        *   A plausible downside scenario (P10) involves growth slowing significantly due to scaling friction, leading to a total of around **2.4 million**.
        *   A plausible upside scenario (P90) involves the organization sustaining its high growth rate for longer than expected, approaching the initial extrapolation of **3.7 million**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is centered at 3.0M with an 80% confidence interval of [2.4M, 3.7M].

*   **Is this overconfident?** The main source of uncertainty is the lack of data for the 19 months between March 2024 and the forecast date (October 2025). My wide 80% CI (1.3M infants) is intended to capture this large uncertainty.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Bear Case):** The 100k/month growth was a short-lived anomaly. The program has since reverted to a much slower growth rate (e.g., 40-50k/month) as it hit significant barriers. The final number could be below 2.4M. I believe this is unlikely given the immense funding and oversight from GiveWell, but it's a possible tail risk captured by the P10.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Bull Case):** The 2.9M target was deliberately conservative for fundraising purposes. The organization has successfully scaled and maintained the 100k/month rate, putting them on track for 3.7M or even higher. My P90 accounts for this possibility.
*   **Conclusion:** The forecast correctly balances the official target (a strong anchor) with the demonstrated performance (evidence of upside potential). The distribution's median is slightly above the target, and its right skew reflects that over-performance is more likely than a significant miss. The final percentiles, derived from a log-normal distribution fitting these parameters, seem robust.
