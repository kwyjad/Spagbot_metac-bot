### Reference class & base rates
1.  **State-level adoption of tech-related regulations:** Laws concerning data privacy (e.g., CCPA-like bills) or social media content serve as a reference. These typically follow an S-curve: a few innovators, a rapid wave of adoption (5-15 states/year), and then a plateau. The current wave of AI legislation appears to be in the rapid adoption phase. Base rate: ~10 states per year enacting legislation on a salient, bipartisan tech issue during its peak momentum.
2.  **State-level adoption of election security laws:** Following the 2020 election, numerous states moved to pass legislation related to voting procedures. This class is relevant due to the shared driver of election integrity. The adoption rate was high and heavily influenced by partisan control, with dozens of laws passed in the 2021-2022 period.
3.  **State-level adoption of "revenge porn" laws:** This is a strong analogue, as it involves non-consensual use of digital media for harm and enjoys broad bipartisan support. Nearly all states (48 + D.C.) now have such laws, with most passed between 2014 and 2020, showing a rapid and near-total adoption cycle.

Limitations: The speed of AI development and the visceral nature of deepfake threats (e.g., election interference, non-consensual pornography) may be accelerating legislative action beyond these historical base rates.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-24** Forbes highlights over 1,100 state-level AI bills in 2025 and continued federal inaction. **(↑)** — Confirms states are the sole, and very active, legislative venue for this issue.
*   **2025-11-28** Most 2025 state legislative sessions have adjourned for the year. **(↓↓↓)** — This is the single most critical factor. The window for passing new legislation before Jan 1, 2026 is nearly closed. Only a handful of states have year-round sessions or could convene a special session.
*   **2025-10-02** Future of Privacy Forum notes 2025 legislation became more specific (e.g., chatbots, healthcare), moving beyond broad frameworks. **(↑)** — Specific, targeted bills are often easier to pass than comprehensive ones, suggesting a maturing and more effective legislative process.
*   **2025-08-18** Brookings reports that 47 states introduced AI-related legislation in 2025. **(↑)** — Demonstrates the issue has reached near-universal legislative attention, creating a very large pipeline of potential bills.
*   **2025-03-19** Legal analysis highlights the influence of comprehensive frameworks like the EU AI Act and Colorado's AI Act on other states. **(↑)** — The existence of model legislation reduces the workload for lawmakers and accelerates the drafting and introduction of similar bills.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Legislative Calendar (Large ↓):** With today's date being November 28, 2025, the vast majority of state legislatures are no longer in session. The opportunity to introduce, debate, and pass new legislation before the January 1, 2026 deadline is minimal to non-existent for most states.
2.  **Bipartisan Salience (Large ↑):** The primary applications of deepfake regulation—preventing election interference and combating non-consensual explicit imagery—are potent, bipartisan issues. This reduces political friction and accelerates passage when legislatures *are* in session.
3.  **Federal Inaction (Moderate ↑):** The continued absence of a comprehensive federal AI or deepfake law creates a policy vacuum that incentivizes states to act independently to protect their citizens and elections.
4.  **Ease of Bill Introduction (Moderate ↑):** The availability of model legislation from organizations like the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) and the example set by pioneering states (e.g., Colorado, California) makes it easy for other states to quickly draft and introduce their own versions.
5.  **High-Profile Events (Small ↑):** Any major deepfake-related scandal occurring in the final month of 2025 could theoretically prompt a governor to call a special session, but this is a low-probability event.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** Unlike a typical forecast over a 1-2 year period, the remaining horizon is just over one month. This makes the legislative calendar the dominant variable, overriding the powerful underlying momentum seen in the base rates.
*   **Unprecedented Speed of Salience:** Public and legislative awareness of AI risks has grown far more rapidly than for prior tech issues like data privacy. The issue went from niche to a top priority in ~24 months.
*   **Lower Partisan Polarization:** Compared to reference classes like election administration laws, deepfake regulation (especially concerning child exploitation) has far less partisan baggage, facilitating broader and faster consensus.
*   **Technological Forcing Function:** The underlying technology is advancing exponentially, creating a constant stream of new capabilities and potential threats that maintain a high sense of urgency among policymakers.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference classes and the immense legislative activity in 2024-2025, a prior would be anchored on a very high number of states, likely in the mid-to-high 40s, reflecting the near-completion of a rapid adoption S-curve. Equivalent n: moderate, reflecting the strong trend.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Overwhelming evidence of legislative will and bipartisan support across nearly all states throughout 2025.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Clear and compelling drivers (election integrity, exploitation) that resonate with voters and politicians.
    *   (↓↓↓ Massive) The legislative calendar constraint. With virtually all legislatures adjourned, the mechanism for passing new laws is turned off.
    *   (↑ Small) Continued lack of federal preemption removes a potential blocker.
*   **Net effect:** The prior, based on annual momentum, must be drastically revised downwards by the overwhelming negative evidence of the calendar. The forecast should be anchored to the *current* number of states with passed legislation, with only a very small probability of 1-2 more additions from states with year-round sessions or a surprise special session.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A governor in a state without a deepfake law calls a special legislative session before Dec 31.
    *   A state with a year-round session (e.g., WI, MI, OH, PA) moves a deepfake bill to a final vote.
    *   The resolution source (MultiState) updates its tracker to include a state that passed a law in late 2025 that was not yet widely reported.
    *   A major, politically destabilizing deepfake incident occurs, creating emergency pressure to act.

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   No announcements of special sessions by mid-December.
    *   Year-round legislatures adjourn for holiday recess without passing relevant bills.
    *   Public statements from legislative leaders confirming no further legislative work in 2025.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Current Count Uncertainty:** The single biggest variable is the exact number of states that have *already* passed legislation as of today. The March 2024 figure of 15 is obsolete. Research suggests the current number is likely between 40 and 45, but this requires verification against the specific resolution source. The final forecast is highly sensitive to this starting number.
*   **Definition of "Regulating Deepfakes":** A state may pass a broad AI disclosure law that covers deepfakes without using the term explicitly. The interpretation of the resolution source (MultiState) will be decisive.
*   **Passage vs. Enactment:** A bill could be passed by the legislature but be awaiting a governor's signature. The timing of the signature relative to the Jan 1, 2026 deadline is critical. "Passed legislation" typically means passed by both chambers and signed by the governor (or a veto is overridden).
*   **Resolution Source Lag:** The MultiState tracker may not be updated instantly. A law passed in the last week of December 2025 might not appear on the site until January 2026, creating ambiguity at resolution time.

### Final Research Summary
The legislative momentum to regulate deepfakes was immense throughout 2024 and 2025, suggesting a near-total adoption by states. However, this momentum has collided with the hard stop of the 2025 legislative calendar, making the passage of additional laws before 2026 highly improbable. The final number will almost certainly be the current count of states with such laws, plus a very small chance of one or two more from states with year-round sessions.

To forecast the number of US states that will pass legislation regulating deepfakes before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class**: State-level adoption of tech-related regulations, particularly those with bipartisan support and high public salience, such as data privacy and revenge porn laws.
- **Base Rate**: Historically, during peak momentum, around 10 states per year enact legislation on salient tech issues. Given the rapid adoption phase for deepfake laws, a prior centered around 40-45 states by the end of 2025 is reasonable, assuming a near-complete adoption cycle.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity**: The rapid legislative response to deepfakes is similar to past tech issues, with bipartisan support and high public concern driving legislation.
- **Difference**: The legislative calendar constraint is a significant deviation, as most state sessions have adjourned, limiting further legislative action in 2025.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Legislative Activity (↑)**: High legislative activity in 2025, with 47 states introducing AI-related bills, supports a high number of states passing laws.
- **Calendar Constraint (↓↓↓)**: The adjournment of most state legislative sessions drastically reduces the likelihood of additional laws being passed before 2026.
- **Federal Inaction (↑)**: The lack of federal legislation encourages state-level action, but this is countered by the calendar constraint.
- **Model Legislation (↑)**: The availability of model legislation facilitates rapid drafting and passage, but again, the calendar constraint is dominant.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior**: Assume 40-45 states have passed legislation by late 2025.
- **Likelihood**: The legislative calendar constraint significantly reduces the likelihood of additional states passing laws, suggesting a small probability of 1-2 more states doing so.
- **Posterior**: The distribution shifts towards the current count of states with laws, with a slight chance of a few more additions.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check**: The forecast must account for the possibility of special sessions or unreported legislative activity.
- **Alternative Scenario**: A major deepfake incident could prompt emergency legislative action, but this is unlikely given the time constraints.
- **Adjustment**: Ensure the forecast reflects the high probability of no additional states passing laws, with a small tail risk of 1-2 more.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the constraints and evidence, the forecast is centered around the current number of states with deepfake laws, with a small chance of a few more:

P10: 40  
P20: 41  
P40: 42  
P60: 43  
P80: 44  
P90: 45

# Forecast: How many US states will pass deepfake legislation before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Current deepfake legislation adoption
- As of March 2024, 15 states had passed deepfake legislation
- Based on the research report and sources, this number has significantly increased throughout 2024-2025
- The most recent data suggests approximately 40-45 states have already passed such legislation by November 2025

**Secondary reference classes**:
- "Revenge porn" legislation: Nearly all states (48+DC) passed laws over ~6 years (2014-2020)
- Data privacy legislation: Following a similar S-curve adoption pattern
- Election security laws: Rapid adoption post-2020

The prior distribution centers around 43 states with a standard deviation of about 2 states, reflecting the current estimated adoption level with some uncertainty.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes**:
- Deepfake regulation follows the typical S-curve adoption pattern seen in other tech-related legislation
- The issue has strong bipartisan appeal (like revenge porn laws)
- The technology poses clear threats to election integrity and personal privacy

**Critical differences**:
- **Time constraint**: With today being November 28, 2025, there is only about one month left before the January 1, 2026 deadline
- Most state legislatures have already adjourned for the year and won't reconvene until 2026
- The adoption rate has been exceptionally rapid compared to other tech regulations

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher numbers**:
- 47 states introduced AI-related legislation in 2025 (Brookings report) → strong likelihood ratio favoring high adoption
- Over 1,100 state-level AI bills in 2025 (Forbes) → large pipeline of potential legislation
- Bipartisan appeal of regulating deepfakes → reduces political friction
- Availability of model legislation → makes adoption easier

**Evidence for lower numbers**:
- Most state legislatures have adjourned for 2025 (November 28 report) → extremely strong constraint on further adoption
- Only a handful of states have year-round sessions → severely limits potential for additional laws
- Special sessions are rare and typically called only for emergencies

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 43 states (±2):

**Update based on legislative calendar constraint**:
- This is the dominant factor that drastically shifts the distribution
- The likelihood of additional states passing legislation in the remaining month is extremely low
- Only states with year-round sessions (WI, MI, OH, PA, etc.) or those that call special sessions could potentially add to the count

**Posterior distribution**:
- Mean shifts slightly upward from 43 to ~44 states
- Variance decreases significantly (more certainty)
- Distribution becomes right-skewed (small chance of 1-2 more states passing legislation)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the exact current count of states with deepfake legislation
- The definition of "regulating deepfakes" might be broader than expected, potentially including general AI regulations
- Some states might have passed legislation that hasn't yet been reported in the tracking databases

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A major deepfake incident in December 2025 could prompt emergency special sessions
- Year-round legislatures might prioritize deepfake legislation in December
- The MultiState tracker might be outdated, and the actual number could be higher or lower

**Adjustments**:
- Widening the distribution slightly to account for uncertainty in the current count
- Adding more weight to the possibility of 1-2 additional states passing legislation

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 42
P20: 43

P60: 45

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is the adoption cycle of similar state-level legislation characterized by high salience and bipartisan support. The strongest analogue is the passage of "revenge porn" laws, which address the non-consensual use of digital media for harm. Nearly all states (48 + D.C.) adopted such laws, with the majority passing between 2014 and 2020. This reference class suggests a rapid S-curve adoption pattern, where an issue gains momentum and achieves near-universal legislative action within a few years. Based on this, the prior expectation would be for a large number of states, likely over 40, to have passed deepfake legislation by the end of a multi-year period of high activity like 2024-2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The regulation of deepfakes shares key characteristics with the "revenge porn" base case. It addresses clear harms (election interference, non-consensual explicit imagery) and enjoys broad, bipartisan support, which accelerates legislative action. Federal inaction has also created a policy vacuum, encouraging states to act independently.
*   **Differences:** The primary and most critical difference is the **extreme time constraint**. The forecast is made on November 28, 2025, for a deadline of January 1, 2026. This leaves only one month for legislative action. Unlike a typical forecast over a 1-2 year period, the legislative calendar becomes the dominant factor, overriding the underlying momentum suggested by the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The evidence presents two powerful but opposing forces:

*   **Evidence for High Momentum (Pushing Up ↑):**
    *   **Massive Legislative Interest:** Reports from August and November 2025 confirm that 47 states introduced AI-related bills and over 1,100 such bills were considered in 2025. This indicates near-universal legislative attention and a very large pipeline of potential laws. This evidence is consistent with the final number being very high (e.g., 40-50 states).
    *   **Bipartisan Drivers:** The core issues of election integrity and preventing digital exploitation are strong, bipartisan motivators, reducing political friction.

*   **Evidence for a Hard Stop (Pushing Down ↓↓↓):**
    *   **Legislative Adjournment:** The research report explicitly states, "Most 2025 state legislative sessions have adjourned for the year." This is the single most important piece of evidence. The mechanism for passing new laws is effectively shut down in the vast majority of states. This evidence makes it overwhelmingly likely that the final number will be very close to the *current* number. The likelihood of a large increase (e.g., 5+ states) in the final month is near zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** My prior, based on the adoption S-curve and the immense legislative activity throughout 2025, would be a distribution centered on a high number, perhaps with a median around 45-48 states.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The evidence of the legislative calendar acts as a massive downward update. The likelihood of a state passing a new law in December 2025 is extremely low.
    *   Posterior ∝ Prior(High Momentum) × Likelihood(Legislatures Adjourned)
*   **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution is anchored to the number of states that have *already* passed legislation as of November 2025. The primary uncertainty shifts from "how many states will act?" to "what is the exact current count, and is there a small chance 1 or 2 more can act?" The research report suggests the current number is "likely between 40 and 45." My posterior will be a distribution over this range, with a slight right skew to account for the small probability of a state with a year-round session (e.g., OH, PA, MI) or a special session passing a bill. The mean of my posterior will be very close to the mean of my estimate for the current number (e.g., ~43).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is critically dependent on the research report's estimate that the current number of states with deepfake laws is between 40 and 45.
*   **Risk of Overconfidence:** What if this estimate is wrong? If the true number is currently 38, my entire distribution is shifted too high. Conversely, if it's already 46, my distribution is too low. To account for this, I must ensure my percentile range is wide enough to accommodate some error in this key assumption. My 80% confidence interval should be reasonably broad.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** A major, shocking deepfake scandal in early December could theoretically prompt a governor to call an emergency special session. While the probability is very low, it's a non-zero tail risk that could add one state to the final count. My distribution accounts for this with a slight right skew.
*   **Best Alternative Forecast:** A forecast centered lower, perhaps around 35. This would be plausible if many of the 1,100+ bills introduced in 2025 failed to pass, and the true current number is much lower than estimated. I find this less likely, as the bipartisan nature of the issue suggests a high conversion rate for introduced bills, but it remains a possibility. My P10 at 40 reflects my confidence that the number is unlikely to be in the 30s.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered in the low 40s, reflecting the uncertainty in the current count of enacted laws. The range is constrained by the fact that very few, if any, additional states can pass legislation before the deadline. The slight right skew accounts for the small possibility of 1-2 more states from year-round or special sessions.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
An appropriate base rate for the number of US states passing legislation regulating deepfakes before 2026 is drawn from historical patterns of state-level adoption of tech-related regulations with bipartisan support and urgency, such as revenge porn laws (48 states over ~6 years, with rapid acceleration to near-total adoption) and election security laws post-2020 (dozens of states in 1-2 years). I chose this because deepfake regulation shares drivers like election integrity and protection from digital harm, which have historically led to fast, widespread adoption in an S-curve pattern (slow start, rapid middle, plateau). For a 2-year horizon (2024-2025), the base rate suggests a median of ~40 states (reflecting ~20/year during peak momentum), with a wide spread (variance equivalent to a standard deviation of ~10 states) to account for variability in legislative speed and external events. This prior assumes no extreme time constraints, anchoring on the observed momentum from 15 states in March 2024 to likely 40+ by late 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base rate in terms of rapid adoption driven by bipartisan salience (e.g., election interference and non-consensual imagery), federal inaction creating a state-level vacuum, and model legislation easing passage—mirroring the revenge porn wave where awareness led to quick consensus. It's different due to the extreme time constraint: with only ~1 month left (as of Nov 28, 2025) and most legislatures adjourned, the opportunity for new laws is severely limited, unlike the multi-year windows in base cases. This difference matters enormously, as it caps further adoption, compressing the distribution toward the current count (estimated 40-45) and reducing variance by making high-tail outcomes (e.g., 50 states) implausible without special sessions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Legislative activity in 2025 (↑ Large, likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring higher values):** 47 states introduced AI bills, with over 1,100 total, and specific deepfake-related laws gaining traction—consistent with higher adoption (e.g., 40+ states), pushing up from base rate by emphasizing momentum.
- **Bipartisan drivers and model laws (↑ Moderate, ~2:1 favoring higher):** Election integrity and anti-exploitation themes reduce friction, and EU/Colorado models speed drafting—makes higher outcomes more likely than lower, but already baked into current counts.
- **Federal inaction (↑ Small, ~1.5:1 favoring higher):** Encourages state action, slightly boosting likelihood of more laws if sessions were open.
- **Legislative calendar closure (↓ Massive, ~1:10 favoring higher vs. lower):** Most sessions adjourned by Nov 28, 2025; only a few year-round states (e.g., WI, MI) or special sessions possible—strongly favors lower additions (0-2), making high increments improbable.
- **Potential for high-profile events (↑ Small, ~1.2:1 favoring higher):** A scandal could prompt action, but low probability in ~1 month, weakly supporting minor upside.
Overall, positive evidence supports a high current count, but the calendar dominates, pushing the distribution down with a strong negative adjustment.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood. Start with prior: Normal-like distribution with mean 40, SD 10 (median ~40, covering 20-50 at 80% CI). First update: Incorporate strong positive likelihood from 2025 activity (LR ~3:1 high), shifting mean up to ~43 (evidence of near-universal introduction suggests faster adoption than base). Second update: Moderate positives (bipartisan drivers, federal vacuum) add a small shift to mean ~44. Major update: Calendar closure (LR ~1:10 high, massively downweighting additions), anchors to current ~42 (midpoint of 40-45 estimate) and slashes variance (new SD ~3), as only 0-2 more are feasible. Final posterior: Mean ~42, reduced variance, slight positive skew from tail risks (e.g., special sessions), but heavily constrained below 50.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the "40-45" current count, as it's an estimate without exact verification—blind spot if MultiState shows lower (e.g., 35) or higher (e.g., 48), though report sources suggest it's accurate. Tail risks include: upside (1-5% chance of a major deepfake scandal prompting 3+ special sessions, pushing to 45+); downside (resolution lag or narrow definitions excluding some laws, resolving at <40). Alternative forecast: Optimistic view (mean 46) assuming year-round states pass 3-4 more and one special session—plausible if underestimating momentum, but rebutted by calendar dominance (most states can't act). Pessimistic view (mean 40) if no additions—plausible but ignores small upside from ongoing sessions. I adjust by widening tails slightly (P10 down, P90 up) to avoid overconfidence, ensuring ~10% coverage for surprises.
