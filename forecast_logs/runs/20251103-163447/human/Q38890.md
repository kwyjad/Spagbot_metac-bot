### Reference class & base rates
*   **Leaders of Spain's People's Party (PP) in opposition:** Since the party's refounding in 1989, there have been three leaders who spent significant time in opposition before Feijóo: José María Aznar (1989-1996), Mariano Rajoy (2004-2011), and Pablo Casado (2018-2022). Aznar and Rajoy both survived failed election bids to eventually become Prime Minister. Casado was forced out after ~3.5 years following a disastrous internal power struggle and poor regional election results. This suggests a leader's survival is not guaranteed, but immediate ousting is not the norm. The base rate of a PP opposition leader being forced out in any given two-month period is very low, likely <5%, absent an acute, pre-existing crisis.
*   **Leaders of major European conservative parties after a lost general election:** Leaders who fail to form a government often face a leadership challenge, but this typically occurs within a 1-2 year timeframe, often catalyzed by a party conference or another poor election result. Survival for the immediate months following the loss is common. For a leader ~2.5 years into their tenure (Feijóo took over in April 2022), the risk increases if they are perceived as unable to win the next election.
*   **Conclusion:** The base rate for a leader being ousted in a specific, short (<2 month) timeframe is extremely low. However, the context of a post-election failure and ongoing political crises elevates this risk significantly compared to a "normal" period. A ballpark base rate might be a 90-95% chance of survival in any given two-month window for a leader in Feijóo's general position.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-03** Carlos Mazón (PP), Valencia's regional president, resigns over the handling of the 2024 DANA flood disaster. ↓ — This is a major blow to the PP's image of competence, a key part of Feijóo's brand. It puts him on the defensive and creates a focal point for internal and external criticism.
*   **2025-10-29** Widespread one-year anniversary protests across Valencia criticize the PP-led government's response to the DANA floods. ↓ — Sustained public anger keeps the issue in the headlines, increasing pressure on the PP leadership, including Feijóo, to demonstrate accountability.
*   **2025-09-15** (Hypothetical based on typical political calendars) PP holds a strategy meeting where Feijóo's plan for the upcoming political term is reportedly met with a lukewarm reception from some regional leaders. ↓ — Indicates potential internal dissatisfaction and a lack of unified support, which is a necessary precondition for a leadership challenge.
*   **2025-07-20** (Hypothetical) Government led by Pedro Sánchez passes a key piece of legislation despite unified opposition from PP and Vox. ↔︎ — Standard political business. While a loss for the opposition, it doesn't significantly alter Feijóo's internal standing unless he is blamed for a specific tactical failure.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Internal Rebellion by Regional "Barons":** The primary mechanism for removal. A coordinated move by powerful regional leaders, most notably Isabel Díaz Ayuso (Madrid) and/or Juanma Moreno (Andalusia), could force a resignation or an extraordinary party congress. The DANA crisis could be the catalyst. **(Size: Large)**
*   **Major Escalating Scandal:** The DANA flood response is a crisis of competence. If investigations directly implicate Feijóo's leadership or reveal a broader cover-up, the pressure could become unbearable. **(Size: Large)**
*   **Voluntary Resignation:** Feijóo could decide the political cost of the DANA crisis is too high and step down to "save the party," especially if he feels his authority has irrevocably eroded. **(Size: Moderate)**
*   **Sudden Health Crisis:** An unforeseen personal health issue could force a temporary or permanent departure. This is a standing, low-probability risk for any leader. **(Size: Small)**
*   **Lack of a Catalyst Event:** There are no scheduled national/regional elections or an ordinary party congress before the end of 2025. This makes it harder for rivals to organize and find a legitimate platform to launch a challenge. This inertia strongly favors the incumbent. **(Size: Large, favors YES)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The question resolves in less than two months. Ousting a party leader is a complex, politically costly process that is difficult to execute this quickly without a pre-planned "palace coup."
*   **Acute, Non-Electoral Crisis:** Unlike Casado, who was weakened by electoral losses and a direct power struggle, Feijóo faces a crisis of perceived governmental incompetence (via the DANA flood response). This is an external shock that tests his leadership differently.
*   **Absence of an Obvious Successor Plot:** While potential rivals like Ayuso exist, there is no public evidence of an active, organized plot to remove Feijóo *now*. Such a move would be seen as highly opportunistic and could backfire amid a national tragedy.
*   **Feijóo's "Stabilizer" Mandate:** Feijóo was brought in specifically to end the internal chaos of the Casado era. There is likely a strong institutional reluctance within the PP to plunge the party back into a damaging civil war unless his position becomes completely untenable.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior favoring survival, based on the high inertia of political leadership over a very short (<2 month) timeframe. A prior of 95% YES seems reasonable (equivalent n=20, with 19 successes).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   `↓` (Large): The resignation of Carlos Mazón is a severe political blow, creating the most significant crisis of Feijóo's leadership and a plausible catalyst for his removal.
    *   `↑` (Large): The extremely short time horizon (under 58 days) provides a powerful defense. Inertia is high, and organizing a successful coup takes more time than is available.
    *   `↑` (Moderate): The lack of a scheduled party congress or election removes the natural focal points around which a challenge could be organized.
    *   `↓` (Small): The ongoing negative press and public anger over the DANA response will continue to erode Feijóo's authority and political capital, making him more vulnerable.
*   **Net effect:** The large negative shock from the Mazón resignation significantly lowers the probability from the very high prior. However, it is counteracted by the powerful structural factor of the short timeline. The posterior should move down moderately, but likely remain comfortably in the "Yes" camp.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (Feijóo survives):**
    *   Public, coordinated statements of support for Feijóo from Ayuso, Moreno, and other key regional leaders.
    *   PP successfully shifts media focus and blame for the DANA crisis onto the national PSOE government.
    *   No new major negative revelations from the DANA flood investigation emerge.
    *   Feijóo gives a well-received, authoritative speech or interview that reasserts his control.
*   **DOWN indicators (Feijóo in trouble):**
    *   Public criticism, even if veiled, of the national party's handling of the DANA crisis from within the PP.
    *   Anonymous sources from PP headquarters briefing journalists about a "crisis of confidence" in Feijóo.
    *   Isabel Díaz Ayuso makes a major, unscheduled speech on the future of Spain/the party, seen as a leadership pitch.
    *   Calls from any significant party faction for an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Asymmetry:** The most critical moves (plotting by rivals, backroom deals) will happen in private. Public signals may lag reality or be deliberately misleading.
*   **"Continuously" Clause:** The resolution criteria are strict. A temporary step-aside for any reason, even if he returns later, would resolve the question to No.
*   **Black Swan Event:** A sudden, unrelated scandal (e.g., corruption, personal) could emerge and force a rapid resignation, bypassing the normal political mechanics.
*   **Definition of "Leader":** The resolution depends on the official title. A de facto loss of power while retaining the title would still resolve to Yes.
*   **Misinterpreting Signals:** A rival like Ayuso might make noise to position herself for the *next* leadership contest, not to launch one now. It's crucial to distinguish positioning from an active coup attempt.

**Final Research Summary:** Feijóo faces the most severe crisis of his leadership due to the DANA flood fallout, but the extremely short two-month timeline to year-end creates a powerful inertial barrier against a successful ouster. His survival is favored, but his position is more fragile than at any other point in his tenure.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a leader of Spain's People's Party (PP) being ousted in a specific, short (<2 month) timeframe is extremely low. Historical data suggests that political leaders, especially those in opposition, tend to have a high survival rate over short periods unless there is an acute crisis. Given the context, a reasonable base rate might be a 90-95% chance of survival in any given two-month window for a leader in Feijóo's position. I will start with a prior probability of 95% for Feijóo remaining as leader through the end of 2025.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Feijóo, like previous PP leaders, is facing internal and external pressures. The base case of leaders surviving short-term crises applies here due to the lack of immediate electoral or party congress challenges.
   - Differences: The DANA flood crisis and the resignation of Carlos Mazón present a unique challenge, increasing the risk of leadership instability. However, the absence of an organized plot or immediate successor reduces the likelihood of a rapid ouster.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Resignation of Carlos Mazón: This is a significant negative event, increasing the likelihood of leadership challenges. Likelihood ratio <1, decreasing the probability of survival.
   - Short time horizon: The less than two-month period before the question resolves is a strong factor in favor of Feijóo's survival. Likelihood ratio >1, increasing the probability of survival.
   - Lack of scheduled party congress or election: This reduces the opportunity for organized challenges. Likelihood ratio >1, increasing the probability of survival.
   - Ongoing negative press: This erodes Feijóo's authority but is less impactful than structural factors. Likelihood ratio slightly <1, slightly decreasing the probability of survival.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 95% / 5% = 19
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio for the combined evidence might be around 0.8 (accounting for both positive and negative factors).
   - Posterior odds = 19 × 0.8 = 15.2
   - Posterior probability = 15.2 / (1 + 15.2) ≈ 93.5%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis might underestimate the potential for rapid political shifts in crisis situations. However, the short timeline remains a strong inertial factor.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden, unforeseen scandal or health issue could force a resignation. While possible, these are low-probability events.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong structural factors favoring survival, the probability remains high, but vigilance for new developments is necessary.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability reflects both the base rate and the impact of the evidence, with a slight adjustment for the recent negative developments.

Final: 93%

# Will Alberto Núñez Feijóo serve continuously as leader of Spain's People's Party (PP) through the end of 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for a party leader remaining in their position over a short time period (approximately 58 days from November 3, 2025, to December 31, 2025).

The most appropriate base rate comes from looking at:
- The typical tenure stability of opposition leaders in major European conservative parties
- The specific history of PP leadership changes
- The conditional probability of leadership change in a short timeframe

Based on the research report, PP has had only four opposition leaders since 1989, with two (Aznar and Rajoy) surviving failed election bids to eventually become Prime Minister, while one (Casado) was forced out after about 3.5 years. This suggests relative stability in leadership positions.

For a short 58-day window, the base rate for leadership change is very low. The research suggests a 90-95% chance of survival in any given two-month window for a leader in Feijóo's position.

I'll select a prior of **95%** that Feijóo will remain leader through the end of 2025, which is equivalent to 19:1 odds in favor of his continued leadership.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Feijóo is an established leader (in position since April 2022, so ~3.5 years by the resolution date)
- He leads a major European conservative party in opposition
- There are no scheduled party congresses or national elections before the end of 2025
- He was brought in specifically as a stabilizing figure after internal party turmoil

**Differences from base case:**
- The DANA flood disaster and resignation of Valencia's PP regional president Carlos Mazón represents an acute crisis of competence for the party
- This is happening very close to the resolution date (Mazón resigned on November 3, 2025)
- The crisis directly implicates the party's governance capabilities, which is central to Feijóo's political brand
- There are ongoing protests and public anger specifically directed at PP governance

These differences suggest a higher risk than the base rate would indicate, but the extremely short timeframe (58 days) provides a strong counterbalance.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Carlos Mazón's resignation over DANA flood disaster**
- P(E|H): Probability of this resignation if Feijóo will remain leader = 0.8 (Fairly high - regional leaders can resign without affecting national leadership)
- P(E|~H): Probability of this resignation if Feijóo will not remain leader = 0.9 (Very high - this could be the catalyst for his removal)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.9 = 0.89
- This evidence slightly decreases the probability of Feijóo remaining leader

**Evidence 2: Extremely short timeframe (58 days) until resolution**
- P(E|H): Probability of having only 58 days if Feijóo will remain leader = 1.0 (This timeframe favors inertia)
- P(E|~H): Probability of having only 58 days if Feijóo will not remain leader = 0.3 (Leadership changes typically take longer to organize)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.0/0.3 = 3.33
- This evidence significantly increases the probability of Feijóo remaining leader

**Evidence 3: No scheduled party congress or election before year-end**
- P(E|H): Probability of no scheduled events if Feijóo will remain leader = 0.9 (Absence of focal points helps incumbents)
- P(E|~H): Probability of no scheduled events if Feijóo will not remain leader = 0.5 (Harder to organize a challenge without these events)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.5 = 1.8
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of Feijóo remaining leader

**Evidence 4: Ongoing public anger and protests over DANA response**
- P(E|H): Probability of ongoing protests if Feijóo will remain leader = 0.7 (Leaders often weather protests)
- P(E|~H): Probability of ongoing protests if Feijóo will not remain leader = 0.9 (Public pressure is a key factor in leadership changes)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.9 = 0.78
- This evidence slightly decreases the probability of Feijóo remaining leader

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 19:1 (95% probability), I'll update based on the evidence:

Posterior odds = 19 × 0.89 × 3.33 × 1.8 × 0.78 = 79.5

Converting back to probability:
Posterior probability = 79.5/(1 + 79.5) = 0.988 or 98.8%

This seems too high given the crisis situation. Let me reconsider the likelihood ratios more conservatively:

**Revised update:**
- Evidence 1 (Mazón resignation): LR = 0.7 (more weight to this crisis)
- Evidence 2 (Short timeframe): LR = 2.5 (still strong but less extreme)
- Evidence 3 (No scheduled events): LR = 1.5 (moderate effect)
- Evidence 4 (Public protests): LR = 0.8 (slight negative)

Revised posterior odds = 19 × 0.7 × 2.5 × 1.5 × 0.8 = 39.9
Revised posterior probability = 39.9/(1 + 39.9) = 0.976 or 97.6%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating how quickly a leadership crisis can unfold in Spanish politics
- The DANA crisis could be more severe than apparent from the information provided
- There could be pre-existing tensions within PP that weren't captured in the research
- I might be overweighting the importance of the short timeframe

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Feijóo could voluntarily step down to take responsibility for the DANA crisis, especially if investigations reveal party negligence
- A health issue or personal reason could cause him to step aside temporarily (which would resolve to "No")
- Isabel Díaz Ayuso (Madrid's regional president) could capitalize on this moment to launch a leadership challenge

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest case for a "No" outcome would be that the DANA crisis represents a perfect storm: a clear failure of PP governance, a resignation of a key regional leader, and ongoing public protests. If Feijóo is seen as mishandling this crisis in the coming weeks, powerful regional "barons" might decide to act quickly to save the party's reputation.

**Rebuttal:**
However, even in this scenario, the mechanics of leadership change in major parties typically take months, not weeks. Without a scheduled party congress, removing Feijóo would require extraordinary measures that would themselves be politically costly. The party would likely prefer to weather this storm rather than create additional internal chaos so close to year-end.

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the severity of the crisis and the possibility of unforeseen developments. A reduction of about 5 percentage points seems appropriate.

## 6. Final Forecast

Starting with my revised posterior of 97.6%, and applying a 5 percentage point reduction to account for the red team considerations, I arrive at a final forecast of 92.6%.

Given the extremely short timeframe, the absence of scheduled party events, and the high political cost of leadership change, I believe Feijóo is very likely to remain PP leader through the end of 2025, despite the significant crisis he currently faces.

Final: 93%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is whether Alberto Núñez Feijóo will continuously serve as the leader of Spain's People's Party (PP) through the end of 2025. The forecast is being made on November 3, 2025, leaving a very short period of just under two months.

An appropriate reference class is the tenure of leaders of major Spanish opposition parties. Leadership changes are infrequent events, typically occurring after lost elections or at scheduled party congresses. For a leader to be ousted within a specific, non-event-driven two-month window is rare. Looking at past PP leaders in opposition (Aznar, Rajoy, Casado), there has been only one forced removal (Casado) in over 17 years of combined opposition leadership. This suggests a very low monthly probability of being ousted.

Based on this, a reasonable prior probability for a leader in this position surviving a given two-month period is very high. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **95%**, where H is the event that Feijóo remains leader. This corresponds to prior odds of 19 to 1 in favor of survival.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs significantly from a "normal" two-month period for an opposition leader.

*   **Similarities**: Feijóo is an opposition leader who failed to form a government after the last election, a position of inherent weakness where internal patience can wear thin. His tenure of ~3.5 years is similar to that of his predecessor, Pablo Casado, who was ousted.

*   **Differences**:
    *   **Acute Crisis**: The situation is dominated by a severe, non-electoral crisis: the political fallout from the DANA flood disaster in Valencia. This crisis directly attacks the PP's core brand of governmental competence.
    *   **Major Escalation**: The crisis has just escalated dramatically with the resignation of Carlos Mazón, the PP's regional president in Valencia. This is a "blood in the water" moment that creates immense pressure for accountability at the national level.
    *   **Short Timeframe**: The resolution date is less than two months away. This is a crucial difference. Ousting a party leader is a complex, politically risky process that is very difficult to organize and execute successfully in such a short period, especially without a pre-scheduled party congress to act as a focal point.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate two key clusters of evidence: the crisis itself and the structural factors.

*   **Evidence 1: The DANA crisis and Mazón's resignation.**
    *   This evidence strongly favors the "No" outcome (Feijóo is ousted). A crisis of this magnitude is a primary catalyst for leadership challenges. If Feijóo were to be ousted in the next two months (~H), it is almost certain that this crisis would be the cause (P(E1 | ~H) ≈ 1). A leader can survive such a crisis (H), but it's a severe test, so the probability of such a crisis occurring and the leader surviving is lower (P(E1 | H) < 1).
    *   The likelihood ratio (P(E1 | H) / P(E1 | ~H)) is therefore significantly less than 1. This evidence substantially decreases the probability of survival from the prior.

*   **Evidence 2: The short timeframe (<2 months) and lack of a scheduled party congress.**
    *   This evidence strongly favors the "Yes" outcome (Feijóo survives). The practical difficulty of coordinating a successful "palace coup" against an incumbent leader in under 58 days is immense. It requires rivals to overcome a significant collective action problem, and a failed attempt can be politically fatal for the plotters.
    *   The likelihood ratio for this structural evidence strongly favors survival. It acts as a powerful inertial brake on the momentum generated by the crisis.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will update the prior odds based on a qualitative synthesis of the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds**: 19 to 1 in favor of survival (95% probability).
*   **Impact of the Crisis**: The DANA crisis and Mazón's resignation are a severe shock. This is not a minor political setback; it's a fundamental challenge to the party's credibility. This evidence might decrease the odds of survival by a factor of 8-10. Let's use a factor of 9.
    *   Intermediate Odds = 19 / 9 ≈ 2.11 to 1. This corresponds to a probability of 2.11 / 3.11 ≈ 68%.
*   **Impact of Inertia**: The short timeframe and lack of a congress provide a strong defense. This inertia makes it much harder for the negative pressure to translate into a successful ousting. This factor might increase the odds of survival by a factor of 3.
    *   Posterior Odds = 2.11 * 3 ≈ 6.33 to 1.
*   **Posterior Probability**: A final odds of 6.33 to 1 corresponds to a probability of 6.33 / (1 + 6.33) ≈ **86%**.

This calculation seems a bit high. An alternative method is to estimate the probabilities of the different paths to a "No" resolution.
1.  **Forced Resignation (Coup)**: Rivals (like Isabel Díaz Ayuso) see this as a unique opportunity and successfully coordinate to force him out. This is risky for them, but plausible. I estimate a **12%** chance of this happening before year-end.
2.  **Voluntary Resignation**: Feijóo decides his position is untenable and resigns for the good of the party. Less likely, as leaders tend to resist. I estimate a **3%** chance.
3.  **Other Reasons**: An unrelated health crisis or scandal, or a temporary step-aside that triggers the "continuously" clause. I estimate a **2%** chance.

Summing these paths gives a total probability of "No" of 12% + 3% + 2% = 17%. This implies a **83%** probability of "Yes". This scenario-based estimate feels more grounded.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~83% could be wrong if I am underestimating the speed and ferocity of modern political crises. The combination of media pressure and internal panic could make Feijóo's position untenable in a matter of days, not weeks, rendering the "short timeframe" defense less effective than I assume. A rival like Ayuso might calculate that the risk of *not* acting now is greater than the risk of acting, if she believes Feijóo's leadership is now permanently damaged. This suggests the true probability could be lower.

Conversely, I might be underestimating the party's desire for stability. Having just gone through the traumatic ousting of Pablo Casado, the PP "barons" may have a very high tolerance for weathering this storm to avoid another destructive internal war. This would suggest the true probability is higher.

Balancing these considerations, the 83% figure seems reasonable, but the crisis is severe enough to warrant a slight downward adjustment to account for the "fast-moving crisis" scenario. I will adjust my final forecast slightly lower.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for Feijóo's survival over a short two-month period is very high. However, he is facing an acute and severe political crisis following the DANA floods and the resignation of a key regional president. This event provides a powerful catalyst for a potential leadership challenge. This downward pressure is significantly counteracted by the powerful inertia of a very short timeframe and the lack of a scheduled party congress, which makes organizing a successful coup difficult and risky for challengers. Weighing the severity of the crisis against the strong structural barriers to a rapid change, I conclude that survival is the likely outcome, but the risk of an ousting is now substantial.

Final: 81%
