### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All Months (1985-Present):** The long-term mean of the monthly US EPU index is approximately 135, with a median of around 110. This class shows the index is right-skewed, with frequent periods of low uncertainty punctuated by sharp, high-magnitude spikes. The 75th percentile is around 150. This class provides the broadest possible base rate but may understate risk in the current environment.
2.  **Months Following a Government Shutdown:** Historically, government shutdowns or near-shutdowns (e.g., 2011, 2013, 2018) are followed by periods of elevated EPU. The index values in the 1-2 months following these events have typically been in the **180-300 range**. This class is highly relevant given the October 2025 shutdown mentioned in the sources.
3.  **Periods of Active US-China Trade Tensions:** The 2018-2019 period, characterized by escalating tariffs, saw the EPU index frequently hover in the **200-350 range**. Given the background information that H1 2025 saw tariff-related spikes and that tensions remain, this class is also a strong prior. The combination of classes 2 and 3 suggests a high baseline.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-07** Fed survey identifies policy uncertainty as a top financial stability concern. — **↑** — Matters because it confirms that key economic institutions view the current environment as highly uncertain, likely keeping the topic salient in financial news.
*   **2025-10-07** EPU index spikes due to a U.S. government shutdown, tariffs, and immigration policy. — **↑** — Matters because the shutdown is a major, recent driver that directly increases media discussion of fiscal paralysis and its economic impact, with effects that will linger into Nov/Dec.
*   **2025-H1** Trump administration tariff announcements cause initial EPU spikes for the year. — **↑** — Matters because it established a high-uncertainty regime for 2025, and the underlying trade issues remain unresolved, providing a high floor for the index.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Fiscal Policy Gridlock (Large):** The primary driver for Nov/Dec. Congressional negotiations over a continuing resolution (CR) or a full budget following the October shutdown will dominate policy news. Failure to find a resolution or threats of another shutdown would cause a large spike.
2.  **Trade Policy Actions (Large):** Any new tariff announcements, escalations in tensions with China, or high-stakes negotiations would significantly increase the index. The lack of new developments could allow the index to drift down.
3.  **Presidential Communications (Moderate):** Unpredictable statements, tweets, or policy announcements from the White House, particularly on the economy, trade, or the Federal Reserve, can generate significant media coverage and uncertainty.
4.  **Monetary Policy Surprises (Moderate):** While the December FOMC meeting is scheduled, any unexpected statements about future policy, inflation, or criticism of the Fed's independence (as noted in the Fed survey) would drive the index up.
5.  **Geopolitical Shocks (Moderate):** An external crisis requiring a significant and uncertain U.S. policy response would increase the index.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Compound Uncertainty:** The current situation combines two major historical drivers of high EPU: a recent government shutdown *and* an active, unresolved trade dispute. Typically, these occur separately. This combination suggests a multiplicative, rather than additive, effect on uncertainty.
*   **Elevated Starting Point:** Unlike many historical periods, the forecast for Nov/Dec begins from an already high level of uncertainty established by tariffs in H1 and the shutdown in October. There is less room for the index to "revert to the mean" in the short term.
*   **Explicit Institutional Concern:** The Federal Reserve is publicly highlighting policy uncertainty as a primary risk. This official validation can amplify media narratives and business caution, creating a feedback loop that sustains a high EPU reading.
*   **Persistent Political Polarization:** The political environment that led to the October shutdown has not changed, making a smooth and rapid resolution to budget issues less likely than in some past fiscal standoffs.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered in the **190-240 range** seems appropriate, drawing from the reference classes of post-shutdown months and periods of trade tension. Strength should be moderate (equivalent n≈10), acknowledging the index's high volatility.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ Large:** The October government shutdown is a powerful, recent event whose consequences (i.e., budget negotiations) are the central policy issue for the forecast period.
    *   **↑ Moderate:** Ongoing, unresolved tariff issues provide a high and sticky floor for the index.
    *   **↑ Small:** The Fed's explicit statement on policy uncertainty validates the high-risk environment and may amplify media coverage.
    *   **↓ Small:** The absence of a *new* shock (e.g., a new tariff tranche) in Nov/Dec could lead to a slight decay from the October peak, but not a return to the historical mean.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the high-uncertainty prior. The posterior should be confidently placed well above the long-term average, likely in the **220-280 range**, with a significant right tail reflecting the possibility of a renewed government shutdown crisis in December.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from congressional leaders or the White House threatening another shutdown if budget demands are not met.
    *   News reports of new tariff considerations or a breakdown in trade talks with China.
    *   Passage of a very short-term Continuing Resolution (e.g., 1-2 weeks), kicking the can down the road and setting up another fiscal cliff in December.
    *   Unexpectedly hawkish FOMC minutes or statements.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A bipartisan agreement on a long-term budget or a CR that funds the government through early 2026.
    *   Positive announcements regarding US-China trade relations or a rollback of existing tariffs.
    *   A period of low activity in major policy announcements from the White House.
    *   A predictable, "on-script" FOMC meeting and press conference in December.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Media-Driven Index:** The index measures media coverage of uncertainty, not uncertainty itself. It can be swayed by journalistic focus and "narrative of the month" effects.
*   **Spikiness:** The index is highly volatile. A single major event (e.g., a surprise announcement on Dec 20th) could dramatically alter the monthly average, making point prediction difficult. The forecast should be probabilistic, focusing on the likelihood of a high-value outcome.
*   **Lagging Data:** The official value for a given month is released after the month has concluded. We are forecasting the content of news articles that have not yet been written.
*   **Keyword Sensitivity:** The index relies on a fixed basket of keywords. If the language used to describe policy uncertainty evolves (e.g., focusing more on "geopolitical risk" or "AI policy"), the index might not fully capture the sentiment.

**Final Research Summary:** The EPU index is positioned to remain at a highly elevated level through December 2025. The recent government shutdown creates a near-term fiscal policy crisis that will dominate news coverage, while unresolved trade tensions provide a high underlying baseline of uncertainty.

To forecast the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index for the US for December 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from historical periods of high economic policy uncertainty, particularly those following government shutdowns and during active US-China trade tensions. The index typically ranges between 180-300 in such scenarios. Given the current context, a prior centered in the 190-240 range is appropriate, with a moderate variance reflecting the index's historical volatility.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation mirrors past periods of high uncertainty due to the recent government shutdown and ongoing trade tensions.
   - Differences: The combination of these factors, along with explicit institutional concern from the Fed, suggests a higher baseline than typical post-shutdown periods.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The October shutdown and unresolved trade issues increase the likelihood of higher EPU values. The Fed's concern about policy uncertainty further supports this. However, the absence of new shocks in November/December could slightly reduce the index from October's peak.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior in the 190-240 range, the evidence of continued fiscal gridlock and trade tensions shifts the posterior upwards. The likelihood of a high EPU reading is reinforced, suggesting a posterior distribution in the 220-280 range, with a right tail for potential new crises.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence is mitigated by considering the index's volatility and media-driven nature. Alternative scenarios, such as a rapid budget resolution or positive trade developments, could lower the index. However, these are less likely given the current political climate.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the EPU index in December 2025 are as follows:

P10: 210  
P20: 220  
P40: 240  
P60: 260  
P80: 280  
P90: 300

# Forecasting the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for December 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use a combination of two relevant reference classes:
- **Post-government shutdown periods**: Following shutdowns (2011, 2013, 2018), the EPU index typically ranges from 180-300
- **Active US-China trade tension periods**: During 2018-2019 trade disputes, the EPU index ranged from 200-350

Given the October 2025 shutdown and ongoing trade tensions with China, I'll use a prior centered around 220, with a relatively wide spread (standard deviation of about 60) to account for the high volatility of the index. This prior reflects that we're starting from an already elevated uncertainty environment.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes:**
- We have a recent government shutdown (October 2025) similar to historical shutdown episodes
- Active trade tensions with China continue, similar to the 2018-2019 period
- Political polarization remains high, creating fiscal policy gridlock

**Key differences:**
- The current situation combines TWO major drivers (shutdown + trade tensions) simultaneously
- We have explicit institutional concern from the Federal Reserve about policy uncertainty
- We're starting from an already elevated baseline due to H1 2025 tariff announcements
- The December timeframe includes potential budget deadline pressures if only short-term resolutions were passed after October's shutdown

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing the forecast higher:**
- The October 2025 government shutdown created a spike in the EPU index, and budget negotiations will continue into November/December (strong upward push, ~1.5x likelihood ratio)
- The Fed explicitly identified policy uncertainty as a top financial stability concern on November 7, 2025 (moderate upward push, ~1.2x likelihood ratio)
- Ongoing unresolved tariff issues from H1 2025 provide a high floor for uncertainty (moderate upward push, ~1.3x likelihood ratio)

**Evidence pushing the forecast lower:**
- Absence of new shocks could allow some decay from October's peak (weak downward push, ~0.9x likelihood ratio)
- December historically shows some seasonal patterns as Congress tries to resolve issues before year-end (weak downward push, ~0.95x likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 220 with a standard deviation of 60, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on government shutdown aftermath:**
- Prior: centered at 220
- Likelihood: 1.5x more likely to see higher values
- Posterior: shifts upward to approximately 245

**Update on combined trade tensions:**
- Prior: now centered at 245
- Likelihood: 1.3x more likely to see higher values
- Posterior: shifts upward to approximately 260

**Update on potential seasonal resolution effects:**
- Prior: now centered at 260
- Likelihood: 0.95x as likely to see higher values (slight downward pressure)
- Posterior: shifts slightly downward to approximately 255

The posterior distribution is now centered around 255, with a still-wide but slightly reduced standard deviation of about 55, and a right-skewed shape reflecting the potential for extreme spikes.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent events (recency bias) and underestimating how quickly the EPU can revert after a spike
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a bipartisan budget agreement in December to avoid holiday-period shutdowns
- The index measures media coverage, not actual uncertainty, and media attention could shift to other topics by December

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would center around 200, arguing that:
- The October shutdown will be resolved with a longer-term agreement
- Media attention will shift away from economic policy uncertainty
- Historical mean reversion is stronger than I've accounted for

**Rebuttal:**
While mean reversion is real, the combination of multiple uncertainty drivers (fiscal, trade, monetary) makes this situation unusual. The index rarely returns to normal levels when the underlying issues remain unresolved.

**Tail risk consideration:**
There's a significant right tail risk of another shutdown threat in December if only short-term funding was agreed to after October. This could push the index well above 300.

Based on this red-teaming, I'll slightly widen my uncertainty bands and ensure my distribution properly captures the right-skewed nature of the index.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 180
P20: 205
P40: 240
P60: 270
P80: 310
P90: 350

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, which is known for its right-skewed distribution, characterized by long periods of relative calm punctuated by sharp spikes. I will use a composite of two specific reference classes as my prior:

*   **Reference Class A: Months Following a Government Shutdown.** The research report notes that in the 1-2 months following shutdowns (e.g., 2013, 2018), the index typically falls in the **180-300 range**. This is highly relevant given the October 2025 shutdown.
*   **Reference Class B: Periods of Active U.S.-China Trade Tensions.** The 2018-2019 period, which the current situation resembles, saw the index frequently in the **200-350 range**.

Combining these two classes suggests a prior distribution centered significantly higher than the long-term historical median (~110). I will establish a prior with a median around **220**, reflecting the high-uncertainty environment created by these dual pressures. The distribution is wide and right-skewed.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in late 2025 is unusual because it combines two powerful historical drivers of EPU that often occur separately: the immediate aftermath of a government shutdown and an ongoing, salient trade dispute.

*   **Similarities:** The political polarization and the presence of a Trump administration engaged in tariff-based trade policy are highly analogous to the 2018-2019 period.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the *compounding* of these factors. The fiscal uncertainty from the shutdown is layered on top of an already elevated baseline of trade uncertainty from H1 2025. This suggests the potential for a multiplicative, rather than additive, effect on the index, pushing the expected value higher than in periods with only one of these drivers.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to update my prior.

*   **October 2025 Government Shutdown (Strong Upward Pressure):** This is the most significant recent event. The forecast for December is contingent on the outcome of budget negotiations. A short-term continuing resolution would likely push the fiscal cliff into December, creating a new crisis and keeping the EPU index very high. This evidence makes values in the 250-400 range much more likely than values below 200.
*   **Ongoing Tariff/Trade Tensions (Moderate Upward Pressure):** The background states that tariff issues from H1 2025 "remain salient." This acts as a high floor for the index, making a return to the historical median (<150) highly improbable, even if the shutdown is resolved smoothly.
*   **Fed Survey Highlighting Policy Uncertainty (Small Upward Pressure):** The Federal Reserve's public identification of policy uncertainty as a top financial stability concern on November 7th validates the high-risk environment. This can create a media feedback loop, as journalists have an official source to cite when writing about uncertainty, which directly increases the index's value.
*   **Potential for Time Decay (Small Downward Pressure):** In the absence of *new* shocks in November or December, media attention could wane, causing the index to drift down from its October peak. However, given the unresolved nature of both the budget and trade issues, a significant decay is less likely.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   My prior distribution was centered around a median of 220, based on historical analogies.
*   The evidence, particularly the high likelihood of continued fiscal conflict in December stemming from the October shutdown, strongly pushes this distribution to the right. The shutdown's aftermath is not just a single data point but an ongoing process that will generate news throughout the forecast period.
*   The combined evidence shifts the median of my posterior distribution upward from ~220 to the **240-260 range**. The variance also increases, as the outcome is highly dependent on political negotiations. The right tail becomes fatter to account for a "perfect storm" scenario where the budget crisis and trade tensions escalate simultaneously in December.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario (Forecast is too high):** A "Christmas Truce" scenario where Congress passes a long-term funding bill in November, and trade tensions coincidentally enter a quiet phase. This could cause the index to fall faster than expected, perhaps toward the **170-190 range**. While possible, the described political environment makes this a less likely outcome. My lower percentiles (P10, P20) must account for this possibility.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Forecast is too low):** A "Perfect Storm" scenario where a temporary funding measure expires in mid-December, sparking a new shutdown crisis just before the holidays. This could be combined with a major new tariff announcement. Such a confluence of events could easily push the index above **400**, similar to other major historical crises. My upper percentiles (P80, P90) must reflect this significant tail risk.
*   **Self-Correction:** My initial thoughts might be anchored too closely to the 200-300 range. The "Perfect Storm" scenario is plausible enough to warrant a P90 value of 400, acknowledging the index's capacity for extreme spikes. The distribution must be wide to reflect the binary nature of the potential outcomes (deal vs. no deal).

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast reflects a high median value with significant right-skew and wide uncertainty, driven by the confluence of fiscal and trade policy risks.

P10: 170
P20: 190
P40: 220
P60: 280
P80: 340
P90: 400
