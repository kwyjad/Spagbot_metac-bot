### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Pandemic, Test-Optional Harvard (Classes 2026-2028):** This is the most relevant reference class. The shift to test-optional admissions beginning with the Class of 2025 created a structural break, massively increasing applications.
    *   **Base Rate:** 3.19% to 3.59% (Average: ~3.4%).
    *   **Reasoning:** This period reflects the current high-application regime. Class of 2026 (3.19%), Class of 2027 (3.41%), and Class of 2028 (3.59%). The numerator (admitted students) has been stable at ~1,940, so the rate is almost entirely a function of the applicant pool size.
    *   **Limitations:** This is a small sample (n=3) and contains significant volatility driven by the novelty of test-optional policies and the first year of post-affirmative action admissions.

2.  **Pre-Pandemic Harvard (Classes 2020-2024):** This class reflects a more stable, but now outdated, admissions environment where standardized tests were required.
    *   **Base Rate:** 4.5% to 5.9%.
    *   **Reasoning:** Represents the "old normal" before the test-optional application surge. Useful for understanding what might happen if application numbers were to revert, but this is unlikely in the short term.
    *   **Limitations:** The structural change to test-optional admissions makes this class a poor direct predictor for the Class of 2029.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*Note: The Class of 2029 admissions cycle occurred during late 2024 and early 2025. The key developments are those affecting that cycle.*

- **2024-05-29** Harvard announces it will continue its test-optional policy through the Class of 2030. ↓ — This ensures the applicant pool remains structurally larger than in the pre-pandemic era, keeping downward pressure on the admit rate.
- **2024-06-23** The Supreme Court's SFFA v. Harvard decision (banning race-conscious admissions) has its first full-cycle test with the Class of 2028, resulting in a 5% drop in applications. ↑ — This precedent suggests the Class of 2029 may also see a slightly depressed applicant pool compared to the peak, which would push the admit rate up.
- **2024-12-12** Harvard announces Early Action (EA) results for the Class of 2029, showing 7,921 applications, a 5% decrease from the previous year. ↑ — The EA pool is a strong leading indicator for the total applicant pool. A decrease here points to a smaller denominator and thus a higher overall admit rate.
- **2025-01-15** Widespread media reports detail the chaotic rollout of the new FAFSA form, causing significant delays and confusion for students seeking financial aid. ↑ — This is a major headwind for application volume, particularly from lower-income students, likely reducing the total applicant pool and increasing the admit rate.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Total Applicant Pool Size (Denominator):** The primary driver of the admit rate. A larger pool decreases the rate, and a smaller pool increases it. This is highly sensitive to policy changes and national trends. (Size: Large)
2.  **Target Class Size (Numerator):** Harvard aims for a consistent entering class size (~1,660), which means they admit a relatively stable number of students (~1,950) to account for yield. This acts as an anchor. (Size: Small)
3.  **Test-Optional Policy:** By removing a significant barrier to entry, this policy structurally inflates the applicant pool, especially with applicants who would not have applied otherwise. This exerts strong downward pressure on the rate. (Size: Large)
4.  **Post-Affirmative Action Uncertainty:** The SFFA v. Harvard ruling may deter some minority applicants and change how all applicants approach their essays, potentially depressing the overall application volume from its peak. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **FAFSA Application Friction:** The significant technical and logistical problems with the 2024-2025 FAFSA form are a one-time shock that likely suppressed applications from aid-dependent students across the country. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Yield Management:** If Harvard anticipates a lower yield rate (the percentage of admitted students who enroll), they may admit slightly more students to fill the class, which would increase the admit rate. The post-SFFA environment could affect yield calculations. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Second Year Post-SFFA:** Unlike the Class of 2028 (the first post-ruling class), the Class of 2029 cycle operates with more information, but also potentially sustained behavioral changes (e.g., depressed applications from certain demographics) that are now becoming clearer.
- **Unique FAFSA Disruption:** The 2024-2025 FAFSA rollout failure is a unique, cycle-specific event not present in any of the reference class years. It acts as a significant drag on application volume.
- **Maturing Test-Optional Environment:** The initial, massive surge in applications due to test-optional policies may be leveling off or slightly receding as the novelty wears off and other factors (like the SFFA ruling) come into play.
- **Increased Scrutiny on Elite Admissions:** Public and political discourse around legacy admissions, donor preferences, and the value of an elite degree is more intense than in previous years, which could be a minor headwind on application growth.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** A tight distribution centered on the average of the last three years (~3.4%), with more weight on the most recent Class of 2028 rate (3.59%). An initial prior of **3.5%** (equivalent n≈10) seems reasonable.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **(↑ Large)** FAFSA disruption significantly reduces the likely applicant pool (denominator).
    - **(↑ Moderate)** Early Action data showed a 5% drop, a strong signal of a smaller total pool.
    - **(↑ Small)** Second-year effects of the SFFA ruling likely continue to slightly depress applications versus the peak.
    - **(↓ Small)** The continuation of the test-optional policy keeps the applicant pool structurally large, preventing a return to pre-2020 rates.
- **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points to a smaller denominator than in the past two cycles. With a stable numerator, the posterior should shift **moderately upwards** from the prior, likely exceeding the Class of 2028's 3.59%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*Note: As the admissions cycle is complete, these are indicators that would have been watched. Their outcomes are reflected in the analysis above.*
- **UP indicators (suggesting a higher admit rate):**
    - Final Common Application data showing flat or negative growth for top-tier universities.
    - Peer institutions (e.g., Yale, Princeton, Stanford) reporting a year-over-year decline in applications.
    - Surveys or reports detailing the extent to which FAFSA issues prevented students from applying to college.
    - Harvard announcing a slightly larger-than-usual number of admitted students to manage yield uncertainty.
- **DOWN indicators (suggesting a lower admit rate):**
    - A surprise late surge in regular decision applications that reverses the EA trend.
    - Harvard explicitly stating an intention to slightly reduce the target class size (highly unlikely).
    - Reports of a significant increase in international applications, offsetting domestic declines.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Numerator Stability Assumption:** While the number of admitted students is usually stable, Harvard could make a small adjustment based on yield models, which are more uncertain in the post-SFFA era.
- **EA to RD Translation:** A drop in Early Action applications does not always translate to an identical drop in the overall pool, though it is a strong correlate.
- **Data Reporting:** The final, official number is what matters. Harvard could theoretically change its calculation method, though this is extremely unlikely.
- **Interacting Effects:** The effects of the SFFA ruling

To forecast the Harvard admit rate for the undergraduate class of 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is the post-pandemic, test-optional Harvard (Classes 2026-2028), with an average admit rate of approximately 3.4%. This period reflects the current high-application regime due to the test-optional policy.
   - **Reasoning:** The test-optional policy has significantly increased the applicant pool, making this period the most relevant for predicting the Class of 2029 admit rate.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The continuation of the test-optional policy ensures a structurally larger applicant pool, similar to the recent classes.
   - **Differences:** The FAFSA disruption and the second-year effects of the SFFA ruling are unique to the Class of 2029, likely reducing the applicant pool compared to the recent past.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **FAFSA Disruption:** This is a major headwind for application volume, likely reducing the total applicant pool and increasing the admit rate. (↑ Large)
   - **Early Action Data:** A 5% decrease in EA applications suggests a smaller total applicant pool, pushing the admit rate up. (↑ Moderate)
   - **SFFA Ruling:** Continued effects may slightly depress applications, increasing the admit rate. (↑ Small)
   - **Test-Optional Policy:** Maintains a large applicant pool, exerting downward pressure on the admit rate. (↓ Small)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered on 3.5%, reflecting the average of recent years with more weight on the Class of 2028 rate (3.59%).
   - **Update:** The evidence points to a smaller applicant pool, suggesting an upward shift in the admit rate. The posterior distribution should reflect a moderate increase from the prior, likely exceeding the Class of 2028's 3.59%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a late surge in applications or changes in yield management that could affect the admit rate.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** A surprise increase in international applications could offset domestic declines, potentially lowering the admit rate.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the strong evidence of a reduced applicant pool, the forecast remains moderately higher than the prior.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted admit rate for the Harvard undergraduate class of 2029 is as follows:

P10: 3.6  
P20: 3.7  
P40: 3.8  
P60: 3.9  
P80: 4.0  
P90: 4.1

# Forecasting Harvard's Class of 2029 Admit Rate

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use the post-pandemic, test-optional Harvard admissions rates as my primary base rate:
- Class of 2026: 3.19%
- Class of 2027: 3.41% 
- Class of 2028: 3.59%

This gives a mean of approximately 3.4% with a modest upward trend. I select this reference class because it represents the current structural regime of Harvard admissions after the shift to test-optional policies, which created a permanent increase in application volume compared to pre-pandemic levels.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Harvard continues its test-optional policy through the Class of 2030
- Target class size remains stable (~1,660 students)
- Harvard continues to admit ~1,940 students to account for yield
- Elite university admissions remain highly competitive

**Differences from base rate:**
- Second full admissions cycle after the SFFA v. Harvard decision (banning race-conscious admissions)
- Early Action data shows a 5% decrease in applications compared to previous year
- Significant FAFSA form implementation problems created barriers for financial aid applicants
- The novelty effect of test-optional policies may be wearing off slightly

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing admit rate higher:**
- 5% decrease in Early Action applications (strong signal): This suggests the total applicant pool will be smaller, directly increasing the admit rate. Likelihood ratio ~2:1 favoring higher rates.
- FAFSA implementation problems (moderate signal): Technical issues likely prevented some students from applying, particularly affecting lower-income applicants. Likelihood ratio ~1.5:1 favoring higher rates.
- Second-year effects of SFFA ruling (weak signal): Continued uncertainty about how Harvard evaluates applications post-affirmative action may deter some applicants. Likelihood ratio ~1.2:1 favoring higher rates.

**Evidence pushing admit rate lower:**
- Continued test-optional policy (weak counterbalance): Maintains structurally higher application numbers compared to pre-pandemic era, but this is already factored into the base rate. Likelihood ratio ~1:1.1 favoring lower rates.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered at 3.4% (the average of the last three classes), I'll update based on the evidence:

- Prior: ~3.4% (with moderate confidence)
- Update on EA application decrease: 3.4% × (2/1) → ~3.6%
- Update on FAFSA issues: 3.6% × (1.5/1) → ~3.8%
- Update on SFFA second-year effects: 3.8% × (1.2/1) → ~3.9%
- Counterbalance from test-optional continuation: 3.9% × (1/1.1) → ~3.85%

The posterior distribution is centered around 3.85%, with increased variance to account for uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the impact of the FAFSA issues on Harvard specifically, as its applicants tend to be wealthier than average.
- The Early Action decrease might not translate proportionally to Regular Decision.
- Harvard might adjust its target class size or admission numbers to manage yield uncertainty.
- International applications could surge, offsetting domestic declines.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 3.5%, arguing that the FAFSA issues primarily affected less selective schools and that Harvard's global brand insulates it from minor application fluctuations.

Rebuttal: The EA data provides a strong signal, and the FAFSA issues were widespread enough to affect even wealthy students who qualify for some aid.

I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these uncertainties.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.4%
P20: 3.5%
P40: 3.7%
P60: 3.9%
P80: 4.1%
P90: 4.3%

Here is my probabilistic forecast for the Harvard admit rate for the undergraduate class of 2029.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the admissions data from the post-pandemic, test-optional era, specifically for the Classes of 2026, 2027, and 2028. This period represents a new admissions regime characterized by a structurally larger applicant pool due to the removal of standardized test requirements.

*   **Reference Class:** Harvard Classes 2026-2028.
*   **Data:**
    *   Class of 2026: 3.19%
    *   Class of 2027: 3.41%
    *   Class of 2028: 3.59%
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** This gives a mean of approximately 3.40% and a median close to 3.41%. The most recent data point (3.59% for the Class of 2028) is the most relevant, as it's the first to incorporate the effects of the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action (SFFA v. Harvard). Therefore, my prior distribution is centered around **3.5%**, with a standard deviation reflecting the recent range (e.g., covering 3.2% to 3.8%).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The admissions cycle for the Class of 2029 is similar to the base case in that the test-optional policy remains in effect, and it is the second year operating under the post-SFFA legal framework. However, it is critically different due to a major, one-time external shock: the chaotic rollout of the new FAFSA form. This event is expected to have suppressed application numbers nationwide, particularly among students requiring financial aid.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their likely impact on the applicant pool size (the denominator), assuming the number of admitted students (the numerator) remains stable at around 1,940. A smaller denominator leads to a higher admit rate.

*   **FAFSA Disruption (Strong Upward Pressure ↑):** Widespread technical issues and delays with the 2024-2025 FAFSA form created a significant barrier to applying to college. This is strong evidence for a smaller national applicant pool, which would almost certainly affect Harvard. This makes a lower-than-usual number of applicants much more likely, thus pushing the admit rate up.
*   **Early Action (EA) Data (Strong Upward Pressure ↑):** The research report states that Harvard's EA applications for the Class of 2029 decreased by 5% year-over-year. The EA pool is a strong leading indicator of the total applicant pool. A 5% decline in total applications from the Class of 2028's 54,008 would result in ~51,300 applicants. With ~1,940 admitted students, this points to a rate of approximately **3.78%** (1940 / 51300).
*   **Second-Year Post-SFFA Effect (Moderate Upward Pressure ↑):** The Class of 2028 saw a 5% drop in applications, which was attributed to the SFFA ruling. The continued uncertainty and changes in application strategy likely continued to depress application volume for the Class of 2029 compared to the peak in 2022. This reinforces the trend suggested by the EA data.
*   **Continued Test-Optional Policy (Baseline):** This policy keeps the applicant pool structurally high compared to the pre-2020 era, preventing a return to rates above 4.5%. This is already incorporated into the base rate and is not new information for this cycle.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My prior was centered around 3.5%, reflecting the recent average but weighted towards the most recent outcome of 3.59%. The evidence, particularly the FAFSA disruption and the concrete 5% drop in EA applications, overwhelmingly points to a smaller applicant pool for the Class of 2029.

*   **Update Step:** I will update my prior median of ~3.5% with the strong likelihood implied by the EA data. A 5% drop in total applications points directly to a rate of ~3.78%. This becomes the new anchor for my posterior distribution.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The posterior distribution's median shifts significantly upward from the prior, from ~3.5% to around **3.80%**. The distribution is now centered on a higher admit rate, reflecting a smaller-than-expected denominator. The variance should account for the possibility that the total application drop was slightly more or less severe than the 5% seen in the EA round.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where this forecast is wrong.

*   **Alternative (Lower Rate):** Could the rate be closer to last year's 3.59%? This would require the drop in EA applications to be fully offset by a surge in Regular Decision (RD) applications, perhaps from international students unaffected by FAFSA. Or, Harvard could have anticipated a higher yield and admitted fewer students. While possible, the FAFSA issue was a powerful, cycle-wide headwind, making a surge in domestic RD applications unlikely. This scenario seems less probable.
*   **Alternative (Higher Rate):** Could the rate exceed 4.0%? This is plausible. If the FAFSA disruption and post-SFFA effects compounded, the total application drop could have been closer to 10%. A 10% drop from 54,008 applicants would be ~48,600, yielding an admit rate of **3.99%**. This represents a significant tail risk on the upside.
*   **Adjustment:** My central estimate around 3.8% seems robust, but the possibility of a larger-than-expected application drop is significant. I will ensure my P80 and P90 percentiles reflect this upside risk, extending the range to 4.0%. The lower bound seems more constrained, as a rate below the previous year's 3.59% is very unlikely.
