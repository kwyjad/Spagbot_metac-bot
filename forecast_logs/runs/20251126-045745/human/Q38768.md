### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Inner Circle of Major Corporate Fraud:** Executives in the C-suite or equivalent leadership at companies that collapse due to massive, publicly prosecuted fraud (e.g., Enron, WorldCom, Theranos). The conviction or guilty plea rate for this group is very high, likely **80-90%**. This class suggests a high prior for any top leader.
2.  **FTX/Alameda Inner Circle (Charged):** This is the most specific reference class. It includes Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, Nishad Singh, and Ryan Salame. Of this group of five, all have been convicted or pleaded guilty. The base rate is **100% (5/5)**. This suggests an extremely high prior.
3.  **Unindicted C-Suite Executives Three Years Post-Collapse:** A more nuanced class includes senior executives at fraudulent firms who were not immediately charged alongside the primary conspirators. The base rate of subsequent conviction for this group is significantly lower. Lacking systematic data, a ballpark estimate might be **10-20%**. These individuals often secure non-prosecution agreements, provide background cooperation, or the evidence against them is weaker.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-21** Salame plea hearing update — **↓** — Report confirms sentencing/incarceration for other key cooperators (Ellison, Singh, Wang). This signals the DOJ is in the final stages of the case, focusing on wrapping up existing pleas rather than initiating new prosecutions against central figures.
*   **2024-11-11** Trabucco settles with FTX estate — **↓** — He agreed to a major civil forfeiture ($70M+, property, yacht) with the bankruptcy estate. This resolves significant financial claims without an accompanying criminal plea, suggesting a potential global resolution where criminal charges are not pursued.
*   **2024-03-28** SBF sentenced to 25 years — **(neutral)** — While confirming the severity of the crimes, this event occurred well in the past relative to the horizon. It established the core narrative but does not change the calculus for uncharged individuals.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Judicial Timeline Constraint (Large ↓):** With the resolution deadline on Jan 1, 2026, there are roughly five weeks remaining. For a conviction to occur, an indictment must be filed, and a guilty plea must be negotiated and formally accepted by a judge in court. This is an exceptionally compressed timeline for the federal justice system, making it the single most powerful driver towards a "No" resolution. A full trial is impossible.
2.  **Prosecutorial Discretion & Priorities (Large ↓):** The SDNY has successfully convicted the CEO (SBF) and secured guilty pleas from the entire remaining inner circle (Ellison, Wang, Singh, Salame). The primary objectives of the investigation have been met. Expending resources to pursue a former co-CEO who left before the final collapse is likely a low priority.
3.  **Trabucco's Pre-Collapse Departure (Moderate ↓):** Trabucco resigned in August 2022, three months before the collapse. While the fraud was ongoing, this timing provides him a defense that he was not party to the final, most desperate acts of concealment and commingling. This complicates the evidentiary narrative for prosecutors compared to those who were present until the end.
4.  **Potential Non-Public Cooperation (Moderate ↓):** The complete absence of charges against Trabucco, a figure of his seniority, strongly implies some form of non-prosecution or immunity agreement in exchange for information. His lack of public testimony at SBF's trial does not preclude this; his cooperation may have been deemed unnecessary for that trial or used for background intelligence.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Lack of Indictment:** Unlike every other member of the FTX/Alameda inner circle (Reference Class 2), Trabucco has not been criminally charged three years after the firm's collapse. This is a profound deviation.
*   **Early Departure:** His resignation distinguishes him from all others who were convicted or pleaded guilty, who were all employed at the time of the collapse. This changes his risk profile compared to the base rate.
*   **Civil, Not Criminal, Forfeiture:** His recent major settlement was with the civil bankruptcy estate, not the Department of Justice. While cooperators also forfeit assets as part of criminal pleas, Trabucco's case is notable for the absence of a parallel criminal action.
*   **Opaque Role in Investigation:** While Ellison, Wang, and Singh were star witnesses, Trabucco's role, if any, has remained entirely out of the public view. This silence is itself a significant differentiator.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the specific reference class of the FTX inner circle (100% conviction rate), a plausible prior for Trabucco's conviction before 2026 might have been very high, e.g., 85% (n≈6).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ Large:** The extreme time constraint (~5 weeks to deadline) makes the process of indictment-and-conviction nearly impossible.
    *   **↓ Large:** The fact that he remains uncharged three years post-collapse, while all other peers were charged long ago, is powerful evidence he is not a primary target.
    *   **↓ Moderate:** His resignation before the final collapse provides a strong mitigating factor unavailable to the others.
    *   **↓ Small:** The recent civil settlement without criminal charges suggests his legal jeopardy is being resolved outside the criminal system.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the high prior derived from the reference class. The posterior probability should collapse to a very low value, likely in the single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A DOJ press release announcing an indictment or a plea agreement involving Sam Trabucco.
    *   News reports, citing sources, that Trabucco will plead guilty to federal charges.
    *   A court docket appearing in the Southern District of New York for *U.S. v. Trabucco*.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The passage of each week in December 2025 without any of the above UP indicators.
    *   Statements from Trabucco's legal team confirming he is not a target of the investigation.
    *   Official announcements from the SDNY that their investigation into FTX's collapse is concluded.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Sealed Proceedings:** An indictment could be under seal, or a plea agreement could be "on pocket," ready to be filed at a moment's notice. This is the primary risk to a low probability forecast.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** We have no visibility into any private discussions between Trabucco's lawyers and the DOJ. A secret cooperation or non-prosecution deal is plausible but unconfirmed.
*   **Definition of "Conviction":** A guilty plea, once accepted by a judge in a formal court proceeding (a plea allocution), constitutes a conviction for the purposes of this question. The timing of this specific event is what matters.
*   **Last-Minute Filings:** The DOJ could theoretically file charges and have a plea accepted in the final days of December 2025 to meet an internal deadline or statute of limitations, though this would be highly unusual for a case of this nature without prior signals.

**Final Research Summary:**
Sam Trabucco remains the only uncharged member of the FTX/Alameda inner circle. Given his departure before the collapse and the extremely short timeline to the 2026 deadline, a federal felony conviction is extraordinarily unlikely.

To forecast the probability of Sam Trabucco being convicted of a U.S. federal felony before 2026, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant reference class is the "FTX/Alameda Inner Circle (Charged)" with a 100% conviction rate. However, given Trabucco's unique circumstances, a more nuanced base rate is needed.
- **Adjusted Prior:** Considering Trabucco's early departure and lack of charges, a more appropriate base rate might be the "Unindicted C-Suite Executives Three Years Post-Collapse," estimated at 10-20%. For this analysis, we will use 15% as a starting prior probability.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Trabucco was part of the FTX/Alameda leadership, similar to others who have been convicted.
- **Differences:** He resigned before the collapse, has not been charged, and settled civilly without criminal charges. These differences significantly lower his risk compared to the base case of his peers.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Judicial Timeline Constraint:** The short time remaining makes a conviction unlikely. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
- **Prosecutorial Discretion:** The DOJ's focus on other key figures and the resolution of major cases suggest Trabucco is not a priority. This decreases the probability.
- **Pre-Collapse Departure:** His resignation before the collapse provides a defense, decreasing the probability.
- **Civil Settlement:** The absence of criminal charges alongside the civil settlement suggests a resolution outside the criminal system, decreasing the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 15% probability translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).
- **Likelihood Ratios:** Given the strong evidence against a conviction, we apply a large downward adjustment.
- **Posterior Odds:** Assuming a combined likelihood ratio of 0.1 (reflecting the strong evidence against conviction), the posterior odds become 0.176 * 0.1 = 0.0176.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.0176 / (1 + 0.0176) ≈ 1.72%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of sealed indictments or last-minute legal actions. However, these are unlikely given the current evidence.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A higher probability might be considered if new evidence of criminal activity or charges emerges, but current indicators strongly suggest otherwise.
- **Adjustments:** Given the overwhelming evidence against a conviction, the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering all evidence and adjustments, the probability of Sam Trabucco being convicted of a U.S. federal felony before 2026 is approximately 2%.

Final: 2%

# Probability Analysis: Will Sam Trabucco be convicted of a U.S. federal felony before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: FTX/Alameda top executives who have been charged with federal crimes
- 5 out of 5 key executives (SBF, Ellison, Wang, Singh, Salame) have been convicted or pleaded guilty
- This suggests a base rate of 100% for those who were charged

**Secondary reference class**: Uncharged executives in major financial fraud cases after 3+ years
- This is more appropriate for Trabucco's specific situation
- Historical patterns suggest that if prosecutors haven't charged a key figure within 3 years of a major fraud collapse, the probability of subsequent charges drops dramatically
- Estimated base rate: 10-15% for executives who remain uncharged after 3 years

Given Trabucco's specific situation (uncharged after 3 years), I'll use a prior of **15%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Trabucco was co-CEO of Alameda Research, placing him in the inner circle
- He likely had knowledge of and involvement in the company's operations during periods when fraudulent activities occurred
- Other executives in similar positions have all been convicted

**Key differences**:
- Trabucco resigned in August 2022, approximately 3 months before FTX's collapse
- Unlike all other key executives, he has not been charged with any crimes despite 3+ years passing
- He recently settled with the FTX bankruptcy estate for $70+ million without accompanying criminal charges
- The resolution deadline is January 1, 2026 - only about 5 weeks away

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Lack of charges after 3+ years**
- P(No charges after 3 years | Will be convicted) = very low (~5%)
- P(No charges after 3 years | Will not be convicted) = very high (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This strongly decreases probability

**Evidence 2: Civil settlement without criminal component**
- P(Civil-only settlement | Will be convicted) = low (~10%)
- P(Civil-only settlement | Will not be convicted) = high (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.10/0.80 = 0.125
- This significantly decreases probability

**Evidence 3: Departure before collapse**
- P(Left before collapse | Will be convicted) = moderate (~40%)
- P(Left before collapse | Will not be convicted) = high (~70%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.40/0.70 = 0.57
- This moderately decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Extremely short timeline to deadline**
- P(Conviction in ~5 weeks from now | Will be convicted) = very low (~5%)
- P(Conviction in ~5 weeks from now | Will not be convicted) = ~100%
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/1.0 = 0.05
- This strongly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15:85 (0.176)

Update on Evidence 1 (no charges after 3 years):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.053 = 0.009
- Posterior probability = 0.009/(1+0.009) ≈ 0.9%

Update on Evidence 2 (civil settlement):
- Posterior odds = 0.009 × 0.125 = 0.001
- Posterior probability = 0.001/(1+0.001) ≈ 0.1%

Update on Evidence 3 (early departure):
- Posterior odds = 0.001 × 0.57 = 0.0006
- Posterior probability = 0.0006/(1+0.0006) ≈ 0.06%

Update on Evidence 4 (short timeline):
- Posterior odds = 0.0006 × 0.05 = 0.00003
- Posterior probability = 0.00003/(1+0.00003) ≈ 0.003%

This extremely low probability needs to be adjusted for model uncertainty.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- There could be sealed indictments or non-public plea negotiations
- The DOJ might have been building a case against Trabucco separately
- The recent civil settlement might have been coordinated with criminal prosecutors

**Alternative scenarios**:
- Trabucco could have been cooperating with authorities in secret
- A last-minute plea deal could be filed in the coming weeks
- New evidence might have recently emerged

Given these considerations, I should adjust my extremely low probability upward to account for unknown factors and model uncertainty. The federal criminal justice system has many non-public aspects, and surprises do occur.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and accounting for uncertainty, I assess that the probability of Sam Trabucco being convicted of a U.S. federal felony before January 1, 2026 is extremely low but not impossible. The timeline constraint alone makes this highly improbable, and the lack of charges after 3+ years strongly suggests he will not face conviction.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is not all executives in major corporate frauds, nor is it the other convicted members of the FTX/Alameda inner circle (which would be subject to survivorship bias). Instead, the best reference class is **senior executives at major fraudulent firms who were not indicted within the first few years following the firm's collapse**.

Systematic data for this class is scarce, but anecdotally, the probability of a subsequent conviction is low. Prosecutors typically prioritize and charge the main conspirators early on. Those not charged often have mitigating circumstances, have secured non-prosecution agreements, or the evidence against them is weaker. The research report's estimate of a **10-20%** chance of eventual conviction for this group seems reasonable. I will select the midpoint, **15%**, as the prior probability P(H).

Prior Odds = P(H) / (1 - P(H)) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176 (or about 1 to 5.6 odds against conviction).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** Sam Trabucco was a co-CEO of Alameda Research, placing him in the inner circle of a massive financial fraud. This makes him a person of significant interest to prosecutors, consistent with the reference class.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Early Departure:** Trabucco resigned in August 2022, three months *before* the November 2022 collapse. This distinguishes him from all other convicted members and provides him with a defense that he was not involved in the final, most desperate acts of fraud and concealment.
    2.  **Lack of Indictment:** All other key figures (SBF, Ellison, Wang, Singh, Salame) were charged much earlier. The fact that Trabucco remains uncharged over three years after the collapse is a profound deviation from the pattern of this specific case.
    3.  **Civil Settlement:** Trabucco has agreed to a major civil forfeiture with the FTX bankruptcy estate. While such forfeitures can accompany criminal pleas, the absence of a parallel criminal action suggests his legal jeopardy is being resolved outside the criminal justice system.

These differences, particularly the time elapsed without charges, suggest his situation is even more favorable than the average member of the reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that Trabucco is convicted before 2026. Let ~H be the event that he is not.

*   **Evidence 1: Extreme Time Constraint.** As of late November 2025, there are only about five weeks until the January 1, 2026 deadline. For a conviction to occur, an indictment must be filed (or unsealed), and a guilty plea must be formally accepted by a judge.
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of a conviction process initiating and concluding in just five weeks, with no prior public filings, is extremely low.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of seeing this state (no activity close to the deadline) if no conviction were going to occur is very high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H)) << 1.** This is extremely strong evidence against conviction.

*   **Evidence 2: No Charges Filed to Date.** While all his peers were charged years ago, Trabucco remains uncharged.
    *   P(E2 | H): It is highly improbable that prosecutors would intend to convict a co-CEO but wait over three years to bring charges, long after securing pleas from all other cooperators.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): This is the expected state of affairs if prosecutors had decided not to charge him, likely due to a non-prosecution agreement or insufficient evidence.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E2|H)/P(E2|~H)) << 1.** This is also very strong evidence against conviction.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 15%, we must apply a massive downward update based on the evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** ~1 to 5.6 against.
*   **Evidence 1 (Timeline):** The five-week timeline is the most powerful factor. The likelihood ratio for this is very small, perhaps 1/50 or less. This alone would shift the odds dramatically.
*   **Evidence 2 (No Charges):** The fact he is the only one uncharged is also powerful. The likelihood ratio is also very small, perhaps 1/20.

*   **Conceptual Update:**
    Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × (LR_Timeline) × (LR_NoCharges)
    Posterior Odds ≈ (0.176) × (1/50) × (1/20) ≈ 0.000176

This calculation results in a posterior probability that is vanishingly small (around 0.02%). The qualitative conclusion is that the initial 15% prior is overwhelmed by the evidence. The probability collapses to a very low single-digit number.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary argument for a "Yes" outcome is the existence of a secret, pre-negotiated plea agreement that is "on pocket" with the U.S. Attorney's office. In this scenario, the filing of the indictment and the court proceeding for the plea could be executed very quickly in December 2025. This would explain the public silence and still result in a conviction before the deadline.

However, this scenario is unlikely. The main prosecutorial goals in the FTX case have been achieved: SBF is serving a long sentence, and the other top leaders have all pleaded guilty and cooperated. The incentive for the DOJ to pursue a last-minute conviction against a former executive who left before the final collapse is low. The large civil forfeiture he agreed to likely represents the totality of his settlement with authorities (both civil and criminal, via a non-prosecution agreement).

While the "pocket plea" scenario is a non-zero risk, its probability is very low. A forecast of 1-3% seems appropriate to account for this tail risk without ignoring the mountain of evidence pointing to "No".

### 6. Final Forecast
The initial base rate of 15% is drastically reduced by the overwhelming evidence. The most significant factors are the extremely short timeline remaining (about five weeks) and the fact that Trabucco is the only member of the FTX/Alameda inner circle who has not been charged after more than three years. His departure before the collapse and his large civil settlement further decrease the probability of a criminal conviction. The small remaining probability accounts for the unlikely but possible scenario of a pre-negotiated plea deal being filed at the last minute.

Final: 2%
