### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Cold War Interstate Ceasefires:** A study by Virginia Page Fortna ("Peace Time") found that roughly two-thirds of ceasefires hold for at least two years. However, this includes many ceasefires following decisive victories or with heavy international peacekeeping. A more relevant subset is ceasefires in unresolved conflicts. Here, failure rates are much higher. **Base Rate:** ~40-50% chance of failure within the first 90 days. This is derived from the general observation that ceasefires without clear enforcement and political resolution are exceptionally fragile.
2.  **Ceasefires in Protracted Territorial Conflicts:** This class includes cases like Nagorno-Karabakh (1994, 2020), Kashmir, and the former Yugoslavia. These ceasefires often devolve into "frozen conflicts" with persistent low-level skirmishes and a high risk of re-escalation. The Minsk I & II agreements (2014, 2015) in this very conflict are the most relevant examples; neither stopped the fighting, and both ultimately failed. **Base Rate:** ~60-70% chance of breakdown or expiration without renewal within 90 days. The core territorial disputes remain, making any pause tactical rather than strategic.
3.  **Ceasefires Explicitly Framed as Temporary:** The background states the proposal is for a "30-day ceasefire." This creates a strong anchor. Agreements with a pre-set, short duration often end on their specified date unless significant political breakthroughs occur during the pause, which is rare. The resolution criteria state the ceasefire ends if it "reaches its predetermined end date without being extended." **Base Rate:** High probability (~80%+) that the ceasefire lasts approximately its intended duration or fails before. This reference class suggests the outcome will be heavily concentrated in the "<30 days" and "30 days" bins.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-10-27] ISW report on Russian military posture — ↓ — Report states Russia is optimized for positional warfare and could achieve victory if Western support is cut. This incentivizes Russia to use any ceasefire to regroup for a decisive future offensive.
*   [2025-03-17] Metaculus question opens — (neutral) — The existence of the question reflects continued expert interest and uncertainty about the conflict's trajectory and potential pauses in fighting.
*   [2025-03-11] Ukraine agrees to support US 30-day ceasefire proposal — ↑↓ — While agreement is a necessary step (↑), the 30-day term is a strong anchor for a short duration, and the context of a "disastrous" prior meeting suggests the foundation is weak (↓).
*   [2025-02-12] Trump-Zelenskyy talks over minerals/security guarantees fail — ↓ — Demonstrates deep friction and transactionalism in the US-Ukraine relationship under this hypothetical administration, undermining trust and the credibility of US security guarantees that would underpin a lasting peace.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Regroup and Rearm:** Both sides are exhausted. A ceasefire offers a critical window to replenish ammunition, rotate troops, repair equipment, and prepare for the next phase of operations. This is a powerful incentive to agree to a pause but also a primary driver for its eventual collapse. (Size: Large)
2.  **Spoiler Actions:** Hardline factions on both sides (e.g., Russian ultranationalists, Ukrainian units determined to retake all territory) have the motive and means to sabotage a ceasefire through provocations. A single high-profile attack could collapse the agreement. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Lack of Trust / Monitoring:** Given the failure of Minsk I & II and the overall brutality of the war, trust is nonexistent. The ceasefire's stability will depend almost entirely on a robust, credible, and intrusive third-party monitoring mechanism, which is not mentioned and unlikely to be implemented quickly. (Size: Large)
4.  **Unresolved Core Issues:** The ceasefire does not address the fundamental conflicts: territorial control (Crimea, Donbas), sovereignty, and security alignments. It is a pause in fighting, not a resolution. Without a political path forward, the logic of war will reassert itself. (Size: Large)
5.  **US Political Reliability:** The background portrays the US (under Trump) as a transactional and potentially unreliable guarantor. If either side believes the US will not or cannot enforce the terms, the incentive to cheat increases dramatically. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **The 30-Day Anchor:** The proposal is explicitly for 30 days. This creates a psychological and legal endpoint. It is far easier to let the ceasefire expire on day 30 than to negotiate a complex extension amidst deep suspicion. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit Short-Term Anchor:** Unlike many historical ceasefires that are open-ended, this one has a proposed 30-day duration from the outset. This dramatically shortens the expected timeline and focuses risk on the 30-day mark.
*   **Extreme Lack of Trust:** The scale and nature of the conflict since 2022, including war crimes allegations and total war rhetoric, create a level of animosity far exceeding many historical comparisons. The direct precedent of the failed Minsk agreements reinforces this.
*   **Transactional Broker:** The US role, as depicted, is not that of a neutral mediator but a great power pursuing its own interests (minerals, managing the conflict). This transactional nature makes enforcement and long-term commitment less credible than a UN or multi-party peacekeeping force.
*   **High Military Stakes:** Both sides believe they can still achieve their objectives militarily. The ISW report suggests Russia sees a path to victory. Ukraine's goal remains the liberation of all its territory. This is not a mutually hurting stalemate ripe for resolution, but a tactical pause.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior from the "Protracted Territorial Conflicts" reference class, suggesting a high probability (>60%) of failure within 90 days. Equivalent n ≈ 10.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓) The explicit 30-day proposal acts as a powerful anchor, concentrating probability mass in the "<30 days" and "30 days" bins. (Large)
    *   (↓) The extreme lack of trust, exacerbated by the failed Minsk precedent, makes any violation likely to be terminal. (Large)
    *   (↓) The ISW assessment of Russia's military posture points to a strong "regroup and rearm" incentive, suggesting bad-faith adherence. (Moderate)
    *   (↓) The depicted unreliability of the US as a broker weakens enforcement, a key factor for ceasefire survival. (Moderate)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the prior is too optimistic on duration. The posterior should shift dramatically towards the shortest-term options. The "91 days or more" category should be near-zero, with the bulk of the probability allocated to "<30 days" (due to early collapse) and "30 days" (due to expiration).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (longer duration):**
    *   Immediate establishment of a multi-national, on-the-ground monitoring force with a strong mandate (e.g., OSCE, UN).
    *   Public statements from both Putin and Zelenskyy emphasizing a genuine commitment to a follow-on political process.
    *   Verifiable withdrawal of heavy weaponry from a significant portion of the front line.
    *   A parallel agreement on prisoner exchanges or humanitarian corridors being successfully implemented.
*   **DOWN indicators (shorter duration):**
    *   Rhetoric from officials on either side accusing the other of violations within the first 48 hours.
    *   Intelligence reports (e.g., from US, UK) showing continued movement of ammunition and reinforcements toward the front lines, not away from them.
    *   "Accidental" artillery strikes or drone attacks on key infrastructure or command posts that go unpunished.
    *   Public statements from the US broker (Trump) downplaying the importance of the ceasefire or linking its continuation to unrelated demands.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Fictional Premise:** This analysis is entirely contingent on the provided fictional background from 2025. Real-world events will differ.
*   **Defining "Breakdown":** The resolution criteria hinge on "major military operations." This is ambiguous. A series of small-scale but persistent skirmishes could degrade the ceasefire without triggering a clear resolution point, leading to definitional disputes.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** True intentions regarding "regroup and rearm" will be concealed. Public statements will be unreliable, and intelligence may be incomplete or politicized.
*   **Black Swan Events:** The assassination of a key figure, a major domestic political crisis in Russia, Ukraine, or the US, or a technological game-changer on the battlefield could instantly alter all calculations.
*   **Expiration vs. Failure:** The question resolves based on the number of *consecutive days*. A ceasefire that lasts exactly 30 days and then expires resolves to "30 days." This is a distinct outcome from a collapse due to violations on, for example, day 25. The 30-day anchor makes expiration a very plausible scenario.

**Final Research Summary:** The proposed 30-day ceasefire is exceptionally fragile due to profound mistrust, unresolved territorial goals, and strong incentives for both sides to use the pause to prepare for future offensives. The 30-day term itself acts as the most likely endpoint, either through early collapse or simple expiration.

To forecast the duration of a potential ceasefire in the Russo-Ukraine conflict in 2025, we will apply Bayesian reasoning to assess the probabilities for each option. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Less than 30 days:** Given the historical fragility of ceasefires in protracted territorial conflicts and the explicit 30-day proposal, the base rate for a ceasefire failing or expiring within 30 days is high. The reference class for temporary ceasefires suggests a high probability (~80%+) for this outcome.
  
- **30 days:** The explicit 30-day term acts as a strong anchor, suggesting a high likelihood that the ceasefire will last exactly 30 days before expiring. This is supported by the base rate for temporary ceasefires.

- **31-60 days:** Ceasefires in unresolved conflicts often fail early, but there is a smaller chance they might be extended slightly beyond the initial term if some progress is made. The base rate for ceasefires lasting beyond 30 days but failing within 60 days is lower.

- **61-90 days:** The likelihood decreases further as the duration extends beyond 60 days, given the lack of trust and unresolved core issues.

- **91 days or more:** Historically, ceasefires in similar conflicts without enforcement mechanisms or political resolutions rarely last this long. The base rate for this duration is very low.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities:** The current scenario aligns with the base rate for temporary ceasefires due to the explicit 30-day proposal and unresolved territorial disputes.

- **Differences:** The extreme lack of trust and the transactional nature of the US as a broker may increase the likelihood of an early breakdown.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Explicit 30-day proposal:** Strongly suggests the ceasefire will last exactly 30 days or less. (P(E | H) is high for "<30 days" and "30 days").

- **Lack of trust and Minsk precedent:** Increases the likelihood of early failure. (P(E | H) is high for "<30 days").

- **ISW report on Russian military posture:** Indicates a regrouping incentive, suggesting bad-faith adherence. (P(E | H) is high for "<30 days").

- **US as a transactional broker:** Weakens enforcement, increasing the likelihood of early failure. (P(E | H) is high for "<30 days").

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Prior for "<30 days":** Start with a high prior based on temporary ceasefires (~80%).

- **Evidence impact:** The explicit 30-day proposal and lack of trust further increase the probability for "<30 days" and "30 days".

- **Posterior adjustment:** Given the strong evidence for early failure or expiration, the posterior probability for "<30 days" and "30 days" should be very high.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence check:** Consider the possibility of a monitoring mechanism being established, which could extend the duration slightly.

- **Alternative scenario:** If a robust monitoring force is deployed, the probability for "31-60 days" could increase.

- **Adjustments:** Given the current evidence, the probabilities for "<30 days" and "30 days" remain dominant.

### 6. Final Normalization

- Ensure the probabilities sum to approximately 100%.

### 7. Output Format

Option_1: 50%  
Option_2: 35%  
Option_3: 10%  
Option_4: 4%  
Option_5: 1%  

These probabilities reflect the high likelihood of the ceasefire either failing early or expiring at the 30-day mark, with diminishing probabilities for longer durations.

# Forecasting the Duration of a Russo-Ukraine Ceasefire in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each duration option by examining historical ceasefires in similar conflicts:

**Less than 30 days**: In protracted territorial conflicts with deep mistrust, short ceasefires often collapse quickly. The Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefires of 2020 and various Gaza ceasefires provide examples. Prior: **25%**

**30 days**: Since the proposal explicitly mentions a 30-day ceasefire, there's a significant chance it will last exactly its intended duration before expiring. Prior: **35%**

**31-60 days**: Extensions of initial ceasefires are somewhat common but require additional negotiation. Prior: **20%**

**61-90 days**: Longer extensions become progressively less likely without substantial political progress. Prior: **10%**

**91 days or more**: Without addressing core territorial disputes, long-term stability is rare in conflicts of this intensity. Prior: **10%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios**:
- Like other territorial conflicts (Nagorno-Karabakh, Kashmir), this involves disputed sovereignty
- Previous ceasefire attempts in this same conflict (Minsk I & II) failed
- Both sides retain military capabilities and territorial objectives
- External power (US) acting as broker, similar to many historical ceasefires

**Key differences**:
- The explicit 30-day timeframe creates a strong anchor point
- The described Trump administration approach appears more transactional than traditional mediation
- The conflict has been ongoing at high intensity for 3+ years, creating extreme mistrust
- The failed White House talks and "disastrous" meeting suggest particularly weak foundations
- Putin's qualified support ("outstanding questions") signals hesitation

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Explicit 30-day proposal**
- P(E|H="30 days"): Very high (~0.8) - The proposal specifically defines this duration
- P(E|H≠"30 days"): Moderate (~0.4) - Could be extended or collapse early

**Evidence 2: Putin's qualified support with "outstanding questions"**
- P(E|H="Less than 30 days"): High (~0.7) - Suggests hesitation and conditions
- P(E|H="30 days or more"): Low (~0.3) - Indicates reluctance for long-term commitment

**Evidence 3: Failed US-Ukraine negotiations over minerals/security**
- P(E|H="Less than 30 days" or "30 days"): High (~0.7) - Shows weak foundation
- P(E|H="61+ days"): Very low (~0.1) - Long-term arrangements require trust

**Evidence 4: Historical failure of Minsk agreements in this same conflict**
- P(E|H="Less than 90 days"): High (~0.8) - Direct precedent of failure
- P(E|H="91+ days"): Very low (~0.1) - Would require overcoming established pattern

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the "30 days" option:
- Prior probability: 35%
- Prior odds: 0.35/0.65 = 0.538
- Likelihood ratio for Evidence 1: 0.8/0.4 = 2
- Posterior odds: 0.538 × 2 = 1.076
- Posterior probability: 1.076/(1+1.076) = 51.8%

For "Less than 30 days":
- Prior probability: 25%
- Prior odds: 0.25/0.75 = 0.333
- Likelihood ratio for Evidence 2: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 0.333 × 2.33 = 0.776
- Posterior probability: 0.776/(1+0.776) = 43.7%

Further updating with Evidence 3 and 4 significantly reduces the probability of longer durations, particularly for "91 days or more":
- The failed negotiations and historical precedent make long-term stability extremely unlikely
- The explicit 30-day timeframe creates a natural endpoint that doesn't require additional negotiation

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a "frozen conflict" scenario where fighting stops but no formal end occurs
- The analysis assumes rational actors; emotional or domestic political factors could lead to unexpected outcomes
- I might be overweighting the explicit "30 days" anchor due to its prominence in the background

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A significant military advantage gained by one side during the ceasefire could incentivize breaking it early
- International pressure or economic incentives could push for extensions beyond 30 days
- A change in US administration approach could create stronger enforcement mechanisms

**Adjustments**:
- I should slightly increase probability for "Less than 30 days" given the fragility of the agreement
- I should slightly decrease "91 days or more" given the overwhelming evidence against long-term stability

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations:

- "Less than 30 days": ~30% (early collapse due to violations or withdrawal)
- "30 days": ~45% (expires at predetermined endpoint)
- "31-60 days": ~15% (single short extension)
- "61-90 days": ~7% (multiple extensions but eventual breakdown)
- "91 days or more": ~3% (unlikely transition to stable peace)

## 7. Output Format

Less than 30 days: 30%
30 days: 45%
31-60 days: 15%
61-90 days: 7%
91 days or more: 3%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will use the reference class of **ceasefires in protracted, unresolved territorial conflicts**. This is more specific than all post-Cold War ceasefires and more general than looking only at the proposed 30-day term.

*   **Reference Class:** Cases like Nagorno-Karabakh (1994, 2020), Kashmir, and particularly the Minsk I & II agreements (2014, 2015) in the same Russo-Ukrainian conflict.
*   **Base Rate:** These ceasefires are notoriously fragile. The Minsk agreements, the most direct analogs, failed to stop the fighting and ultimately collapsed. This reference class suggests a high probability of failure within a short period. A reasonable prior would be a ~60-70% chance that a ceasefire breaks down or expires without renewal within 90 days.
*   **Initial Distribution (Prior):**
    *   P(≤ 90 days) ≈ 65%
    *   P(> 90 days) ≈ 35%
    This prior reflects a general expectation of fragility but does not yet account for the specific details of the 2025 scenario.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The core drivers of the conflict (territorial control, sovereignty) remain unresolved, just as they were during the Minsk agreements. Both sides have strong incentives to use any pause to rearm and regroup. Mistrust is profound.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Explicit 30-Day Term:** The most significant difference is that this is a proposal for a "30-day ceasefire." Unlike the more open-ended Minsk agreements, this creates a strong Schelling point (focal point) for the ceasefire to end, either by expiration or by a breakdown just before.
    2.  **Increased Animosity:** The scale and brutality of the conflict since February 2022 have created a level of mistrust and animosity far exceeding the 2014-2015 period, making cooperation even less likely.
    3.  **Transactional US Role:** The background describes a US administration under Donald Trump that is highly transactional (e.g., talks over minerals for security) and has a poor relationship with the Ukrainian leadership. This undermines the credibility of the US as a reliable guarantor, which is critical for ceasefire stability.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the background and research report.

*   **Evidence 1: The proposal is for a "30-day ceasefire."**
    *   This evidence makes outcomes centered around 30 days far more likely.
    *   P(E1 | H = "30 days" or "<30 days") is very high. A 30-day proposal is the direct cause of such an outcome.
    *   P(E1 | H = "91 days or more") is very low. For a ceasefire with a 30-day term to last over 90 days, it would require at least two successful, non-trivial extensions amidst deep hostility. This is highly improbable.
    *   **Effect:** This evidence strongly shifts probability mass from the longer-duration options to the "Less than 30 days" and "30 days" options.

*   **Evidence 2: Failed US-Ukraine talks and transactionalism.**
    *   This suggests the primary broker (the US) is not a trusted or reliable partner for Ukraine, and its security guarantees are weak. Stable ceasefires often rely on strong third-party enforcement.
    *   P(E2 | H = "Less than 30 days") is high. A lack of faith in the guarantor encourages cheating or preemptive action.
    *   P(E2 | H = "91 days or more") is low. A long-term resolution requires credible, long-term security commitments, which this evidence directly contradicts.
    *   **Effect:** This evidence further increases the probability of short-duration outcomes.

*   **Evidence 3: ISW report on Russia's military posture.**
    *   The report suggests Russia believes it can achieve its objectives militarily and has an incentive to use any pause to regroup for a future decisive offensive. This points towards bad-faith participation in any ceasefire.
    *   P(E3 | H = "Less than 30 days" or "30 days") is high. Russia would likely use the 30 days to prepare and then either break the ceasefire or simply let it expire.
    *   P(E3 | H = "91 days or more") is very low. This evidence is inconsistent with a genuine Russian desire for a lasting peace at this juncture.
    *   **Effect:** This reinforces the shift towards the shortest-duration options.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's perform a conceptual update.

*   **Prior:** A 65% chance of failure within 90 days.
*   **Update 1 (30-day anchor):** The explicit 30-day term is powerful evidence. It suggests that the vast majority of outcomes will be either an early collapse (due to fragility) or a simple expiration on day 30. This evidence alone likely shifts the probability of the outcome being ≤ 30 days from perhaps ~35% in the prior to ~75-80%.
    *   *Posterior Odds (for ≤30 days vs >30 days) = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio.* The likelihood ratio for seeing a "30-day proposal" given a short outcome versus a long one is very high, dramatically increasing the posterior probability of a short outcome.
*   **Update 2 (Other evidence):** The unreliability of the US broker and Russia's incentive to rearm both act as further multipliers on the odds of failure. They make an early collapse ("Less than 30 days") more likely relative to a clean expiration ("30 days") and make any extension beyond 30 days even more improbable.

After these updates, the probability mass should be heavily concentrated in the first two bins, with a steep drop-off for any longer duration.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Overconfidence Check:** Am I too pessimistic? Perhaps sheer exhaustion on both sides could create a "mutually hurting stalemate" where a pause is surprisingly welcome and stable. A successful 30-day period could build momentum for an extension. While possible, the structural incentives for re-arming and the deep-seated conflict goals make this a low-probability alternative.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative would place a higher probability on "30 days" (e.g., 50%) and less on "<30 days" (e.g., 30%). This forecast would argue that the 30-day expiration is a powerful Schelling point that both sides would prefer to adhere to, avoiding the blame associated with actively breaking the ceasefire.
*   **Rebuttal & Adjustment:** My current forecast already gives significant weight (35%) to the "30 days" option for this very reason. However, the extreme mistrust, the long front line, and the presence of hardline factions (spoilers) make an accidental or intentional escalation that collapses the ceasefire early a very high risk. Therefore, placing a slightly higher probability on early collapse ("<30 days") seems more robust. The tail probabilities for >60 days seem appropriately small given the evidence.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will distribute the probability with a heavy focus on the first two options, reflecting the high chance of either early collapse or expiration at the 30-day mark.

*   **Less than 30 days:** High probability due to extreme mistrust, spoiler risk, and incentives to test the ceasefire's limits immediately.
*   **30 days:** High probability as this is the explicit term, providing a natural and mutually-agreed-upon endpoint without assigning blame for a "breakdown."
*   **31-60 days:** Low probability. This would require a successful negotiation for an extension, which would be difficult.
*   **61-90 days & 91 days or more:** Very low probability, as this would require multiple successful extensions or a fundamental political breakthrough, both of which are strongly contradicted by the available evidence.

My final probabilities are adjusted to sum to 100%.

Less than 30 days: 45%
30 days: 35%
31-60 days: 12%
61-90 days: 5%
91 days or more: 3%
