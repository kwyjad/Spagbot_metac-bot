### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Waymo's Own State-Level Expansion Rate:** Waymo's first public rider-only service launched in Arizona (1 state) in 2020. It expanded to California (2 states) in 2023 and Texas (3 states) in 2024. This establishes a base rate of approximately 0.5-1 new states per year since public operations began. This is the most relevant reference class.
2.  **New-Market Entry for Capital-Intensive Tech:** This class includes services like 5G network rollouts or initial ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft) expansion. These rollouts are lumpy, characterized by long initial periods followed by rapid acceleration once the model is proven. Uber, for example, expanded to dozens of US cities within its first 3-4 years. This class suggests a possibility of faster, non-linear expansion, but is limited by the unique physical safety and regulatory hurdles of autonomous vehicles (AVs), which Uber did not face.
3.  **Deployment of Novel, Regulated Hardware:** This class includes technologies like commercial drones or new medical devices. The timeline is dominated by state-by-state and federal regulatory approval, public acceptance, and high per-unit costs. Expansion is typically very slow and methodical, often taking a decade or more to achieve significant national penetration. This class highlights the potential for regulation to be the primary rate-limiter, suggesting a low base rate.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-10-10** Waymo launches rider-only service in Austin, TX. — ↑ — Confirms entry into the 3rd state and demonstrates continued expansion momentum after successes in CA and AZ.
*   **2024-09-12** California Governor Newsom signs AB 2286, which clarifies state-level authority over AVs, preventing a patchwork of city-level bans. — ↑ — Reduces a significant regulatory risk that could have fragmented or slowed operations in Waymo's largest market, signaling a more stable environment for future growth.
*   **2024-08-20** Waymo announces it is doubling its service area in Phoenix. — ↑ — Shows successful scaling within an existing market, which is a prerequisite for allocating resources to entirely new markets.
*   **2024-07-01** Waymo announces official start of testing in Atlanta, GA and expansion of testing in Bellevue, WA. — (neutral) — Indicates a pipeline of potential future states, but testing is a very early stage. The timeline from testing to public launch is typically over a year, making a launch by Jan 1, 2026 highly improbable.
*   **2024-05-15** Reports surface of increased federal scrutiny from NHTSA on AV performance in adverse weather conditions following several minor incidents. — ↓ — Heightens regulatory overhead and could delay approvals for expansion into states with more varied climates than AZ, CA, and TX.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **State-Level Regulatory Approval:** The single largest driver. A permissive regulatory framework (like in AZ and TX) is a prerequisite for entry. A cautious or hostile one (e.g., requiring specific legislative approval) can be a complete blocker. (Size: Large)
2.  **Technical Viability & Mapping:** Waymo must extensively map a city and validate its system's performance in the local Operational Design Domain (ODD), including road layouts, traffic patterns, and weather. This is a time and resource-intensive process that gates any launch. (Size: Large)
3.  **Public & Political Acceptance:** High-profile accidents (even if not Waymo's) or organized opposition from labor groups or local governments can create significant political pressure, slowing or stopping expansion plans, as seen in early debates in San Francisco. (Size: Moderate to Large)
4.  **Capital Allocation:** While Alphabet has deep pockets, each new city launch is a multi-hundred-million-dollar investment. The pace of expansion is constrained by the company's budget and strategic priorities, especially in a climate of tech cost-cutting. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Competitive Landscape:** The collapse of Cruise's operations in late 2023 removed Waymo's primary competitor. This reduces pressure to expand aggressively for market share and may encourage a more deliberate, safety-first pace. (Size: Small, negative)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The question resolves in less than one month. The base rate of ~0.5-1 state/year is an average over longer periods. The probability of a complex, regulated launch occurring in the final few weeks of the year without prior announcement is virtually zero.
*   **Post-Cruise Regulatory Climate:** The environment is more cautious than during Waymo's initial expansion. Regulators and the public are more aware of the risks following Cruise's 2023 failure, likely extending timelines for approval in new states.
*   **Shift from "Firsts" to "Scaling":** Waymo's focus appears to be on expanding and achieving profitability within its existing three states (e.g., doubling the Phoenix service area) rather than planting flags in new states at any cost.
*   **Clear Expansion Pipeline:** Unlike in its early years, Waymo now has a public pipeline of cities where it is testing (e.g., Atlanta). This provides a clearer, albeit long-term, roadmap and makes a "surprise" launch in a non-testing state extremely unlikely.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The current number of states is 3 (AZ, CA, TX). A strong prior should be centered on 3. Given the operational lead times, the probability of launching in a 4th state before Jan 1, 2026, is exceedingly small. An equivalent n > 50 on the outcome being 3 seems appropriate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Successful launch and expansion in Austin (TX) confirms the 3rd state is solid. (Large, reinforces 3)
    *   (↓) The extremely short time remaining until resolution makes a new state launch logistically impossible. (Large, against >3)
    *   (↓) The lack of any public announcements regarding an imminent launch in a 4th state. (Large, against >3)
    *   (↑) Favorable regulatory outcome in California (AB 2286) secures existing operations but doesn't accelerate new state entry in the short term. (Small, reinforces 3)
    *   (neutral) Testing in GA and WA points to a long-term pipeline, confirming that no other state is close to launch-ready. (reinforces not >3)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. The posterior distribution should be even more sharply peaked at 3, with the probability assigned to 4 or more states approaching zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A surprise press release from Waymo announcing an immediate public launch in a new state (e.g., Georgia).
    *   An announcement from a state governor (e.g., of Florida or Georgia) of a fast-tracked partnership with Waymo for a December 2025 launch.
    *   Waymo's "Where You Can Go" page is updated to include a new state.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A major safety incident leading to a fleet-wide grounding that includes operations in one of the current three states.
    *   A state (e.g., Texas) revoking Waymo's operating permit due to unforeseen issues.
    *   Waymo announces a strategic retreat from a market to consolidate resources (extremely unlikely).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The key is "available to the general public." A very small, geofenced "public" launch in a new city (e.g., a single square mile in downtown Atlanta) would count, even if not a meaningful service.
*   **"Paper Launch" Risk:** A company could theoretically announce a launch on Dec 31st that is public in name only (e.g., one car available for a waitlist of thousands) to meet a goal. This is unlikely for Waymo but possible.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** We lack access to Waymo's internal dashboards, readiness assessments, and confidential discussions with state regulators. A deal could be closer than publicly visible.
*   **Force Majeure Events:** A sudden, unexpected event (e.g., a massive cyberattack on the fleet) could theoretically take a state offline, reducing the count.
*   **Resolution Source Lag:** The primary source is Waymo's website. A launch could occur on Dec 31, but the website might not be updated until Jan 2, creating ambiguity. However, such a launch would be accompanied by press releases.

Final Research Summary: The current number of states with Waymo's public rider-only service is three (AZ, CA, TX). Given the resolution date is less than a month away, the operational, regulatory, and logistical lead times for a new state launch make an increase from this number a near impossibility.

To forecast the number of US states where Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available to the general public on January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is Waymo's historical state-level expansion rate. Since launching its first public rider-only service in Arizona in 2020, Waymo expanded to California in 2023 and Texas in 2024. This suggests an average expansion rate of approximately 0.5-1 new state per year. Given the current number of states is 3, the base rate is centered around 3 states with a low probability of increasing to 4 states by early 2026.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns with the base rate, as Waymo has not announced any imminent launches in new states. The short time frame until January 1, 2026, makes it unlikely for a new state to be added without prior announcements. The regulatory environment post-Cruise's failure is more cautious, likely slowing down expansion.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Successful launch in Austin, TX**: Confirms the current count of 3 states. (Reinforces 3)
- **Short time frame**: Logistically improbable for a new state launch without prior announcements. (Strongly against >3)
- **No public announcements for new states**: Reinforces the likelihood of staying at 3 states. (Strongly against >3)
- **Regulatory developments in California**: Secures existing operations but doesn't facilitate new state entry in the short term. (Reinforces 3)
- **Testing in GA and WA**: Indicates a long-term pipeline, not immediate expansion. (Reinforces not >3)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
The prior distribution is centered on 3 states. The evidence overwhelmingly supports this, with strong likelihoods against an increase to 4 states. The posterior distribution remains sharply peaked at 3 states, with negligible probability for 4 or more states.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Consideration of potential blind spots includes:
- **Definitional ambiguity**: A minimal launch could technically count as a new state.
- **Information asymmetry**: Waymo's internal plans could be more advanced than publicly known.
- **Force majeure events**: Unlikely to reduce the count of states.
The alternative scenario of a surprise launch is highly improbable given the lack of announcements and regulatory hurdles.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecast is:
- P10: 3
- P20: 3
- P40: 3
- P60: 3
- P80: 3
- P90: 3

# Forecasting Waymo's State-Level Expansion by January 1, 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use Waymo's historical expansion rate as the primary base rate:

- 2020: Arizona (1 state)
- 2023: Added California (2 states total)
- 2024: Added Texas (3 states total)

This shows approximately 0.67 new states per year since launching their first public rider-only service. As of December 2025, Waymo operates in 3 states (Arizona, California, and Texas).

The mean of this base rate would suggest approximately 3.67 states by January 1, 2026 if we extrapolate linearly. However, the variance is quite high given the small sample size and the "lumpy" nature of such expansions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Waymo continues to operate under the same business model and regulatory framework
- The company still faces similar technical challenges for new market entry (mapping, testing, regulatory approval)
- Alphabet continues to provide financial backing

**Differences from base rate:**
- The resolution date is less than a month away, making any new state launch extremely unlikely without prior announcement
- Waymo's recent focus appears to be on expanding within existing markets rather than entering new states
- The regulatory environment has become more cautious following Cruise's failures in 2023
- Waymo now has a clearer expansion pipeline with testing in places like Atlanta and Bellevue

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for expansion beyond 3 states:**
- Waymo has been testing in Atlanta, GA and Bellevue, WA (likelihood ratio: ~1.2x for potential future expansion)
- Successful expansion in existing markets demonstrates operational capability (likelihood ratio: ~1.1x)
- Favorable regulatory outcome in California with AB 2286 shows improving regulatory climate (likelihood ratio: ~1.05x)

**Evidence against expansion beyond 3 states by January 1, 2026:**
- Extremely short timeframe remaining until resolution date (likelihood ratio: ~0.1x)
- No public announcements of imminent launches in new states (likelihood ratio: ~0.2x)
- Typical timeline from testing to public launch exceeds 12 months (likelihood ratio: ~0.3x)
- Increased federal scrutiny from NHTSA on AV performance (likelihood ratio: ~0.8x)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior centered on 3 states with some probability of 4:
- Prior: ~80% on 3 states, ~15% on 4 states, ~5% on other values

Applying the strongest evidence - the extremely short timeframe and lack of announcements:
- Likelihood ratio for 4+ states: 0.1 × 0.2 = 0.02
- Posterior odds ratio: 0.15/0.8 × 0.02 = 0.00375
- This dramatically reduces the probability of 4+ states

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior distribution shifts to:
- ~98% on 3 states
- ~1.5% on 4 states
- ~0.5% on other values (2 or 5+)

The mean shifts from ~3.25 to ~3.03, and the variance decreases significantly.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a surprise announcement in the next few weeks
- Waymo could have advanced further in regulatory discussions in a new state than is publicly known
- The definition of "available to the general public" could be met with a very limited launch

Alternative forecast: One could argue for a higher probability on 4 states (~10%) if Waymo has been preparing a surprise launch in Georgia or Washington, where testing has been ongoing.

Rebuttal: The operational and regulatory lead times make this extremely unlikely. Even if Waymo wanted to launch in a new state, the necessary preparations would have been visible by now.

Considering these factors, I'll slightly increase the probability of 4 states to account for unknown information, but maintain the strong concentration on 3 states.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant base rate is the current status quo, given the extremely short time horizon. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, and the forecast is being made on December 4, 2025. For a complex, capital-intensive, and heavily regulated service like autonomous ride-hailing, the probability of a change in the number of operational states within a 28-day window is exceptionally low.

Therefore, the prior distribution is a point mass, or very nearly so, at the current number of states. As of today, Waymo's rider-only service is available to the general public in three states: Arizona, California, and Texas.

*   **Prior Distribution:** A discrete distribution heavily centered on 3.
*   **Mean/Median:** 3
*   **Spread:** Extremely low. Let's model this as P(3) > 99%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is effectively identical to the base case (the status quo). The only difference is the passage of 28 days. This difference is critical because the lead time for launching a service in a new state is measured in many months or even years, not days. This process involves extensive mapping, regulatory engagement, building a physical fleet and operations center, a "trusted tester" phase, and public announcements. It is not a process that can be completed from a standing start (or even a late stage) within four weeks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence overwhelmingly supports the number of states remaining unchanged.

*   **Evidence for No Change (Value = 3):**
    *   **Short Time Horizon:** Less than one month remains until resolution. This is the strongest piece of evidence. The logistical and regulatory hurdles to launch in a new state are immense and cannot be cleared this quickly. This makes the status quo of 3 states extremely likely.
    *   **Lack of Imminent Launch Announcements:** Waymo has been public about its testing pipeline (e.g., Atlanta, GA). There have been no announcements that any of these testing sites are on the verge of a public, rider-only launch. A surprise launch of this magnitude is inconsistent with Waymo's established, methodical expansion strategy.
    *   **Focus on Existing Markets:** The report notes Waymo is doubling its service area in Phoenix. This suggests a strategic focus on deepening penetration and achieving profitability in existing markets, rather than a rushed expansion into new ones.

*   **Evidence for an Increase (Value > 3):**
    *   This would require a "paper launch" or a launch that has been kept completely secret until the last minute. The likelihood of this is virtually zero. It would be a major departure from corporate practice and logistically infeasible. This evidence makes an outcome of 4 or more extremely unlikely.

*   **Evidence for a Decrease (Value < 3):**
    *   This would require a sudden shutdown of service in one of the three current states. This could be triggered by a catastrophic safety event, a sudden regulatory injunction (as happened to Cruise in California in 2023), or a major technical failure. While this is a non-zero probability tail risk, it is extremely unlikely to occur in the next 28 days given Waymo's long and relatively stable operational history.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** P(3) ≈ 99.9%, P(not 3) ≈ 0.1%.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (short timeline, no announcements) provides an extremely high likelihood ratio in favor of the number of states remaining at 3. The likelihood of the evidence given an outcome of 4 is near zero. The likelihood of the evidence given an outcome of 2 is also very low, as no precipitating events have occurred.
*   **Posterior:** The posterior distribution becomes even more sharply peaked at 3. The probability mass for any value other than 3 is pushed into the extreme tails. The posterior is approximately P(3) ≈ 99.5%, with a tiny residual probability (P(2) ≈ 0.5%) for a black swan shutdown event, and a negligible probability for an increase.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is extremely confident, with all percentiles at the same value. Is this justified?

*   **Plausible Alternative:** The most plausible alternative is a sudden shutdown in one state, reducing the count to 2. The precedent set by the California Public Utilities Commission's suspension of Cruise's license shows that regulators can and will act swiftly. A single, severe Waymo incident in December could trigger a similar response in CA, AZ, or TX. This is a genuine, albeit low-probability, risk.
*   **Rebuttal:** Waymo's safety record, transparency, and relationship with regulators are substantially different and stronger than Cruise's were at the time of its incident. A shutdown-level event in the next 28 days remains a remote possibility.
*   **"Paper Launch" Risk:** Could Waymo announce a launch in Atlanta on December 31st, available in a one-block radius to a waitlist, just to meet an internal goal? This is possible but seems out of character for the company's public posture, which has prioritized methodical, safety-first expansion. The reputational risk of such a stunt likely outweighs the benefit.
*   **Conclusion:** The extreme confidence is warranted by the operational realities of the short timeline. The distribution is not a bell curve; it is a discrete distribution with almost all its mass on a single integer. Therefore, the percentiles will naturally collapse to that single value. The tiny tail risk of a shutdown (to 2) is not large enough to pull even the P10 value down from 3. For the P10 to be 2, the cumulative probability of the outcome being 2 or less would need to be at least 10%. My estimate for this is closer to 0.5%.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated at the value of 3. The probability of the outcome being less than 3 is extremely small (well under 10%), and the probability of it being greater than 3 is negligible. Therefore, all percentiles from P10 to P90 fall on the integer 3.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 3
P90: 3
