Here is my research plan.

### **Step 1: Identify Core Research Questions**

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** What is NVIDIA's historical quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth rate for GAAP Operating Expenses (OpEx)? How has this trend evolved, especially in the recent AI boom (FY24-FY26)?
2.  **Deconstruct the Anchor:** The Q1 FY26 release provided full-year FY26 OpEx growth guidance of "mid-30%". How can this be translated into a quarterly forecast? Is this guidance still credible given the massive OpEx jump guided for Q2 and the current market environment?
3.  **Identify Key Drivers:** What are the primary components of NVIDIA's GAAP OpEx? What external and internal factors are causing them to change (e.g., R&D for next-gen chips, stock-based compensation, headcount growth, competitive pressures)?
4.  **Incorporate Recent Signals:** What do recent earnings reports and announcements from major customers and competitors (especially the provided sources on Meta) imply about the competitive landscape and cost pressures for NVIDIA?
5.  **Model the Guidance:** How does NVIDIA typically formulate its guidance? Do they tend to be conservative on costs? Is there a pattern of guiding sequentially higher?

### **Step 2: Formulate Search Queries**

1.  **For Baseline:**
    *   `NVIDIA investor relations earnings releases`
    *   `NVIDIA historical GAAP operating expenses quarterly`
    *   `NVDA 10-Q filings operating expenses`
    *   `NVIDIA FY25 10-K report`

2.  **For Deconstructing the Anchor:**
    *   `NVIDIA Q2 FY2026 earnings transcript` (to find any updates to the full-year guidance)
    *   `NVIDIA Q1 FY2026 earnings press release` (to re-verify the initial guidance)
    *   `analyst estimates NVDA opex FY2026`

3.  **For Key Drivers:**
    *   `NVIDIA 10-K breakdown of operating expenses`
    *   `NVIDIA stock based compensation expense trend`
    *   `NVIDIA R&D spending roadmap Blackwell Rubin`
    *   `AI chip engineer salary trends 2025`

4.  **For Recent Signals:**
    *   `Meta capex guidance 2026 impact on NVIDIA`
    *   `Google AI infrastructure spending 2025 2026`
    *   `AMD MI400 series competitive pressure`
    *   `Intel Gaudi 4 market traction`

5.  **For Modeling Guidance:**
    *   `NVIDIA guidance vs actuals history operating expenses`
    *   `NVIDIA management commentary on cost discipline earnings call`

### **Step 3: Synthesize Key Findings**

*   **Historical Trend:** NVIDIA's GAAP OpEx has been accelerating dramatically. A simple historical average is misleading. The most recent quarters show significant sequential jumps. The Q2 FY26 guidance of $5.7B was a massive step-up from Q1's actuals (~$3.9B), representing a ~46% QoQ increase, likely due to the full impact of annual compensation reviews, increased headcount, and R&D program costs. This breaks any simple linear or low-percentage growth model.
*   **Obsolete Anchor:** The "mid-30% range" for full-year FY26 OpEx growth, given in May 2025, is no longer credible.
    *   FY25 GAAP OpEx was $11.56B.
    *   A 35% increase implies a full-year FY26 target of ~$15.6B.
    *   Q1 FY26 actual was ~$3.9B. The Q2 guidance was $5.7B. Assuming Q3 guidance (from the August 2025 release) saw continued growth to ~$6.2B, the total for the first three quarters would already be ~$15.8B.
    *   This makes the initial full-year guidance mathematically impossible to achieve without a negative Q4 OpEx. Therefore, NVIDIA must have updated this guidance in their Q2 release, and the QoQ trend is the only reliable signal.
*   **Primary Drivers:** The main drivers are (1) R&D for an accelerated roadmap (Blackwell-Next/Rubin architecture), (2) massive headcount growth to support this, and (3) Stock-Based Compensation (SBC), which is a huge component of GAAP OpEx and is amplified by a high stock price and fierce competition for AI talent.
*   **Peer Signals:** The provided sources on Meta are a

To forecast NVIDIA's GAAP Operating Expenses for Q3 FY2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** NVIDIA's historical GAAP Operating Expenses growth, particularly focusing on recent quarters during the AI boom (FY24-FY26). The Q2 FY26 guidance was $5.7 billion, a significant increase from Q1's $3.9 billion.
   - **Reasoning:** The recent trend shows a dramatic increase in OpEx, driven by R&D, headcount growth, and stock-based compensation. Historical data suggests a strong upward trajectory.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Given the Q2 guidance of $5.7 billion, a reasonable base rate for Q3 could be around $6.2 billion, assuming continued growth. Variance is high due to the rapid changes in the market and internal investments.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarity:** The current situation continues the trend of increasing expenses due to strategic investments in AI and competitive pressures.
   - **Difference:** The Q2 guidance was a significant jump, indicating that the company might have adjusted its strategy or faced unexpected cost pressures.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **R&D and Headcount Growth:** Continued investment in next-gen chips and AI talent suggests higher OpEx, making higher values more likely.
   - **Stock-Based Compensation:** High stock prices and competition for talent increase SBC, pushing expenses up.
   - **Market Conditions:** Meta's increased expenses and competitive pressures from AMD and Intel suggest a challenging environment, supporting higher OpEx.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Starting with a prior centered around $6.2 billion, the evidence of continued R&D investment and competitive pressures suggests an upward adjustment.
   - **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The mean shifts upward slightly, with increased variance due to market uncertainties and strategic investments.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The rapid increase in expenses could face constraints if market conditions change or if NVIDIA adjusts its strategy.
   - **Tail Risks:** Potential for lower expenses if cost-cutting measures are implemented or if market conditions improve unexpectedly.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative estimate might assume a stabilization of expenses around $6 billion, but this seems less likely given current evidence.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - **Calibrated Percentiles:** Based on the analysis, the forecast for NVIDIA's GAAP Operating Expenses for Q3 FY2026 is as follows:

P10: 5.8 billion  
P20: 6.0 billion  
P40: 6.2 billion  
P60: 6.4 billion  
P80: 6.6 billion  
P90: 6.8 billion

# Forecasting NVIDIA's Q3 FY2026 GAAP Operating Expenses Guidance

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use NVIDIA's recent GAAP Operating Expenses guidance and actual figures:

- Q1 FY2026 actual: ~$3.9B
- Q2 FY2026 guidance: $5.7B (a 46% QoQ increase)
- Full year FY2026 guidance: "mid-30% range" growth over FY2025's $11.56B

The most appropriate base rate is a sequential growth model from the Q2 FY2026 guidance of $5.7B, since the full-year guidance appears to be outdated given the massive Q2 jump. Historical patterns suggest NVIDIA's OpEx growth has been accelerating dramatically in the AI boom era.

Prior distribution:
- Mean/median: $6.3B (assuming ~10% QoQ growth from Q2's $5.7B)
- Variance: Moderate to high, given the volatility in NVIDIA's recent OpEx growth

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- NVIDIA continues to prioritize AI innovation and market leadership
- Competitive pressures remain high, requiring continued investment
- Stock-based compensation remains a significant component of GAAP OpEx

**Differences from base case:**
- The Q2 guidance of $5.7B represented an unusually large 46% QoQ jump, which is unlikely to repeat at the same magnitude
- Export control limitations mentioned in the background ($8B revenue impact) may lead to some cost adjustments
- Meta's recent earnings showed significantly higher AI spending, suggesting the AI arms race is intensifying

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing forecast higher:**
1. Meta's Q3 2025 results showed dramatically increased AI spending, with 2026 capex guidance of $37-40B (much higher than expected). This suggests NVIDIA's customers are accelerating AI investments, requiring NVIDIA to match with R&D spending. (Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring higher values)

2. The "mid-30% range" full-year OpEx growth guidance is mathematically impossible given the Q1 actual ($3.9B) and Q2 guidance ($5.7B), implying NVIDIA has already accepted a much higher OpEx trajectory. (Likelihood ratio: 3:1 favoring higher values)

3. NVIDIA's stock-based compensation, a major component of GAAP OpEx, likely continues to grow with the company's high stock price and aggressive hiring in AI talent. (Likelihood ratio: 1.5:1 favoring higher values)

**Evidence pushing forecast lower:**
1. The export control limitations mentioned ($8B revenue impact) might lead to some cost discipline or reallocation of resources. (Likelihood ratio: 1.2:1 favoring lower values)

2. The 46% QoQ jump in Q2 likely included some one-time or annual factors (compensation reviews, program initiations) that won't repeat at the same scale in Q3. (Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring lower values)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at $6.3B (10% growth from Q2's $5.7B), I'll update based on the evidence:

First update (Meta's increased AI spending):
- Prior: $6.3B
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring higher values
- Posterior shift: +$0.3B to $6.6B

Second update (Impossibility of original full-year guidance):
- Prior: $6.6B
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1 favoring higher values
- Posterior shift: +$0.4B to $7.0B

Third update (Export control limitations):
- Prior: $7.0B
- Likelihood ratio: 1.2:1 favoring lower values
- Posterior shift: -$0.1B to $6.9B

Fourth update (One-time factors in Q2 jump):
- Prior: $6.9B
- Likelihood ratio: 2:1 favoring lower values
- Posterior shift: -$0.3B to $6.6B

My posterior distribution is now centered around $6.6B, with increased variance due to the conflicting evidence.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the export controls on NVIDIA's strategic spending decisions
- The Q2 guidance of $5.7B might have already incorporated future growth plans, leading to a more modest Q3 increase
- I haven't fully accounted for potential seasonal patterns in NVIDIA's OpEx

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would be a lower forecast around $6.0B, assuming NVIDIA decides to moderate OpEx growth after the large Q2 jump. This could happen if:
- Management faces investor pressure about spending discipline
- The export controls force a strategic reassessment
- Q2 included significant one-time expenses

However, this seems less likely given the competitive AI landscape and Meta's recent spending signals.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: NVIDIA could dramatically accelerate R&D spending for next-gen architectures beyond Blackwell, pushing guidance above $7.5B
- Lower tail: A strategic pivot to cost discipline could keep guidance below $6.0B

I'll widen my distribution to account for these possibilities.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: $5.9B
P20: $6.1B
P40: $6.4B
P60: $6.7B
P80: $7.1B
P90: $7.5B

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary task is to forecast NVIDIA's GAAP Operating Expenses (OpEx) guidance for Q4 FY2026, which will be issued in the Q3 FY2026 earnings release.

The most critical piece of information is NVIDIA's recent OpEx trajectory. The background states that in the Q1 FY26 release (May 2025), NVIDIA guided for Q2 FY26 GAAP OpEx of **$5.7 billion**. This guidance represents a massive ~46.5% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase from the Q1 FY26 actual OpEx of $3.89 billion.

This enormous jump signifies a structural break, rendering long-term historical averages obsolete. The "mid-30% range" full-year FY26 OpEx growth guidance provided in May 2025 is also mathematically impossible given the Q1 and Q2 figures, and must have been revised upwards since.

Therefore, the appropriate base rate is not a historical average, but a forward-looking QoQ growth rate applied to the new, elevated cost structure established in Q2 FY26. A massive 46.5% QoQ growth is unsustainable. A reasonable prior assumes this growth will decelerate but remain high due to ongoing investments in R&D and talent.

My prior distribution for QoQ OpEx growth from Q3 to Q4 is centered around **8%**. This is significantly lower than the Q2 jump but higher than the ~6-7% rates seen in FY25, reflecting the intensified competitive environment.

To establish a prior for the Q4 guidance, I must first estimate the Q3 actual OpEx. Assuming a 10% QoQ growth from Q2's $5.7B guidance, Q3 OpEx would be approximately $6.27B. Applying my 8% growth prior for Q4 results in a baseline forecast:
$6.27B * 1.08 ≈ **$6.77 billion**.

My prior distribution is centered at approximately **$6.8 billion**, with a range reflecting uncertainty in both the Q3 actuals and the Q4 growth rate (e.g., from $6.2B to $7.4B).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: The fundamental drivers for OpEx growth persist. NVIDIA is in an AI arms race, requiring massive R&D spending on next-generation architectures (like Rubin). Competition for a limited pool of elite AI talent remains fierce, driving up compensation costs, a major component of GAAP OpEx via Stock-Based Compensation (SBC).
*   **Differences**: The key difference is the new, much higher cost baseline established in mid-FY26. While the percentage growth may slow, the absolute dollar increase each quarter will be substantial. Management may also face increasing pressure to demonstrate some cost control as the absolute numbers become very large, which could temper growth rates compared to the "growth at all costs" phase.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The provided research report, focusing on Meta's Q3 2025 earnings (late October 2025), offers highly relevant, timely evidence.

*   **Evidence 1: Meta's "spree of AI hiring and spending" and "soaring AI costs."**
    *   Meta is a key NVIDIA customer and a direct competitor for AI talent. Their aggressive spending signals that the competitive environment for R&D and personnel is intensifying, not easing. This directly translates to upward pressure on NVIDIA's own R&D and compensation expenses.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment**: This evidence makes higher OpEx growth scenarios (e.g., >10% QoQ) more likely and lower growth scenarios (<5% QoQ) less likely. It pushes the forecast **up**.

*   **Evidence 2: Meta projects higher expenses for 2026.**
    *   This forward-looking statement from a major industry player confirms that the high-spending environment is expected to persist. This reduces the probability that NVIDIA will suddenly signal a slowdown or cost-cutting initiative in its Q4 guidance.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment**: This reinforces the upward pressure on the forecast, particularly making the lower tail of the distribution less probable.

*   **Evidence 3: Meta's "Gloomy Ad Revenue Outlook" and stock slide.**
    *   At first glance, this could suggest a broader tech slowdown, which might eventually curb AI spending. However, the reports clarify that Meta is increasing its AI spending *despite* weakness in its core ad business. This demonstrates that major players view AI investment as strategically non-negotiable, even in the face of other business headwinds.
    *   **Likelihood Adjustment**: This is largely neutral to slightly bullish for NVIDIA's OpEx. It shows that AI spending is currently inelastic to other market concerns, reinforcing the "spend to win" thesis.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior**: Centered at $6.8B, based on a ~10% Q2->Q3 growth and an ~8% Q3->Q4 growth.
*   **Evidence**: The evidence from Meta strongly suggests the competitive pressures are higher than assumed in my conservative prior. The QoQ growth rate is unlikely to decelerate as much as I initially estimated.
*   **Update**: I will revise my assumptions upward.
    1.  I'll increase my estimate for Q3's QoQ growth from 10% to 12%, yielding an estimated Q3 OpEx base of $5.7B * 1.12 = **$6.38B**.
    2.  I'll increase my estimate for the Q4 guided QoQ growth from 8% to 10%, reflecting the intense competitive environment.
*   **Posterior Calculation**: $6.38B * 1.10 = **$7.02B**.

My posterior distribution is now centered around **$7.0 billion**. The evidence has shifted the median of my forecast up by about $200 million and has made me more confident that growth will remain in the double-digit range, while making a sharp deceleration less likely.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower Forecast)**: The massive Q2 OpEx jump could have been a one-time event to "catch up" on annual salary/stock grants and R&D program kickoffs. Management, seeing the new ~$23B/year run rate, could impose strict cost discipline, leading to a much lower QoQ growth of ~5% for Q4. This would imply guidance around $6.4B * 1.05 = **$6.72B**. This is a plausible downside risk if investor focus shifts to profitability.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher Forecast)**: The AI race could be even more expensive than I've modeled. An acceleration of the Rubin platform development or other strategic initiatives could require another major step-up in spending. A QoQ growth rate of 14-15% is not out of the question. This would imply guidance around $6.5B * 1.14 = **$7.41B**. This represents the upside tail risk.
*   **Confidence Adjustment**: My initial range was likely too narrow. The volatility in this metric is high. The evidence from Meta suggests the distribution should be skewed to the right; the pressures to spend seem more powerful than the pressures to save. I will widen my P10-P90 range to over $1 billion and introduce a slight right skew, with the median ($7.0B) being closer to the lower end of the central range.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final distribution is centered around $7.0 billion, reflecting continued strong, but decelerating, QoQ growth. The distribution is skewed to the upside to account for the intense competitive pressure to invest in R&D and talent, as evidenced by recent reports from peers like Meta.
