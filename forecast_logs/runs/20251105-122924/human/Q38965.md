### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Former UK Prime Ministers returning to party leadership:** This is the most specific reference class. In the post-war era, this has happened only once: Winston Churchill returned as PM in 1951 after losing the 1945 election, but he never ceased to be Leader of the Opposition. No post-war PM who has resigned or been forced out as party leader has ever returned to the post. This suggests a base rate of near 0%.
2.  **Leaders of major UK political parties returning after resignation:** This class is slightly broader. Notable examples are rare. Harold Wilson returned as Labour leader (and PM) in 1974 after resigning in 1970, but like Churchill, he remained leader in opposition. Nigel Farage has repeatedly returned to lead UKIP/Reform UK, but these are not parties of government in the same vein. The base rate for a leader of a major party of government returning after being forced out is exceptionally low, likely <1%.
3.  **"Comeback" leaders in other Westminster-style democracies:** Looking at countries like Australia or Canada, comebacks are also exceedingly rare. Kevin Rudd's brief return as Australian PM is a notable exception, but it was short-lived and occurred while he was still a sitting MP. This international comparison reinforces a very low base rate, perhaps in the 1-3% range.

**Limitations:** Boris Johnson is a unique political figure whose career has often defied conventional precedent. His celebrity status and populist appeal may make historical comparisons less reliable.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2023-06-09** Boris Johnson resigns as an MP with immediate effect. ↓ — This created a massive, unprecedented procedural barrier to his return, as the Conservative leader must be a Member of Parliament.
*   **2023-06-19** The Privileges Committee report is published, finding Johnson knowingly misled Parliament and recommending a 90-day suspension had he remained an MP. ↓ — The damning official verdict solidified opposition to him within the parliamentary party and damaged his public reputation.
*   **2023-10-04** At the Conservative Party Conference, Johnson makes no appearance, with allies instead launching the "Conservative Democratic Organisation" to push for more member control. ↓ — Showed his influence is now exerted from outside the formal party structure, reinforcing his distance from the parliamentary party.
*   **2024-10-24** (Hypothetical based on polling trends) The Conservative Party suffers a historic defeat in the UK General Election, losing over 200 seats. Labour wins a large majority. Rishi Sunak resigns as leader. ↑ — A catastrophic loss creates a power vacuum and a desperate search for a "winner," which some still believe Johnson to be.
*   **2024-12-05** (Hypothetical) Kemi Badenoch is elected as the new Conservative Party leader, promising a focus on fiscal discipline and a break from the "chaos" of the Johnson/Truss years. ↓ — A new leader is in place, blocking the path for Johnson's return. The party has chosen a new direction.
*   **2025-05-01** (Hypothetical) In local elections, the Conservatives make no significant recovery, continuing to poll in the low 20s. ↑ — The failure of the new leadership to gain traction could lead to buyer's remorse and increase chatter about a "proven election winner."
*   **2025-09-09** Johnson continues his lucrative career, writing for the Daily Mail and giving speeches, often criticising the government and the Conservative leadership's strategy. ↓ — He appears settled in a comfortable, high-influence, low-responsibility role, reducing his personal incentive to return to the grind of opposition politics.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **The "Not an MP" Barrier (Large, ↓):** The single largest obstacle. He must first be selected for and win a by-election in a safe Conservative seat. This requires a sitting MP to stand down for him, an event that is difficult to orchestrate and politically risky.
2.  **Desperation of the Party (Large, ↑):** If the Conservatives are languishing in opposition with historically low poll numbers into 2025, the membership and some MPs may see a return to their last election-winning leader as the only path back to relevance, regardless of the baggage.
3.  **Incumbent Leader Failure (Large, ↑):** A leadership contest must be triggered for Johnson to have a chance. If the post-Sunak leader fails to gain traction and faces a vote of no confidence from MPs, a window of opportunity opens.
4.  **Johnson's Personal Ambition vs. Lifestyle (Moderate, ↓):** Johnson is earning millions from speeches and writing. A return to lead a shattered opposition party would mean a huge pay cut and immense political difficulty. His motivation to undertake this task is a key uncertainty.
5.  **Enduring Popularity with Party Members (Moderate, ↑):** Johnson remains popular with a significant portion of the Conservative grassroots, who would have a final say in a leadership contest. Their nostalgia for the 2019 victory could override concerns from the parliamentary party.
6.  **Hostility from the Parliamentary Party (Moderate, ↓):** A large number of Conservative MPs, particularly the "One Nation" and 2019 intake MPs who lost their seats, blame Johnson's conduct for the party's collapse. They would actively work to block any return.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Lack of a Parliamentary Seat:** Unlike almost any other potential "comeback" leader in UK history (e.g., Churchill, Wilson), Johnson is not in Parliament. This adds a major procedural step that did not exist in historical reference cases.
*   **Nature of Departure:** He was not ousted by the electorate (like Churchill in '45) but by his own party due to scandal (Partygate, Pincher affair). This leaves a legacy of internal division and a "character" question that is difficult to overcome.
*   **Post-Premiership Career:** Johnson has rapidly built a highly lucrative and visible media career. This provides him with a platform and financial independence that reduces the personal incentive to return to frontline politics compared to past leaders.
*   **Severity of Party's Position:** The scale of the Conservatives' likely 2024 defeat would be far greater than the losses that preceded other leadership changes, potentially leading to a more radical and desperate search for a solution.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<5%) based on the historical reference class of former PMs returning after being forced out. The "equivalent n" is high, as this is a strong historical pattern.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Johnson's resignation as an MP creates a formidable, multi-stage procedural barrier.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The acrimonious nature of his exit and the Privileges Committee report create a significant bloc of opposition within the parliamentary party.
    *   (↓ Small) His successful and lucrative post-political career reduces his personal incentive to return.
    *   (↑ Moderate) A catastrophic and enduring electoral defeat for the Conservatives could create the "desperation" needed to overlook his flaws.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the low prior. The procedural hurdles and internal party opposition are immense and concrete, while the case for his return relies on a hypothetical level of future party desperation. The posterior should be significantly lower than the already-low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A safe-seat Conservative MP announces their resignation, with rumours Johnson will be the candidate.
    *   A "Draft Boris" campaign gains significant, public backing from sitting MPs and major party donors.
    *   The current Conservative leader faces a formal vote of no confidence.
    *   Polls of Conservative members show an overwhelming majority favouring Johnson over any other candidate.
    *   Johnson himself begins making speeches and appearances that are clearly aimed at a political comeback.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The current Conservative leader's approval ratings begin to recover or stabilize.
    *   Johnson explicitly rules out a return to frontline politics before the next election.
    *   No safe by-election opportunities emerge by mid-2025.
    *   Key former allies of Johnson publicly endorse the current leader or another future candidate.
    *   Johnson accepts a major international role or business commitment that would preclude a return.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Johnson's Unpredictability:** Johnson's career is defined by surprising and norm-breaking moves. Standard political logic may not fully apply.
*   **Party Rule Changes:** It is conceivable, though highly unlikely, that in a moment of crisis the party could change its rules to allow a non-MP to stand for leader on the condition they find a seat.
*   **"Black Swan" Events:** A major national or international crisis could dramatically reshape the political landscape and create an unexpected demand for a figure perceived as a strong leader.
*   **Media vs. Reality:** Johnson's media presence may create the illusion of a viable comeback, while the structural and political barriers remain insurmountable.
*   **Resolution Window:** The question closes on Jan 1, 2026. This is a short window for a new leader to fail, a leadership contest to be held, and for Johnson to secure a seat and win that contest.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of Boris Johnson returning as Conservative leader before 2026 is extremely low. The procedural barrier of him not being an MP is the most significant obstacle, and while his return is not impossible in a scenario of extreme party desperation, the combination of internal opposition, his lucrative new career, and the very short timeframe makes it a highly improbable event.

To forecast the probability of Boris Johnson returning as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for former UK Prime Ministers returning to party leadership after being forced out is extremely low. Historically, no post-war PM who has resigned or been forced out as party leader has returned to the post. This suggests a base rate near 0%. For broader context, leaders of major UK political parties returning after resignation is also rare, likely <1%. Therefore, we start with a prior probability of around 1%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Like other former leaders, Johnson faces significant procedural and political barriers to returning.
   - Differences: Johnson is not currently an MP, which adds a unique procedural hurdle. His departure was due to internal party issues rather than electoral defeat, creating additional internal opposition.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Not an MP Barrier (Large, ↓):** The requirement for Johnson to first become an MP is a significant procedural barrier. Likelihood ratio strongly decreases probability.
   - **Party Desperation (Moderate, ↑):** If the Conservative Party suffers a historic defeat, there might be desperation to bring back a "proven winner." However, this is speculative and not guaranteed.
   - **Johnson's Personal Ambition (Moderate, ↓):** His lucrative career outside politics reduces his incentive to return, decreasing probability.
   - **Internal Opposition (Moderate, ↓):** Significant opposition within the party due to past scandals decreases probability.
   - **Popularity with Members (Moderate, ↑):** Some grassroots support could increase probability, but this is countered by parliamentary opposition.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of 1%, the overwhelming evidence against a return (procedural barriers, internal opposition, personal career incentives) suggests a decrease in probability.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (where the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards decreasing probability).
   - Posterior probability remains very low, likely less than 1%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: Consider the possibility of a major political shift or crisis that could change the landscape. However, these are low-probability, high-impact events.
   - Alternative Forecast: A scenario where Johnson returns would require a significant political upheaval and a change in party rules or dynamics, which seems unlikely given current evidence.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the procedural barriers, internal opposition, and Johnson's current career, the probability of him returning as leader before 2026 is extremely low.
   - Final: 0.5%

# Will Boris Johnson return as the leader of the UK Conservative Party before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for former UK Prime Ministers returning to lead their party after resigning or being forced out.

Looking at historical data:
- In the post-war era, no UK Prime Minister who has resigned or been forced out as party leader has ever returned to lead their party.
- Winston Churchill returned as PM in 1951 after losing the 1945 election, but he never ceased being party leader.
- Harold Wilson returned as Labour leader (and PM) in 1974 after resigning in 1970, but like Churchill, he remained leader in opposition.

The most appropriate base rate is therefore extremely low, around 1-2%. This reflects the historical precedent while acknowledging that unprecedented events can occasionally occur in politics.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like other former PMs, Johnson left office under a cloud of controversy
- The Conservative Party has moved on with new leadership
- There's a natural tendency in politics to look forward rather than backward

**Key differences:**
- Johnson resigned as an MP in June 2023, creating an unprecedented procedural barrier - he would first need to return to Parliament
- The Privileges Committee found he knowingly misled Parliament, a particularly serious charge
- The timeline is extremely compressed - we're already in November 2025, leaving just 2 months for this to occur
- Johnson has established a lucrative post-political career with speaking engagements and media work

These differences significantly reduce the already low probability.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Johnson's resignation as an MP**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return as leader, it's very unlikely he would have resigned his seat (0.1)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return as leader, resigning his seat would be quite likely (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: The damning Privileges Committee report**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return as leader, such a damning report would be somewhat unlikely (0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, such a report would be more likely (0.7)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- This moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Current date (November 2025) with deadline of January 2026**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return, having only 2 months left would be very unlikely (0.05)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, being this close to the deadline is expected (0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
- This very strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Johnson's lucrative post-politics career**
- P(E|H): If Johnson were to return, establishing such a career would be somewhat unlikely (0.4)
- P(E|~H): If Johnson were not to return, such a career is quite likely (0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.8 = 0.5
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior of 2%:
- Prior odds: 0.02/0.98 = 0.0204

After Evidence 1 (MP resignation):
- Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 0.11 = 0.00224
- Posterior probability = 0.00224/(1+0.00224) = 0.0022 or 0.22%

After Evidence 3 (timeline constraint):
- Posterior odds = 0.00224 × 0.053 = 0.000119
- Posterior probability = 0.000119/(1+0.000119) = 0.000119 or 0.012%

The other evidence would further reduce this probability, but I'll stop here as the calculation is already approaching zero.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:
- I might be underestimating the Conservative Party's desperation if they're polling extremely poorly
- Johnson has defied political gravity before and has a unique appeal to certain voters
- There could be emergency procedures to fast-track his return if the party were desperate enough

However, even accounting for these factors:
- The procedural barriers remain enormous (he needs to become an MP first)
- The timeline is extremely compressed (just 2 months left)
- There's no evidence of any movement toward bringing Johnson back

Even the most optimistic scenario would require multiple highly improbable events to occur in sequence within a very short timeframe.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the historical base rate, the significant procedural barriers, the damning Privileges Committee report, Johnson's resignation as an MP, his lucrative post-politics career, and especially the extremely compressed timeline with only 2 months remaining until the resolution date, the probability is vanishingly small.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is former UK Prime Ministers who were forced out of the leadership by their own party and later returned to lead that party. In the post-war era, this has never happened. Leaders like Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May, and indeed Boris Johnson's predecessor, were removed by their party and did not return. Leaders who did return, like Winston Churchill (PM 1940-45, 1951-55), were not forced out by their party but lost a general election while remaining party leader.

A slightly broader reference class, leaders of major governing parties in Westminster-style democracies returning after being ousted by their party, is also exceptionally rare. The comeback of Kevin Rudd in Australia is a notable but isolated modern example.

Given this extreme rarity, the historical base rate is very low. I will set the prior probability P(H) at **2%**. This acknowledges that the event is not impossible but is historically extraordinary.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with Boris Johnson has similarities and crucial differences compared to the historical base case.

*   **Similarities:** Like other ousted leaders, Johnson was removed due to a loss of support from his parliamentary party and retains a degree of popularity with the grassroots membership.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Not a Member of Parliament:** This is the most significant difference. Unlike almost any historical precedent (e.g., Churchill, Rudd), Johnson is not in Parliament. To become leader, he must first be selected for and win a parliamentary seat, adding a major procedural barrier that did not exist in other cases.
    *   **Nature of Departure:** Johnson's ousting was driven by scandals related to personal conduct (Partygate, Pincher affair), culminating in a Privileges Committee finding that he knowingly misled Parliament. This leaves a legacy of deep personal animosity and mistrust within the parliamentary party, which acts as a gatekeeper for leadership nominations.
    *   **Post-Premiership Career:** Johnson has quickly established a highly lucrative career in media and public speaking, which may reduce his personal incentive to return to the arduous and less well-paid role of Leader of the Opposition.

These differences, particularly the lack of a parliamentary seat, make his situation significantly more difficult than the already-rare historical precedents.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "Boris Johnson returns as leader before 2026".

*   **Evidence 1: Johnson's resignation as an MP (June 2023).**
    *   This evidence is much more likely if he does not intend to return (P(E|~H) is high) than if he does (P(E|H) is low). Resigning created a formidable, multi-stage barrier to any comeback.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: A likely catastrophic Conservative defeat in the 2024 General Election.**
    *   This is a necessary precondition for a Johnson comeback. A party in deep crisis is far more likely to consider a radical, high-risk option like returning to a former leader. The desperation this would create is the primary driver for the "Pro-Johnson" scenario.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1.** This evidence increases the probability, as it creates the conditions under which a return becomes thinkable.

*   **Evidence 3: The short timeframe (resolution by Jan 1, 2026).**
    *   Following a late 2024 election, there is only about one year for the entire comeback sequence to unfold: a new leader must be elected, fail, be challenged and removed; Johnson must find a safe seat, win a by-election, secure enough MP nominations, and win a leadership contest.
    *   This compressed timeline makes the already difficult sequence of events highly improbable.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Prior Odds:** 2% probability corresponds to 1-to-49 odds.
*   **Step 1: Update for "Not an MP".** This is the most powerful piece of evidence against a return. It makes the mechanics of a comeback incredibly complex. This might decrease the odds by a factor of 10, moving them to roughly 1-to-490 (P ≈ 0.2%).
*   **Step 2: Update for "Party Desperation".** A massive election loss is the main factor making a comeback plausible. This could increase the odds significantly, perhaps by a factor of 5, as the party grasps for a "proven winner." This would bring the odds to roughly 5-to-490, or 1-to-98 (P ≈ 1%).
*   **Step 3: Update for "Short Timeline".** The need for a new leader to fail and be replaced, plus a by-election, all within about a year, is a huge constraint. This plausibly reduces the odds again by a factor of 2 or 3. Let's say it halves them to 1-to-196 (P ≈ 0.5%).
*   **Step 4: Net Effect & Final Polish.** The combination of factors suggests the final probability should remain very low. The procedural hurdles (no seat, short timeline, parliamentary opposition) are concrete and severe, while the main argument in favour (desperation) is speculative. My initial prior of 2% seems to be a reasonable landing spot after considering the push and pull of the evidence. The path to a comeback is narrow and requires a perfect sequence of improbable events.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis could be wrong if I am underestimating the sheer panic and pragmatism of the Conservative Party after a historic defeat. In a true crisis, party rules can be bent, and procedural hurdles can be overcome with surprising speed if the political will exists. A "Draft Boris" movement, funded by donors and amplified by friendly media, could create an unstoppable momentum that forces the parliamentary party's hand. I might also be underestimating Johnson's own ambition and his unique ability to defy political gravity.

However, the counter-argument is that the animosity towards him from many MPs who will have lost their seats, blaming his conduct, will be a powerful blocking force. Furthermore, his lucrative lifestyle offers a very comfortable alternative to leading a shattered party in opposition. The timeline remains the most brutal and objective constraint. The scenario requires too many things to go right too quickly. My low probability accounts for the possibility of a "perfect storm" but correctly weights it as a tail risk. I will stick with a very low probability.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability of Boris Johnson returning as Conservative leader before 2026 is extremely low. The base rate for such an event is near zero. While the desperation following a likely major election defeat provides a motive for the party to consider him, the procedural barriers—most notably that he is not a Member of Parliament—combined with the short timeframe and significant opposition within the parliamentary party, make a successful comeback a remote possibility. The chain of events required for his return is long, and every link is fragile.

Final: 2%
