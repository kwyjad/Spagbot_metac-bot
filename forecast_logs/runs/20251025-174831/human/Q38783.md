### Reference class & base rates
1.  **GiveWell Top Charity List Stability:** Historically, GiveWell's top charity list has been relatively stable, with changes occurring annually based on in-depth reviews. Once a charity *category* is removed for strategic reasons (as opposed to performance issues), its re-instatement is rare in the short term. In the 2017-2022 period, the list composition was quite consistent. The 2022 change that removed deworming charities was a significant strategic shift. The base rate of a strategically removed intervention category returning to the list within 3 years is low, estimated at **10-20%**.
2.  **Endorsement of High-Uncertainty, High-EV Interventions:** Philanthropic evaluators often grapple with how to present interventions with extremely high expected value (EV) but high uncertainty (a "heavy-tailed" or "fragile" evidence base). Often, these are recommended for a portion of a portfolio but not given the top, "safest bet" endorsement. The base rate for such an intervention regaining a "top/safest" recommendation without new, certainty-increasing evidence is low, perhaps **5-15%** over a 2-3 year period.
3.  **Status of Deworming Charities on the List (2020-2025):** At the question's opening in 2020, four of seven top charities were deworming-focused. They remained on the list through 2021 but were removed in late 2022. They have been off the list for 2023, 2024, and thus far in 2025. This implies a ~40% "on-list" rate over the question's lifetime, but this is a poor reference class as it ignores the regime change in GiveWell's criteria. The post-2022 period is more relevant, where the rate is 0%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-06-10** New PNAS meta-analysis reaffirms positive health impacts of deworming. — ↑ — Strengthens the overall evidence base for deworming, potentially reducing (but not eliminating) GiveWell's specific concerns about the certainty of long-term economic benefits.
*   **2025-01-01** Giving What We Can (which relies heavily on GiveWell) lists its 2025 recommendations. Deworming charities are recommended but not in the same top tier as GiveWell's current "Top Charities." — ↓ — Indicates the new categorization scheme from 2022 is holding steady across the effective altruism ecosystem.
*   **2025-05-01** GiveWell recommends a $1.4M grant to Evidence Action's Deworm the World. — ↑ — Demonstrates continued high regard for deworming's cost-effectiveness and an ongoing funding relationship, keeping the door open for a potential change in status. It is not a "forgotten" intervention.
*   **2025-10-25** (Present Day) GiveWell's Top Charities list for 2025 does not include any deworming charities. — ↓ — The status quo with only two months left in the year is a strong piece of evidence. A change would require a reversal of the current public recommendation.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **GiveWell's Strategic Criteria for "Top Charity":** This is the primary driver. The 2022 shift to prioritize "surer bets" with more robust, less fragile evidence is the sole reason deworming charities were removed. A reversal of this high-level strategy is the most direct path to a "Yes" resolution. **(Large effect)**
2.  **New, Replicating Evidence on Long-Term Outcomes:** GiveWell's high valuation of deworming rests heavily on the Miguel & Kremer (2004) study's long-term income findings. A new, high-quality study that successfully replicates these specific long-term economic effects would directly address the "thin reed" concern and could trigger a re-evaluation. **(Large effect)**
3.  **Re-evaluation of Existing Evidence:** GiveWell could decide its previous discounting of the long-term effects was too conservative, perhaps influenced by new meta-analyses (like the 2024 PNAS paper) or a shift in internal expert opinion. **(Moderate effect)**
4.  **Funding Room and Cost-Effectiveness Shifts:** If other top charities (e.g., malaria nets, vitamin A) see their cost-effectiveness decline or become fully funded, GiveWell might be compelled to elevate the next-best options, like deworming, to the top list to guide marginal donations effectively. **(Moderate effect)**
5.  **Performance of Deworming Charities:** Exceptional execution, such as significantly lower costs per treatment or expansion into highly cost-effective regions (as seen with ongoing funding in Nigeria), could marginally improve the intervention's standing, though it's already considered highly cost-effective. **(Small effect)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Reason for Removal:** Unlike a charity being removed for poor performance or new negative evidence, deworming charities were removed due to a change in GiveWell's labeling philosophy. The underlying evaluation of their cost-effectiveness remains extremely high.
*   **Continued Strong Funding:** GiveWell continues to direct significant funding from its "All Grants Fund" to deworming, calling it one of its top funding opportunities. This is highly unusual for an intervention not on the "Top Charities" list and signals it is "first in line" if criteria change or other funding rooms dry up.
*   **"Fragile" Evidence Base:** The controversy and reliance on a single study for the bulk of the modeled benefits make deworming's evidence profile unique among GiveWell's highly-rated interventions. This fragility is the explicit reason for its current status.
*   **Very Short Time Horizon:** With only two months until the end of 2025, any change would have to be based on analysis that is already complete or nearly complete. GiveWell typically announces its annual list in November, leaving a very narrow window for a reversal.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the stability of institutional strategy (Reference Class 1), a reasonable prior for a reversal within a 3-year window is ~15%. Given we are at the end of that window, this seems like a fair starting point. Let's set the prior at **15% YES** with an equivalent n of ~10, reflecting moderate confidence in the status quo.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ small) The 2024 PNAS meta-analysis strengthens the general case for deworming but doesn't directly replicate the long-term economic effects that are the core of GiveWell's uncertainty.
    *   (↑ small) Continued large-scale funding in 2025 confirms deworming is a top-tier funding priority for GiveWell, just not a "Top Charity" by label. This keeps the possibility of reinstatement alive.
    *   (↓ moderate) The persistence of the "surer bets" categorization throughout 2023, 2024, and 2025 suggests the strategic shift is durable and not a temporary re-labeling.
    *   (↓ large) The extremely short time to resolution (2 months) makes a major strategic reversal, which would require significant internal deliberation and a public announcement, highly improbable.
*   **Net effect:** The strong evidence for the stability of the new criteria and the very short timeline heavily outweigh the positive but non-decisive new evidence and funding. The posterior should move **down significantly** from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A new GiveWell blog post explicitly questioning or announcing a revision of the "Top Charity" criteria.
    *   Publication of a major new study replicating long-term economic benefits of deworming.
    *   An unexpected announcement that a current top charity (e.g., Malaria Consortium) has closed its funding gap for the foreseeable future.
    *   GiveWell announces its 2026 recommendations in Nov/Dec 2025 and a deworming charity is on the list.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   GiveWell releases its 2026 Top Charities list in Nov/Dec 2025, and it does *not* include any deworming charities (this would be definitive).
    *   A GiveWell blog post reaffirming the distinction between "Top Charities" and other highly-recommended grant opportunities.
    *   Evidence Action or other deworming charities announce a shift in focus away from mass deworming.

To forecast whether any of GiveWell's top charities will perform mass deworming as their primary intervention by the end of 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for a strategically removed intervention category returning to the list within 3 years is estimated at 10-20%. Given the strategic shift in 2022 and the absence of deworming charities on the list since then, a base rate of 15% seems reasonable.
- **Rationale:** This base rate reflects the historical stability of GiveWell's top charity list and the rarity of reinstating a category removed for strategic reasons.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation aligns with the base case in that deworming charities were removed due to a strategic shift, not due to performance issues.
- **Differences:** The continued funding and positive meta-analysis in 2024 suggest some ongoing support for deworming, which could slightly increase the probability compared to the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **2024 PNAS Meta-Analysis:** Strengthens the evidence base for deworming but does not directly address the long-term economic effects. Likelihood ratio slightly >1.
- **Continued Funding:** GiveWell's $1.4M grant to Evidence Action's Deworm the World indicates ongoing support, slightly increasing the probability. Likelihood ratio slightly >1.
- **Current Status:** The absence of deworming charities on the 2025 list and the short time frame for a change are strong negative indicators. Likelihood ratio <1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 15% translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).
- **Likelihood Ratios:** 
  - Positive evidence (meta-analysis, funding): Combined likelihood ratio ~1.1.
  - Negative evidence (current status, short time frame): Combined likelihood ratio ~0.5.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.176 * 1.1 * 0.5 = 0.0968.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.0968 / (1 + 0.0968) ≈ 8.8%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The short time frame and strategic stability strongly suggest a low probability, but the ongoing funding and meta-analysis provide a non-zero chance.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A sudden strategic shift or new evidence could change the outcome, but these are unlikely given the current context.
- **Adjustments:** The probability remains low due to the strong negative evidence and short time frame.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian update, the final forecast is 9%.

Final: 9%

# Forecasting: Will any of GiveWell's top charities perform mass deworming as their primary intervention by end of 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish a prior based on the most relevant reference class: the probability that an intervention category strategically removed from GiveWell's top charities list would be reinstated within a 3-year period.

Key considerations:
- Deworming charities were removed from the top charities list in late 2022 due to a strategic shift in GiveWell's criteria (prioritizing "surer bets"), not due to performance issues
- The question resolves in just over 2 months (end of 2025)
- GiveWell typically announces its annual charity list in November

Based on GiveWell's historical pattern of strategic decisions and the rarity of reversing such decisions within a short timeframe, I'll set a prior of **10%**. This reflects the low base rate of intervention categories being reinstated after a strategic removal, especially within a 3-year window.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- GiveWell's strategic shifts tend to be deliberate and durable
- The organization maintains consistency in its evaluation framework once established
- Major changes to charity categorization typically follow annual review cycles

**Key differences:**
- Deworming remains highly regarded by GiveWell despite its removal from the top list (unlike truly deprioritized interventions)
- GiveWell continues to direct significant funding to deworming charities through its All Grants Fund
- The removal was specifically about the certainty of evidence, not cost-effectiveness (which remains extremely high)
- The extremely short timeline (2 months) until resolution is unusually constraining

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Continued substantial funding to deworming charities in 2025**
- P(E|H): ~90% (If deworming were to return to top charity status, continued funding would be nearly certain)
- P(E|~H): ~70% (Even without top charity status, GiveWell continues to value and fund deworming)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Persistence of "surer bets" categorization through 2023-2025**
- P(E|H): ~20% (If deworming were to return to top charity status, this persistent categorization would be unlikely)
- P(E|~H): ~90% (If deworming remains off the top list, this consistent categorization is expected)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.22 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Only 2 months remaining until resolution**
- P(E|H): ~5% (If deworming were to return to top charity status, having only 2 months left would be very unlikely)
- P(E|~H): ~95% (If deworming remains off the top list, the short timeline is irrelevant)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.05 (strongly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: 2024 PNAS meta-analysis strengthening deworming evidence**
- P(E|H): ~80% (If deworming were to return, new supporting evidence would likely be a factor)
- P(E|~H): ~60% (Even without reinstatement, we'd expect ongoing research in this area)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.33 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10%/90% = 0.11

First update (Evidence 1): 0.11 × 1.3 = 0.143
Converting to probability: 0.143/(1+0.143) ≈ 12.5%

Second update (Evidence 2): 0.143 × 0.22 = 0.031
Converting to probability: 0.031/(1+0.031) ≈ 3%

Third update (Evidence 3): 0.031 × 0.05 = 0.0016
Converting to probability: 0.0016/(1+0.0016) ≈ 0.16%

Fourth update (Evidence 4): 0.0016 × 1.33 = 0.0021
Converting to probability: 0.0021/(1+0.0021) ≈ 0.21%

The extremely short timeline until resolution dominates this calculation, as it's highly improbable that GiveWell would make such a significant strategic reversal with only two months remaining in the year.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of an already-planned announcement in November 2025
- GiveWell could have been conducting a thorough re-evaluation throughout 2025 that I'm unaware of
- The resolution criteria include a provision about regrants (10% to deworming would count as positive)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- GiveWell could announce a restructuring of its charity categories that effectively reinstates deworming
- A major new study replicating the long-term economic benefits could be published in November
- GiveWell might be planning to release its 2026 recommendations early (in December 2025)

After considering these possibilities, I believe my forecast is still too low. While the timeline is extremely tight, GiveWell does typically make its annual announcements in November, which falls within our resolution window. Additionally, the regrants provision provides another path to positive resolution.

I'll adjust my forecast upward to account for these considerations, but still keep it very low given the timeline constraints.

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The central issue is the likelihood of a major strategic reversal by a large, data-driven organization like GiveWell. A generic base rate for such a reversal within a 3-year window is low. However, this situation is unique. The removed intervention, deworming, remains one of the highest-rated by GiveWell's own cost-effectiveness models, creating constant internal pressure for its reinstatement to the "Top Charities" list.

Therefore, a more appropriate reference class is: "What is the probability that a data-driven organization reverses a major public-facing categorization decision within three years, when its own internal models conflict with that categorization?" This is a situation of high internal tension. I estimate the probability of a reversal under these specific conditions to be significantly higher than for a typical strategic change.

I will set the prior probability at **30%** that GiveWell would reverse this decision within a three-year timeframe (end of 2022 to end of 2025).
*   Prior Odds: 30 / 70 ≈ 0.43 (or roughly 3-to-7 in favor of no change).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The situation involves a large, deliberative non-profit, where institutional inertia is a powerful force. Changes to core recommendations are made carefully and are not reversed lightly.
*   **Differences:** The key difference is the reason for deworming's removal. It was not due to reduced cost-effectiveness but a change in labeling philosophy to prioritize interventions with a more robust, less "fragile" evidence base for the "Top Charity" designation. GiveWell continues to direct tens of millions of dollars to deworming via its All Grants Fund, calling it a top funding opportunity. This makes deworming a "first in line" candidate for reinstatement, unlike an intervention that was dropped due to poor performance. This sustained high internal rating is the primary reason for using a higher-than-normal prior for reversal.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will update the 30% prior based on events between late 2022 and today (October 2025).

*   **Primary Evidence: The new categorization has remained in place for two full annual cycles (the 2023 and 2024 lists).**
    *   This is the strongest piece of evidence. It demonstrates that the new policy is not a one-off decision and has survived at least two annual reviews.
    *   P(E | H): If GiveWell were going to reverse the decision by the end of year three (H), it's still quite possible they would let the new policy run for two years to gather data or test donor reactions.
    *   P(E | ~H): If GiveWell were *not* going to reverse the decision (~H), we would certainly expect to see the policy remain in place for two years.
    *   The evidence is more likely if the policy is permanent, but not overwhelmingly so, as a three-year trial period is plausible. I estimate a likelihood ratio of **0.5**, meaning observing two years of persistence makes the "reversal" hypothesis half as likely as it was before. This is a moderately strong update **decreasing** the probability.

*   **Secondary Evidence (minor points):**
    *   **(Slightly ↑) Continued heavy funding and positive language:** GiveWell's ongoing grants to deworming in 2023-2025 confirm it remains a top priority, keeping the door open for reinstatement.
    *   **(Slightly ↑) New PNAS meta-analysis (2024):** This strengthens the general evidence base for deworming. While it doesn't resolve the core "thin reed" issue about long-term economic benefits, it could provide rhetorical cover for a reversal.
    *   **(Slightly ↓) Adoption by other organizations (e.g., Giving What We Can):** This suggests the new framework is becoming an accepted, stable part of the effective altruism ecosystem, making it harder for GiveWell to reverse course without causing confusion.

These minor points push in opposite directions and have a small net effect. The main update comes from the persistence of the policy for two years.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a single update using the primary piece of evidence on the prior.

*   **Prior Odds:** 0.43
*   **Likelihood Ratio (for policy persistence over two years):** 0.5
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.43 × 0.5 = 0.215
*   **Posterior Probability:** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 0.215 / 1.215 ≈ **17.7%**

After updating, the probability stands at approximately 18%. This reflects a significant downgrade from the 30% prior due to the observed stability of the new policy, but it remains well above zero because of the underlying tension between GiveWell's model and its public list.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~18% could be too high if I am underestimating GiveWell's commitment to the new "surer bets" philosophy for its flagship list. The All Grants Fund works as a perfect release valve, allowing them to fund deworming without compromising the communication goals of the Top Charities list. In this view, the current system is a stable, long-term equilibrium, and the probability of a change should be very low (<10%).

Conversely, the forecast could be too low. The pressure from having what their model says is a phenomenally effective intervention in a secondary category may be immense. Three years could be the breaking point where they decide the labeling experiment has failed and revert to putting their highest-EV-rated charities on the main list. In this world, the probability could be closer to the 30% prior or even higher.

The Metaculus community forecast on an identical question is 19%, which suggests my reasoning is aligned with the market consensus. My final probability acknowledges both the strong force of the status quo and the significant, persistent pressure for a reversal.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability is low but not negligible. The status quo is a strong predictor, and the core evidence controversy that prompted the change has not been resolved. However, the extreme cost-effectiveness of deworming in GiveWell's models creates a unique and constant pressure to reinstate it. The upcoming Nov/Dec 2025 announcement is the moment of truth for the three-year window. Balancing these factors, I assess the probability to be just under one in five.

Final: 18%
