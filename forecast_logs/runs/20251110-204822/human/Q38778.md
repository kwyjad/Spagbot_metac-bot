### Reference class & base rates
*   **Reference Class 1: Major UK public sector pay disputes involving sustained strike action (2010-2025).** This class includes disputes with teachers, rail workers, university staff, and NHS staff. In these cases, the government often makes an initial offer (usually aligned with a pay review body), which is rejected, leading to strikes. A revised, improved offer is frequently made to end the dispute.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~40-50%. Strikes are costly and politically damaging, creating strong incentives for the government to find a resolution, which often involves a concession beyond the initial offer.
    *   **Limitations:** This class is broad. The fiscal context and political priorities vary significantly over this period. The NHS holds a unique political position compared to other public services.

*   **Reference Class 2: NHS doctor pay disputes in England leading to strike action (2012-2025).** This is a more specific class, including the 2012 pension dispute, the 2015-16 junior doctor contract dispute, and the 2022-2024 pay dispute. In all these instances, industrial action ultimately led to negotiations and a revised government position or offer.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~60-70%. The precedent is strong: when doctors strike, the government eventually makes a better offer to end the disruption. The 2022-24 dispute, which resulted in an improved offer accepted in September 2024, is the most salient example.
    *   **Limitations:** The current dispute is happening very soon after the last one was settled, which might alter the political dynamics. The resolution window (before Jan 1, 2026) is extremely short.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2024-09-16** Junior doctors vote to accept a pay offer, ending the 18-month dispute. — ↓ — This set a new baseline and created a temporary truce, suggesting the issue was resolved for the 2023/24 and 2024/25 pay years.
*   **2025-07-03** BMA outlines priorities for the government's 10-Year Health Plan, re-emphasizing workforce and pay issues. — ↑ — Signaled that the underlying demand for "full pay restoration" was not resolved by the 2024 deal and would be a priority in the next pay round.
*   **2025-11-06** BMA rejects a government offer of non-pay benefits (exam fees, training places) and confirms strikes will proceed. — ↑ — Demonstrates the BMA's focus is exclusively on a consolidated pay uplift and that they have a strong mandate to reject lesser concessions.
*   **2025-11-08** A five-day strike is confirmed for November 2025 after talks fail, marking the 13th round of action in the overall dispute. — ↑ — Escalates pressure on the government and the NHS. Sustained action is the BMA's primary lever for forcing a better offer, and they are using it again.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Strike Impact on NHS Performance:** Each strike day cancels tens of thousands of appointments, exacerbating record-high waiting lists. This creates immense political pressure on the Health Secretary and the government to resolve the dispute. (Large impact)
*   **Government Fiscal Constraints:** The Labour government faces significant pressure on public finances. A large, unbudgeted pay rise for doctors would be costly and could trigger knock-on demands from other public sector unions, undermining the government's economic credibility. (Large impact)
*   **BMA Resolve & Mandate:** The BMA's resident doctors committee has a strong and recently renewed mandate for "full pay restoration." Having successfully forced a better offer in 2024, their credibility with members depends on achieving further gains, making it hard for them to back down. (Moderate impact)
*   **Political Calculus of a New Government:** The Labour government, elected in 2024, has staked its reputation on "fixing the NHS." Ongoing, high-profile strikes are politically damaging and contradict this core mission, creating a powerful incentive to make a deal. (Moderate impact)
*   **Time Constraint:** The resolution deadline is Jan 1, 2026. This leaves less than two months for negotiation, treasury approval, and implementation. Bureaucratic and political inertia make this a very tight turnaround for a revised pay offer. (Large impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extremely Short Horizon:** Unlike previous disputes which unfolded over many months or years, this question resolves in under 60 days. The speed required for a new offer to be negotiated and enacted is a major deviation from the norm.
*   **Post-Truce Dispute:** This industrial action follows shortly after a deal was accepted (Sept 2024). The government may feel it has already made significant concessions and be less willing to immediately offer more, framing this as "re-opening a closed issue."
*   **New Labour Government:** The dispute from 2022-2024 was primarily with a Conservative government. The current negotiations are with a Labour government, which may be more ideologically sympathetic to unions but is also highly sensitive to accusations of fiscal irresponsibility.
*   **Specificity of the Demand:** The BMA's demand for "full pay restoration" (a ~35% uplift) is a clear but very high bar. The government's position is that this is unaffordable. This lack of a clear landing zone for compromise makes a quick resolution difficult.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the reference class of major NHS doctor strikes (Reference Class 2), a prior of P(Yes) ≈ 0.6 seems appropriate. The precedent for strikes yielding improved offers is very strong. (Equivalent n ≈ 8).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The BMA has immediately resumed significant industrial action and rejected non-pay offers, showing high resolve.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The Labour government has a strong political need to show competence by ending NHS strikes.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (<2 months) is a powerful constraint on the slow-moving processes of government negotiation and finance approval.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The government is operating under severe fiscal pressure and has already settled one dispute with this group within the last 18 months.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The BMA's strong position and the government's political need to solve the problem push upwards. However, the exceptionally short timeline is a critical, practical barrier. This negative factor is significant enough to substantially reduce the high prior. The posterior should move down significantly, likely to just below 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The government publicly acknowledges the 5.4% offer is a "starting point" for talks.
    *   ACAS or another third-party mediator is formally brought in to facilitate talks.
    *   Wes Streeting or the Prime Minister's office clears their diary for "intensive negotiations."
    *   Leaked reports of a new Treasury-approved mandate for the Department of Health.
    *   The BMA announces a ballot on a "credible new offer."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Wes Streeting makes a "final offer" statement in Parliament or to the media.
    *   The government announces it will impose the 5.4% increase unilaterally via the DDRB process.
    *   Talks between the BMA and government break down completely with no date to resume.
    *   Public opinion, as measured in polls, turns sharply against the striking doctors.
    *   Strike turnout is visibly lower than in previous rounds.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Enacts":** The resolution criteria state the DHSC "enacts a pay offer." This is ambiguous. It could mean a formal agreement is signed, or simply that a new pay circular is issued. A last-minute verbal agreement on Dec 31st might not count.
*   **Hypothetical Sources:** The provided sources for November 2025 are future-dated and must be treated as assumed facts for this scenario, not real-world events.
*   **Complexity of Pay Offer:** An offer could exceed 5.4% on average but not for all doctors, or include one-off payments. The resolution hinges on the "average uplift" exceeding 5.4%, which could be a point of contention.
*   **External Shocks:** A severe winter NHS crisis (e.g., a new flu strain) or a separate major economic event could dramatically shift the government's priorities and willingness to pay.
*   **Unilateral Action:** The government could enact a pay rise above 5.4% without BMA agreement. While this resolves the question "Yes," it would be a very different political situation than a negotiated settlement.

**Final Research Summary:** The strong precedent of doctors' strikes forcing government concessions is pitted against an extremely short timeline for resolution. While the BMA's resolve and the government's political need for a solution are high, the practical difficulty of negotiating and implementing a new offer before 2026 makes this a very close call.

To forecast the probability of resident doctors in England receiving a further pay increase before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 2** is the most relevant: NHS doctor pay disputes in England leading to strike action (2012-2025). Historical data shows a strong precedent for strikes leading to improved offers, with a base rate of ~60-70%.
- **Chosen Base Rate:** 60% (P(H) = 0.6) due to the strong historical precedent of government concessions following strikes.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves NHS doctors striking, similar to past disputes where improved offers were made.
- **Differences:** The time frame is much shorter (less than two months), and the government has recently settled a similar dispute, which might reduce their willingness to concede further.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **BMA's Strong Resolve:** The BMA's rejection of non-pay offers and continued strikes suggest a high likelihood of pushing for a better offer. This increases the probability (Likelihood ratio > 1).
- **Political Pressure on Labour Government:** The need to resolve NHS issues aligns with the government's political goals, increasing the probability (Likelihood ratio > 1).
- **Short Time Horizon:** The limited time for negotiation and implementation is a significant constraint, decreasing the probability (Likelihood ratio < 1).
- **Fiscal Constraints:** The government's financial limitations and recent settlement with doctors decrease the probability (Likelihood ratio < 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 0.6 / (1 - 0.6) = 1.5
- **Likelihood Ratios:**
  - BMA's resolve and political pressure: Increase odds (combined likelihood ratio > 1).
  - Short time horizon and fiscal constraints: Decrease odds (combined likelihood ratio < 1).
- **Net Effect:** The negative factors (short time horizon and fiscal constraints) are significant, likely outweighing the positive factors. The posterior probability should be adjusted downward from the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of rapid negotiation breakthroughs or external pressures forcing a quick resolution.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A unilateral government decision to increase pay could resolve the question affirmatively without full negotiations.
- **Adjustments:** Given the significant constraints, a downward adjustment from the prior is justified, but not too drastic due to the potential for unexpected developments.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering all factors, the probability of a pay increase being enacted before 2026 is adjusted to reflect the constraints and potential for resolution. A reasonable estimate is slightly below 50%.

Final: 45%

# Will resident doctors in England receive a further pay increase before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the reference class of NHS doctor pay disputes in England that led to strike action (2012-2025). This is the most relevant reference class because:

- It specifically involves the same group (resident/junior doctors)
- It involves the same type of action (strikes)
- It includes recent historical precedents with similar dynamics

Based on this reference class, the base rate is approximately 60-70% that strikes lead to an improved government offer. In all recent instances (2012 pension dispute, 2015-16 junior doctor contract dispute, and 2022-2024 pay dispute), industrial action ultimately led to negotiations and a revised government position.

I'll use a prior of 60% to be slightly conservative given the unique time constraints in this case.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The BMA is using the same strategy (strikes) that has been effective in the past
- The government faces similar political pressure to resolve NHS disruption
- The core issue (pay) remains the same as in previous disputes
- The BMA has a strong mandate from its members, as in previous disputes

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline**: The resolution window is extremely short (less than 2 months until Jan 1, 2026)
- **Recent settlement**: This dispute follows shortly after a deal was accepted (Sept 2024)
- **Political context**: This is a Labour government rather than Conservative
- **Fiscal environment**: The government faces significant budget constraints

The short timeline is the most significant difference and works strongly against resolution, while the Labour government's political priorities might slightly increase chances of resolution.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: BMA has called a five-day strike for November 2025**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If a pay increase is coming, strikes are the proven mechanism to achieve it
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Strikes might still occur even if they won't succeed
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 2: BMA rejected non-pay benefits offer**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - If pay increase is coming, BMA would reject lesser offers
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - BMA might reject alternatives regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.14 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Extremely short timeline (less than 2 months)**
- P(E|H): Very low (~0.2) - If pay increase happens, it would typically need more time
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If no pay increase happens, short timeline is a likely reason
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 4: Recent settlement in September 2024**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.3) - If new pay increase happens, it would be unusual so soon after settlement
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - If no increase happens, recent settlement explains why
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.43 (moderately decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior probability P(H) = 0.6 (60%)

First update using Evidence 3 (timeline constraint):
- Prior odds = 0.6/0.4 = 1.5
- Likelihood ratio = 0.25
- Posterior odds = 1.5 × 0.25 = 0.375
- Posterior probability = 0.375/(1+0.375) = 0.273 (27.3%)

Second update using Evidence 4 (recent settlement):
- Prior odds = 0.273/0.727 = 0.375
- Likelihood ratio = 0.43
- Posterior odds = 0.375 × 0.43 = 0.161
- Posterior probability = 0.161/(1+0.161) = 0.139 (13.9%)

Third update using Evidence 1 (five-day strike):
- Prior odds = 0.139/0.861 = 0.161
- Likelihood ratio = 1.8
- Posterior odds = 0.161 × 1.8 = 0.29
- Posterior probability = 0.29/(1+0.29) = 0.225 (22.5%)

Fourth update using Evidence 2 (rejected non-pay benefits):
- Prior odds = 0.225/0.775 = 0.29
- Likelihood ratio = 1.14
- Posterior odds = 0.29 × 1.14 = 0.331
- Posterior probability = 0.331/(1+0.331) = 0.249 (24.9%)

The posterior probability after considering all evidence is approximately 25%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the timeline constraint. Government pay processes can be expedited when politically necessary.
- I might be underestimating the new Labour government's motivation to resolve NHS disputes quickly as part of their core promise to "fix the NHS."
- The BMA might accept a smaller increase than their full demand, making resolution easier.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The government could announce an intention to increase pay before Jan 1, 2026, with implementation later.
- A creative compromise could emerge (e.g., staged increases or one-off payments).
- External factors (winter NHS crisis) could force faster government action.

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic view would place the probability at 40-45%, arguing that:
1. Labour governments historically have better relations with unions
2. The political cost of continued NHS strikes is too high for a new government
3. The BMA's strategy has consistently worked in the past

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome the practical reality of the extremely short timeline and the fiscal constraints. The government bureaucracy moves slowly, and Treasury approval for unbudgeted spending is a significant hurdle.

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 28% to account for the possibility of expedited government action.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 28%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate reference class is "NHS doctor pay disputes in England leading to strike action." This has occurred several times in the last 15 years (e.g., 2012, 2015-16, 2022-24). In each of these major disputes, sustained industrial action by doctors ultimately resulted in the government improving its offer or position to end the strikes. This suggests a strong precedent. Given that this tactic has consistently worked for the BMA, a base rate reflecting a better-than-even chance of success is appropriate.

I will set the prior probability P(H) at **65%**. This reflects the historical pattern where determined strike action by this specific group has a high likelihood of extracting concessions from the government. In odds, this is 0.65 / (1 - 0.65) = 1.86 to 1 in favor of an improved offer.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The core dynamics are the same as in past disputes. The BMA is using its most powerful lever—multi-day strikes—to cause maximum disruption to the NHS. This creates immense political pressure on the government, which is judged by its handling of the health service and its waiting lists.
*   **Differences:** The primary and most significant difference is the **extremely short timeline**. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, which is less than two months from the current date (November 10, 2025). Previous disputes unfolded over many months or even years, allowing for protracted negotiations. For a new offer to be negotiated, approved by the Treasury, and formally "enacted" in such a short period is a major logistical and bureaucratic challenge. A secondary difference is the context: this dispute comes very soon after a previous 18-month dispute was settled (in September 2024), which could harden the government's resolve.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that a further pay increase is enacted before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: The BMA has announced a five-day strike and rejected non-pay offers.**
    *   This shows high resolve and a focus on the core pay demand. This level of pressure is a necessary precondition for forcing a government concession.
    *   P(E | H) is high; P(E | ~H) is moderate.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1 (Increases probability).** This action is what you would expect to see if a deal were to be forced quickly.

*   **Evidence 2: The new Labour government has staked its reputation on "fixing the NHS."**
    *   Ongoing, high-profile strikes are politically toxic for a government with this core mission. This creates a powerful incentive to resolve the dispute swiftly.
    *   P(E | H) is high; P(E | ~H) is moderate (the government could try to tough it out, blaming the union).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1 (Increases probability).** The political pain is a strong motivator for the government to make a deal.

*   **Evidence 3: The resolution deadline is less than two months away.**
    *   Government machinery, especially involving Treasury approval for new spending, moves slowly. Enacting a new pay deal in this timeframe is exceptionally difficult.
    *   P(E | H) is low (it's hard to do this quickly); P(E | ~H) is high (running out of time is a very common reason for negotiations to fail).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).** This is the most powerful piece of evidence against the event occurring.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I begin with a prior of 65% (1.86-to-1 odds).

The first two pieces of evidence (BMA resolve, government's political need) confirm the conditions are ripe for a potential deal and push the probability up. They reinforce the prior.

However, the third piece of evidence—the timeline—is a powerful counter-argument. Let's model its impact. The odds of a deal being reached *and enacted* in under two months, even if one is eventually forthcoming, are low. Let's estimate the likelihood ratio for this time constraint is approximately 0.25 (i.e., it's four times more likely that a "no deal" outcome would be associated with this short timeline than a "deal" outcome).

*   **Prior Odds:** 1.86 to 1
*   **Update for timeline:** Posterior Odds = 1.86 × 0.25 = 0.465 to 1.

This single, powerful constraint flips the odds to be against the event. Converting back to a probability:
*   Posterior Probability = 0.465 / (1 + 0.465) ≈ 32%.

The other evidence (BMA resolve, political pressure) pushes this back up. Let's say their combined effect has a likelihood ratio of 2.0.
*   Final Odds = 0.465 * 2.0 = 0.93 to 1.
*   Final Probability = 0.93 / 1.93 ≈ 48%.

The final posterior is a close call, reflecting the tension between strong political pressure for a deal and the severe practical constraints of the timeline.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis hinges on the timeline being the decisive factor. Could I be wrong?

A plausible alternative is that the political crisis created by a 5-day winter strike is so severe for the new government that it overrides all normal bureaucratic processes. The Prime Minister could intervene directly, instruct the Treasury to find the money, and force a deal through in a matter of weeks. This "crisis response" scenario would make a "Yes" resolution much more likely. The government might see paying doctors more as a lesser evil than having their core "fix the NHS" pledge undermined by images of cancelled operations and picket lines just before Christmas.

This possibility suggests my calculated 48% might be slightly too low. The political will, if it is strong enough, can overcome bureaucratic inertia. I should adjust my forecast slightly upwards to account for this "crisis" pathway, which I believe is a significant possibility. However, the path to failure (running out of time, talks bogging down) remains the default and slightly more probable outcome.

### 6. Final Forecast
The historical base rate is high (65%), suggesting strikes are an effective tool for doctors. The political pressure on the new government to avoid a winter crisis is also immense, pushing for a "Yes" resolution. However, these factors are counteracted by the extremely tight deadline. Negotiating and formally enacting a new pay deal in under two months is a formidable challenge. The outcome is therefore highly uncertain. The path to "No" requires only for bureaucratic inertia and political disagreement to run out the clock, while the path to "Yes" requires a concerted and unusually rapid effort from the government. I place the probability just below the midpoint to reflect that the practical constraints are slightly more powerful than the political incentives.

Final: 47%
