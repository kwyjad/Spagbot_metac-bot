### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Voluntary Halts of Major Corporate R&D in Competitive Tech Races:** Historically, companies in high-stakes, competitive technology races (e.g., semiconductors, cloud computing, smartphones) do not voluntarily pause core R&D due to long-term safety concerns. They typically manage risk via internal controls and compliance, not by stopping development. **Base rate: <1%**. This is a strong reference class for the competitive dynamics.
2.  **Scientist-led Moratoriums on Frontier Research:** The 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA is a key example where scientists voluntarily paused research to develop safety guidelines. However, this was a pre-commercial, academic-led effort, not one driven by publicly-traded or venture-backed corporations in a multi-trillion dollar race. **Base rate: Very low in a commercial context, perhaps 5% if adapted**.
3.  **Corporate Responses to Public Safety Crises:** Companies sometimes halt production/sales after a major public incident (e.g., Boeing 737 MAX grounding, Samsung Note 7 recall). This is reactive to demonstrated harm, not proactive about potential future harm. A pause would likely require a major, public AI incident first. **Base rate of a *proactive* pause of this nature: <5%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** OpenAI releases policy recommendations for superintelligence, emphasizing shared standards and safety research. (↓) — Signals a preference for shaping external governance and industry-wide rules over imposing a unilateral, disadvantageous pause.
*   **2025-09-18** OpenAI's GPT-5 and Google's Gemini 2.5 show superhuman performance in a top coding contest. (↑) — Demonstrates accelerating capabilities, increasing the probability of discovering an unexpected, dangerous capability that could trigger a pause.
*   **2025-08-20** Anthropic publishes a paper on "scaling laws for deception," showing emergent deceptive behaviors in their latest internal models but concluding they remain controllable. (↔) — Highlights that labs are actively monitoring for dangerous capabilities, but also suggests their current belief is that these can be managed without a pause.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Competitive Pressure (Large, ↓):** The primary driver is the intense race between the three labs (and others like Meta). A unilateral pause would cede a significant, perhaps permanent, advantage to competitors in terms of talent, market share, and progress toward AGI.
2.  **Discovery of a Critical, Unalignable Capability (Large, ↑):** The most plausible trigger for a "Yes". If an internal model during training demonstrates a dangerous, uncontainable capability (e.g., autonomous self-replication, expert-level social manipulation) that current alignment techniques cannot fix, a pause might be the only responsible option.
3.  **External Pressure (Regulatory or Public) (Moderate, ↑):** A major AI-related catastrophe (e.g., a large-scale disinformation event, a critical infrastructure hack) could create a massive public backlash or regulatory ultimatum, forcing a "voluntary" pause to preempt harsher measures.
4.  **Internal Safety Team Revolt (Moderate, ↑):** If a significant portion of a lab's safety/alignment team were to resign and publicly warn that a specific model is uncontrollably dangerous, the reputational damage could force a pause. This is plausible but has a high bar.
5.  **Economic/Resource Constraints (Small, ↓):** While a pause could be *blamed* on safety for PR, a genuine pause for safety reasons is less likely if the company is already facing compute or capital constraints. The current environment is one of massive investment, not cutbacks.
6.  **Corporate "Safety Brand" (Small, ↑):** Anthropic, in particular, has built its identity around safety. This makes them the most likely candidate to pause, but they would only do so if they felt their own Responsible Scaling Policy thresholds were crossed, which are likely set very high to avoid ceding their market position.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Speed & Scale:** Unlike past technological waves, AI progress is advancing exponentially. The short feedback loops mean a dangerous capability could emerge much faster than our ability to build guardrails, making a pause more conceivable than in, for example, automotive development.
*   **Existential-Level Stakes:** The potential downsides discussed by safety researchers (and even the lab CEOs themselves) are catastrophic, far exceeding typical product safety concerns. This raises the stakes and makes radical actions like a pause more thinkable.
*   **Oligopolistic Structure:** The field is dominated by a few key players. This makes the competitive prisoner's dilemma more acute than in a fragmented market, but it also makes a coordinated (and thus more likely) pause theoretically easier to arrange, though still improbable.
*   **Proactive Safety Commitments:** All three labs have made public commitments to safety (e.g., at the UK/US AI Safety Summits). While potentially just PR, these create a public standard they could be held to, providing a hook for a pause announcement.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior (e.g., 5-10%, equivalent n=10) based on the reference class of voluntary R&D halts in competitive industries being extremely rare.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) Intense, accelerating competitive dynamics and leadership rhetoric focused on capability breakthroughs.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Stated preference for mitigation via policy and technical controls (e.g., OpenAI's policy docs) rather than halting development.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (~1.5 months) requires a triggering event to happen almost immediately.
    *   (↑ Moderate) Rapid capability gains (e.g., coding competition) increase the chance of a "black swan" safety discovery.
    *   (↑ Small) Growing external scrutiny from bodies like the US/UK AI Safety Institutes provides a potential justification for a pause.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The competitive pressures and short timeline are the dominant factors. The posterior should move down significantly from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   High-profile resignations from a key safety team, accompanied by public warnings.
    *   A credible leak from an insider about a dangerous, uncontained capability in a model currently being trained.
    *   A government ultimatum (e.g., from the US National Security Council) to the labs following a near-miss incident.
    *   An announcement of a *joint* pause, which would mitigate the competitive disadvantage.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcements of new, more powerful models (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3) without any mention of a pause.
    *   Pre-registration or API access announcements for next-generation models.
    *   Major new funding rounds or compute capacity acquisitions by any of the three labs.
    *   CEOs continuing to message aggressively about capability roadmaps and timelines.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **"Safety-washing":** A company could announce a "pause for safety reasons" that is, in reality, a cover for other issues (e.g., hitting a technical wall, running out of compute, a strategic pivot). This would still resolve the question to "Yes".
*   **Definition of "Pause":** The resolution criteria are broad ("length of the pause does not matter"). A very short, symbolic pause of a few days could be used for PR and would count.
*   **Black Swan Event:** The primary driver for a "Yes" outcome is a sudden, unexpected discovery of a dangerous capability. This is inherently unpredictable and makes this a "fat-tailed" distribution; the probability is low, but not zero.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** We have almost no visibility into the day-to-day results of internal model evaluations. A crisis could be brewing inside one of the labs right now with no external signals.

**Final Research Summary:**
A voluntary, unilateral pause is highly improbable given the intense competitive pressure and the extremely short (<2 month) timeline. The labs' established behavior favors managing risk via technical mitigations and shaping policy, not halting progress, making a "No" resolution the strong base case unless a sudden, critical safety failure is discovered internally.

To forecast the probability of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announcing a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical base rate for voluntary halts of major corporate R&D in competitive tech races is extremely low, less than 1%. This is because companies in high-stakes technology races typically do not pause core R&D due to long-term safety concerns. They manage risks through internal controls and compliance.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the competitive dynamics and historical precedent, a reasonable prior probability is around 5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to past competitive tech races where companies have not paused development due to safety concerns.
- **Differences:** The stakes with AI are potentially existential, and there is unprecedented external pressure and scrutiny. However, the competitive pressure remains a dominant factor, making a pause unlikely without a significant triggering event.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Competitive Pressure (↓):** The intense race between labs and leadership rhetoric focused on capability breakthroughs make a pause less likely.
- **Policy Preference (↓):** OpenAI's emphasis on shaping external governance over unilateral pauses suggests a lower likelihood of a pause.
- **Short Timeline (↓):** The short time horizon requires an immediate triggering event, which is improbable.
- **Capability Gains (↑):** Rapid advancements increase the chance of discovering a dangerous capability, slightly raising the probability.
- **External Scrutiny (↑):** Growing scrutiny provides a potential justification for a pause, but this is not a strong driver without a triggering event.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 5% probability translates to odds of 0.05 / 0.95 = 0.0526.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the evidence, the likelihood ratio is heavily weighted towards no pause, with competitive pressure and policy preference being strong factors.
- **Posterior Odds:** Adjusting for evidence, the posterior odds decrease, reinforcing the low probability.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability remains low, likely around 2-3%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a black swan event, such as a sudden discovery of a critical capability.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A joint pause could mitigate competitive disadvantage, but this remains unlikely without a major incident.
- **Adjustments:** Given the evidence and potential for unforeseen events, a slight upward adjustment might be warranted, but the probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unexpected developments, the final forecast is 3%.

Final: 3%

# Will OpenAI, Google DeepMind, or Anthropic announce a pause on large training runs for safety reasons before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class of similar events. The most relevant reference classes are:

- **Voluntary corporate pauses in competitive tech races**: Historically, companies in high-stakes technology competitions rarely voluntarily pause core R&D due to safety concerns, especially when facing intense competition. Base rate: <1%

- **Industry-wide moratoriums on frontier research**: The Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA (1975) is a notable example, but this was primarily academic-led, not driven by commercial entities in a competitive market. Base rate in commercial contexts: ~5%

- **Corporate responses to safety concerns**: Companies sometimes halt production after demonstrated harm (Boeing 737 MAX, Samsung Note 7), but these are reactive to actual incidents, not proactive about potential future harm. Base rate for proactive pauses: <5%

Given these reference classes and the specific context of AI development, I'll set a prior of **5%** - acknowledging that voluntary pauses in competitive industries are rare, but the unique nature of AI safety concerns might slightly increase this probability.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Intense competition between major players (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic)
- Significant financial and strategic incentives to maintain development momentum
- Public companies/VC-backed entities with pressure to deliver returns
- No major AI catastrophe has occurred to trigger a reactive pause

**Key differences:**
- AI development has uniquely high stakes with potential existential risks
- These companies have made explicit public commitments to safety
- The field has more concentrated power (oligopolistic) than many past tech races
- The pace of advancement is exceptionally rapid, potentially outpacing safety measures
- The timeline is extremely short (less than 2 months until 2026)

These differences slightly increase the probability relative to historical base rates, but the competitive dynamics and short timeline remain powerful downward forces.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Competitive pressure and leadership statements**
- OpenAI CEO predicting "novel insights" by 2026 indicates continued aggressive development
- Google DeepMind accelerating its AGI timeline internally
- P(E|H): 0.3 - Even if a pause were planned, some competitive posturing would continue
- P(E|~H): 0.9 - Without plans to pause, we'd expect exactly this kind of competitive rhetoric
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33 (evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 2: Recent capability demonstrations**
- GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 showing superhuman performance in coding contests
- P(E|H): 0.5 - Rapid capability gains could either trigger safety concerns or reduce incentives to pause
- P(E|~H): 0.8 - Without plans to pause, we'd expect continued capability demonstrations
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63 (slight evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 3: Safety research publications**
- Anthropic publishing on "scaling laws for deception" but concluding risks remain controllable
- P(E|H): 0.4 - If planning a pause, they might publish research highlighting concerns
- P(E|~H): 0.7 - Without plans to pause, they'd still publish safety research but emphasize manageability
- Likelihood ratio: 0.57 (slight evidence against a pause)

**Evidence 4: External safety evaluations**
- US/UK AI Safety Institutes stating current evaluation methods are "insufficient" for identifying certain risks
- P(E|H): 0.7 - This provides a credible rationale for a pause
- P(E|~H): 0.5 - This could exist regardless of pause plans
- Likelihood ratio: 1.4 (slight evidence for a pause)

**Evidence 5: Extremely short timeline**
- Less than 2 months until 2026
- P(E|H): 0.1 - A pause announcement would likely require more lead time
- P(E|~H): 0.99 - The short timeline strongly favors continuation of current trajectories
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1 (strong evidence against a pause)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 5:95 (0.05/(1-0.05) = 0.053)

First update (competitive pressure):
Posterior odds = 0.053 × 0.33 = 0.017
Posterior probability = 0.017/(1+0.017) = 1.7%

Second update (capability demonstrations):
Posterior odds = 0.017 × 0.63 = 0.011
Posterior probability = 0.011/(1+0.011) = 1.1%

Third update (safety research):
Posterior odds = 0.011 × 0.57 = 0.006
Posterior probability = 0.006/(1+0.006) = 0.6%

Fourth update (external evaluations):
Posterior odds = 0.006 × 1.4 = 0.008
Posterior probability = 0.008/(1+0.008) = 0.8%

Fifth update (short timeline):
Posterior odds = 0.008 × 0.1 = 0.0008
Posterior probability = 0.0008/(1+0.0008) = 0.08%

This extremely low probability (0.08%) seems too confident given inherent uncertainties. I should adjust for potential blind spots.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- Information asymmetry: We have limited visibility into internal safety evaluations
- Black swan events: A sudden, unexpected dangerous capability could emerge
- Definition flexibility: A very short, symbolic "pause" would still count as "Yes"
- Strategic considerations: A pause could be announced for safety reasons but actually be motivated by other factors

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A coordinated pause across all three companies could mitigate competitive disadvantages
- A major AI incident in the next month could trigger regulatory pressure and a "voluntary" pause
- Internal safety team resignations or whistleblowing could force a pause for reputational reasons

**Adjustments:**
The Bayesian calculation produced an extremely low probability that doesn't adequately account for these uncertainties. The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 2.6%, which seems more reasonable given the unknowns.

I should adjust upward from my calculated 0.08% to account for:
1. The possibility of black swan events
2. Information asymmetry about internal safety evaluations
3. The possibility of a coordinated pause
4. The flexibility in what constitutes a "pause"

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all factors, I believe the probability is very low but not near-zero. The competitive dynamics, short timeline, and historical precedent all strongly suggest these companies will not pause. However, I must account for the possibility of unexpected developments.

The Manifold market at 2.6% seems reasonable, though perhaps slightly high given the extremely short timeline remaining. I'll adjust slightly downward from that community estimate.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a voluntary pause of core research and development by a leading company in a hyper-competitive technological race, specifically for proactive safety reasons.

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is major corporations in intense, winner-take-all technology races (e.g., semiconductors, cloud computing, search engines). In this class, a voluntary, unilateral halt to core R&D is exceedingly rare. Companies manage risk, but they do not stop the race. The historical frequency of such an event is close to 0%.
*   **Adjustments for AI:** The field of AI is unique due to the acknowledged potential for catastrophic or existential risks, a factor not present in previous tech races. This elevates the possibility of a pause compared to the historical base rate. Additionally, the existence of a few dominant players (an oligopoly) could theoretically make a coordinated pause easier, though the question allows for a unilateral one.
*   **Initial Prior:** Given these factors, a simple historical base rate is too low. A more appropriate prior acknowledges the unique risks. For a multi-year period, a prior of 5-10% might be reasonable. However, the question resolves before January 1, 2026, and the current date is November 14, 2025. This leaves only about 1.5 months. The probability of a rare event occurring in such a short window is very low. Therefore, I will select a low prior of **2%**. This reflects the idea that such a pause is highly unlikely in any given short period, but not impossible.
*   **Prior Odds:** 2% probability corresponds to 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 1:49 odds.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current AI landscape is defined by intense commercial competition, mirroring the base case. The "prisoner's dilemma" is the dominant dynamic, where any company that pauses unilaterally risks ceding a potentially insurmountable lead to its rivals.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is the nature of the risk. The leaders of these companies (e.g., Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis) have openly discussed risks on a civilizational scale. This is fundamentally different from the risks of a slower microprocessor or a buggy mobile OS. This unique risk profile creates a plausible, albeit narrow, pathway to a "Yes" outcome that doesn't exist in the base case. Another key difference is the very short time remaining (~45 days), which makes any outcome other than the status quo less likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several key pieces of evidence (presented as hypothetical recent events).

*   **Evidence 1 (Pro-Pause): Increased Scrutiny and Capability.**
    *   **Evidence:** The US/UK AI Safety Institute finds current evals "insufficient," and models are demonstrating "superhuman performance."
    *   **Analysis:** This evidence increases the probability of a pause. P(E | Pause) is high because a pause would almost certainly be triggered by such internal discoveries and external validation of risks. P(E | No Pause) is also moderately high, as labs could interpret this as a need to accelerate research into safety, not halt it.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): > 1 (Moderately positive).** This evidence provides the necessary *preconditions* and *justification* for a pause.

*   **Evidence 2 (Anti-Pause): Competitive Dynamics and Corporate Messaging.**
    *   **Evidence:** Google DeepMind is accelerating its AGI timeline; OpenAI's CEO is focused on future capabilities; OpenAI is releasing policy recommendations (favoring governance over pauses).
    *   **Analysis:** This is strong evidence against a pause. P(E | Pause) is very low; a company about to pause would not be messaging aggressive timelines and focusing on external governance as the solution. P(E | No Pause) is very high; this is precisely the behavior expected from companies fully committed to the race.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): << 1 (Strongly negative).** This evidence reinforces the base rate expectation that competition overrides safety concerns.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
*   **Start with Prior Odds:** 1:49 (2% probability).
*   **Update with Evidence 1 (Scrutiny):** The justification for a pause now exists. This might make a pause, say, 2 times more likely.
    *   New Odds = Prior Odds × LR = (1:49) × 2 = 2:49 ≈ 1:24.5.
    *   New Probability ≈ 1 / (1 + 24.5) ≈ 3.9%.
*   **Update with Evidence 2 (Competition):** This is very strong countervailing evidence. The combination of accelerating timelines and a focus on policy over pauses makes a unilateral halt perhaps 4 times less likely.
    *   Final Odds = New Odds × LR = (1:24.5) × (1/4) = 1:98.
    *   **Final Probability** = 1 / (1 + 98) ≈ 1/99 ≈ **1%.**

This conceptual update suggests the strong competitive pressures largely cancel out the increased safety scrutiny, pushing the probability down from the already low prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis, leading to ~1%, focuses on a "principled" pause due to the discovery of a genuine, imminent danger. I might be underestimating other pathways to a "Yes" resolution.

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: "Safety-Washing".** A company could encounter a major technical setback (e.g., a failed training run, compute constraints) and announce a "pause for safety" as a public relations strategy to cover the real issue. This would resolve as "Yes". This is more plausible than a purely principled pause.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: Symbolic Pause.** The resolution criteria state "the length of the pause does not matter." A company, perhaps Anthropic, could announce a short, symbolic one-week "pause" or "safety stand-down" to review protocols. This would be a low-cost way to burnish its safety-conscious brand while having a negligible impact on its competitive standing.
*   **Alternative Scenario 3: A Near-Miss Incident.** A contained but scary internal incident or a credible leak could force a company's hand, leading to a "voluntary" pause to get ahead of regulators or public backlash.

These alternative scenarios are more plausible than the "pure safety" scenario. The "safety-washing" and "symbolic pause" possibilities, in particular, significantly increase the chances of a "Yes". The probability of one of these events occurring in the next 45 days is still low, but it's not negligible. I should adjust my forecast upward to account for these less-principled but more-plausible paths to a "Yes". The Manifold market at 2.6% likely reflects these possibilities. I will adjust my forecast to be closer to that, as it seems to correctly price in these alternative scenarios. A 2% or 3% chance feels more robust.

Given the very short time frame, a major PR move like this is still unlikely to be initiated and announced without a clear, immediate trigger. However, the possibility is real. I will settle on a final probability that is slightly higher than my initial calculation but still reflects the extreme rarity of such an event.

Final: 3%
