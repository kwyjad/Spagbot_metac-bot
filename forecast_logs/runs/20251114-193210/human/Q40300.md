### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Unilateral US military strikes in a new country without government consent:** This is the tightest reference class. Since the end of the Cold War, the US has initiated overt, unilateral military action in a new country where it did not have at least tacit consent or an invitation from a recognized government entity very rarely. Examples include the 1993 strikes on Iraq, the 1998 strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan, and the 2018 strikes in Syria (though a civil war context complicates this). This is a rare event, occurring perhaps once every 5-10 years across the entire globe. The base rate for a specific country like Nigeria in any given year is extremely low, likely **<1%**.
2.  **US counter-terrorism (CT) operations in Africa:** The US has conducted numerous CT operations in Africa, primarily via AFRICOM. These have included drone strikes and special forces raids in Somalia, Libya, and the Sahel. However, these actions are almost always conducted with some level of host-nation cooperation (even if not publicly acknowledged) or in failed/ungoverned states. Initiating such a strike in a major, functioning regional power like Nigeria would be a significant departure. The base rate for a *new* country being added to this list is low, perhaps **2-3% per year**.
3.  **Presidential military threats followed by action:** US presidents often use the threat of military force as a diplomatic tool. The follow-through rate varies significantly based on the president and the strategic context. President Trump, during his first term, was known for aggressive rhetoric but was often more cautious about committing to new, large-scale military entanglements. However, he authorized targeted strikes, such as the one that killed Qasem Soleimani. The base rate of a specific, public threat like this being acted upon within months is difficult to calculate but is likely well under 50%, perhaps in the **10-20% range**, as threats are cheaper than action.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-06** BNN and other outlets report on escalating violence, citing over 7,000 Christians killed in 2025. — **↑** — Provides the *casus belli* and public justification for potential US action, framing it as a humanitarian/religious freedom issue.
*   **2025-11-01** CNN reports President Trump has ordered the DoD to ‘prepare for possible action’ in Nigeria. — **↑ (Large)** — Moves the situation from rhetoric to operational planning. This is a significant and concrete step toward military action.
*   **2025-11-01** Trump posts on Truth Social, threatening to go into Nigeria “guns-a-blazing” to stop the killing of Christians. — **↑ (Large)** — A direct, public, and personal threat from the Commander-in-Chief. This stakes his credibility on the issue and makes it harder to back down without a clear "win."
*   **2025-10-20** A question is submitted to the European Parliament highlighting systematic violence against Nigerian Christians. — **↑ (Small)** — Demonstrates that the issue has traction among Western political bodies, providing a thin layer of potential international justification.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Credibility & Style:** President Trump has made a direct, public threat. Having been accused of "all talk" in the past, he may feel compelled to act to maintain credibility with his base and on the world stage. His decision-making style is less constrained by institutional norms. (Size: Large)
2.  **Domestic Political Calculus:** The framing of the issue—protecting Christians from Islamic extremists—resonates strongly with a key part of Trump's evangelical base. An intervention, even a limited one, could be a significant political victory for him with this constituency. (Size: Moderate)
3.  **Pentagon/State Department Resistance:** A unilateral strike on Nigeria, a major regional power and partner in other CT efforts, would be viewed as extremely destabilizing by the US foreign policy and military establishment. They would likely counsel restraint, highlighting risks to regional stability, US personnel, and long-term strategic goals. (Size: Large)
4.  **Nigerian Diplomatic/Military Response:** Nigeria is not a passive actor. It could de-escalate the crisis by publicly launching a major new offensive against the responsible groups, arresting key perpetrators, or engaging in high-level diplomacy with the US to offer security guarantees. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Operational Feasibility:** The US (via AFRICOM) has the capability to conduct limited, standoff strikes (e.g., drones, cruise missiles) or special operations raids in Nigeria. The logistical and technical barriers to a limited attack are low. This is an enabler, not a driver, but it makes the threat credible. (Size: Small)
6.  **International Reaction:** A unilateral US attack would be widely condemned by the African Union, ECOWAS, and likely European allies, isolating the US. This diplomatic cost would be a significant deterrent for the State Department, though it may be less of a concern for President Trump. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Target Country Status:** Unlike typical targets of unilateral US strikes (e.g., Somalia, Yemen, Syria), Nigeria is a major, sovereign regional power with a functioning government and military. It is not a failed state or an internationally isolated pariah.
*   **Presidential Actor:** President Trump's foreign policy is characterized by a higher degree of unpredictability and a willingness to bypass traditional bureaucratic and diplomatic processes, making this low-probability event more plausible than under a more conventional administration.
*   **Public Threat Specificity:** The threat is not a vague "all options are on the table." It is a specific, public, and personal threat ("guns-a-blazing") tied to a single issue (killing of Christians), creating a clear red line.
*   **Compressed Timeline:** The threat was made in early November 2025, with a resolution date of January 1, 2026. This leaves very little time for diplomacy or for the issue to fade from the news cycle, increasing pressure for a decision.
*   **Explicit Justification:** The rationale is explicitly religious/humanitarian, rather than the more common justifications of direct threats to US national security (e.g., WMDs, direct terrorist plots against the US).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (<5%) based on the reference class of the US launching a new, unilateral military operation against a major regional power without its consent. (Equivalent n: ~50-100, with 1 success).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Large):** The President's direct order to the DoD to "prepare" and his specific, public threat on social media are extremely strong signals of intent that overwhelm the base rate.
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The strong domestic political appeal to a key constituency provides a clear motive for the President to follow through.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The immense diplomatic and strategic costs of attacking a major regional partner create powerful institutional resistance within the US government (DoD, State).
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The likelihood of a Nigerian de-escalatory response (diplomatic or military) to avert a US strike is a significant off-ramp.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence dramatically increases the probability from the very low prior. The direct presidential threat is the key factor. While powerful constraints remain, the President's known tendencies make this a live possibility. The posterior should move significantly upward, landing in a range of considerable uncertainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Movement of US military assets (e.g., naval groups, special operations forces, ISR platforms) toward the region.
    *   State Department issuing travel warnings or evacuation orders for US citizens in Nigeria.
    *   Leaks from the Pentagon detailing specific target sets (e.g., Boko Haram/ISWAP training camps).
    *   A high-profile atrocity against Christians in Nigeria that generates significant US media coverage.
    *   Breakdown of high-level diplomatic communication between the US and Nigeria.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Announcements of high-level talks between US and Nigerian officials (e.g., Secretary of State/Defense).
    *   The Nigerian military launching a new, credible, and well-publicized offensive against extremist groups in the north.
    *   Statements from senior US military leaders (e.g., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs) emphasizing the complexity and risks of intervention.
    *   President Trump's attention shifting to a different domestic or international crisis.
    *   A joint statement from the US and Nigeria announcing new cooperation on counter-terrorism.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** What constitutes a "military attack"? A drone strike or a small special forces raid would count, but a covert intelligence operation or a cyber-attack might not, depending on interpretation. The resolution criteria is broad.
*   **Rhetoric vs. Reality:** The President's statements could be a negotiating tactic to force the Nigerian government to act, with no real intention of a strike. The threat itself may be the primary tool.
*   **Covert Action:** A US military action could occur but be kept secret (i.e., remain unacknowledged). This would not trigger a "Yes" resolution if it does not become public knowledge before the deadline.
*   **Nigerian Sovereignty:** An uninvited US attack would be an act of war. The potential for escalation, including retaliation against US interests or citizens in the region, is a major, unquantifiable risk that weighs against action.
*   **Information Reliability:** Initial reports of atrocities can be exaggerated or manipulated by various actors for political purposes. The US intelligence assessment of the situation on the ground will be a critical, but unseen, factor.

**Final Research Summary:** The probability of a US military attack in Nigeria before 2026 has shifted from near-zero to a highly uncertain but plausible scenario due to a direct, public threat from a President known for unconventional actions. The core conflict is between this specific presidential threat and the powerful, systemic diplomatic and strategic constraints against attacking a major regional partner.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most appropriate base rate is the likelihood of the US initiating a new, unilateral military operation in a country without its government's consent. Historically, this is a rare event, occurring perhaps once every 5-10 years globally. For a specific country like Nigeria, the base rate is extremely low, likely less than 1% per year. Given the time frame until 2026, we might consider a slightly higher base rate due to the compressed timeline, but still under 5%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The situation involves a potential unilateral military action without the host nation's consent, aligning with the base case.
   - Differences: Nigeria is a major regional power with a functioning government, unlike typical targets of such actions. The current US administration under President Trump is more unpredictable and has made specific threats, which is unusual compared to historical precedents.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Presidential Order to DoD**: The order to prepare for possible action is a strong indicator of intent, significantly increasing the likelihood of an attack (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - **Public Threat on Social Media**: A direct threat from the President increases the probability, as it stakes his credibility (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - **Domestic Political Calculus**: The issue resonates with Trump's base, providing motivation for action (Likelihood ratio > 1).
   - **Pentagon/State Department Resistance**: Strong institutional resistance decreases the probability (Likelihood ratio < 1).
   - **Nigerian Diplomatic/Military Response**: Potential de-escalation by Nigeria could reduce the likelihood (Likelihood ratio < 1).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior of around 5%, the strong evidence of intent (Presidential order and public threat) increases the probability significantly. However, the institutional resistance and potential diplomatic solutions act as counterweights.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (considering both increasing and decreasing factors).
   - Given the strong signals of intent but also significant constraints, the posterior probability might increase to a range of 20-30%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from overestimating the President's willingness to bypass institutional norms. The best alternative forecast might emphasize the diplomatic and strategic costs, suggesting a lower probability.
   - Consideration of covert actions or diplomatic resolutions that might not be publicized could also affect the outcome.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Balancing the strong signals of intent with the significant institutional and diplomatic constraints, the final calibrated probability is:

Final: 25%

# Will the United States conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before January 1, 2026 (approximately 6-7 weeks from now).

The most relevant reference class is **unilateral US military strikes in a new country without government consent**. Since the end of the Cold War, such actions have been rare, occurring perhaps once every 5-10 years globally (examples include Iraq 1993, Afghanistan/Sudan 1998, Syria 2018).

For a specific country like Nigeria in a short timeframe (6-7 weeks), the base rate would be extremely low, likely **<1%**. However, given the explicit presidential threat and order to prepare, I should consider a more specific reference class: **presidential military threats followed by action**. This has a higher base rate, perhaps in the **10-20% range**.

Given the unusual specificity of the threat and the short timeframe, I'll use a prior of **15%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The US has military capabilities to conduct strikes globally
- The stated justification (protecting a vulnerable group) aligns with past US interventions
- The US has conducted counter-terrorism operations in Africa before

**Key differences:**
- Nigeria is a major regional power with a functioning government, unlike typical targets of unilateral US strikes (failed states or pariah regimes)
- President Trump's foreign policy is characterized by higher unpredictability and willingness to bypass traditional processes
- The threat is unusually specific and public ("guns-a-blazing"), creating a clear red line
- The compressed timeline (6-7 weeks until resolution) leaves little room for diplomatic solutions
- The explicitly religious justification (protecting Christians) is unusual for US military interventions

These differences significantly increase the probability above the typical base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Trump ordered DoD to "prepare for possible action"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US were going to attack, such preparation would almost certainly occur
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Preparations could be ordered as a threat without intent to follow through
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Trump's public threat on Truth Social**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - A public threat would likely precede actual military action
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.4) - Trump has made threats without follow-through before
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
- This increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Reports of escalating violence against Christians**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Such reports provide justification for military action
- P(E|~H): High (~0.7) - Such reports exist regardless of US intent to act
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.1
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Nigeria's status as a sovereign regional power**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - The US rarely attacks functioning states with strong governments
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Most countries the US doesn't attack are functioning states
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 5: Short timeframe (6-7 weeks)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Military actions can be executed quickly
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Most threats don't materialize in such a short timeframe
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.63
- This moderately decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with my prior of 15% (odds of 0.176):

First update (Trump ordered DoD preparation):
- Prior odds: 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 3.0 = 0.528
- Posterior probability: 0.528/(1+0.528) = 34.6%

Second update (Trump's public threat):
- Prior odds: 0.528
- Likelihood ratio: 2.4
- Posterior odds: 0.528 × 2.4 = 1.267
- Posterior probability: 1.267/(1+1.267) = 55.9%

Third update (Reports of violence):
- Prior odds: 1.267
- Likelihood ratio: 1.1
- Posterior odds: 1.267 × 1.1 = 1.394
- Posterior probability: 1.394/(1+1.394) = 58.2%

Fourth update (Nigeria's status):
- Prior odds: 1.394
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- Posterior odds: 1.394 × 0.25 = 0.349
- Posterior probability: 0.349/(1+0.349) = 25.9%

Fifth update (Short timeframe):
- Prior odds: 0.349
- Likelihood ratio: 0.63
- Posterior odds: 0.349 × 0.63 = 0.220
- Posterior probability: 0.220/(1+0.220) = 18.0%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the institutional resistance within the US government to attacking a major African partner
- I might be overweighting the significance of Trump's rhetoric, which often exceeds his actions
- I haven't fully accounted for Nigeria's likely diplomatic response to defuse the situation
- The resolution criteria requires an attack before January 1, 2026, which is a very short window

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The threat could be primarily a negotiating tactic to pressure Nigeria into stronger action against extremists
- A covert operation might occur but remain unacknowledged, which wouldn't resolve as "Yes"
- Nigeria might launch a major offensive against extremist groups, removing the justification for US action
- Trump's attention could shift to other crises before any action is taken

**Best alternative forecast:**
A much lower probability (5-10%) could be justified by emphasizing the enormous diplomatic costs of attacking Nigeria and the historical rarity of such actions. However, this underweights the unusual specificity of Trump's threat and his unconventional decision-making style.

A much higher probability (40-50%) could be justified by emphasizing Trump's need to maintain credibility with his base and his history of occasional surprising military actions (like the Soleimani strike). However, this overweights rhetoric and underweights institutional constraints.

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to 16% to account for the extremely short timeframe and the strong institutional resistance likely to emerge.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 16%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is the frequency of the United States initiating a new, overt military attack in a sovereign country without that country's consent or invitation. Historically, this is an extremely rare event. Since the end of the Cold War, such actions have occurred perhaps once every 5-10 years across the entire globe (e.g., strikes on Iraq, Sudan, Syria). For any single country, like Nigeria, in a given year, the probability is exceptionally low.

Furthermore, Nigeria is not a failed state or an international pariah; it is a major regional power and a partner in some counter-terrorism efforts. A unilateral strike against such a nation is even rarer. Therefore, a reasonable prior probability P(H) for a US attack on Nigeria in any given year, absent specific threats, is very low.

*   **Prior Probability (P(H)): 1%**. This reflects the extreme rarity of this type of event.
*   **Prior Odds:** 1:99.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The US possesses the military capability (via AFRICOM) to conduct limited strikes. The targets would likely be internationally recognized terrorist groups (Boko Haram/ISWAP), which fits a pattern of US counter-terrorism operations.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Target Nation Status:** Unlike typical targets (e.g., Syria, Somalia, or non-state actors in Afghanistan), Nigeria is a major, sovereign regional power. Attacking it would incur immense diplomatic and strategic costs, risking the destabilization of a nation of over 200 million people and alienating the African Union. This makes an attack much less likely than in a typical counter-terrorism scenario.
    *   **Presidential Actor:** The threats originate from President Donald Trump, whose foreign policy has been characterized by greater unpredictability, a willingness to challenge institutional norms, and a focus on his domestic political base. This specific variable significantly increases the likelihood of an unconventional action compared to a baseline administration.
    *   **Public Threat:** The threat is not a vague diplomatic warning but a specific, public, and personal vow ("guns-a-blazing"). This puts the President's personal credibility on the line, making it more difficult to back down without a clear "win."

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The primary evidence is the combination of President Trump's public statements and his directive to the Pentagon.

*   **Evidence (E):** A direct public threat from the US President combined with an order to the DoD to "prepare for possible action."
*   **Likelihood if the event happens (P(E | H)):** If the US were to conduct an attack, it is virtually certain that it would be preceded by presidential threats and military preparations. Thus, P(E | H) is very high, close to 1.
*   **Likelihood if the event does not happen (P(E | ~H)):** If the US does not attack, could these events still have occurred? Yes. Such actions are a classic tool of coercive diplomacy, intended to force the target nation (Nigeria) to act, thereby allowing the President to claim a victory without firing a shot. However, a formal order to "prepare" is a more concrete step than mere rhetoric. The probability of making such a specific threat and order as a pure bluff is significant, but not certain. Let's estimate P(E | ~H) at around 0.20 (a 20% chance).
*   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)):** Approximately 1 / 0.20 = 5. This is a powerful piece of evidence that substantially increases the probability of an attack.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

We can update our prior odds using the likelihood ratio from the key evidence.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:99
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** 5
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio** = (1:99) × 5 = 5:99
*   **Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)** = 5 / (5 + 99) = 5 / 104 ≈ 4.8%

This initial mathematical update seems too low. The qualitative factors, particularly the President's specific personality and the strong domestic political motivation (appealing to his evangelical base), suggest the likelihood ratio might be even stronger. The combination of a specific casus belli (protecting Christians), a direct order, and a public threat from this particular president is a potent mix that the simple base rate update may not fully capture.

Let's reconsider the update, treating the evidence as exceptionally strong. A likelihood ratio of 10 might be more appropriate.
*   **Posterior Odds** = (1:99) x 10 = 10:99
*   **Posterior Probability** = 10 / (10+99) = 10/109 ≈ 9.2%

This is still feels low. Let's integrate the powerful countervailing factors. The primary reason not to attack is the immense strategic cost and the high likelihood that Nigeria will provide a diplomatic "off-ramp" (e.g., by announcing a major new offensive against the groups in question, allowing Trump to claim his threat worked). The institutional resistance from the State Department and Pentagon, who would be acutely aware of the risks, is another major brake on action.

The core of the forecast is the tension between Trump's personal credibility and political calculus versus the immense strategic and diplomatic costs. The latter forces are very strong, but the former have proven capable of overriding them in the past (e.g., the strike on Qasem Soleimani). A limited drone strike is the most plausible action, as it minimizes US risk and can be narrowly justified.

Balancing these factors, the probability moves from nearly impossible (1%) to the realm of significant possibility. The initial update to ~9% seems like a floor. The unique presidential factor and the domestic political drivers likely push the probability higher, into the high teens or low twenties.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of ~20% could be wrong for several reasons.
*   **It might be too high:** I could be over-reading Trump's rhetoric. It may be pure political theater or a negotiating tactic with no real intent to act. The institutional "guardrails" of the Pentagon and State Department might be far stronger than I'm assessing, making a strike on a partner nation like Nigeria a virtual impossibility, regardless of presidential statements. The most probable outcome is that Nigeria takes some action, and Trump declares victory.
*   **It might be too low:** I could be underestimating Trump's commitment to this issue and his willingness to take high-risk actions to satisfy his base and project strength. If another high-profile atrocity occurs in Nigeria before the end of the year, the political pressure could make an attack almost unavoidable for him. The precedent of the Soleimani strike shows he is willing to authorize high-risk, targeted operations against the advice of some advisors.

Considering these points, the 20% figure attempts to balance these competing possibilities. It correctly frames an attack as the less likely outcome, but assigns a substantial, one-in-five chance to account for the volatile and unusual circumstances.

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for such an attack is extremely low (<1%). However, the direct and public threats from President Trump, combined with a formal order to the DoD to prepare for action, represent exceptionally strong evidence of intent. This dramatically increases the probability. The primary constraints are the severe diplomatic and strategic consequences of attacking a major regional partner and the high likelihood that Nigeria will offer a diplomatic off-ramp. Balancing the President's personal credibility and political motivations against these powerful constraints, the event remains unlikely but has become a distinct possibility.

Final: 20%
