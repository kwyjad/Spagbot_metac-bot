### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Long-Term Trend (2010-2024):** The admit rate has shown a consistent and strong secular decline. The rate was 9.3% for the Class of 2010, falling to 4.5% for the Class of 2024 (the last pre-COVID, test-required class). A simple linear extrapolation of this trend would suggest a rate between 3.0% and 4.0%. This class reflects the general increase in application volume to elite universities driven by demographic growth, the ease of the Common Application, and increased global interest.
2.  **Test-Optional Era (Classes 2025-2028):** The pandemic-induced shift to test-optional policies created a new regime. Applications surged by over 40% in the first year, driving the admit rate to an all-time low of 3.19% for the Class of 2026. The average rate in this four-year period was **3.55%**. This reference class is relevant for its recency but is defined by a key policy (test-optional) that is no longer in effect.
3.  **Peer Institutions (Ivy+, Stanford, MIT):** In the most recent cycle (Class of 2028), admit rates for this group ranged from Columbia's 3.85% to Cornell's ~10%. Most top-tier peers (e.g., Yale, Princeton, Stanford) were in the 3.5%-4.5% range. This suggests a competitive equilibrium, with Harvard typically being among the most selective. This class provides a strong cross-sectional baseline, suggesting a rate in the **3.5% to 4.0%** range is plausible.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2023-06-29** SFFA v. Harvard SCOTUS ruling bans race-conscious admissions. — **(↑/↓ uncertain)** — Created uncertainty in admissions, potentially deterring some URM applicants (↓ applicants, ↑ rate) but also signaling a "fairer" process to others (↑ applicants, ↓ rate).
*   **2024-03-28** Class of 2028 results released, the first post-SCOTUS. — **↑** — Admit rate rose to 3.59% from 3.41% the prior year. This was driven by a 5% drop in applications, suggesting the post-COVID application peak was already waning.
*   **2024-04-11** Harvard reinstates standardized test requirement for Class of 2029. — **↑↑** — This is the most significant recent event. It raises the barrier to apply, strongly suggesting a decrease in the applicant pool (denominator), which would increase the admit rate.
*   **2024-10-31** Common Application reports a 4% year-over-year increase in total applicants nationally for the 2024-25 cycle. — **↓** — While a national trend, this suggests overall application interest remains high, potentially counteracting some of the expected drop from test reinstatement at Harvard specifically.
*   **2024-11-01** Harvard's Restrictive Early Action application deadline passes. — **(indicator)** — The number of early applicants is a key leading indicator for the total pool size. This data is not yet public but is the most important unknown variable.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Number of Applicants (Denominator):** The primary driver of year-to-year volatility.
    *   **Standardized Test Policy:** Reinstating the SAT/ACT requirement is the largest lever. It will likely reduce the number of "aspirational" or less-prepared applicants. (Large effect size)
    *   **Public Perception:** Ongoing controversies regarding campus speech, antisemitism, and leadership could deter some potential applicants and their families. (Small to Moderate effect size)
    *   **Recruitment & Outreach:** Post-SCOTUS, Harvard has emphasized new outreach programs to maintain diversity. Success here could bolster application numbers from targeted groups. (Small to Moderate effect size)
2.  **Number of Admitted Students (Numerator):** This is a policy choice driven by target class size and expected yield.
    *   **Target Class Size:** Harvard's target first-year class size is remarkably stable, hovering around 1,650. This anchors the numerator. (Very small effect size)
    *   **Yield Projections:** The admissions office admits more students than the target size, based on the predicted percentage who will enroll (yield). If they expect lower yield due to reputational damage or increased competition, they might admit slightly more students, pushing the rate up. (Small effect size)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Policy Reversal on Testing:** This cycle marks a sharp break from the four-year "Test-Optional Era" base rate. We are reverting to a pre-2020 policy environment but in a post-2020 world, making direct comparisons to either period difficult.
*   **Post-Affirmative Action Environment:** This is only the second admissions cycle since the SCOTUS ruling. The strategies for building a diverse class without considering race are new and their effect on application and admission patterns is still uncertain.
*   **Heightened Reputational Scrutiny:** Unlike in most prior years, Harvard has faced sustained, negative national media attention over the past year, which may impact applicant choices in a way not captured by historical data.
*   **Increased Competition on Testing Policy:** In prior test-required eras, nearly all peers had the same policy. Now, some peers (e.g., Cornell, Penn) remain test-optional or test-flexible, which could siphon some applicants away from Harvard.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior could be centered on the Class of 2028 result of **3.59%**, with an equivalent n reflecting moderate confidence based on the last few years (e.g., n=20). This acknowledges the recent uptick but is still anchored in the highly selective modern era.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑↑ (Large):** Reinstatement of standardized testing requirements will almost certainly shrink the applicant pool, pushing the rate up significantly.
    *   **↑ (Small):** Potential for reputational damage and lower yield could lead to a slightly larger number of admission offers to secure the target class size.
    *   **↓ (Small):** National application trends (per Common App) are up, which may provide a modest tailwind to Harvard's numbers, partially offsetting other effects.
    *   **↑/↓ (Uncertain):** The net effect of the post-SCOTUS landscape is still unclear; it could be a wash.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly points upward. The posterior should shift significantly higher than the 3.59% prior, likely into the 3.8% to 4.2% range. The magnitude of the "test reinstatement" effect is the key uncertainty.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (rate increases):**
    *   Press release or leak indicating a year-over-year drop in Early Action applications.
    *   Peer institutions that also reinstated testing (e.g., Yale, Dartmouth) reporting significant drops in their applicant pools.
    *   Commentary from admissions deans highlighting a smaller, but stronger, applicant pool.
    *   Harvard announcing a slightly larger number of admitted students to hedge against potentially lower yield.
*   **DOWN indicators (rate decreases):**
    *   Reports of surprisingly strong Early Action numbers, suggesting the testing effect was smaller than anticipated.
    *   Strong overall Regular Decision numbers reported by the Common Application in January 2025.
    *   Peer institutions that remained test-optional reporting massive application increases, suggesting a flight from schools with test requirements was minimal.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Elasticity Uncertainty:** The primary uncertainty is the elasticity of application volume to the test requirement. There is no modern precedent for a school like Harvard reinstating a test requirement after a multi-year optional period.
*   **Numerator Stability:** The forecast assumes a stable target class size (~1,650) and thus a stable number of admitted students (~1,950). A surprise decision to expand or shrink the class would significantly alter the rate.
*   **Self-Correction by Applicants:** The applicant pool may self-select more effectively. A smaller but stronger pool could lead admissions to admit a similar number of students, but the denominator's change is the key.
*   **Data Voids:** Harvard may choose to release less detailed data this cycle (e.g., not releasing early application numbers) to avoid media narratives, leaving forecasters in the dark until the final March announcement.
*   **Definitional Gotchas:** Ensure the final number used for resolution is the overall admit rate (including early and regular rounds) and not a specific round's rate. The source is clearly defined as Harvard's official statistics.

Final Research Summary: The reinstatement of standardized testing is the dominant factor for the Class of 2029, breaking from the recent test-optional era. This will almost certainly reduce the number of applicants, causing the admission rate to rise noticeably from last year's 3.59%.

To forecast the Harvard admit rate for the undergraduate class of 2029, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the admit rate for the Class of 2028, which was 3.59%. This reflects the most recent data point in a post-SCOTUS, post-COVID, and test-optional environment.
- **Variance:** Given the historical fluctuations and recent policy changes, a moderate variance is appropriate, reflecting uncertainty in the applicant pool size and admit rate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The Class of 2029 is similar to the Class of 2028 in terms of the post-SCOTUS environment and the ongoing competitive nature of admissions.
- **Differences:** The reinstatement of standardized testing for the Class of 2029 is a significant change, likely reducing the applicant pool and increasing the admit rate. Additionally, the national trend of increasing applications could counterbalance this effect to some extent.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Reinstatement of Testing (↑↑):** This is expected to significantly reduce the number of applicants, increasing the admit rate.
- **National Application Trends (↓):** A 4% increase in national applications suggests sustained interest, which could mitigate the impact of testing requirements.
- **Post-SCOTUS Environment (↑/↓):** Uncertainty remains, but the slight increase in the admit rate for the Class of 2028 suggests a potential upward pressure.
- **Reputational Factors (↑):** Negative media attention could slightly deter applicants, increasing the admit rate.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at 3.59% with moderate variance.
- **Likelihoods:** The reinstatement of testing is the dominant factor, suggesting a significant upward shift.
- **Posterior:** The admit rate is likely to increase, with the posterior distribution shifting towards 3.8% to 4.2%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must account for the uncertainty in applicant behavior in response to testing requirements.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider scenarios where the applicant pool does not decrease as expected, or where Harvard adjusts its admissions strategy unexpectedly.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is a smaller increase in the admit rate if national trends and outreach efforts counteract the testing effect.

### 6. Final Percentiles
- Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the Harvard admit rate for the Class of 2029 are:

P10: 3.7  
P20: 3.8  
P40: 3.9  
P60: 4.0  
P80: 4.1  
P90: 4.2

# Forecasting Harvard's Admit Rate for Class of 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Recent Trend (Classes 2025-2028, test-optional era):**
- Class of 2025: 3.43%
- Class of 2026: 3.19% 
- Class of 2027: 3.41%
- Class of 2028: 3.59%

The most recent 4-year average is 3.41%, with a slight upward trend in the last two years. This is my primary reference class because it represents the most recent data, though with the important caveat that these were all test-optional years.

**Pre-COVID Trend (Classes 2020-2024, test-required era):**
- Class of 2020: 5.2%
- Class of 2021: 5.2%
- Class of 2022: 4.59%
- Class of 2023: 4.5%
- Class of 2024: 4.92%

The pre-COVID average was 4.88%, significantly higher than the test-optional era.

I'll use a prior centered at 3.59% (the most recent data point) with moderate uncertainty, acknowledging the test-optional era as the immediate past but recognizing we're entering a new policy regime.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Harvard's target class size remains stable (~1,650 students)
- Harvard continues to be among the most selective universities globally
- The Common Application continues to facilitate easy application to multiple schools
- Post-SCOTUS affirmative action environment remains the same as Class of 2028

**Key differences:**
- **Test requirement reinstated**: Harvard is requiring standardized tests again after four years of test-optional policies
- **Competitive landscape**: Some peer institutions remain test-optional while Harvard has reinstated requirements
- **Reputational factors**: Harvard has faced significant public scrutiny over campus protests and leadership issues
- **Application trends**: Common App reports a 4% year-over-year increase in total applicants nationally

The test requirement reinstatement is the most significant difference and will likely reduce the applicant pool substantially.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing admit rate higher:**
1. **Test requirement reinstatement** (Strong ↑): This will significantly reduce "reach" applications from students with weaker academic profiles or test anxiety. During the test-optional era, applications surged by ~40%. Even if only half of that surge reverses, this would push the admit rate up by ~0.5-0.7 percentage points.

2. **Reputational challenges** (Moderate ↑): Recent controversies may deter some applicants, further reducing the denominator. This could reduce applications by an additional 2-5%.

3. **Class of 2028 trend** (Weak ↑): The admit rate already increased from 3.41% to 3.59% for the Class of 2028, suggesting the post-COVID application surge may be naturally subsiding.

**Evidence pushing admit rate lower:**
1. **National application volume increase** (Moderate ↓): The Common App reports a 4% increase in total applicants nationally, indicating continued strong interest in college applications.

2. **Competitive test policies** (Weak ↓): Some peer institutions remaining test-optional could concentrate stronger applicants at Harvard if they self-select based on test confidence.

3. **Harvard's global brand resilience** (Weak ↓): Despite controversies, Harvard's brand remains exceptionally strong, potentially limiting application declines.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 3.59% (Class of 2028 rate):

**First update - Test requirement effect:**
- This is the strongest factor, likely to reduce applications by 15-25%
- If applications drop by 20% and admitted students remain constant, the admit rate would increase from 3.59% to approximately 4.49% (3.59% ÷ 0.8)
- Likelihood ratio strongly favors higher rates (>4.0%) over lower rates (<3.8%)
- Posterior shifts to ~4.2-4.3% after this update

**Second update - Reputational factors vs. national application trends:**
- These factors partially offset: reputational challenges push rate up, national application growth pushes it down
- Net effect is small but likely still positive toward a higher rate
- Posterior shifts slightly higher to ~4.3-4.4%

**Third update - Competitive landscape considerations:**
- The fact that some peers remain test-optional creates uncertainty
- This slightly widens our distribution but doesn't significantly shift the mean
- Final posterior centered around 4.3% with moderate uncertainty

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
1. **Test requirement elasticity**: I may be overestimating the impact of reinstating test requirements. Some students may have continued taking tests despite the optional policy, limiting the drop in applications.

2. **Harvard's countermeasures**: Harvard may intensify recruitment efforts to offset expected application declines, potentially maintaining a larger applicant pool than anticipated.

3. **Yield considerations**: If Harvard anticipates lower yield (percentage of admitted students who enroll), they might admit more students, pushing the rate higher than my forecast.

4. **Black swan events**: Major policy changes, scandals, or external events before the application deadline could significantly impact application volumes.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be a more modest increase to ~3.8-4.0%, arguing that:
- The test requirement effect will be smaller than expected
- Harvard's recruitment efforts will be highly effective
- The national application increase will benefit Harvard despite policy changes

However, I find this less compelling given the magnitude of the test policy change and the clear historical difference between test-required and test-optional eras.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll provide my calibrated forecast for Harvard's Class of 2029 admit rate:

P10: 3.8%
P20: 4.0%
P40: 4.2%
P60: 4.4%
P80: 4.7%
P90: 5.0%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My prior distribution is based on a combination of two recent, but distinct, reference classes:
1.  **The Test-Optional Era (Classes 2025-2028):** This four-year period saw an average admit rate of 3.55%, with a low of 3.19% and a high of 3.59%. This period is defined by a massive surge in applications due to the removal of standardized test requirements.
2.  **The Last Pre-COVID, Test-Required Year (Class of 2024):** This class had an admit rate of 4.5%. This serves as a crucial anchor for what a "normal" test-required environment might look like, albeit from five years ago.

Combining these, I'll establish a prior centered between these two regimes, perhaps around 4.0%, but with very high uncertainty. The key question is whether the world has fundamentally changed such that a return to the old policy (test-required) will produce a result closer to the old data (4.5%) or the more recent data (3.6%).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation for the Class of 2029 is a hybrid of the two reference periods.
*   **Similar to Pre-COVID:** The mandatory standardized test policy is back in place. This is a significant barrier to entry for applicants and is the single most important change from the last four cycles.
*   **Different from Pre-COVID:**
    *   The overall number of students using the Common Application is higher than in 2019-2020.
    *   This is the second cycle post-SCOTUS ruling on affirmative action, an environment that did not exist pre-COVID.
    *   Harvard has faced a year of intense public scrutiny over leadership and campus issues, which is atypical.
    *   Unlike the pre-COVID era where nearly all peers required tests, some elite competitors (e.g., Penn, Cornell) remain test-optional, potentially siphoning off applicants.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their likely impact on the admit rate, primarily by affecting the denominator (number of applicants), as the numerator (number of admitted students) is historically stable.

*   **Reinstatement of Standardized Tests (↑↑):** This is the dominant factor and provides a strong upward push on the admit rate. When MIT reinstated its test requirement for the Class of 2027, its applications dropped by ~20% and its admit rate jumped from 3.9% to 4.8%. A similar dynamic at Harvard is highly probable. If Harvard's applications (~54,000 last year) drop by 15-20% while the number of admitted students remains stable (~1,950), the rate would mathematically increase to the 4.2%-4.5% range. This evidence makes rates above 4.0% much more likely than rates below.
*   **Post-SCOTUS Environment (↑):** In the first cycle after the ruling (Class of 2028), applications fell by 5% and the rate ticked up from 3.41% to 3.59%. This suggests the new landscape may already be contributing to a smaller applicant pool, providing a small upward push to the rate.
*   **Reputational Scrutiny (↑):** Sustained negative media attention could deter a small fraction of potential applicants, particularly those who are cross-admitted to other top schools like Stanford or Yale. This is a small effect, but it also points to a smaller denominator and thus a higher rate.
*   **National Application Trends (↓):** The Common Application reported a 4% increase in total applicants nationally in its early data. This provides a general tailwind of interest in college applications, which could slightly dampen the application drop at Harvard. This is the only significant piece of evidence pointing towards a lower rate, but its effect is likely to be minor compared to the Harvard-specific policy change.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Centered loosely around 4.0%, acknowledging the tension between the recent 3.6% and the last test-required 4.5%.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to a smaller applicant pool and therefore a higher admission rate. The MIT case study is a powerful analogue, suggesting a rate increase of nearly a full percentage point is plausible. The combination of test reinstatement, post-SCOTUS effects, and reputational issues all push in the same direction. The national trend is a weak counter-signal.
*   **Posterior:** I will update my prior significantly upwards. The evidence from the test requirement reinstatement is strong enough to shift my median expectation from a vague middle-ground to a point much closer to the pre-COVID, test-required rate. My posterior distribution will be centered around **4.3%**. This reflects a significant, but not quite 1-to-1, reversion to the pre-test-optional era, accounting for the slightly dampening effect of national trends and the uncertainty of the new competitive landscape. The distribution will have a right skew, as there's more potential for a surprisingly large drop in applications than a surprisingly small one.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast hinges on the assumption that reinstating the test requirement will cause a large drop in applications, similar to the MIT case. What if this is wrong?
*   **Alternative View:** Perhaps the "test-optional" applicant surge was mostly non-competitive applicants, and their removal won't change the number of *qualified* applicants much. If the core pool of serious applicants has grown since 2020, the drop might only be 5-10%. A 10% drop in applications would lead to a rate of ~4.0%. This is a plausible downside scenario.
*   **Tail Risk (Higher Rate):** Conversely, the effect could be even larger than at MIT. The combination of the test requirement, reputational issues, and post-SCOTUS uncertainty could create a "perfect storm" that drives applications down by 25% or more. This would push the admit rate towards 4.8%-5.0%. This seems less likely but is a possible upside risk.
*   **Conclusion:** My central estimate seems sound, but the tails of my distribution must account for these possibilities. The range from ~3.8% to ~5.0% should capture most of the uncertainty. I will ensure my percentiles reflect this range.
