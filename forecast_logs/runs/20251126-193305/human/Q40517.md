### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Fiscal years with a continuing resolution (CR) extending beyond January 1.** In these situations, the CR provides funding and removes the urgent "cliff" for action in December. Congress typically uses the holiday recess and returns in January to address the new deadline. In the last 15 years (FY2011-FY2025), this has occurred multiple times. The base rate for passing *additional* regular appropriations bills in December after a long-term CR is in place is very low, likely near 0.
-   **Reference Class 2: Lame-duck sessions after a midterm or presidential election.** While the 2024 election is a year past, the dynamics of a post-election session often involve clearing necessary legislation. However, the key variable is the deadline. If the deadline is in December, action is high. If the deadline is pushed to the next year, action is low. Given the CR extends to Jan 30, 2026, this reference class also suggests a low probability of December action.
-   **Reference Class 3: Appropriations progress by January 1 in recent, politically polarized years (approx. last 10 years).** The median number of regular appropriations bills enacted by January 1 has been zero. The current situation is already an outlier with three bills enacted. This suggests that passing more than the three already completed would be highly unusual.

**Reasoning:** The most salient feature is the January 30, 2026, CR deadline. This acts as a powerful disincentive for legislative action in the short, holiday-punctuated December session. The base rate from the most relevant reference class (CRs extending past Jan 1) strongly suggests no further bills will be enacted in 2025.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-08] Shutdown ends with CR and 3-bill package — ↓ — The deal resolved the immediate crisis by funding the government until Jan 30, 2026. This removes all urgency to act in December, making it the path of least resistance to defer remaining work.
-   [2025-11-07] Three least controversial bills enacted — ↓ — Congress passed the "easy" bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA). The nine remaining bills, including Defense, Labor-HHS, and Homeland Security, contain the most contentious policy riders and funding disputes, making quick passage much harder.
-   [2025-10-01] FY2026 begins, government shuts down — ↓ — The month-long shutdown indicates extreme partisan friction and a breakdown of the normal process. This acrimony makes the compromises needed to pass the remaining nine bills much more difficult to achieve in a short timeframe.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **CR Deadline Pressure:** The Jan 30, 2026 deadline is the primary driver. With no fiscal cliff in December, the incentive to engage in difficult negotiations before the holidays is virtually zero. (Large ↓)
-   **Holiday Recess:** The congressional calendar is a powerful force. Members are highly motivated to leave Washington for the holidays, making them extremely reluctant to take up complex, time-consuming legislative fights in December. (Large ↓)
-   **Political Polarization & Post-Shutdown Exhaustion:** The recent shutdown has likely hardened positions and exhausted members. There is little political appetite for another high-stakes fiscal fight immediately. The remaining bills are where the toughest ideological battles are fought. (Large ↓)
-   **Complexity of Remaining Bills:** The nine remaining bills are the most difficult. They involve major disagreements on funding levels (e.g., Defense vs. non-defense) and policy riders (e.g., immigration, abortion). Bundling them into a "minibus" or "omnibus" takes weeks of negotiation, which has not yet happened. (Moderate ↓)
-   **Desire for a "Governing" Narrative:** Congressional leadership or the White House may want to demonstrate progress by passing another small package of bills. However, this is a weak driver compared to the deadline and holiday pressures. (Small ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Three Bills Already Enacted:** Unlike many years where zero bills are done by this point, a "down payment" of three has already been made. This could slightly increase the chance of another small, bipartisan package, but it also means the easiest work is finished.
-   **Exceptionally Long Preceding Shutdown:** The background states the shutdown was the "longest in US history," implying a level of dysfunction even greater than in typical reference class years. This deepens the partisan divide and makes further compromise less likely.
-   **Explicit "Two-Tiered" Deadline:** The CR established a clear deadline in late January. This is a common tactic now, but it specifically structures the legislative calendar to defer conflict until after the new year, a stronger signal than a simple CR with a vague promise to keep working.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** The base rate from years with a CR extending past Jan 1 suggests a prior heavily concentrated on 0 *additional* bills being passed. The total would therefore be 3. This prior should be strong (high "n").
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   Recent shutdown was unusually long and contentious (↓, large): Reinforces prior by indicating extreme difficulty in reaching compromise.
    -   CR deadline is Jan 30, 2026 (↓, large): This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It removes the primary mechanism (deadline pressure) that would force action in December.
    -   The three easiest bills are already complete (↓, moderate): The remaining work is qualitatively harder, reducing the probability of quick, easy passage for any more bills.
    -   Impending holiday recess (↓, large): A powerful, predictable driver of legislative inaction on non-essential items.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly confirms and strengthens the prior. The posterior distribution should be very sharply peaked at 3. The probability of any outcome greater than 3 should be considered very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Announcements from House/Senate leadership of floor time being scheduled for another appropriations bill in December.
    -   Press reports of a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on one of the "easier" remaining bills (e.g., Energy and Water, Financial Services).
    -   Formation of a new "minibus" package combining 2-3 of the remaining bills.
    -   A major external event (e.g., national security crisis) that requires supplemental funding and could be attached to a regular appropriations bill.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Leadership announcing the December legislative calendar with no appropriations bills scheduled for a vote.
    -   Public statements from key factions (e.g., House Freedom Caucus, Senate conservatives) vowing to oppose any further spending bills in December.
    -   Congress adjourning for the holiday recess without action on appropriations.
    -   Rhetoric from leadership focusing on the "January 30th deadline" as the next action point.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution Definition:** The question resolves on bills being "enacted" (signed by the President) before Jan 1, 2026. Passage in both chambers is not sufficient.
-   **"Christmas Miracle" Omnibus:** There is always a small, non-zero chance that leadership cobbles together a surprise large-scale deal to clear the decks before the new year. This is unlikely given the context but remains a possibility.
-   **Legislative Vehicle Hijacking:** A must-pass bill for another reason could become the vehicle for one or more appropriations bills, accelerating the timeline unexpectedly.
-   **Hypothetical Scenario:** The background is a hypothetical future scenario. The analysis relies on established patterns of congressional behavior, assuming they hold true in this future context.
-   **Information Gaps:** We lack real-time information on the private negotiations and mood of the caucuses in this hypothetical November 2025.

### Final Research Summary
Three of the twelve bills are already law. The combination of a recent, bitter government shutdown, a funding deadline that is safely in late January 2026, and the powerful incentive of the holiday recess makes it extremely unlikely Congress will enact any of the nine remaining, more controversial bills before the new year.

To forecast the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1**: Fiscal years with a CR extending beyond January 1. Historically, this scenario results in very few additional bills being passed in December. The base rate for additional bills is near 0.
   - **Reference Class 2**: Lame-duck sessions after elections with deadlines in the following year. Historically low action in December.
   - **Reference Class 3**: Appropriations progress by January 1 in recent years, with a median of zero bills enacted. The current situation is already an outlier with three bills enacted.
   - **Prior Mean**: 3 bills (those already enacted), with a very low variance suggesting little change.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The CR deadline is beyond January 1, and the political environment is highly polarized.
   - Differences: Three bills are already enacted, which is unusual but does not significantly alter the base rate expectation due to the complexity of remaining bills.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR Deadline (Jan 30, 2026)**: Strongly discourages December action (Large ↓).
   - **Holiday Recess**: Reduces likelihood of legislative action (Large ↓).
   - **Political Polarization**: Post-shutdown exhaustion and hardened positions (Large ↓).
   - **Complexity of Remaining Bills**: Makes quick passage unlikely (Moderate ↓).
   - **Desire for Progress**: Slight chance of a small package (Small ↑).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior**: Concentrated on 3 bills.
   - **Evidence**: Strongly supports the prior, with overwhelming factors discouraging further action.
   - **Posterior**: Remains sharply peaked at 3, with very low probability of additional bills.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of a "Christmas Miracle" omnibus or legislative vehicle hijacking, but these are unlikely given the context.
   - Alternative forecast: A small chance of one more bill due to a surprise deal, but this is not supported by current evidence.
   - Adjustments: None needed; the forecast remains robust.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong evidence against further action, the percentiles reflect a high concentration around the current number of enacted bills.

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical pattern of appropriations bills enacted before January 1st in fiscal years with a continuing resolution extending beyond January 1st.

Looking at recent history (approximately the last 15 years), when Congress passes a CR extending into January:
- The median number of regular appropriations bills enacted by January 1st is typically 0-3
- The mean is likely around 2-3 bills
- The variance is relatively low, as the pattern is quite consistent

The most relevant base rate is that when a CR extends past January 1st, Congress rarely enacts additional appropriations bills in December. The prior distribution should be heavily concentrated at 3 (the current number already enacted).

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- A continuing resolution is in place extending well past January 1st (to January 30, 2026)
- The political environment is highly polarized
- The easiest bills have already been enacted (Agriculture, Legislative Branch, Military Construction-VA)
- The holiday recess creates a natural break in legislative activity

**Differences from base rate:**
- Three bills have already been enacted, which is slightly above the typical base rate
- The preceding shutdown was exceptionally long ("longest in US history"), indicating even greater dysfunction
- The explicit two-tiered deadline structure (with January 30th as the target) is a stronger signal than usual to defer work

These differences generally reinforce the expectation that no additional bills will be enacted before January 1st.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward lower values (0 additional bills):**
- **CR deadline of January 30, 2026**: This removes all urgency to act in December. Likelihood ratio: ~10:1 favoring no additional bills.
- **Holiday recess**: Congress is highly motivated to adjourn for the holidays without complex negotiations. Likelihood ratio: ~5:1 favoring no additional bills.
- **Post-shutdown exhaustion**: The recent month-long shutdown indicates extreme difficulty reaching compromises. Likelihood ratio: ~3:1 favoring no additional bills.
- **Remaining bills are the most contentious**: The nine remaining bills contain the most difficult policy and funding disputes. Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring no additional bills.

**Evidence pushing toward higher values (1+ additional bills):**
- **Three bills already enacted**: This demonstrates some capacity to pass appropriations bills. Likelihood ratio: ~1.5:1 favoring at least one additional bill.
- **Potential desire to demonstrate governance**: Leadership might want to show progress. Likelihood ratio: ~1.2:1 favoring at least one additional bill.

The combined likelihood strongly favors no additional bills being enacted (combined ratio of approximately 6:1 against additional bills).

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior heavily concentrated at 3 bills (already enacted), with small probability mass at 4-5 bills, and very little at higher values.

**Update based on CR deadline evidence:**
- Prior probability of exactly 3 bills: ~75%
- Prior probability of 4+ bills: ~25%
- Likelihood ratio favoring exactly 3 bills: ~10:1
- Posterior probability of exactly 3 bills: ~97%
- Posterior probability of 4+ bills: ~3%

**Further update based on holiday recess and post-shutdown exhaustion:**
- These factors further reduce the already small probability of additional bills
- The posterior becomes even more concentrated at exactly 3 bills
- The probability of 4+ bills decreases to perhaps 1-2%

The posterior distribution is thus heavily concentrated at 3 bills, with a small tail extending to 4-5 bills, and negligible probability at 6+ bills.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a "Christmas miracle" omnibus package that leadership could negotiate to clear the decks before year-end
- There could be external events (national security crisis, economic shock) that create pressure for additional appropriations action
- I may be overweighting the importance of the January 30th deadline if there are other political incentives to act sooner

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would be to place more weight on 4-5 bills being enacted. The argument would be that with three bills already done, there's momentum to complete a few more of the less controversial bills (perhaps Energy & Water, Financial Services). This could happen if leadership wants to demonstrate progress or reduce January workload.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The historical pattern is extremely strong - when a CR extends past January 1st, Congress almost never enacts additional appropriations bills in December. The incentive structure (no deadline pressure, holiday recess) overwhelmingly favors inaction.

**Adjustment for uncertainty:**
I'll slightly increase the probability of 4-5 bills to account for unexpected scenarios, but maintain the strong concentration at 3 bills.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of regular appropriations bills enacted before January 1, 2026, given that three are already enacted and a Continuing Resolution (CR) funds the government until January 30, 2026.

The most appropriate reference class is **the number of *additional* appropriations bills passed during a lame-duck or holiday session when a CR is already in place that extends the funding deadline into the next calendar year.**

*   **Reasoning:** The primary driver of congressional action on appropriations is a "fiscal cliff" or deadline. By passing a CR until January 30, Congress has explicitly removed any deadline pressure for December 2025. Historical precedent shows that when such a deadline is removed, Congress is overwhelmingly likely to defer difficult negotiations until the new deadline approaches. The impending holiday recess further solidifies this pattern.
*   **Distribution:** In such scenarios, the base rate for passing *any* additional bills is very low. The distribution is therefore heavily concentrated on 0 additional bills. My prior distribution for the *total* number of enacted bills is thus sharply peaked at 3, with a small probability of a slightly higher number. The median of this prior is 3, with very little variance.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current situation perfectly matches the core mechanism of the reference class: a CR has pushed the deadline past the new year, and the holiday recess is imminent. High political polarization, which makes legislative compromise difficult, is also a common feature.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Three bills already enacted:** This is a notable difference. However, it likely makes *further* action less probable, not more. The enacted bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are typically the least controversial. This means the nine remaining bills are the most difficult ones, containing major funding and policy disputes (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security). The "easy wins" have already been secured.
    *   **Preceded by the "longest government shutdown in US history":** This context suggests that partisan acrimony and legislative exhaustion are at an extreme high. This significantly strengthens the case for inaction, as there would be little appetite for another immediate, high-stakes fiscal battle. This difference makes the base case of "no action" even more likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Each piece of evidence strongly points toward a lower number of bills being enacted (i.e., no change from the current total of 3).

*   **Evidence 1: CR Deadline of Jan 30, 2026.** This is the most powerful factor. It removes the primary forcing mechanism for action in December. This makes the outcome of "3 total bills" (0 additional) many times more likely than any outcome greater than 3. (Large downward pressure on any number > 3).
*   **Evidence 2: Impending Holiday Recess.** A reliable driver of legislative inaction. Members are highly motivated to leave Washington, not to engage in complex, contentious negotiations. (Large downward pressure on any number > 3).
*   **Evidence 3: Remaining Bills are the Most Controversial.** The work left to do is qualitatively harder than the work already done. This makes a quick, easy deal on another bill or package highly improbable. (Moderate downward pressure on any number > 3).
*   **Evidence 4: Post-Shutdown Political Environment.** The recent historic shutdown indicates a breakdown in trust and compromise. This political toxicity makes the bipartisan cooperation needed to pass appropriations bills extremely difficult to achieve. (Large downward pressure on any number > 3).

There is no significant evidence pointing towards a higher number of bills. A desire to "show progress" is a weak motivator compared to the powerful structural incentives to defer action.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A strong belief that the total will be 3, based on historical patterns of congressional inaction in December when deadlines are postponed. Let's model this as P(Total=3) ≈ 85%.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (Jan 30 deadline, holiday recess, difficulty of remaining bills, post-shutdown exhaustion) is highly consistent with the "no further action" hypothesis (Total=3) and highly inconsistent with any hypothesis of further action (Total>3).
*   **Update:** Applying these strong, confirmatory likelihoods to the prior solidifies the belief that the total will be 3. The posterior probability of the total being exactly 3 increases.
    *   *Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood*
    *   The likelihood of seeing all this evidence *if* Congress were planning to pass more bills is very low. The likelihood of seeing this evidence *if* Congress were planning to wait until January is very high.
    *   The posterior distribution becomes even more sharply peaked at 3. My final subjective probability for P(Total=3) is now in the 85-90% range.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario:** What if I'm wrong? The most plausible alternative is not a full omnibus, but a small "minibus" package of the next 2-3 least controversial bills (e.g., Energy & Water, Financial Services). Congressional leadership might push for this to claim a victory and build momentum before the holidays. This is a low-probability but non-zero event.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** My initial posterior might be slightly overconfident in the "exactly 3" outcome. The "small minibus" scenario represents the primary tail risk. While the structural factors against it are enormous, congressional action can sometimes be unpredictable.
*   **Adjustment:** I will adjust my percentiles to account for this small but plausible tail risk. While the median and most of the distribution will be at 3, the upper percentiles should reflect the possibility of one or more additional bills passing. I estimate roughly a 10-15% chance that at least one more bill is enacted. This means the 90th percentile should be higher than 3. A total of 4 (one additional bill) or 5 (a two-bill minibus) are the most likely "surprise" outcomes.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is heavily concentrated at 3, reflecting the overwhelming likelihood of congressional inaction in December. The upper percentiles account for the small but non-zero chance of a surprise "minibus" package passing before the new year.
