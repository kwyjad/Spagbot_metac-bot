### Reference class & base rates
- **Severe Influenza Seasons:** A common benchmark for an endemic respiratory virus. In the US, severe flu seasons can cause 50,000–60,000 deaths (e.g., 2017-2018). This serves as a plausible lower-bound anchor for an endemic state where COVID-19 is a persistent but manageable threat.
- **Early Pandemic Years (2020-2021):** This class represents the virus spreading through a largely naive population with limited treatments and no vaccines. The US averaged approximately 455,000 reported deaths/year in this period. This serves as a high-end anchor, reflecting a state of crisis rather than endemicity.
- **Other Leading Causes of Death (US, pre-pandemic):** This provides context for the scale of mortality. For example, accidents (~170,000 deaths/year) and stroke (~150,000 deaths/year). This helps calibrate whether a given number represents a top-tier public health crisis or a more typical, albeit serious, cause of death.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
The question's resolution period (2022-2025) is nearly complete. Recent developments primarily inform the final months of 2025 and potential data revisions. The recency guideline is to emphasize the last 6 months.

- **2025-09-15** FDA and CDC authorize and recommend updated 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines targeting recent variants (e.g., descendants of JN.1/FLiRT). ↓ — Matters for mitigating the severity of the impending winter 2025-2026 wave, though uptake is expected to be low.
- **2025-10-20** CDC wastewater surveillance data shows a clear seasonal uptick in SARS-CoV-2 activity in the Northeast and Midwest, consistent with prior years. ↑ — A reliable leading indicator for a winter wave of infections, which will translate to hospitalizations and deaths in the final months of 2025.
- **2025-07-01** The "FLiRT" variants (KP.2, KP.3) and their descendants are established as dominant across the US. ↔︎ — These variants are highly transmissible and immune-evasive but have not demonstrated a clear increase in intrinsic severity compared to prior Omicron subvariants.
- **2025-05-11** The US federal government formally ends the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency declaration, shifting costs of tests and treatments to individuals and insurers. ↑ (small) — May slightly increase mortality by creating barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment (e.g., Paxlovid) for the uninsured or underinsured.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Population Immunity (Large):** The primary driver of reduced mortality. A wall of immunity built from prior infections and vaccinations (hybrid immunity) has significantly decoupled infections from severe outcomes. However, this immunity wanes over time, creating vulnerability to new waves.
2.  **Viral Evolution (Large):** The virus continues to evolve, primarily towards greater immune evasion. A variant emerging with significantly higher intrinsic severity is a low-probability, high-impact risk. The current trajectory is high transmissibility without major severity increases.
3.  **Antiviral Treatments (Moderate):** Widespread availability and use of effective antivirals like Paxlovid, particularly in high-risk populations, is a crucial mitigator that prevents progression to severe disease and death. Access and uptake are key variables.
4.  **Vaccine/Booster Uptake (Small-to-Moderate):** While foundational immunity is high, uptake of annual boosters is very low (<25% of eligible adults). This limits their population-level impact, making this a less powerful lever than in 2021, but still important for individual protection.
5.  **Data Reporting and Attribution (Moderate):** The resolution depends on *reported* deaths. Changes in testing availability, death certificate coding practices, and reporting infrastructure can alter the final count without a change in underlying mortality. There is a general trend towards less comprehensive reporting.
6.  **Behavioral Normalization (Small):** The vast majority of the population has returned to pre-pandemic behavior. There is very little remaining political or social will for mandates. Behavior is now a minor driver, only changing at the margins during major waves.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
This case is a transition from a pandemic crisis (the "Early Pandemic Years" reference class) towards an endemic state (the "Severe Influenza" reference class). The 2022-2025 period captures this entire transition.

- **Known Data Points:** Unlike a pure forecast, three of the four years (2022, 2023, 2024) are largely complete, with official or high-quality provisional data available. The problem is now heavily weighted towards data aggregation rather than prediction.
- **Rapid Deceleration:** The rate of change is the most unusual feature. Mortality fell dramatically from 2022 to 2023, a much steeper decline than the year-over-year variation seen with influenza.
- **Effective Therapeutics:** The availability of a highly effective, specific oral antiviral (Paxlovid) is a significant advantage over the therapeutic options for severe influenza (e.g., Tamiflu), fundamentally altering the risk profile for vulnerable individuals who get timely treatment.
- **Complex Immune Landscape:** Unlike flu, where immunity is primarily shaped by recent strains and annual shots, the population's SARS-CoV-2 immunity is a complex mosaic of different vaccines, boosters, and infections from numerous distinct variants (Alpha, Delta, Omicron BA.1/2/5, XBB, JN.1, etc.).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** A reasonable prior, looking forward from 2021, would have been centered on a number slightly higher than a severe flu season, perhaps 75,000 deaths/year, acknowledging COVID-19's higher severity but anticipating mitigation measures. Equivalent n=4 (moderate confidence in the "endemic flu" analogy).
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - **2022 Reported Deaths (~244,986):** ↑ (Large). This hard data point from the CDC MMWR is far above the prior, reflecting the lingering impact of Delta and the massive Omicron wave. This single data point will dominate the 4-year average.
    - **2023 Reported Deaths (~76,000):** ↓ (Large). This shows a rapid decline towards the "severe flu" base rate, confirming the transition to endemicity. It pulls the average down significantly from the 2022 high.
    - **2024 Provisional Deaths (~35,000-45,000):** ↓ (Moderate). Data indicates a further halving from 2023, showing stabilization at or below the level of a severe flu season.
    - **2025 Projected Deaths (~25,000-35,000):** ↓ (Small). The trend continues, with no signs of a catastrophic new variant. The year is nearly over, and mortality remains relatively low.
- **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points to an average heavily skewed by the high 2022 number, followed by three years of progressively lower mortality. The posterior should be a direct calculation of the average of these four numbers, with only minor uncertainty around the 2024 and 2025 final tallies. The initial prior is useful context but is superseded by the observed data.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - Unexpectedly sharp, sustained increases in CDC wastewater surveillance levels.
    - Spikes in COVID-19 hospital admissions that exceed levels from the past two winters.
    - Emergence of a new variant with credible reports of increased severity (e.g., higher hospitalization rates in initial clusters).
    - Major year-end revisions of provisional 2024/2025 death data upwards by the NCHS.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - The winter 2025-2026 wave proves to be significantly milder than the previous two winters.
    - Provisional death counts for late 2025 are lower than expected.
    - Final NCHS mortality reports for 2023/2024 revise initial counts downward.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Resolution Source Specificity:** The resolution hinges on CDC-reported deaths. This is not the same as "excess mortality," which is often higher. The provided sources discussing excess deaths are context, not the resolution criterion.
- **Reporting Lags and Revisions:** Provisional data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is subject to

To forecast the average number of COVID-19 deaths per year in the United States from 2022 to 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The base rate is informed by the transition from pandemic to endemic states. The severe influenza season (50,000–60,000 deaths/year) serves as a lower bound, while the early pandemic years (455,000 deaths/year) serve as an upper bound. Given the transition, a reasonable prior might center around 75,000 deaths/year, reflecting a shift towards endemicity but acknowledging COVID-19's higher severity.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Prior mean is 75,000 with a moderate variance reflecting uncertainty in the transition dynamics.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The transition towards endemicity is consistent with the base rate, as immunity builds and mortality decreases.
   - **Differences:** The rapid decline in mortality from 2022 to 2023 and the availability of effective treatments like Paxlovid are significant deviations, suggesting a faster transition than typical for influenza.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **2022 Reported Deaths (~244,986):** This is significantly higher than the prior, indicating a lingering impact from earlier variants.
   - **2023 Reported Deaths (~76,000):** Aligns closely with the prior, suggesting a rapid decline towards endemic levels.
   - **2024 Provisional Deaths (~35,000-45,000):** Further decline, indicating stabilization below severe flu levels.
   - **2025 Projected Deaths (~25,000-35,000):** Continues the trend of decreasing mortality, with no catastrophic variant emergence.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Update Step:** Start with the prior centered at 75,000. The 2022 data point pulls the mean upwards, but subsequent years (2023-2025) pull it downwards significantly.
   - **Posterior Mean/Variance:** The posterior mean is heavily influenced by the high 2022 number but trends downward due to lower subsequent years. Variance decreases as more data solidifies the trend.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the potential for data revisions or unexpected variant impacts. However, the trend is robust with three years of data.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A new severe variant could increase deaths, but current evidence suggests this is unlikely.
   - **Adjustments:** Minor adjustments for potential underreporting or data revisions.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the evidence and Bayesian updating, the final percentiles reflect a distribution skewed by the high 2022 deaths but moderated by subsequent declines.

P10: 40,000  
P20: 50,000  
P40: 70,000

P90: 130,000

# Forecasting COVID-19 Deaths in the US (2022-2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Early Pandemic Years (2020-2021):** The US averaged approximately 455,000 COVID-19 deaths per year during this period. This represents the high end of potential outcomes.

**Severe Influenza Seasons:** A severe flu season in the US can cause 50,000-60,000 deaths (e.g., 2017-2018 season). This represents a plausible lower bound for an endemic respiratory virus.

**Transition to Endemicity:** Given that the question spans 2022-2025, which represents a transition period from pandemic to endemic state, a reasonable prior would be centered between these extremes, but closer to the endemic state by the end of the period.

Based on these considerations, I'll use a prior centered at approximately 75,000 deaths/year, with a wide variance to reflect the uncertainty in how quickly the transition to endemicity would occur.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- COVID-19 remains a respiratory virus with seasonal patterns similar to influenza
- Population-level immunity continues to build through infections and vaccinations
- The virus continues to evolve, with new variants emerging regularly

**Differences from base case:**
- We now have actual data for most of the period in question (2022-2025)
- The transition to endemicity happened faster than many expected
- Effective treatments like Paxlovid became widely available
- Reporting practices have changed over time, potentially affecting death counts
- The population has developed substantial hybrid immunity from multiple exposures

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Key evidence:**

1. **2022 Reported Deaths (~244,986):** This is hard data from the CDC, far above the prior. This reflects the lingering impact of Delta and the massive Omicron wave. (Strong evidence pushing average up)

2. **2023 Reported Deaths (~76,000):** This shows a rapid decline towards the "severe flu" base rate, confirming the transition to endemicity. (Moderate evidence pushing average down from 2022)

3. **2024 Provisional Deaths (~35,000-45,000):** Data indicates a further halving from 2023, showing stabilization at or below the level of a severe flu season. (Moderate evidence pushing average down)

4. **2025 Projected Deaths (~25,000-35,000):** The trend continues, with no signs of a catastrophic new variant. The year is nearly over with relatively low mortality. (Moderate evidence pushing average down)

5. **Effective Treatments:** Widespread availability of Paxlovid and other treatments has significantly reduced the case fatality rate. (Moderate evidence pushing average down)

6. **Vaccine/Booster Uptake:** While foundational immunity is high, uptake of annual boosters is very low (<25% of eligible adults), limiting their population-level impact. (Weak evidence pushing average up)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with our prior of 75,000 deaths/year, I'll update based on the actual data we have:

**First update (2022 data):** The 244,986 deaths in 2022 is much higher than our prior. This single year will heavily influence the 4-year average.

**Second update (2023 data):** The dramatic drop to 76,000 deaths shows a rapid transition to endemicity.

**Third update (2024 provisional data):** Further decline to ~40,000 deaths continues the downward trend.

**Fourth update (2025 projected data):** Stabilization at ~30,000 deaths suggests we've reached an endemic state.

Calculating the 4-year average:
(244,986 + 76,000 + 40,000 + 30,000) / 4 = 97,746.5

This posterior mean of ~98,000 deaths/year is higher than our prior due to the heavily skewed distribution with 2022 having much higher mortality than subsequent years.

The variance has narrowed considerably since we now have actual data for most of the period, with only minor uncertainty around the final 2024 and 2025 numbers.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**

1. **Data revisions:** Final death counts for 2023-2025 could be revised upward or downward as data is finalized.

2. **Late 2025 surge:** A new variant could cause an unexpected surge in late 2025 that isn't captured in current projections.

3. **Reporting changes:** Changes in how COVID-19 deaths are classified and reported could affect the final numbers without reflecting true mortality changes.

4. **Overconfidence in trends:** The consistent downward trend might lead to overconfidence that 2025 will continue this pattern.

**Alternative forecast:** A more pessimistic view might argue that the 2025 numbers could be significantly higher (~60,000) if a more severe variant emerges or if immunity wanes more rapidly than expected. This would push the average to around 105,000 deaths/year.

**Rebuttal:** The consistent downward trend over three years, combined with high population immunity and effective treatments, makes a major reversal unlikely. Even if 2025 sees a modest increase, it would have a limited impact on the 4-year average given the weight of the earlier years.

After considering these factors, I'll widen my uncertainty bands slightly but maintain the central estimate.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks for the average annual COVID-19 deaths in the US from 2022 to 2025. Since the question was originally posed in 2021, a relevant prior would have been a distribution between two reference classes:
1.  **Severe Influenza Seasons:** In the US, a bad flu season causes 50,000-60,000 deaths. This serves as a plausible lower-bound anchor for an endemic state.
2.  **Early Pandemic Years (2020-2021):** The US averaged ~455,000 deaths/year during this period. This serves as a high-end anchor representing a full-blown pandemic crisis.

A reasonable prior in 2021 would have been centered somewhere between these two, perhaps around 100,000-150,000 deaths/year, anticipating a gradual decline from the pandemic peak towards an endemic state over the four-year period. However, as of late 2025, this prior is almost entirely superseded by observed data.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The 2022-2025 period is not a stable state but a rapid transition. It began with the tail end of the pandemic crisis and is ending in a state more analogous to the "severe influenza" base rate. The key feature is the steep year-over-year decline in mortality. Unlike a stable endemic virus, the average over this period will be heavily skewed by the much higher death toll in the first year (2022). The problem has shifted from a long-term forecast to one of data aggregation for completed years and short-term estimation for the final months.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The forecast is now dominated by concrete data for most of the 4-year period. The main task is to aggregate this data and estimate the small remaining portion.

*   **2022 Deaths (Evidence: ↑↑↑):** The CDC's MMWR report "COVID-19 Mortality Update — United States, 2022" states a final count of **244,986** deaths. This is a hard data point and is far higher than any endemic baseline, pulling the 4-year average up significantly.
*   **2023 Deaths (Evidence: ↓↓):** The CDC's MMWR report "Provisional Mortality Data — United States, 2023" states that COVID-19 deaths fell to **76,245**. This confirms the rapid transition towards endemicity and pulls the average down from the 2022 high.
*   **2024 Deaths (Evidence: ↓):** Provisional data for 2024 is largely complete. Based on CDC NCHS data and trackers, the year's total is approximately **40,000** (with a plausible range of 35,000-45,000). This shows a continued halving of mortality, bringing it into the range of a severe flu season.
*   **2025 Deaths (Evidence: ↓):** We are in late November 2025. The year has followed a similar seasonal pattern to 2024 but with a lower baseline. A reasonable projection for the full year, accounting for the nascent winter wave, is around **30,000** (with a plausible range of 25,000-35,000).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
The posterior distribution is no longer an update on a broad prior, but a direct calculation based on the evidence, with uncertainty confined to the 2024 and 2025 figures.

**Central Estimate (Median):**
- Sum of deaths = 244,986 (2022) + 76,245 (2023) + 40,000 (2024 est.) + 30,000 (2025 est.) = 391,231
- Average = 391,231 / 4 ≈ **97,800 deaths/year**

This calculation forms the median of my posterior distribution. The uncertainty in the 2024 and 2025 numbers will define the spread. Because the high 2022 number is fixed, it dampens the impact of this uncertainty on the final average. For instance, a 10,000-death error in the 2025 estimate only changes the 4-year average by 2,500.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My primary risk is overconfidence due to having most of the data. I need to account for tail risks in the remaining period and in data revisions.
*   **Upside Risk (Higher Deaths):** The most significant risk is a severe winter 2025-2026 wave in December, driven by a new variant, pushing the 2025 total higher than expected. Additionally, provisional data from NCHS is often revised upwards as death certificates are processed. A scenario where 2024 final deaths are closer to 50,000 and 2025 deaths reach 45,000 is a plausible tail event. This would push the average to (244,986 + 76,245 + 50,000 + 45,000) / 4 ≈ 104,000.
*   **Downside Risk (Lower Deaths):** The winter wave could be exceptionally mild, and provisional data could have overcounted. A scenario with 2024 deaths at 35,000 and 2025 at 25,000 is also plausible. This would yield an average of (244,986 + 76,245 + 35,000 + 25,000) / 4 ≈ 95,300.
*   **Conclusion:** The risks are skewed to the upside. Upward data revisions are more common than downward ones, and a viral surprise is a classic right-tail risk. Therefore, my final distribution should be right-skewed, with the mean slightly above the median. My P10-P90 range of roughly 95,500 to 104,000 reflects these considerations.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is centered around 98,000, anchored by the definitive high death count in 2022 and the subsequent sharp declines. The uncertainty is primarily driven by the final tallies for 2024 and 2025, with a right skew to account for potential upward revisions and late-year mortality spikes.
