### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Biweekly changes in 10Y Yield (2010-Present).** The mean biweekly change in the 10-year yield is near zero (~0.0 bps). The standard deviation is approximately 16 basis points (bps). This implies that roughly 68% of the time, the yield finishes a two-week period within +/- 16 bps of its starting value, and 95% of the time within +/- 32 bps.
    -   *Reasoning:* This provides a broad, long-term view of typical volatility over the forecast period's length.
    -   *Limitation:* This class includes periods of quantitative easing, zero-interest-rate policy, and stable inflation, which may not reflect the current, more volatile, post-hiking cycle environment.
-   **Reference Class 2: Biweekly changes during Fed "on-hold" periods (e.g., 2019, post-2023).** In periods where the Federal Reserve is holding rates steady but the future path is uncertain, volatility is often elevated. The standard deviation of biweekly changes in these periods is closer to 20-25 bps.
    -   *Reasoning:* This class is more analogous to the current situation where the Fed has likely concluded its hiking cycle but has not yet begun to ease, making markets highly sensitive to incoming data.
    -   *Limitation:* Each "on-hold" period has a unique macroeconomic context (e.g., pre-pandemic slowdown vs. post-pandemic inflation fight).

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-10-27** Yield eases to 4.00% — ↓ — Markets react to slightly weaker-than-expected manufacturing PMI data, reinforcing the narrative of a cooling economy and reducing pressure on the Fed.
-   **2025-10-24** Yield ends the week at 4.02% — ↔ — The rate stabilized after a volatile week, finding a technical level as investors await the next major economic data releases.
-   **2025-10-17** October CPI report released — ↓ — Core CPI for September came in slightly below consensus expectations, suggesting disinflationary trends remain intact and pushing yields lower from ~4.15%.
-   **2025-10-08** Fed Governor comments perceived as dovish — ↓ — A prominent Fed Governor emphasized patience and the risks of over-tightening, leading markets to price out any remaining chance of a final rate hike.
-   **2025-09-05** August Jobs Report shows moderation — ↔/↓ — The report indicated a cooling but still-healthy labor market, consistent with a "soft landing" scenario that keeps the Fed on hold.
-   **2025-06-04** Schwab outlook suggests potential for 5% yields — ↑ — This older analysis from mid-year highlighted upside risks to yields based on persistent inflation and fiscal pressures, a view that has since moderated.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Federal Reserve Policy Expectations:** The market's interpretation of FOMC statements, minutes, and key official's speeches regarding the timing of a potential first rate cut. Any shift in this timeline is the primary driver. (Size: Large)
2.  **Core Inflation Data (CPI & PCE):** An upside surprise in the October CPI report (to be released early November) would push yields higher by reviving "higher-for-longer" fears. A downside surprise would accelerate bets on an earlier Fed pivot. (Size: Large)
3.  **Labor Market Data (Jobs Report & Wages):** The October jobs report (early November) will be critical. Signs of unexpected weakness could pull yields down sharply, while surprising strength would push them up. (Size: Moderate-Large)
4.  **Economic Growth Indicators (GDP, ISM):** Data indicating a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown would increase demand for safe-haven Treasuries, pushing yields down. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Geopolitical Events & "Flight to Safety":** An unexpected geopolitical flare-up or financial stability scare could trigger a flight to quality, causing a rapid drop in yields. (Size: Moderate)
6.  **Treasury Auction Demand:** The results of Treasury auctions in early November, particularly for long-duration bonds, can signal investor appetite and influence yields at the margin. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Post-Hiking Cycle Ambiguity:** Unlike a clear easing or tightening cycle, the market is in a "wait-and-see" mode. This creates high sensitivity to data surprises, potentially leading to higher-than-average volatility around key data releases.
-   **Inverted Yield Curve:** The yield curve remains inverted (short-term rates higher than long-term). This is historically anomalous and signals market expectations of a future slowdown and rate cuts, putting a ceiling on how high the 10-year yield can go without a major regime shift.
-   **Elevated Fiscal Deficit:** The ongoing high level of U.S. government borrowing and Treasury issuance creates a persistent upward pressure on yields via term premium, a factor less prominent in the ZIRP era of the 2010s.
-   **Divergent Expert Forecasts:** As of late 2025, credible forecasts exist for both significantly higher (Schwab's older 5% view) and lower (WGB's 3.5% by Q1 2026) yields, indicating a lack of consensus on the medium-term path.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A strong prior centered on the current yield of 4.00%. Given the very short forecast horizon (<1 month), the current market price is a highly informative signal. A Normal distribution with a mean of 4.00% and a standard deviation of 0.20% (reflecting the more volatile "on-hold" reference class) seems appropriate. This represents a high "equivalent n".
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓) Recent inflation and manufacturing data have been moderately softer than expected, reducing the probability of a hawkish Fed surprise. (Magnitude: Small)
    -   (↔) Fed communications have coalesced around a "data-dependent pause," providing a strong anchor and limiting the potential for large moves without a significant data shock. (Magnitude: Large, stabilizing)
    -   (↑) Underlying fiscal pressures and the possibility of a resilient labor market report for October provide a plausible, though less likely, path to slightly higher yields. (Magnitude: Small)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence since mid-October has been modestly yield-negative. The posterior should be centered very close to the prior of 4.00%, perhaps shifting slightly lower to a mean of ~3.95%. The variance of the posterior should remain similar to the prior, as key event risks (Jobs report, CPI) are still ahead.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   October Core CPI (MoM) prints at 0.4% or higher.
    -   October Non-Farm Payrolls number exceeds 250k, with accelerating wage growth.
    -   November FOMC statement or press conference is interpreted as hawkish, pushing back on rate cut expectations.
    -   A breakdown in geopolitical stability that is inflationary (e.g., new energy supply shocks).
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   October Core CPI (MoM) prints at 0.2% or lower.
    -   October Non-Farm Payrolls number is below 100k, with a rising unemployment rate.
    -   November FOMC statement contains language signaling a greater concern for slowing growth.
    -   A significant "flight to safety" event (e.g., stress in a major financial institution).

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **FOMC Meeting Overreaction:** The November FOMC meeting falls just before the forecast period. The market's initial reaction to the statement or press conference can be volatile and subject to revision.
-   **Holiday Liquidity:** The period includes Veterans Day (Nov 11). Thinner trading volumes around holidays can sometimes lead to exaggerated price movements on minor news.
-   **Data Revisions:** Initial prints of economic data (especially jobs numbers) are subject to significant future revisions, but the market trades on the initial release.
-   **Term Premium Volatility:** The "term premium" (extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds) has been volatile. A sudden shift in investor risk perception could move the 10Y yield without a change in Fed expectations.
-   **Geopolitical Shocks:** The forecast is highly sensitive to an unforecastable "black swan" event that would override all fundamental economic drivers.

Final Research Summary: The 10-year yield starts the forecast window at 4.00%, which serves as a very strong anchor for this short-term prediction. The most likely outcome is a value between 3.80% and 4.20%, with the final position determined by the market's reaction to the upcoming October jobs/inflation reports and the November FOMC meeting.

To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period from November 10 to November 21, 2025, we will follow a structured probabilistic approach using Bayesian reasoning.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 2** is most appropriate: Biweekly changes during Fed "on-hold" periods, with a standard deviation of 20-25 bps. This reflects the current situation where the Fed is likely holding rates steady, and market sensitivity to data is high.
   - The mean of the base rate is centered around the current yield of 4.00%, with a standard deviation of 0.20%.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current environment is similar to past "on-hold" periods with elevated volatility due to uncertainty about future Fed actions.
   - **Differences:** The current period has unique factors such as an inverted yield curve and elevated fiscal deficits, which may exert additional upward pressure on yields.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Recent Data:** Weaker-than-expected inflation and manufacturing data suggest a cooling economy, reducing the likelihood of a hawkish Fed move (downward pressure).
   - **Fed Communications:** A "data-dependent pause" stance stabilizes expectations, limiting large yield movements without significant data surprises (stabilizing effect).
   - **Fiscal Pressures:** Persistent fiscal deficits and potential labor market strength could exert upward pressure on yields (upward pressure).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 4.00% with a 0.20% standard deviation, the recent evidence suggests a slight downward adjustment.
   - The posterior mean shifts slightly lower to ~3.95%, with the variance remaining similar due to upcoming key data releases.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider potential for unexpected geopolitical events or significant data surprises that could shift yields outside the expected range.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A stronger-than-expected jobs report or inflation data could push yields higher, while a significant "flight to safety" event could push them lower.
   - Adjustments: Given the potential for tail risks, ensure the forecast accounts for these possibilities.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecast percentiles for the UST 10Y Yield are as follows:
P10: 3.85
P20: 3.90
P40: 3.95
P60: 4.00
P80: 4.05
P90: 4.10

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 10-21, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my base rate, I'll use the current 10-year Treasury yield of 4.00% as of October 27, 2025, as my central estimate. This is appropriate because:

- For short-term forecasts (2-3 weeks out), the current yield is the most informative starting point
- Treasury yields follow a random walk in the short term, making the current value the best predictor
- The research report confirms a current yield of 4.00% as of October 27, 2025

The variance for my prior distribution comes from the reference class of "biweekly changes during Fed on-hold periods" which the research report indicates has a standard deviation of 20-25 basis points. I'll use 22.5 basis points (0.225%) as my standard deviation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- We are in a Fed "on-hold" period, similar to the reference class
- Market is in a "wait-and-see" mode regarding future Fed policy
- The economy appears to be in a "soft landing" scenario

**Differences from reference distribution:**
- The yield curve remains inverted, which is historically unusual
- Elevated fiscal deficit creates persistent upward pressure on yields
- Recent data has shown slightly softer-than-expected inflation and manufacturing
- The November FOMC meeting falls just before the forecast period, which could create volatility

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing yields lower:**
- Recent inflation data came in below consensus (October 17 CPI report), suggesting disinflationary trends remain intact (moderate downward push)
- Fed Governor comments perceived as dovish (October 8), emphasizing patience and risks of over-tightening (small downward push)
- Weaker-than-expected manufacturing PMI data (October 27) reinforcing cooling economy narrative (small downward push)
- August Jobs Report showed moderation in labor market (small downward push)

**Evidence pushing yields higher:**
- Elevated fiscal deficit creating persistent upward pressure via term premium (small upward push)
- Schwab outlook from June suggested potential for 5% yields based on persistent inflation and fiscal pressures (very small upward push, as this is older analysis)

**Neutral/stabilizing evidence:**
- Fed communications have coalesced around a "data-dependent pause," providing a strong anchor (strong stabilizing effect)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.00% with a standard deviation of 0.225%, I'll update based on the evidence:

The net effect of the evidence suggests a slight downward shift in the distribution:
- Multiple pieces of evidence point to softer economic data and dovish Fed signals
- These factors outweigh the upward pressure from fiscal concerns
- The research report suggests a posterior mean of ~3.95%

I'll shift my distribution to center at 3.95% while maintaining a similar standard deviation of 0.225%, reflecting that while the mean has shifted slightly lower, the uncertainty remains similar due to upcoming economic data releases and the November FOMC meeting.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the November FOMC meeting, which could cause significant volatility
- The forecast period includes Veterans Day (Nov 11), which could lead to exaggerated price movements due to thinner trading volumes
- I haven't fully accounted for potential geopolitical shocks that could trigger a flight to safety
- Term premium volatility could cause sudden shifts independent of economic fundamentals

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Upside scenario: If October jobs and inflation data come in much stronger than expected, yields could rise to 4.30-4.40%
- Downside scenario: A significant economic disappointment or geopolitical event could trigger a flight to safety, pushing yields down to 3.60-3.70%

**Adjustments:**
- I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these tail risks
- I'll maintain the slight downward shift in the mean based on recent evidence

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, here are my calibrated percentiles for the UST 10Y Yield for Nov 10-21, 2025:

P10: 3.65
P20: 3.75
P40: 3.90
P60: 4.00
P80: 4.15
P90: 4.25

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The forecast horizon is approximately one month from the last known data point (Oct 27, 2025) to the resolution date (Nov 21, 2025). The most informative prior is a distribution centered on the current yield, with a variance informed by historical volatility over a similar timeframe.

*   **Anchor/Mean:** The current 10-year Treasury yield is 4.00% as of October 27, 2025. This serves as a very strong anchor for a short-term forecast.
*   **Reference Class for Volatility:** The research report highlights that during Federal Reserve "on-hold" periods, the biweekly standard deviation of yield changes is approximately 20-25 bps. The forecast horizon covers roughly two biweekly periods. The total volatility can be estimated by scaling the biweekly volatility: `sqrt(2) * 22.5 bps ≈ 32 bps`.
*   **Prior Distribution:** I will model my prior as a Normal distribution with a mean of 4.00% and a standard deviation of 0.32%. This implies a 68% probability that the yield will end between 3.68% and 4.32% in one month, which is a reasonable starting point.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The current "post-hiking cycle ambiguity" aligns well with the chosen "Fed on-hold" reference class, where markets are highly sensitive to incoming economic data.
*   **Differences:** The current environment has unique features not fully captured by the base rate:
    *   **Inverted Yield Curve:** This historically signals an upcoming slowdown and rate cuts, acting as a soft ceiling on long-term yields. It makes a very large upward move less likely than a large downward move.
    *   **Elevated Fiscal Deficit:** Persistent Treasury issuance creates underlying upward pressure on yields through a higher term premium, counteracting some of the downward pressure from recession fears.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence provided in the report to adjust the prior distribution.

*   **Recent Data Momentum (Downward Pressure):** The timeline from late October shows a consistent pattern of softer-than-expected data (manufacturing PMI, Core CPI) and dovish commentary from Fed officials. This has pushed yields down from ~4.15% to 4.00%. This evidence suggests that outcomes below 4.00% are more likely than outcomes above it, as the disinflationary/slowing growth narrative has been gaining traction.
*   **Major Upcoming Catalysts (Source of Variance):** The forecast period is preceded by several key events: the October Jobs Report, the October CPI report, and a November FOMC meeting. These events are the primary sources of uncertainty and justify maintaining the ~32 bps standard deviation from the prior. A significant surprise in either direction could cause a large, rapid move.
*   **Structural Factors (Source of Skew):** The inverted yield curve and the potential for a "flight to safety" event create a plausible path for a sharp drop in yields (a fat left tail). Conversely, persistent fiscal pressures provide a floor and a slight upward push, but this is likely a weaker force in the short term compared to a major data shock.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   **Updating the Mean/Median:** My prior mean was 4.00%. The consistent stream of recent dovish evidence (softer inflation, weaker manufacturing) suggests a downward adjustment. I will shift the center of my distribution slightly lower, from 4.00% to a median (P50) of 3.95%. This reflects the idea that the recent trend is likely to persist or at least weigh on market sentiment.
*   **Updating the Variance:** The high uncertainty from the upcoming jobs and inflation reports means the variance of the distribution should remain wide. I will maintain the effective standard deviation of approximately 32 bps.
*   **Updating the Skew:** The combination of the inverted curve and "flight to safety" risks suggests the downside potential is larger than the upside potential. A very weak jobs report could trigger significant recession fears and a sharp rally in bonds (yields down). A very strong report would push yields up, but the move might be capped by the Fed's established "on-hold" stance. Therefore, I will construct a distribution with a slight negative skew, where the distance from the median to the 10th percentile is greater than the distance to the 90th percentile.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Alternative Scenario (Higher Yields):** What if the recent soft data was just noise? A surprisingly hot October CPI and a strong jobs report could quickly reverse the recent trend, causing the market to price "higher-for-longer" more aggressively. In this case, yields could challenge the 4.25%-4.50% range. My initial P90 might be too low.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Lower Yields):** What if a "black swan" event occurs? A geopolitical crisis or a financial stability scare could trigger a massive flight to quality, pushing the 10-year yield down 75-100 bps, well below my P10.
*   **Adjustment:** My initial assessment had a strong negative skew. The red team thinking suggests the upside risk, while less probable, is still significant. A major inflation surprise could have a powerful effect. I will slightly increase my upper percentiles (P80, P90) to better reflect this risk, resulting in a distribution that is still centered below 4.00% and has a fatter left tail, but acknowledges the possibility of a sharp move higher. My final P10-P90 range of 85 bps (3.50% to 4.35%) feels appropriately wide to capture the outcomes of the key upcoming data releases.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.50
P20: 3.70
P40: 3.85
P60: 4.05
P80: 4.20
P90: 4.35
