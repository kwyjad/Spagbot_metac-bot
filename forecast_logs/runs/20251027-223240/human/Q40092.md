### Reference class & base rates
*   **Long-Term Historical Average (1997-Present):** The most comprehensive reference class is the full history of the FRED series BAMLH0A0HYM2. The long-term average is 5.23% (523 bps). The median is lower, around 4.60%, indicating a right-skewed distribution with periods of extreme widening (e.g., 2008, 2020). The current level of ~2.96% is in the lowest quartile of this historical data.
*   **Post-GFC "Low Rate" Era (2010-2021):** This period was characterized by accommodative monetary policy and generally benign credit conditions. The average spread during this time was approximately 4.50% (450 bps). This class is relevant as the market is again entering a Fed easing cycle, but it doesn't capture the current inflationary context.
*   **Periods of Fed Easing Cycles:** Historically, the start of a Fed easing cycle tends to be bullish for credit, leading to spread tightening (or preventing significant widening). In the initial months following the first rate cut, spreads often remain stable or compress further as markets price in lower borrowing costs and a supportive policy backdrop. The base rate here is less a specific number and more a directional trend: stability or tightening.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-27** Spreads hover near historic lows (~2.96%) amid strong investor demand, despite a brief spike to 3.40% in March. — (↓) — Reinforces the current low-spread regime and strong technical support for the high-yield market.
*   **2025-10-24** Data shows the high-yield default rate has remained above 4% for two years, a level historically associated with wider spreads. — (↑) — Highlights a significant fundamental disconnect and a source of potential risk if sentiment shifts.
*   **2025-09-30** Q3 2025 concludes with spreads having tightened significantly, from ~2.96% to ~2.80% during the quarter. — (↓) — Demonstrates strong recent momentum towards tighter spreads, driven by market optimism.
*   **2025-09-18** The Federal Reserve initiates its first rate cut of the cycle. — (↓) — A major macro catalyst providing a powerful tailwind for credit assets and encouraging risk-taking.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** The start of an easing cycle is a powerful downward driver on spreads. Lower risk-free rates increase the appeal of credit risk for yield and reduce refinancing stress for corporations. (Large effect, currently pushing spreads down).
*   **Economic Growth Outlook:** Market expectations for a "soft landing" (slowing inflation without a major recession) are keeping default *expectations* low, even if current defaults are elevated. A surprise recession would cause spreads to widen significantly. (Large effect, currently pushing spreads down).
*   **Corporate Default Rates:** The actual rate of defaults is a direct input into the compensation investors demand. The current disconnect, with spreads tight despite high defaults, is a major tension. A sudden spike in defaults or a high-profile bankruptcy could force a repricing. (Large effect, currently pushing spreads up, but being ignored by the market).
*   **Investor Risk Appetite & Fund Flows (Technicals):** Strong demand for high-yield assets, evidenced by fund inflows, can overwhelm fundamental signals in the short term. This "reach for yield" environment is a key support for current tight spreads. (Moderate effect, currently pushing spreads down).
*   **Market Volatility (VIX):** High-yield spreads are highly correlated with broader market volatility. A low VIX reflects complacency and supports tight spreads. A spike in the VIX would almost certainly lead to wider spreads. (Moderate effect, currently supportive of tight spreads).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The Spread-Default Disconnect:** This is the most significant anomaly. The long-term historical relationship suggests that a >4% default rate should correspond to spreads well above 5.00%, not below 3.00%. This implies the market is either highly complacent or correctly pricing in a rapid economic recovery and a decline in future defaults.
*   **Start of an Easing Cycle:** Unlike a random point in history, we are at the beginning of a documented Fed easing cycle. This provides a clear, powerful, and forward-looking justification for tight spreads that may not have existed in previous periods with similar default rates.
*   **Historically Low Starting Point:** Spreads are already near the "floor" seen in the post-GFC era (around 2.50-3.00%). There is very little room for further compression, making the risk/reward asymmetric. The potential for widening is much larger than the potential for further tightening.
*   **Concentrated vs. Broad Defaults:** The elevated default rate may be concentrated in specific sectors (e.g., legacy tech, certain consumer discretionary) that the market perceives as contained, rather than signaling broad economic weakness.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the current value of ~2.96%, but with a slight upward pull towards a short-term mean, perhaps centered at **3.05%**. The equivalent n should be moderate, reflecting that spreads are "sticky" in the short-term but that the current situation is fragile.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Fed easing cycle initiated in September (↓, Large): This is the dominant narrative and provides a strong anchor for low spreads.
    *   Strong recent momentum and investor demand (↓, Moderate): Technicals are a powerful force keeping spreads tight in the near term.
    *   Historically low starting point (↓, Small): Inertia is a factor; spreads are unlikely to move much without a catalyst.
    *   Sustained elevated default rate (↑, Moderate): This is a significant counter-signal that creates fragility and skews risks to the upside (wider spreads).
    *   Asymmetric risk profile (↑, Small): With spreads so low, any negative surprise has a larger potential impact than a positive one.
*   **Net effect:** The powerful downward forces of Fed policy and market momentum are likely to outweigh the upward pressure from fundamentals in the immediate forecast window. The posterior should remain very close to the current level, perhaps shifting slightly lower to **~2.90-3.00%**, but with a fatter right tail to account for the risk of a sudden widening event.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    *   Any major corporate bankruptcy announcement, especially outside of expected sectors.
    *   A sharp spike in the VIX above 20.
    *   Hawkish commentary from FOMC members pushing back against expectations for further cuts.
    *   Weekly jobless claims trending consistently higher, signaling a weakening labor market.
    *   Significant outflows from major high-yield bond ETFs (e.g., HYG, JNK).
*   **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten):**
    *   October inflation (CPI/PCE) data coming in below expectations, cementing the case for more Fed cuts.
    *   Strong Q3 corporate earnings reports, particularly guidance for Q4 and 2026.
    *   Explicitly dovish Fed speeches confirming the path of monetary easing.
    *   A surprise uptick in GDP growth forecasts.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Short Horizon Risk:** The ~3-week forecast horizon makes the outcome highly susceptible to a single, unpredictable news event (e.g., geopolitical flare-up, unexpected credit event) which can override all fundamental analysis.
*   **The Complacency Trap:** The market's willingness to ignore high defaults could be a sign of extreme complacency. Such periods can end abruptly and violently with a rapid repricing of risk.
*   **OAS is an Average:** The index value can mask underlying stress. A small number of distressed sectors could be worsening while the broader index remains stable, creating a misleading picture of health.
*   **Data Lags:** Economic data like default rates are backward-looking. The market is a forward-looking mechanism, and the forecast depends on which one is "right."
*   **Model Limitations:** Statistical models based on historical relationships may fail when faced with the current, highly unusual disconnect between default rates and spread levels.

**Final Research Summary:**
The high-yield spread is caught in a tug-of-war between powerful dovish Fed policy and strong investor demand pushing it lower, versus worrisome underlying default rates pushing it higher. For the very short-term forecast horizon, the policy and momentum tailwinds are likely to dominate, keeping spreads anchored near their current historically low levels, though the risk is skewed towards a sudden widening.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread for the biweekly period of November 10 - November 21, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The long-term historical average of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS from 1997 to present is 5.23%, with a median of 4.60%. However, the current level is significantly lower at ~2.96%, indicating a period of tight spreads.
- **Selection Rationale:** Given the current economic context and the start of a Fed easing cycle, a more relevant base rate might be the average from the post-GFC "Low Rate" Era (2010-2021), which is approximately 4.50%. However, the current spread is even lower, suggesting a strong deviation from historical norms due to specific market conditions.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** We'll use a prior centered around the current level of 2.96% with a slight upward adjustment to 3.05% to account for potential mean reversion, acknowledging the historical average and current economic conditions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The current situation is similar to past periods of Fed easing, where spreads tend to tighten or remain stable.
- **Difference:** The current high default rate (>4%) is a significant deviation from the norm, which historically would suggest wider spreads. This creates a tension between the low spread environment and the fundamental risk indicators.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Fed Easing Cycle:** Strong downward pressure on spreads due to lower borrowing costs and increased risk-taking (Large effect, ↓).
- **Investor Demand and Momentum:** Continued strong demand for high-yield assets supports tight spreads (Moderate effect, ↓).
- **High Default Rate:** Suggests potential for wider spreads, but currently being ignored by the market (Moderate effect, ↑).
- **Starting Point and Asymmetric Risk:** Low starting point limits further tightening, with more room for widening (Small effect, ↑).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at 3.05% with moderate variance.
- **Evidence Update:** The dominant downward forces (Fed policy, investor demand) outweigh the upward pressure from defaults, suggesting a posterior slightly lower than the prior, around 2.90-3.00%, but with a fatter right tail to account for potential widening.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the risk of a sudden widening due to high defaults or unexpected events.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider the possibility of geopolitical events or a sudden spike in market volatility leading to wider spreads.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where defaults lead to a market correction could push spreads to 3.50% or higher. However, this is less likely in the immediate term given current momentum and policy support.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for the period of November 10 - November 21, 2025, are:

P10: 2.85  
P20: 2.88  
P40: 2.92  
P60: 2.96  
P80: 3.05  
P90: 3.20

# Forecasting the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Nov 10-21, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use multiple reference classes:

- **Current level (Oct 27, 2025)**: ~2.96%
- **Recent trend (Q3 2025)**: Tightened from ~2.96% to ~2.80%
- **Post-GFC "Low Rate" Era (2010-2021)**: Average ~4.50%
- **Long-term historical average (1997-Present)**: ~5.23%

Given the short forecast horizon (about 2-3 weeks from current date to Nov 10-21), I'll center my prior primarily on the current value of 2.96% with a slight pull toward recent trends. The variance should be moderate, reflecting that spreads typically don't move dramatically in short periods without catalysts.

**Prior distribution**: Mean of 2.90%, with a standard deviation of approximately 0.30%.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- We're in a Fed easing cycle, which historically supports tight spreads
- Strong technical demand for high-yield assets continues
- Market sentiment remains optimistic about a "soft landing"
- Spreads have shown stability in recent months

**Differences from base case**:
- The disconnect between tight spreads (~2.96%) and elevated default rates (>4%) is historically unusual
- Spreads are already near historical floor levels, limiting downside potential
- We're at the beginning of an easing cycle, not the middle or end
- The current spread level is in the lowest quartile of historical data

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for tighter spreads**:
- Fed initiated its easing cycle in September 2025 (strong downward pressure, likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring tighter spreads)
- Q3 2025 showed momentum toward tightening (from ~2.96% to ~2.80%) (moderate downward pressure, likelihood ratio ~2:1)
- Strong investor demand and fund flows continue to support high-yield assets (moderate downward pressure, likelihood ratio ~2:1)

**Evidence for wider spreads**:
- Default rates have remained elevated above 4% for two years (strong upward pressure, likelihood ratio ~3:1 favoring wider spreads)
- Current spread levels are historically low, suggesting limited room for further compression (moderate upward pressure, likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)
- The disconnect between fundamentals and pricing creates fragility (moderate upward pressure, likelihood ratio ~2:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 2.90% with SD of 0.30%, I'll update based on the key evidence.

First update - Fed easing cycle:
- This strongly supports tighter spreads (likelihood ratio 3:1)
- Shifts the distribution downward to approximately 2.85%
- Slightly reduces variance as this is a strong anchor

Second update - Elevated default rates:
- This strongly supports wider spreads (likelihood ratio 3:1)
- Pulls the distribution back up to approximately 2.90%
- Increases the right tail (risk of sudden widening)

Third update - Recent tightening momentum:
- This moderately supports tighter spreads (likelihood ratio 2:1)
- Shifts the distribution slightly downward to approximately 2.87%

The posterior distribution has:
- Mean: ~2.87%
- Standard deviation: ~0.35% (slightly wider than prior due to conflicting forces)
- Shape: Right-skewed (more upside risk than downside potential)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the fragility of the current tight spread environment
- The forecast window includes the U.S. presidential election aftermath, which could cause volatility
- A single high-profile bankruptcy could trigger rapid repricing
- Market technicals (fund flows) can reverse quickly with sentiment

**Alternative scenarios**:
- **Rapid widening scenario**: A negative catalyst triggers a sudden risk-off move, pushing spreads to 3.50-4.00% (10-15% probability)
- **Further tightening scenario**: Strong economic data and dovish Fed commentary drive spreads to new lows around 2.60-2.70% (15-20% probability)
- **Stability scenario**: Conflicting forces balance out, keeping spreads in a tight range of 2.80-3.00% (65-75% probability)

After considering these scenarios, I should widen my distribution slightly to account for tail risks, particularly on the upside. The short time horizon limits extreme moves, but doesn't eliminate them.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Adjusting my distribution to account for the red team analysis:

P10: 2.65%
P20: 2.75%
P40: 2.85%
P60: 2.95%
P80: 3.15%
P90: 3.40%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My primary prior is an anchor-and-adjust model based on the current value of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS. For a short-term forecast horizon of approximately four weeks, financial time series like credit spreads exhibit high autocorrelation, making the current level the most informative starting point. The current value as of October 27, 2025, is approximately 2.96%.

I will model my prior as a distribution centered near this value, specifically with a median of **3.00% (300 bps)**. This prior is not symmetric; it is right-skewed. Spreads are already near historical lows (the "floor" is around 2.40-2.50%), limiting the potential for further tightening. Conversely, shocks or changes in sentiment can cause spreads to widen rapidly and significantly (e.g., to 4.00%, 5.00%, or higher). Therefore, the prior distribution has a compressed left tail and an extended right tail.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to other "risk-on" periods (e.g., parts of 2017, 2021) where a supportive monetary policy backdrop and strong investor demand keep spreads compressed. The recent initiation of a Federal Reserve easing cycle is a powerful historical parallel for a benign credit environment.

However, the current situation is highly unusual in one critical aspect: the disconnect between fundamentals and market pricing. A sustained high-yield default rate above 4% is historically associated with much wider spreads (typically >5.00%). The market is currently pricing in a "soft landing" and a future decline in defaults, effectively ignoring the present data. This creates a significant tension and makes the current low-spread environment more fragile than in past periods where fundamentals were also strong.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the report and their likely impact on the distribution.

*   **Fed Initiates Easing Cycle (Sept 2025):** This is the most powerful piece of evidence supporting lower or stable spreads. It provides a strong tailwind for risk assets, reduces refinancing risks for companies, and anchors market sentiment. This evidence makes outcomes below 3.00% much more likely than outcomes above it. **Directional Adjustment: Strongly Downward (↓).**
*   **Strong Recent Momentum & Investor Demand:** Spreads tightened during Q3, and the report notes strong investor demand. These "technical" factors can overwhelm fundamentals in the short term. This reinforces the low-spread regime. **Directional Adjustment: Moderately Downward (↓).**
*   **Sustained Elevated Default Rate (>4%):** This is the primary evidence for higher spreads. It represents a significant fundamental risk that is currently being ignored. If a catalyst (e.g., a high-profile bankruptcy, a weak jobs report) causes the market to refocus on this risk, a sharp widening is plausible. This evidence doesn't shift the median much (as it's being ignored) but significantly fattens the right tail of the distribution. **Directional Adjustment: Increases Right-Tail Risk (↑).**
*   **Asymmetric Risk Profile:** Starting from a low base of ~2.96%, the potential for spreads to widen (e.g., by 100 bps) is much greater than their potential to tighten (e.g., by 50 bps to all-time lows). This structural feature skews the entire distribution to the right. **Directional Adjustment: Increases Skewness and Variance.**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** A right-skewed distribution with a median around 3.00%.
*   **Likelihood Update:** The powerful downward forces from the Fed's policy and market momentum are the dominant narrative. This confirms that the most likely outcomes (the central mass of the distribution) should remain in the current low range. I will update my median slightly downwards from the initial 3.00% prior to **2.95%**, reflecting the strength of these tailwinds.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The evidence of elevated defaults and asymmetric risk acts as a strong counterweight, preventing me from forecasting a significant further tightening. Instead, this evidence compels me to assign significant probability to a widening event. The posterior distribution, therefore, will be centered very near the current value (median at 2.95%) but will have a fatter right tail than the prior. The mean of the distribution will be higher than the median, reflecting this upside risk (wider spreads).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily anchored to the current market regime, assuming the Fed narrative will continue to dominate over the next month. What if I'm wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario (Bearish):** A catalyst emerges that makes the default rate impossible to ignore. For instance, a major issuer defaults unexpectedly, or October's employment data shows a sharp rise in unemployment, signaling a harder landing than expected. In this case, spreads could quickly gap out to the 3.40% level seen in the March 2025 spike, or even higher. My P90 at 3.45% is intended to capture this plausible risk.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Bullish):** October's inflation data comes in surprisingly low, cementing expectations for more aggressive Fed cuts. Combined with strong corporate earnings guidance, this could fuel a final "melt-up" in risk assets, pushing spreads down to re-test the Q3 lows around 2.80% or even lower. My P10 and P20 values account for this possibility.

My central estimate remains that inertia and the powerful Fed narrative will keep spreads range-bound. The short forecast horizon makes a full regime change less likely than a continuation of the current trend. The distribution I've constructed acknowledges the competing forces by keeping the median stable but widening the tails to reflect the fragility of the current environment.
