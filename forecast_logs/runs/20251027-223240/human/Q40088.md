### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: All biweekly periods (2010-2024).** The VIX is a mean-reverting index with a right-skewed distribution. The long-term average closing value is ~19. The maximum intraday value is typically higher. In a random biweekly period, the median maximum intraday VIX is approximately **24**. There is roughly a 25% chance the maximum exceeds **30** and a 10% chance it exceeds **35**. This is derived from analyzing historical CBOE data, focusing on the distribution of biweekly peaks.
-   **Reference Class 2: Biweekly periods in November (2010-2024, excluding 2020).** November is often a period of lower-than-average volatility, falling after Q3 earnings season and before year-end portfolio adjustments. The median biweekly maximum in these periods is slightly lower, around **22**. This class suggests a calmer baseline.
-   **Reference Class 3: Biweekly periods in post-presidential election years (e.g., 2013, 2017, 2021).** The first year of a new presidential term can bring policy uncertainty. The provided sources confirm a new Trump administration has introduced "steep tariffs," driving volatility. In these years, the baseline for volatility is elevated. The median biweekly maximum is closer to **28**, with a higher probability of spikes above 35. This class appears most relevant given the context.

*Limitations:* The current environment features a unique combination of aggressive trade policy (pushing VIX up) and a dovish Federal Reserve (pushing VIX down), making direct historical comparisons challenging.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-27] Markets anticipate a 25bps Fed rate cut this week, with a 96.7% probability priced in. ↓ — An expected rate cut reduces uncertainty and supports asset prices, typically dampening volatility.
-   [2025-10-27] The Fed Funds Rate is 4.25%, with expectations for another 50bps of cuts by year-end. ↓ — A clear and dovish monetary policy path is a strong headwind against sustained VIX elevation.
-   [2025-10-15] A U.S. Bank report notes a strong market rebound in 2025 but highlights persistent uncertainty from tariffs and potential government shutdowns. ↑ — Acknowledges that despite market strength, the key drivers of volatility from earlier in the year remain active.
-   [2025-09-17] The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by 25bps in September. ↓ — Confirms the start of the easing cycle, which has been a consistent theme calming markets in H2 2025.
-   [2025-07-11] An RSM report characterizes the first half of 2025 with "significant financial market volatility" driven by U.S. trade and fiscal policies. ↑ — Establishes that the baseline volatility for 2025 has been significantly higher than in recent years.
-   [2025-06-20] A St. Louis Fed article notes a "sharp, temporary increase in volatility" in April 2025, attributing it to changing expectations on tariffs. ↑ — Highlights the specific mechanism (tariffs) and character (sharp, sudden spikes) of volatility in the current regime.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **U.S. Trade Policy Announcements:** The primary driver of volatility in 2025. An unexpected tariff announcement or escalation in trade disputes could cause a rapid, large spike in the VIX.
-   **Monetary Policy Surprises:** The Fed is on a clear easing path. Any deviation, such as hawkish commentary or a smaller-than-expected cut in December, would be a major surprise and drive VIX higher. Effect size: Large.
-   **Key Economic Data Releases:** Inflation (CPI) and employment data are the main inputs for Fed policy. A significant upside surprise in inflation could challenge the easing narrative and cause a moderate VIX spike. The Nov 10-21 period contains CPI and PPI data.
-   **Geopolitical Shocks:** Unforeseen international conflicts or crises remain a constant, unpredictable driver that can cause large, immediate VIX spikes.
-   **Market Structure & Flows:** While Q3 earnings season will be largely complete, unexpected negative guidance from a major company could still ripple through the market. Options expiry dates can also induce short-term volatility. Effect size: Small to Moderate.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Conflicting Macro Forces:** The environment is defined by a strong conflict between dovish monetary policy (typically VIX-suppressing) and unpredictable trade policy (VIX-inflating). This is a highly unusual combination compared to historical periods.
-   **Elevated Volatility Baseline:** Sources indicate 2025 has been a year of "extreme volatility," with the VIX having fallen from 50 to 30. This suggests the market's perception of "normal" volatility is higher than the long-term average of ~19.
-   **Source of Volatility:** Unlike past spikes driven by credit crises (2008) or systemic health events (2020), the current volatility is primarily policy-driven. This can lead to more frequent, sharp, but potentially shorter-lived spikes tied to news flow.
-   **Quiet Event Calendar:** The specific Nov 10-21 period does not contain an FOMC meeting or a presidential election. While key economic data will be released, the absence of a top-tier scheduled risk event reduces the likelihood of a *predictable* catalyst during these two weeks.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A distribution based on the "post-presidential election year" reference class seems appropriate. Suggest a log-normal distribution with a median around **28** and significant right skew, reflecting the potential for policy-driven spikes. Equivalent n=10.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) **Confirmed Fed Easing:** The Fed is actively cutting rates and is expected to continue. This provides a powerful anchor against sustained volatility.
    *   (↑ Large) **Persistent Tariff Risk:** The primary driver of volatility in 2025 remains unresolved. The risk of a sudden announcement is high and not tied to the economic calendar.
    *   (↓ Moderate) **Quiet Period-Specific Calendar:** The absence of an FOMC meeting or peak earnings reports within the Nov 10-21 window lowers the probability of a scheduled catalyst.
    *   (↑ Moderate) **Higher Volatility Regime in 2025:** The market has already experienced VIX levels of 50 this year, making a spike to 30-35 seem less extreme than it would in a calmer year.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is strongly conflicting. The dovish Fed puts significant downward pressure on the median expectation. However, the tariff risk and higher baseline volatility argue for fatter tails on the upside. The posterior median should likely be revised slightly *down* from the prior of 28 (perhaps to ~26), but the probability assigned to values above 35 should remain elevated compared to a normal year.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any official statements, rumors, or social media posts from the administration regarding new or accelerated tariffs.
    *   Hawkish commentary from Fed officials in the wake of the October rate cut, questioning the path for December.
    *   October CPI/PPI data (released in mid-November) coming in significantly above expectations.
    *   A rise in the VVIX index (VIX of VIX), indicating options traders are pricing in a wider range of VIX outcomes.
    *   Escalation of any existing geopolitical tensions.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Post-October FOMC meeting commentary that strongly reaffirms the dovish path for December and 2026.
    *   Positive developments or de-escalation in U.S. trade relations.
    *   In-line or benign inflation and employment data, supporting the Fed's easing stance.
    *   Realized S&P 500 volatility remaining low in the first week of November.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Intraday vs. Closing Value:** The resolution is on the *maximum intraday* value. A fleeting news-driven panic can cause a spike of 5-10 points that quickly recedes by market close. The forecast must account for this "flash" potential.
-   **Unpredictability of Policy Shocks:** The primary upside risk (tariffs) is not tied to a predictable calendar. It can occur at any moment, making traditional forecasting based on scheduled events less reliable.
-   **VIX as an Input:** The VIX itself can influence trading behavior. A sharp rise can trigger algorithmic selling, creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop that exaggerates the peak.
-   **Data Gaps:** This analysis lacks real-time sentiment indicators, options market positioning data (e.g., put/call ratios), and the VVIX level, which would provide a more nuanced view of market expectations.
-   **Hypothetical Nature of Sources:** The analysis relies on the provided future-dated sources. Any deviation from their described economic reality (e.g., the Fed not cutting rates in October) would fundamentally alter the forecast.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast period is caught between two powerful, opposing forces: a calming, dovish Federal Reserve and an unpredictable, volatility-inducing trade policy. While the specific biweekly calendar lacks major scheduled catalysts, the background risk of a sudden policy-driven spike remains exceptionally high, suggesting a wide distribution of potential outcomes with a significant tail risk.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - For the maximum intraday value of the VIX over the biweekly period in November 2025, the most relevant base rate is the "post-presidential election year" reference class. This class has a median maximum intraday VIX of approximately 28, with a higher probability of spikes above 35 due to policy uncertainty. The distribution is right-skewed, reflecting the potential for sharp spikes.
   - Mean/Median: 28
   - Variance: High, due to right skew and potential for large spikes.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation shares the policy uncertainty characteristic of post-presidential election years, with trade policy being a significant driver.
   - Differences: The dovish Federal Reserve stance is a calming factor not typically present in past post-election years, which could suppress volatility compared to the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Fed rate cuts and dovish stance (↓ Large): Reduces volatility, making lower VIX values more likely.
   - Persistent tariff risk (↑ Large): Increases the likelihood of higher VIX values due to potential sudden announcements.
   - Quiet event calendar (↓ Moderate): Reduces the likelihood of scheduled catalysts causing spikes.
   - Elevated volatility baseline in 2025 (↑ Moderate): Increases the likelihood of higher VIX values compared to calmer years.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Start with a log-normal distribution centered around a median of 28.
   - Adjust downward due to the Fed's dovish stance, shifting the median to around 26.
   - Maintain a significant right tail due to tariff risks and elevated baseline volatility, keeping the probability of values above 35 higher than in a typical year.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could underestimate the potential for a sudden, large spike due to unpredictable policy announcements.
   - Alternative scenario: A major geopolitical event or unexpected economic data could drive the VIX higher than anticipated.
   - Adjustments: Ensure the distribution accounts for tail risks by maintaining a higher probability for extreme values.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated distribution, the percentiles are as follows:
P10: 22
P20: 24
P40: 26
P60: 28
P80: 32
P90: 36

# Forecast: Maximum Intraday VIX Value for Nov 10-21, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the reference class of "biweekly periods in post-presidential election years" since we're forecasting for Q4 2025, which follows the 2024 presidential election. According to the research report, this reference class has:
- Median biweekly maximum of approximately 28
- Higher probability of spikes above 35 compared to typical periods
- Right-skewed distribution (typical for VIX)

This base rate is appropriate because post-election years often feature policy uncertainty, which aligns with the research report's mention of "steep tariffs" and "significant financial market volatility" in 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- We're in a post-presidential election year with policy uncertainty
- Trade policy appears to be a significant driver of volatility
- The market has already experienced high volatility earlier in 2025

**Key differences:**
- The Fed is in an active easing cycle (4.25% rate with expectations for further cuts)
- The specific Nov 10-21 period lacks major scheduled risk events like FOMC meetings
- The research indicates 2025 has had "extreme volatility" with VIX reaching 50 earlier in the year
- There's an unusual combination of dovish monetary policy (VIX-suppressing) and unpredictable trade policy (VIX-inflating)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing distribution lower:**
- Fed easing cycle is well-established with a 25bps cut expected in late October (strong downward pressure)
- Clear dovish monetary path with expectations for another 50bps of cuts by year-end (moderate downward pressure)
- Absence of FOMC meeting in the Nov 10-21 window (moderate downward pressure)
- Post-Q3 earnings season timing (slight downward pressure)

**Evidence pushing distribution higher:**
- Persistent trade policy uncertainty with tariffs as a key volatility driver (strong upward pressure)
- 2025 has established a higher volatility baseline with VIX reaching 50 earlier (moderate upward pressure)
- The period contains CPI and PPI data releases that could surprise (slight upward pressure)
- Unpredictable nature of policy announcements that aren't tied to a calendar (moderate upward pressure)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 28 (median from post-election years), I need to update based on the conflicting evidence.

The strongest downward factor is the established Fed easing cycle. This significantly reduces the likelihood of monetary policy surprises, which are typically a major source of volatility. This shifts my distribution downward by approximately 2-3 points at the median.

However, the unpredictable nature of trade policy announcements and the higher baseline volatility in 2025 maintain a significant right tail risk. While the median shifts down, I need to maintain a relatively fat right tail to account for the possibility of sudden policy shocks.

After updating, my posterior distribution has:
- Median around 25-26 (down from 28)
- Maintained significant right skew
- Higher probability mass in the 30-40 range than would be typical in non-post-election years

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the calming effect of the Fed's easing cycle. If markets are primarily focused on monetary policy, the VIX could be much lower.
- Conversely, I could be underestimating the potential for a major trade policy shock. If a significant tariff announcement occurs during this period, the VIX could spike well above 40.
- The research doesn't provide detailed information about options market positioning or the VVIX (volatility of volatility), which would give better insight into market expectations.
- I haven't fully accounted for potential geopolitical shocks, which remain an ever-present tail risk.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would be a much lower median (around 22) with a thinner right tail, based on the view that November is typically a calmer month and the Fed easing cycle will dominate market sentiment. However, this seems to underweight the evidence of 2025's elevated volatility baseline and the unpredictable trade policy environment.

After considering these factors, I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for greater uncertainty, particularly in the tails.

## 6. Final Percentiles

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The research report provides several reference classes. The most relevant is **Reference Class 3: Biweekly periods in post-presidential election years (e.g., 2013, 2017, 2021)**. This class is chosen because the context describes 2025 as a year with a new administration whose policies (specifically "steep tariffs") are the primary driver of "significant financial market volatility." This reference class suggests an elevated median biweekly maximum VIX of around **28**, with a fatter right tail (higher probability of spikes) than a typical year.

However, a crucial piece of information in the report is that the VIX is currently (late October 2025) around **30**, having fallen from a high of 50 earlier in the year. This current value is a much stronger anchor than a historical reference class. Therefore, I will adjust my prior to be a distribution of the maximum VIX over a 10-day period, conditional on starting at a high level of ~30. This implies a hard floor near 30 and a strong right skew. My prior median for the maximum value would be a few points above the starting level, perhaps around **34**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is defined by two powerful, conflicting forces, which is unusual compared to most historical periods.
*   **Similarity to high-volatility periods**: The market is driven by significant, unpredictable policy risk (tariffs), which justifies the high baseline VIX of ~30 and creates the potential for sharp, sudden spikes.
*   **Difference from high-volatility periods**: Unlike periods where volatility was driven by tightening financial conditions (e.g., Fed hiking rates), the Federal Reserve is in a clear and aggressive easing cycle. This dovish monetary policy acts as a powerful suppressant, providing a "Fed put" that should dampen panic and limit the potential for sustained, extreme VIX levels.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key evidence in terms of its effect on the distribution of the maximum VIX, anchored at a starting point of ~30.

*   **(↓ Large) Confirmed Fed Easing**: The Fed has cut rates, is expected to cut again just before the forecast period, and is projected to continue cutting. This is a strong force for mean reversion, suggesting the VIX is more likely to fall from 30 than to rise significantly further. This evidence caps the upside potential and makes lower outcomes (i.e., the max value being only slightly above 30) more likely.
*   **(↑ Large) Persistent and Unpredictable Tariff Risk**: The report identifies this as the primary driver of volatility in 2025. This risk is not tied to the economic calendar and could manifest as a sudden news event, causing a sharp intraday spike. The fact that the VIX reached 50 earlier in the year on similar concerns makes a spike to 40+ highly plausible. This evidence creates a fat right tail for the distribution.
*   **(↓ Moderate) Quiet Event Calendar**: The specific period of Nov 10-21 lacks a top-tier scheduled risk event like an FOMC meeting. While CPI/PPI data will be released, the absence of a major known catalyst lowers the probability of a *predictable* spike within this window, favoring a scenario where the VIX drifts without a major breakout.
*   **(↑ Moderate) High Volatility Baseline**: Starting with a VIX of ~30 fundamentally changes the problem. It requires a much smaller shock to reach 40 than it would from a normal baseline of 15-20. This high starting point elevates the entire distribution of possible maximums.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior**: A distribution of the 10-day max VIX, starting from ~30. Median is ~34, with a floor at 30 and a fat right tail.
*   **Likelihoods**: The evidence is strongly conflicting. The dovish Fed and quiet calendar pull the distribution down toward the floor of 30. The persistent tariff risk and high baseline pull the upper tail out towards the year's previous high of 50.
*   **Posterior**: The conflicting forces result in a highly skewed distribution.
    *   **Median**: The median outcome is a modest fluctuation above the starting point. The Fed's presence should prevent a major, sustained rise on minor news. I place the posterior median around **34**.
    *   **Lower End**: The lower percentiles are compressed against the floor of ~30. There is a reasonable chance that calming news from the Fed leads to a fall in volatility, in which case the maximum for the period would be recorded on one of the first few days.
    *   **Upper End**: The upper percentiles must remain very high to account for the unpredictable tariff risk. A spike of 10-20 points is a distinct possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily dependent on the interpretation that the VIX starts the period near 30. If the late-October Fed meeting is exceptionally dovish and calms markets, the VIX could fall to ~25 before Nov 10, which would shift my entire forecast down by ~5 points. However, the report's emphasis on "persistent uncertainty" suggests the high VIX level is sticky.

The main alternative forecast would be much lower, centered around 25-28. This would prioritize the powerful effect of the dovish Fed over the tariff narrative. The rebuttal is that the market has demonstrably cared about tariffs all year, pushing the VIX to 50. It is unlikely this sensitivity has vanished.

I should also consider tail risks beyond tariffs, such as a geopolitical shock. Given the already elevated volatility regime, such a shock could have an outsized impact. My P90 should reflect the possibility of reaching the year's prior high of 50. I will set my P90 at 49 to reflect this significant tail risk.

P10: 30.5
P20: 31.5
P40: 33.0
P60: 36.0
P80: 41.0
P90: 49.0
