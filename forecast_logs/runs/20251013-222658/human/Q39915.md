### Reference class & base rates
*   **Short-term (3-week) changes from a similar starting point (yield > 3.5%):** Since 2022, when yields entered a higher regime, the average 3-week change in the 10-year yield has been close to zero, but with significant volatility. The standard deviation of 15-day trading changes is approximately 25 basis points (bps). This suggests a 68% probability that the yield will end within a 50 bps range of its starting point (e.g., 3.85% to 4.35% if starting at 4.10%).
    *   *Reasoning:* This class is most relevant as it captures the current macroeconomic regime of higher inflation and active monetary policy, unlike the preceding decade of low yields. The 3-week horizon matches the forecast period.
    *   *Limitation:* This is a short time series and may not fully capture all potential tail risks. It treats all periods as equal, whereas the forecast period contains major scheduled events.

*   **Changes during FOMC meeting weeks:** In periods of policy uncertainty, the week of a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting often sees heightened volatility. The median absolute change in the 10Y yield during these weeks is historically larger than in non-FOMC weeks. A base rate range of change for this specific period could be estimated at +/- 15-30 bps, centered on the pre-meeting trend.
    *   *Reasoning:* The resolution period (Oct 27 - Nov 7) contains a scheduled FOMC meeting (Nov 4-5). This reference class isolates the impact of the single most important known driver.
    *   *Limitation:* The market reaction depends entirely on whether the Fed's action and communication surprises expectations, which is difficult to predict.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-10:** Yield closed around 4.04-4.05% after a week of mixed economic data, easing from earlier highs. ↓ — Suggests markets are balancing inflation concerns with signs of a potential economic slowdown.
*   **2025-10-09:** 10-Year Treasury Rate reported at 4.14%. ↓ — The subsequent drop to 4.04% indicates a downward momentum entering the forecast period.
*   **2025-10-06:** Reports noted the 10-year yield fell 8 bps during September to 4.23%. ↓ — Establishes a recent peak from which yields have been declining, setting a context of potential further easing if data permits.
*   **2025-09 (late):** Federal Reserve officials maintained a hawkish tone in public statements, emphasizing data-dependence and a commitment to fighting inflation. ↑ — This underlying policy stance provides a floor for yields and could cause them to rise again on any strong economic data.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **FOMC Policy Decision & Statement (Nov 4-5):** The Fed's decision on rates and, more importantly, its forward guidance, is the primary driver. A hawkish surprise (hinting at more hikes or a longer hold) would push yields up. A dovish surprise (signaling a peak or future cuts) would push them down. (Size: Large)
*   **October Employment Report (NFP, likely Nov 7):** A strong jobs report (high payrolls, low unemployment, high wage growth) signals economic resilience and inflationary pressure, pushing yields up. A weak report would do the opposite. (Size: Large, especially as it falls on the likely resolution day).
*   **Incoming Inflation Data (e.g., PCE):** While the key October CPI report is likely after the resolution date, any other inflation indicators (like the PCE Price Index released in late October) will shape expectations. Hotter-than-expected inflation data would drive yields higher. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Geopolitical & Safe-Haven Flows:** Unforeseen geopolitical events or signs of financial instability can trigger a "flight to safety," increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries and pushing yields down. (Size: Small to Large, event-dependent)
*   **Treasury Auction Demand:** The results of Treasury auctions in late October will signal investor appetite. Weak demand (high bid-to-cover ratio) would require higher yields to clear the market. (Size: Small to Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Coincidence of Major Events:** This specific biweekly period is highly unusual as it contains both a scheduled FOMC meeting *and* the release of the monthly jobs report. This concentration of top-tier catalysts significantly increases the potential for volatility compared to a typical 3-week period.
*   **Jobs Report on Resolution Day:** The likely release of the October jobs report on Friday, November 7, means the final resolving value could experience a large, last-minute swing based on that single data point.
*   **Fed at a Potential Inflection Point:** By late 2025, the market is intensely focused on whether the Fed is done hiking and when it might begin cutting. The stakes for each FOMC meeting are higher than during a clear hiking or easing cycle, leading to greater sensitivity.
*   **Elevated Yield Level:** The starting yield of ~4.1% is historically neutral but high relative to the post-2008 era. This level reflects a significant inflation and term premium, which could compress (yields fall) or expand (yields rise) quickly based on new information.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior would be a normal distribution centered on the current yield of **~4.10%**, with a standard deviation of **~25 bps**, reflecting the historical 3-week volatility (our first reference class). This represents an "equivalent n" of moderate strength, acknowledging the recent stability but anticipating upcoming events.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **FOMC Meeting (Nov 4-5):** A hawkish hold/statement is the baseline. A surprisingly dovish tone (e.g., explicitly discussing cuts) would be a large downward update (↓). A surprisingly hawkish tone (e.g., re-opening the door to hikes) would be a large upward update (↑).
    *   **Jobs Report (Nov 7):** Payrolls well above consensus (>200k) and hot wage growth would be a moderate-to-large upward update (↑). A soft report (<100k) would be a moderate-to-large downward update (↓).
    *   **Recent Momentum:** The slight downward drift in yields in early October provides a small downward update (↓).
*   **Net effect:** The prior of 4.10% is a solid anchor, but the two major, symmetric risks (FOMC, NFP) suggest the posterior distribution should be wider than the prior. The net effect on the mean is currently balanced, with a slight tilt downwards due to recent momentum. The final value is highly contingent on the resolution of these two events.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Fedspeak in the pre-meeting blackout period (late Oct) that sounds unexpectedly hawkish.
    *   Strong weekly jobless claims or other high-frequency labor data before the Nov 7 report.
    *   Core PCE inflation (for September, released late Oct) coming in above expectations.
    *   Poor demand metrics in upcoming 2-year, 5-year, or 7-year Treasury note auctions.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Major bank earnings calls or business surveys (e.g., ISM) pointing to a sharp economic slowdown.
    *   A significant "flight-to-safety" event (e.g., geopolitical flare-up, credit event).
    *   Dovish commentary from influential Fed governors.
    *   Weaker-than-expected Q3 GDP final revision.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Event-Driven Volatility:** The forecast is less about the trend and almost entirely about the market's reaction to two specific events (FOMC, NFP). Standard models based on historical trends may fail.
*   **Resolution Day Risk:** With the jobs report likely landing on the final day of the period, the resolution could be determined by a few hours of trading and may not reflect a "settled" level.
*   **Fed Communication Nuance:** The market reaction will depend not just on the FOMC decision but on subtle word changes in the statement and the tone of the press conference, which are hard to quantify in advance.
*   **Data Revisions:** The resolving value will be based on the initially published data. Subsequent revisions to economic data will not matter for the resolution but could mean the market's initial reaction was based on a false signal.
*   **Liquidity:** Trading liquidity can be unusual around major events, potentially exaggerating price moves.

**Final Research Summary:** The 10-year yield will enter the period near 4.1%, with recent momentum suggesting a slight downward bias. However, the forecast is dominated by two major, binary-risk events within the resolution window—the Nov 5 FOMC statement and the Nov 7 jobs report—making a significant move in either direction plausible.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the 10-Year Treasury yield is centered around the current yield of approximately 4.10%, with a standard deviation of 25 basis points. This is based on the historical 3-week volatility observed since 2022 when yields entered a higher regime. This period is characterized by significant macroeconomic changes, including higher inflation and active monetary policy, making it a relevant reference class.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in terms of the macroeconomic regime of higher yields and inflation. However, it is different due to the concentration of major events (FOMC meeting and jobs report) within the forecast period, which increases the potential for volatility.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Recent downward momentum in yields provides a small downward adjustment.
   - The upcoming FOMC meeting and jobs report introduce significant uncertainty, with potential for large swings in either direction. A hawkish FOMC outcome or strong jobs report would increase yields, while dovish signals or weak employment data would decrease them.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered at 4.10% with a 25 bps standard deviation, the evidence suggests a wider distribution due to the potential impact of the FOMC meeting and jobs report. The mean remains close to 4.10%, but the variance increases to account for the heightened event-driven volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks such as unexpected geopolitical events or significant surprises in economic data is crucial. An alternative forecast could emphasize a more pronounced downward shift if the FOMC signals a dovish stance or if the jobs report is significantly weaker than expected. However, the current balanced approach accounts for both upward and downward risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the final percentiles are adjusted to reflect the increased uncertainty and potential for volatility:

P10: 3.85  
P20: 3.95  
P40: 4.05  
P60: 4.15  
P80: 4.25  
P90: 4.35

# Forecasting the UST 10Y Yield for Oct 27 - Nov 7, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the current 10-year Treasury yield level and recent volatility patterns:

- **Current yield (as of Oct 2025)**: ~4.05-4.10%
- **Historical 3-week volatility in the current regime**: Standard deviation of approximately 25 basis points

This base rate is appropriate because:
- It reflects the current market pricing, which incorporates all available information
- The post-2022 higher-yield regime is most relevant for forecasting near-term movements
- The 25bps standard deviation captures typical 3-week movements in this regime

My prior distribution is therefore centered at 4.10% with a standard deviation of 25bps.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We remain in a higher-yield regime compared to the 2010s
- The Fed continues to prioritize inflation control over growth concerns
- Market participants are closely monitoring economic data for signs of Fed policy shifts

**Key differences:**
- The forecast period contains both an FOMC meeting (Nov 4-5) and likely the October jobs report (Nov 7)
- This concentration of major market-moving events creates higher potential volatility
- The jobs report falling on the final day of the resolution period creates significant tail risk
- Recent yield momentum has been slightly downward (from 4.23% in late September to ~4.05% in mid-October)

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing yields lower:**
- Recent downward momentum in yields (4.23% → 4.05%) suggests some easing of inflation concerns or growth expectations (moderate downward pressure, ~10bps)
- By Q4 2025, the market may be increasingly focused on when the Fed will begin cutting rates rather than hiking further (small downward pressure, ~5bps)
- Any flight-to-safety flows from geopolitical events would push yields lower (small probability but large impact)

**Evidence pushing yields higher:**
- The FOMC meeting could reaffirm the Fed's commitment to keeping rates higher for longer (moderate upward pressure, ~10-15bps)
- A strong October jobs report would signal continued economic resilience and inflation pressures (moderate-to-large upward pressure, ~15-20bps)
- Treasury auction demand dynamics could require higher yields to clear the market (small upward pressure, ~5bps)

**Neutral/ambiguous evidence:**
- The specific period contains major binary events whose outcomes are uncertain
- The starting yield of ~4.10% already incorporates significant inflation and term premium

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 4.10% with SD=25bps, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **Update for recent momentum**: The downward drift suggests a small likelihood ratio favoring lower yields. This shifts my distribution center slightly downward to ~4.05%.

2. **Update for event risk**: The presence of both FOMC and jobs report increases the variance of possible outcomes. This widens my distribution to SD≈30bps.

3. **Update for resolution timing**: With the jobs report likely on the final day, there's increased tail risk in both directions. This creates slight positive skew (more upside risk than downside).

My posterior distribution is therefore centered around 4.05%, with a wider standard deviation of ~30bps, and slight positive skew.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of the FOMC meeting if the Fed signals a major policy shift
- The jobs report could show extreme values that cause outsized market reactions
- Geopolitical events could trigger significant safe-haven flows
- I might be overweighting recent momentum versus longer-term fundamentals

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would center the distribution higher at 4.20%, arguing that:
- The recent downward momentum is temporary
- The Fed will maintain a hawkish stance at the November meeting
- The jobs market will remain resilient, pushing yields back up

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While plausible, this alternative doesn't sufficiently account for the recent downward trend and the possibility that the Fed may begin signaling a more dovish stance by late 2025.

After this consideration, I'll widen my tails slightly to account for these scenarios.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.65%
P20: 3.80%
P40: 3.95%
P60: 4.15%
P80: 4.35%
P90: 4.50%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

My prior distribution is based on the short-term volatility of the 10-year Treasury yield in the current macroeconomic regime. The research report identifies a relevant reference class: 3-week changes in the 10-year yield since 2022, when yields have been above 3.5%.

*   **Reference Class:** 15-trading-day changes in the 10Y yield since January 2022.
*   **Reasoning:** This period captures the current environment of higher inflation and active Federal Reserve policy, making it more relevant than the preceding decade of low interest rates. The two-to-three-week timeframe is analogous to the forecast period.
*   **Distribution:** The report states this reference class has a standard deviation of approximately 25 basis points (0.25%). I will model my prior as a Normal distribution centered on the most recent known yield, which is approximately **4.10%**, with a standard deviation of **0.25%**. This implies a 68% probability that the yield will end between 3.85% and 4.35% under normal conditions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The forecast period exists within the same general macroeconomic regime as the reference class (2022-present). The starting yield of ~4.10% is typical for this period.
*   **Differences:** The forecast period (Oct 27 - Nov 7, 2025) is highly unusual and not a "typical" two-week period. The primary difference is the extreme concentration of market-moving events:
    1.  **FOMC Meeting (Nov 4-5):** A scheduled Federal Reserve policy meeting is one of the most significant drivers of yield changes.
    2.  **Jobs Report (Nov 7):** The monthly employment report is another top-tier economic release. Its likely release on the final day of the resolution period introduces significant last-minute volatility.
    
    This confluence of major events means the base rate's standard deviation of 25 bps, which represents an *average* period, is likely a significant underestimate of the potential volatility for this *specific* period.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate key pieces of evidence to adjust my prior.

*   **Event Concentration (Increases Variance):** The presence of both an FOMC meeting and the NFP jobs report within the two-week window is the most important factor. These events create symmetric risks; a hawkish surprise pushes yields up, while a dovish surprise pushes them down. This evidence doesn't strongly shift the mean of my forecast but argues for a much wider distribution (a higher standard deviation) than the 25 bps prior. The likelihood of a large move (>30 bps) in either direction is substantially higher than in a typical period.
*   **Recent Downward Momentum (Shifts Mean Down):** The report notes that yields have been declining in early October (from 4.23% in late Sept to ~4.05% by Oct 10). This provides weak evidence favoring a continuation of this trend, suggesting a slight downward adjustment to the central tendency of my forecast.
*   **Underlying Hawkish Fed Stance (Shifts Mean Up / Provides a Floor):** The Fed's stated commitment to fighting inflation provides a countervailing force. Any strong economic data is likely to be met with a hawkish market reaction, pushing yields up. This evidence tempers the downward momentum and supports the possibility of a sharp move higher, effectively creating a floor and providing support for the upper tail of the distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** Normal distribution centered at 4.10% with a standard deviation of 0.25%.
*   **Update 1 (Event Risk):** The primary update is to account for the massive event risk from the FOMC and NFP. A typical standard deviation for a single NFP or FOMC day can be 10-15 bps. Having both, with the potential for compounding effects, suggests the standard deviation for this specific two-week period should be significantly larger than the 25 bps average. I will increase the standard deviation to **0.35%**.
*   **Update 2 (Mean Adjustment):** The weak downward momentum is partially offset by the Fed's underlying hawkishness. I will make a small net downward adjustment to the mean of the distribution, moving it from the starting point of 4.10% to **4.08%**.
*   **Posterior Distribution:** My final posterior is a Normal distribution with a mean of **4.08%** and a standard deviation of **0.35%**. This distribution is centered slightly below the starting point but is significantly wider to reflect the high, symmetric uncertainty.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative is that the market has already priced in the range of outcomes for the FOMC and NFP, leading to a muted reaction. In this scenario, the yield would remain anchored near 4.10%, and the base rate volatility of 25 bps would be more appropriate, leading to a much narrower range (e.g., P10-P90 of 3.78% to 4.42%).
*   **Rebuttal:** While some anticipation is priced in, history shows these specific events frequently cause surprises that lead to large market moves. The "volatility is high" scenario seems more robust, especially with the NFP report landing on the final day, leaving no time for the market to digest the information.
*   **Tail Risks:** A geopolitical "flight-to-safety" event could push yields down sharply, independent of the Fed or economic data (fat left tail). Conversely, a surprisingly hot inflation report just before the period could re-ignite fears of more hikes, causing a spike (fat right tail). My widened standard deviation of 0.35% accounts for a P10-P90 range of nearly 90 bps, which I believe adequately captures these heightened, symmetric tail risks.

### 6. Final Percentiles

My final forecast is based on a Normal distribution with a mean of 4.08% and a standard deviation of 0.35%.

P10: 3.63
P20: 3.79
P40: 3.99
P60: 4.17
