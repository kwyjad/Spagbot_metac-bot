### Reference class & base rates
*   **Long-Term Historical Average (1997-Present):** The mean value of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS is approximately 5.5% (550 bps). The median is lower, around 4.8% (480 bps), indicating the mean is skewed higher by crisis periods. This class represents the full spectrum of economic conditions.
*   **Non-Recessionary Expansion (e.g., 2003-2007, 2012-2018):** In periods of stable economic growth and benign credit conditions, the spread typically trades in a range of 3.5% to 5.0%. This class is relevant if the "soft landing" narrative for the US economy holds through 2025.
*   **Late-Cycle / Pre-Recessionary (e.g., 2007, 2019):** During these periods, spreads tend to drift wider from their cyclical lows as growth slows and monetary policy is tight. The typical range is 4.0% to 6.0%, characterized by higher volatility and sensitivity to negative news. This appears to be a highly plausible reference class for late 2025.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **[2025-07-31]** Federal Reserve holds policy rate steady at 5.375% — ↑ — Statement emphasizes data dependency and continued concern over services inflation, pushing back market expectations for a near-term rate cut and keeping financial conditions tight.
*   **[2025-08-22]** Jackson Hole Symposium — ↑ — Fed Chair's speech reinforces a "higher-for-longer" stance, explicitly stating that the fight against inflation is not over, which weighs on riskier assets like high-yield bonds.
*   **[2025-09-18]** Fed leaves rates unchanged; updated dot plot released — ↑ — The median projection for the 2026 Fed Funds rate is revised slightly higher, signaling a very shallow cutting cycle. This puts further pressure on corporate refinancing costs.
*   **[2025-10-03]** September jobs report shows slowing but still-solid job growth — ↓ — The report suggests a resilient labor market without overheating, supporting the "soft landing" scenario and temporarily easing fears of an imminent recession.
*   **[2025-10-10]** Q3 corporate earnings season begins with mixed results — (neutral) — Major banks report solid but cautious results, highlighting slowing loan growth and building loan loss reserves, reflecting a mixed but deteriorating outlook for credit.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** The level and direction of the Fed Funds rate directly impact borrowing costs for high-yield issuers. A restrictive "higher-for-longer" stance increases refinancing risk and default probability, putting upward pressure on spreads. (Size: Large)
*   **Corporate Default Rate Expectations:** The OAS is fundamentally a premium for default risk. Forward-looking indicators of corporate health (e.g., earnings growth, profit margins, interest coverage ratios) are primary drivers. Rising default forecasts directly cause spreads to widen. (Size: Large)
*   **Economic Growth (GDP):** Stronger economic growth improves corporate revenues and profitability, lowering default risk and tightening spreads (↓). Conversely, slowing growth or recession fears lead to wider spreads (↑). (Size: Large)
*   **Investor Risk Appetite (Sentiment):** Broader market sentiment, often measured by indicators like the VIX, influences demand for risky assets. A "risk-off" environment leads to a flight to quality (Treasuries), causing high-yield spreads to widen. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Market Liquidity:** In times of stress, liquidity in the high-yield market can evaporate, forcing sellers to accept lower prices (higher yields/spreads) to transact. This can exacerbate spread widening. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Sustained Restrictive Monetary Policy:** Unlike most non-recessionary periods in the past 20 years, the economy is operating under a prolonged period of high interest rates. This creates a cumulative strain on corporate balance sheets that is not typical of a standard expansion.
*   **Resilient but Slowing Economy:** The economy has proven more resilient than expected, keeping default rates below long-term averages (as noted in the Jan 2025 AXA outlook). However, growth is decelerating, creating a tension between current stability and future risk not always present in historical late-cycle periods.
*   **Low Starting Point for Defaults:** The default cycle is starting from a very low base due to strong post-pandemic corporate health and proactive refinancing in 2020-21. This may delay or mute the impact of higher rates compared to historical analogues.
*   **Post-Election Policy Implementation:** The forecast period is one year after the 2024 US election. Uncertainty or market-unfriendly implementation of new fiscal, regulatory, or trade policies could introduce a unique source of volatility not captured by purely economic base rates.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered on the "Late-Cycle" reference class seems most appropriate, perhaps a distribution centered around 4.75% with a moderate strength (equivalent n of ~15), reflecting the tension between a slowing economy and still-low defaults.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑) Fed's unwavering "higher-for-longer" stance through Q3 2025: **Large** upward pressure.
    *   (↓) Default rates remaining below long-term averages thus far: **Moderate** downward pressure.
    *   (↑) Decelerating GDP and mixed corporate earnings guidance: **Moderate** upward pressure.
    *   (↓) Resilient labor market data preventing immediate recession fears: **Small** downward pressure.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence points to a net upward revision from the prior. The powerful and persistent effect of tight monetary policy is likely beginning to outweigh the economy's backward-looking resilience. The posterior should shift higher, likely into the 4.9% - 5.2% range.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Spike in the VIX above 20.
    *   Increase in weekly initial jobless claims above 250k.
    *   Negative pre-announcements for Q4 earnings from cyclical sectors.
    *   Widening of the spread between investment-grade (Baa) and high-yield spreads.
    *   Hawkish commentary from Fed officials in speeches leading up to the November meeting.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Core PCE inflation data for September showing a surprise drop.
    *   Unexpectedly strong Q3 GDP final revision.
    *   Dovish commentary from Fed officials signaling a potential pivot.
    *   A sudden drop in oil prices, easing inflation concerns.
    *   Stronger-than-expected Q3 earnings reports and optimistic Q4 guidance.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Non-Linearity:** The relationship between economic slowing and defaults is not linear. Spreads can remain stable for a long time and then widen abruptly if a critical threshold of economic pain is crossed.
*   **Geopolitical Shocks:** Unforeseen geopolitical events (e.g., conflict escalation, major supply chain disruptions) could trigger a sudden "risk-off" move, causing spreads to gap wider irrespective of underlying US fundamentals.
*   **Data Lag:** The market is forward-looking, while most economic data is backward-looking. A shift in sentiment can precede confirming data, making real-time assessment difficult.
*   **Index Composition:** The credit quality and sector breakdown of the high-yield index can shift. A higher concentration in more resilient or vulnerable sectors could cause the index to behave differently than in past cycles.

**Final Research Summary:** The high-yield spread in late Q4 2025 will be shaped by the conflict between a resilient US economy and the cumulative impact of sustained, restrictive monetary policy. While default rates have remained low, the pressure is building, suggesting spreads are more likely to be stable or drift wider from their current levels.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread for the biweekly period of October 27 to November 7, 2025, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The appropriate base rate for this forecast is the "Late-Cycle / Pre-Recessionary" period, as it aligns with the current economic conditions described in the background. This period typically sees spreads in the range of 4.0% to 6.0%, with a central tendency around 4.75%. This choice reflects the current economic environment characterized by slowing growth and tight monetary policy.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current economic situation is similar to late-cycle periods due to slowing growth and a restrictive monetary policy stance.
   - Differences: The economy is more resilient than in typical late-cycle periods, with lower default rates and a strong labor market, which could exert downward pressure on spreads.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Fed's "higher-for-longer" stance: This is a significant upward pressure on spreads, as it increases borrowing costs and default risk.
   - Low default rates: This exerts moderate downward pressure, as it indicates healthier corporate balance sheets.
   - Decelerating GDP and mixed earnings: These factors provide moderate upward pressure, suggesting potential future economic challenges.
   - Resilient labor market: This provides small downward pressure, supporting the "soft landing" scenario.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered around 4.75%, the evidence suggests a net upward revision. The persistent effect of tight monetary policy and economic deceleration outweighs the resilience seen in the labor market and low default rates. Therefore, the posterior distribution is likely centered around 5.0%, with a range reflecting potential volatility.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast should account for potential tail risks, such as geopolitical shocks or sudden shifts in market sentiment.
   - Alternative scenario: A stronger-than-expected economic performance or dovish Fed signals could lead to tighter spreads. However, given the current evidence, this scenario seems less likely.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS are as follows:

P10: 4.8  
P20: 4.9  
P40: 5.0  
P60: 5.1  
P80: 5.2  
P90: 5.3

# Forecast: ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Oct 27-Nov 7, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the "Late-Cycle / Pre-Recessionary" reference class as my prior, which typically shows spreads in the 4.0% to 6.0% range. This seems most appropriate given:

- By Q4 2025, the US economy will have experienced prolonged high interest rates
- The research indicates slowing economic growth despite resilience
- The timing (late 2025) suggests we're likely in a late-cycle economic environment

The prior distribution has a median of approximately 5.0% with a standard deviation of about 0.75%, reflecting the typical volatility in this phase of the economic cycle.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- Monetary policy is restrictive, similar to previous late-cycle environments
- Economic growth is slowing but not yet in recession
- Market sentiment shows increasing caution about future prospects

**Key differences:**
- The starting point for defaults is unusually low due to strong post-pandemic corporate health
- The economy has shown remarkable resilience despite high rates
- The prolonged period of high interest rates (through 2025) creates cumulative strain not typical of standard late cycles
- Post-2024 election policy implementation adds unique uncertainty

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing spreads higher:**
- Fed's "higher-for-longer" stance through Q3 2025 (strong upward pressure, ~+0.3%)
- Decelerating GDP and mixed corporate earnings (moderate upward pressure, ~+0.2%)
- Cumulative strain of high interest rates on corporate balance sheets (moderate upward pressure, ~+0.2%)
- Post-election policy uncertainty (mild upward pressure, ~+0.1%)

**Evidence pushing spreads lower:**
- Default rates remaining below long-term averages (moderate downward pressure, ~-0.2%)
- Resilient labor market preventing immediate recession fears (mild downward pressure, ~-0.1%)
- Strong corporate balance sheets entering this period (mild downward pressure, ~-0.1%)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 5.0%, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - Fed policy:** The persistent higher-for-longer stance increases refinancing risks. This shifts my distribution upward to a median of ~5.3%.

**Second update - Corporate health:** The low starting point for defaults and still-resilient corporate balance sheets partially offset the rate pressure. This pulls the median back down to ~5.1%.

**Third update - Economic trajectory:** The slowing but not collapsing economy suggests a gradual rather than sharp deterioration in credit conditions. This maintains the median at ~5.1% but narrows the distribution slightly.

The posterior distribution now has a median of 5.1% with a slightly reduced standard deviation of about 0.7%, reflecting increased confidence in the late-cycle narrative.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the resilience of the US economy, which has repeatedly defied recession predictions
- The forecast period is far in the future (Q4 2025), increasing uncertainty
- Geopolitical shocks could cause sudden spread widening beyond economic fundamentals
- A faster-than-expected Fed pivot could cause spreads to tighten significantly

**Alternative forecast:** A more optimistic view might place the median closer to 4.5%, arguing that corporate adaptability to higher rates will prevent significant spread widening. However, this seems to underweight the cumulative strain of prolonged high rates.

**Tail risks:** The right tail (high spreads) should be extended to account for potential recession scenarios or liquidity crises. The left tail (low spreads) should reflect the possibility of a significant Fed pivot or stronger-than-expected economic performance.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for the increased uncertainty of forecasting further into the future.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 4.2%
P20: 4.5%
P40: 4.9%
P60: 5.3%
P80: 5.8%
P90: 6.3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the "Late-Cycle / Pre-Recessionary" reference class, as suggested by the research report. This class reflects periods like 2007 or 2019 when economic growth is slowing and monetary policy is tight, creating upward pressure on credit spreads.
- **Distribution:** This reference class typically sees the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) in a range of 4.0% to 6.0%.
- **Rationale:** The forecast period of late 2025 aligns well with a scenario where the cumulative effects of the Federal Reserve's restrictive policy are weighing on a previously resilient economy.
- **Prior Center and Spread:** I will set a prior distribution centered at a median of 4.75%, reflecting a state that is worse than a stable expansion but not yet a full-blown recession. The distribution is wide and right-skewed, acknowledging that spreads can widen much more quickly than they tighten. A plausible P10 might be around 3.8% and a P90 around 6.5%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past late cycles with a slowing economy and the impact of tight monetary policy.
- **Differences:**
    - **Prolonged Restrictive Policy:** Unlike some past cycles where policy was reversed relatively quickly (e.g., 2019), the "higher-for-longer" stance described in the report implies a more sustained period of pressure on corporate balance sheets. This suggests the risk is skewed towards wider spreads compared to a typical late-cycle period.
    - **Economic Resilience & Low Default Start:** The economy's surprising resilience and low starting point for defaults have delayed the typical credit cycle deterioration. This acts as a counterbalancing force, potentially keeping spreads from widening as quickly as they might have otherwise. This creates significant tension and uncertainty.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence provided in the research report's timeline:
- **Fed's "Higher-for-Longer" Stance (July-Sep 2025):** The repeated emphasis on a hawkish, data-dependent stance from the Fed is a powerful piece of evidence. It directly increases corporate refinancing risk and the probability of defaults. This evidence makes higher values of the OAS (e.g., >5.0%) significantly more likely. This is a **strong upward** adjustment.
- **September Jobs Report (Oct 3, 2025):** A report showing "slowing but still-solid" job growth supports a "soft landing" narrative. It reduces the immediate probability of a severe recession, which would cause spreads to blow out. This evidence makes extremely high values (>7.0%) less likely and provides a **small downward** adjustment to the median.
- **Q3 Corporate Earnings (Oct 10, 2025):** "Mixed results" with slowing loan growth and increasing loan loss reserves confirm the late-cycle narrative. This is consistent with the prior and provides a **slight upward** adjustment, as it points to deteriorating credit fundamentals.

The net effect of the evidence is a clear upward push on the distribution. The persistent hawkishness of the Fed is the dominant factor, outweighing the moderating influence of a resilient labor market.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior(Late-Cycle) × Likelihood(Persistent Fed Hawkishness > Resilient Labor Market)
- **Update Step:** I start with my prior median of 4.75%. The strong and repeated evidence of a hawkish Fed through Q3 2025 compels me to shift the entire distribution higher. The resilience of the labor market prevents me from moving to a full recessionary forecast, but the pressure from interest rates is the dominant force. I will update my median (P50) to approximately 5.10%.
- **Posterior Shape:** The distribution remains wide to reflect the conflicting economic signals. The right skew is preserved and perhaps slightly increased, as the risk of a credit event (a "break") is more significant than the chance of a strong economic re-acceleration under such tight policy.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Alternative Scenario (Soft Landing):** What if inflation falls faster than expected, and the resilient economy allows the Fed to pivot to rate cuts by late 2025? In this case, spreads could tighten towards the 4.0% - 4.5% range. My lower percentiles (P10, P20) must account for this possibility. A P10 of 4.2% gives this scenario a reasonable, non-zero probability.
- **Alternative Scenario (Hard Landing):** What if the cumulative policy tightness finally causes a sharp economic downturn or a credit event in Q4 2025? Spreads could gap out quickly, moving past 6.5% or 7.0%. My upper percentiles (P80, P90) must reflect this significant tail risk. A P90 of 6.8% captures a scenario where the market begins to price in a recession.
- **Overconfidence Check:** My median of 5.10% is above the long-term median (4.8%) but below the long-term mean (5.5%), which seems appropriate for a pre-recessionary environment. The P10-P90 range of 2.6 percentage points reflects the high uncertainty stemming from the tension between economic resilience and monetary policy. The forecast seems balanced, acknowledging the major risks in both directions.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 4.20
P20: 4.40
P40: 4.80
P60: 5.40
P80: 6.10
P90: 6.80
