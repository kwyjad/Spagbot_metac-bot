### Reference class & base rates
*   **Recent High-Frequency Period (2020-Present):** From August 2020 to November 2025 (a period of ~5.25 years), there have been at least 9 successful coups in Africa (Mali x2, Guinea, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon, Sudan x2) and zero in Latin America. This yields an average rate (λ) of approximately 1.7 successful coups per year. For the 4.3-month resolution window (Aug 21, 2025 - Dec 31, 2025, or ~0.36 years), a simple Poisson model (P(k≥1) = 1 - e^(-λt)) suggests a base rate of **~46%**. This class is highly relevant due to its recency.
*   **Post-Cold War Era (1991-2019):** This period saw a general decline in coup frequency. Across both continents (~74 countries), the average rate of successful coups was roughly 1.1 per year. Using this rate, the base probability for the resolution window would be **~33%**. This class provides a longer-term, more stable baseline but may understate current risks.
*   **Combined Reference Class:** A weighted average of the two, giving more weight to the recent period, suggests a base rate in the **35-45%** range. The key limitation is whether the recent spike is a new, stable regime of high instability or a temporary anomaly.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-27** Chad's transitional government postpones presidential elections, citing security concerns, sparking opposition protests and military deployments in N'Djamena. (↑) — Postponed elections are a classic coup trigger, signaling incumbent entrenchment and increasing political tension.
*   **2025-09-15** ECOWAS formally lifts remaining sanctions on Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, accepting the juntas' prolonged transition timelines in exchange for security cooperation. (↑) — This signals a significant weakening of regional anti-coup norms and reduces the punitive cost for future coup plotters.
*   **2025-08-05** The Bolivian military's high command is reshuffled by President Arce following intelligence reports of continued unrest within the officer corps after the failed 2024 attempt. (↑) — Indicates deep-seated military discontent and ongoing plotting, even if the last attempt failed.
*   **2025-07-22** Haiti's transitional council secures a deal for a larger Kenyan-led security force deployment, which begins to pacify key areas of Port-au-Prince. (↓) — A marginal improvement in the security vacuum reduces the opportunity and justification for a military seizure of power, though the state remains exceptionally fragile.
*   **2025-06-10** The African Union's Peace and Security Council issues a statement condemning "unconstitutional changes in government" but fails to agree on concrete new enforcement mechanisms. (↔) — Reinforces existing rhetoric but demonstrates a continued lack of effective institutional power to deter coups.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Security Crisis & Insurgency (Large):** Military frustration with civilian governments' inability to contain violent extremism (especially in the Sahel) or powerful criminal gangs (in parts of Latin America) serves as a primary justification and catalyst for coups.
*   **Contested Elections & Term Limit Extensions (Large):** Incumbents manipulating constitutional or electoral processes to extend their rule erodes their legitimacy and often provokes a military intervention, frequently framed as a restoration of democracy or constitutional order (e.g., Guinea 2021, Gabon 2023).
*   **Coup Contagion & Weakened Norms (Moderate):** Successful, unreversed coups in neighboring countries create a powerful demonstration effect. The failure of regional bodies like ECOWAS and the AU to restore civilian rule has significantly lowered the perceived cost of intervention for other militaries.
*   **Geopolitical Competition (Moderate):** The availability of non-Western partners (e.g., Russia, China, Gulf states) provides alternative sources of diplomatic, economic, and military support for new juntas, mitigating the impact of sanctions and condemnation from Western powers.
*   **Economic Distress (Small-Moderate):** High inflation, youth unemployment, and perceived corruption fuel popular discontent, making the public more receptive to extra-constitutional changes in government. While rarely the sole trigger, it creates a permissive environment.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Geographic Concentration:** Unlike the geographically dispersed coups of the Cold War, the recent wave is intensely concentrated in the "Sahel coup belt" (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger), creating a contiguous bloc of military-led states that can mutually support one another.
*   **Shifting Public Opinion:** Recent coups in the Sahel have been met with significant popular support, driven by anti-incumbent and anti-French sentiment. This public backing provides a legitimacy buffer for juntas that was less common in previous decades.
*   **Ineffective Regional Deterrence:** The post-Cold War base rate was established when regional bodies like ECOWAS were perceived as having a credible "red line" against coups. This deterrent has been severely eroded by the string of successful and sustained military takeovers since 2020.
*   **Resilience in Latin America:** While political instability, democratic backsliding, and even coup *attempts* (Peru, Brazil, Bolivia) have occurred, Latin American civil and military institutions have thus far proven more resilient to *successful* military coups than their African counterparts in this recent period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **40%** seems appropriate, derived from a blend of the recent high-frequency period and the longer-term post-Cold War average, with an equivalent n of ~15 observations reflecting moderate confidence in this baseline.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The demonstrated failure of ECOWAS and the AU to reverse recent coups has created a state of permissive deterrence, significantly increasing the likelihood that plotters elsewhere will succeed.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The persistence of the core drivers—jihadist insurgencies in the Sahel, contentious elections in fragile states like Chad—maintains a high-risk environment.
    *   (↑ Small) Geopolitical shifts continue to provide potential juntas with alternatives to Western partnerships, lowering the cost of a takeover.
    *   (↓ Small) Latin America's continued, albeit strained, institutional resilience against successful military takeovers slightly dampens the overall probability across the combined region.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the high-risk environment of the early 2020s is not abating but is becoming entrenched. The posterior should be adjusted significantly upwards from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Arrest or flight of a prominent opposition leader in a fragile state.
    *   Reports of mutinies or unusual troop movements near a capital city.
    *   Sudden, unexplained dismissal of a country's chief of defense staff or head of the presidential guard.
    *   An incumbent's announcement of a referendum to amend the constitution to extend their term.
    *   A major military defeat at the hands of insurgents, leading to public criticism of the government.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Successful, internationally-verified peaceful elections in a country previously considered high-risk (e.g., Chad).
    *   A new, binding security pact between a fragile government and a major international power.
    *   The successful prosecution and conviction of leaders of a prior failed coup attempt (e.g., in Bolivia).
    *   A significant and sustained decline in commodity prices that strains the budgets of military-led states, demonstrating the costs of isolation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The line between a coup, a "constitutional coup," a popular uprising supported by the military, or a self-coup can be blurry. Resolution will depend on how "credible media reports" interpret the Powell & Thyne definition.
*   **Black Swan Nature:** Coups are inherently difficult to predict in specific times and places. Our forecast is for "at least one in ~74 countries," which is a much easier proposition, but still subject to high uncertainty.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Coup plots are, by nature, secret. The most critical information is unavailable until the event occurs. We are forecasting based on observable environmental factors, not direct intelligence.
*   **Short Time Window:** The 4.3-month period is very specific. A coup occurring in July 2025 or January 2026 would resolve this question as "No," making the forecast highly sensitive to the exact timing of events.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate of successful coups has been elevated since 2020, primarily in Africa

To forecast the probability of a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate:** The recent high-frequency period (2020-present) suggests a base rate of approximately 1.7 successful coups per year in Africa, with no successful coups in Latin America. For the 4.3-month resolution window, this translates to a base rate of ~46% using a Poisson model. A combined reference class, considering both recent trends and the post-Cold War era, suggests a base rate in the 35-45% range. Given the recent spike in coups, a prior centered around 40% is appropriate.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the recent high-frequency period, with ongoing political instability, security crises, and weakened regional deterrence mechanisms.

**Differences:** The geographic concentration of coups in the Sahel region and the resilience of Latin American institutions are notable differences. The recent geopolitical shifts and public support for coups in some African regions also differentiate the current environment from the post-Cold War era.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Postponed Elections in Chad (↑):** Postponed elections are a classic trigger for coups, increasing the likelihood of a coup.
- **ECOWAS Sanctions Lifted (↑):** Weakening of regional anti-coup norms increases the likelihood of coups.
- **Bolivian Military Reshuffle (↑):** Indicates ongoing military discontent, increasing the likelihood of a coup.
- **Haiti Security Improvement (↓):** Reduces the likelihood of a coup in Haiti, though the state remains fragile.
- **AU Statement (↔):** Reinforces rhetoric but lacks enforcement, maintaining the status quo.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

**Prior Probability:** 40% (0.4 in probability terms)

**Likelihood Ratios:**
- **Chad Elections:** Increases probability (LR > 1)
- **ECOWAS Sanctions:** Increases probability (LR > 1)
- **Bolivian Military:** Increases probability (LR > 1)
- **Haiti Security:** Decreases probability (LR < 1)

**Posterior Probability Calculation:**
- Adjusting the prior upwards due to the evidence of increased coup likelihood in Africa, particularly in the Sahel region, and ongoing military discontent in Latin America.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

**Overconfidence Check:** The forecast must consider the inherent unpredictability of coups and the short time window. The possibility of no coups occurring within the specified period remains significant.

**Alternative Scenarios:** A peaceful resolution of political tensions or successful international interventions could reduce the likelihood of coups.

**Adjustment:** Given the evidence and potential for unforeseen events, a slight upward adjustment from the prior is warranted, but caution is necessary due to the short time frame.

### 6. Final Forecast

Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unforeseen events, the final forecast is:

Final: 55%

# Will there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I'll analyze historical coup frequencies in Africa and Latin America, focusing on recent patterns.

**Recent High-Frequency Period (2020-Present):**
- At least 9 successful coups in Africa over ~5.25 years (Mali x2, Guinea, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon, Sudan x2)
- No successful coups in Latin America during this period
- This yields approximately 1.7 successful coups per year

**Post-Cold War Era (1991-2019):**
- Lower frequency of about 1.1 successful coups per year across both regions

For our time window (August 21, 2025 - December 31, 2025), which is approximately 4.3 months or 0.36 years, I can apply a Poisson model:
- Using recent rate (1.7/year): P(k≥1) = 1 - e^(-1.7×0.36) ≈ 46%
- Using longer-term rate (1.1/year): P(k≥1) = 1 - e^(-1.1×0.36) ≈ 33%

Given the persistence of recent coup-conducive conditions, I'll weight the recent period more heavily, setting a prior of **42%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The core drivers of coups remain present: security crises (especially in the Sahel), contested elections, economic distress, and weakened regional deterrence mechanisms
- The geographic concentration in the "Sahel coup belt" continues to create contagion effects
- Military frustration with civilian governments' handling of insurgencies remains high

**Differences from base case:**
- The time window is relatively short (4.3 months), which reduces the probability compared to a full year
- Regional bodies like ECOWAS have shown even less ability to deter or reverse coups, as evidenced by the September 2025 lifting of sanctions on Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso
- Recent reshuffling of Bolivia's military high command (August 2025) suggests ongoing instability in a Latin American country with a recent coup attempt
- Chad's postponement of elections (October 2025) creates a high-risk situation that wasn't present in earlier periods

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: ECOWAS formally lifted remaining sanctions on Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If coups are likely to occur, we would expect to see regional bodies abandoning punitive measures against previous coup leaders
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even if coups weren't likely, ECOWAS might still prioritize security cooperation over democratic principles
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.8 (increases probability)

**Evidence 2: Chad's transitional government postponed presidential elections (October 2025)**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Postponed elections are a classic coup trigger
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.4) - Without coup risk, such postponements would be less common
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (increases probability)

**Evidence 3: Bolivian military high command reshuffled following intelligence reports of unrest (August 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Ongoing military discontent is consistent with coup risk
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Reshuffles can also be routine or preventative measures
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4 (slightly increases probability)

**Evidence 4: Haiti's transitional council secured larger security force deployment (July 2025)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Even with coup risk, some countries might improve security
- P(E|~H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Improved security reduces coup opportunities
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7 (slightly decreases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 42:58 (0.42/(1-0.42) = 0.724)

First update (ECOWAS sanctions lifting):
- Posterior odds = 0.724 × 1.8 = 1.303
- Posterior probability = 1.303/(1+1.303) ≈ 0.57 or 57%

Second update (Chad election postponement):
- Posterior odds = 1.303 × 2.0 = 2.606
- Posterior probability = 2.606/(1+2.606) ≈ 0.72 or 72%

Third update (Bolivian military reshuffling):
- Posterior odds = 2.606 × 1.4 = 3.648
- Posterior probability = 3.648/(1+3.648) ≈ 0.78 or 78%

Fourth update (Haiti security improvement):
- Posterior odds = 3.648 × 0.7 = 2.554
- Posterior probability = 2.554/(1+2.554) ≈ 0.72 or 72%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence factors:**
- The short time window (4.3 months) makes specific timing crucial - coups are unpredictable in exact timing
- I may be overweighting recent events and underestimating institutional resilience
- The evidence points strongly to risk factors but not to specific plots
- Latin America has shown greater resistance to successful coups despite attempts

**Alternative forecast:**
A more conservative forecaster might argue for ~50-55%, noting that:
- Coups often require specific triggering events that may not occur in this window
- The base rate calculation might overstate the probability for such a short period
- Regional bodies, despite weaknesses, still create some deterrent effect
- Most high-risk countries have already experienced coups recently

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While timing is uncertain, multiple countries show immediate risk factors:
- Chad's election postponement creates an acute crisis within our time window
- The lifting of ECOWAS sanctions removes a key deterrent precisely during our period
- The concentration of coups in the Sahel has created a self-reinforcing dynamic
- Historical data shows coups often cluster temporally

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly downward to account for the short time window and timing uncertainty, from 72% to 68%.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 68%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks for the probability of at least one successful coup in Africa or Latin America within a specific time window: August 21, 2025, to December 31, 2025. This is a period of 133 days.

To establish a prior, I will use a Poisson process model based on historical frequencies. The research report identifies two relevant reference classes:
*   **Post-Cold War Era (1991-2019):** A lower rate of ~1.1 successful coups per year.
*   **Recent High-Frequency Period (2020-Present):** A significantly higher rate of ~1.71 successful coups per year (9 coups in ~5.25 years).

The recent period is a more appropriate reference class because the underlying conditions that drove this spike—namely, the "coup contagion" in the Sahel, the demonstrated ineffectiveness of regional bodies like ECOWAS to reverse takeovers, and ongoing security crises—persist today. Therefore, I will select the higher rate, **λ = 1.71 successful coups per year**, as the basis for my prior.

For the full 133-day window (t = 133/365.25 ≈ 0.364 years), the expected number of coups (μ) would be λ * t = 1.71 * 0.364 ≈ 0.622. The probability of at least one coup is given by P(k≥1) = 1 - e^(-μ).

*   Initial Prior P(H) = 1 - e^(-0.622) ≈ 46%. This is the prior probability of a coup happening *at some point* in the 133-day window, as viewed from before the window started.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation remains highly comparable to the recent high-frequency base case. The drivers identified in the research report, such as security vacuums in the Sahel, contested elections (e.g., the situation in Chad), and weakened international anti-coup norms, are all still present.

The most significant difference from the initial base case is the passage of time. As of today, November 18, 2025, approximately 90 days of the 133-day window have passed without a successful coup. The forecast must be conditioned on this crucial fact.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The primary piece of evidence is that **no successful coup has occurred in the first 90 days of the resolution window**. This evidence drastically reduces the probability from the initial prior because the time remaining for the event to occur has shrunk by about 68%.

We must evaluate how likely this 90-day quiet period is, given our assumed high rate of coups (λ = 1.71).
*   P(No coup in 90 days | λ=1.71) = e^(-1.71 * (90/365.25)) = e^(-0.42) ≈ 66%.
A 90-day period with no coups is a very likely outcome even in a high-risk environment. Therefore, this evidence does not compel me to revise my estimate of the underlying rate (λ) downwards. It simply means we must now calculate the probability for the much shorter remaining time.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The task is to update the initial 46% probability based on the evidence that no coup occurred in the first 90 days. Using a Poisson model, which has a memoryless property, the probability of an event in a future interval is independent of the absence of events in a past interval.

Therefore, the problem simplifies to calculating the probability of a coup in the **remaining 43 days** (November 19 to December 31, 2025).

*   **Prior:** The underlying coup rate is λ = 1.71 coups/year.
*   **Evidence:** No coup in the first 90 days.
*   **Update:** Calculate the probability for the remaining time window.
    *   Time remaining (t_rem) = 43 days / 365.25 days/year ≈ 0.118 years.
    *   Expected number of coups in the remaining window (μ_rem) = λ * t_rem = 1.71 * 0.118 ≈ 0.202.
    *   Posterior Probability = P(k≥1 in remaining 43 days) = 1 - e^(-μ_rem) = 1 - e^(-0.202).
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 1 - 0.817 = 0.183.

The probability of a successful coup in the remaining time is approximately 18.3%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider potential flaws in this reasoning. The primary assumption is that the coup rate (λ) is constant. In reality, risk is lumpy, often clustering around trigger events like contentious elections. The situation in Chad, mentioned in the report, could represent such a trigger. However, without specific intelligence of an imminent plot, the statistical average is the most robust approach.

An alternative view is that the 90-day quiet period *is* evidence that the true rate is lower than 1.71 coups/year. If we had used the blended rate from the report's prior (implying λ ≈ 1.40), the final probability would be closer to 15%.

However, the qualitative evidence from the report (weakened ECOWAS, ongoing instability) strongly supports the idea that the high-risk environment persists. The 90-day lull is not statistically significant enough to discard the high base rate. Therefore, I will stick with the forecast derived from the higher rate. The 18% figure correctly balances the high underlying risk with the substantially shortened time window.

### Final Forecast
My forecast is based on the historical rate of successful coups from the recent high-risk period (2020-present) applied to the remaining 43-day window of the question. The initial ~46% probability for the full 133-day period is significantly reduced by the fact that 90 days have already passed without an event.

Final: 18%
