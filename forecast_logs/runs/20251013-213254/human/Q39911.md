### Reference class & base rates
-   **Full History (1997-Present):** The long-term median for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS (BAMLH0A0HYM2) is approximately 4.80%, with a mean of 5.23%. This class includes multiple economic cycles, including major crises (2000, 2008, 2020), and represents the broadest possible base rate. Its limitation is that it averages extreme, crisis-driven widening with periods of calm, potentially overstating the "normal" level.
-   **Non-Recessionary/Stable Growth Periods (e.g., 2004-2006, 2017-2018, 2021-Present):** In periods without imminent recessionary threats or major systemic shocks, spreads typically trade in a tighter range. A visual inspection of the FRED chart suggests a base rate range of **3.25% to 4.50%** for these environments. This class is more relevant given the current economic context described in the sources (resilience, solid fundamentals).
-   **Recent History (Last 24 Months, Q4 2023 - Q4 2025):** This period has been characterized by post-tightening cycle stability and relatively strong corporate performance. Spreads have been consistently below the long-term average. The median value over this period is approximately **3.40%**. This class is useful for capturing current market structure and sentiment but may understate the potential for a regime shift.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-10-09** Latest OAS reading at 2.95%. (→) — Establishes the current, historically tight baseline just weeks before the resolution period.
-   **2025-09-17** Federal Reserve holds policy rate steady, signaling a data-dependent "higher for longer" stance. (↑) — Reduces likelihood of imminent rate cuts that would support credit, adding modest pressure for wider spreads.
-   **2025-08-14** Q2 2025 corporate earnings season concludes stronger than expected. (↓) — Reinforces the narrative of corporate resilience and solid fundamentals, supporting tight credit spreads.
-   **2025-07-16** Core CPI data for June shows inflation remains persistent, slightly above consensus. (↑) — Fuels concerns, noted by AXA IM, that the Fed may have limited room to ease, a key risk for high-yield issuers.
-   **2025-06-24** Lord Abbett publishes analysis highlighting "continued resilience" in high yield. (↓) — Influential market commentary supports investor confidence and contributes to keeping spreads tight.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Federal Reserve Monetary Policy:** The Fed's policy stance is a primary driver. A hawkish tone or unexpected rate hike would increase borrowing costs and recession risk, causing spreads to widen (large effect, ↑). A dovish pivot or rate cut would signal support, tightening spreads (large effect, ↓).
-   **Economic Growth Outlook:** Forward-looking indicators of economic health (e.g., ISM PMI, jobless claims, GDP forecasts) directly impact default expectations. Signs of slowing growth or recession widen spreads (large effect, ↑), while signs of robust growth tighten them (large effect, ↓).
-   **Corporate Default Rate Trajectory:** The actual and forecasted rate of corporate defaults is a direct input into the risk premium. An uptick in defaults or negative credit rating migration widens spreads (large effect, ↑). Stable or falling defaults support tight spreads (large effect, ↓).
-   **Investor Risk Appetite & Fund Flows:** Broader market sentiment (e.g., VIX index) and flows into or out of high-yield bond funds can create technical pressure. A "risk-off" event drives outflows and widens spreads (moderate effect, ↑), while strong inflows tighten them (moderate effect, ↓).
-   **Inflation Data:** Unexpected inflation prints influence the Fed's reaction function. Higher-than-expected inflation suggests a more restrictive Fed, widening spreads (moderate effect, ↑). Lower inflation allows for a more accommodative stance, tightening spreads (moderate effect, ↓).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Historically Tight Spreads:** The current OAS of 2.95% is significantly below the long-term median (~4.80%) and even the non-recessionary median (~3.75%). This suggests the market is pricing in very low risk, leaving little room for further compression and creating asymmetric risk to the upside (widening).
-   **Improved Underlying Credit Quality:** As noted by Lord Abbett, the composition of the high-yield index has improved over the years. A higher concentration of BB-rated ("higher quality junk") issuers compared to past cycles may justify structurally tighter spreads than the historical average.
-   **Persistent Inflationary Backdrop:** Unlike the disinflationary environments of the 2010s, the current period faces lingering inflation risk (per AXA IM). This creates a novel tension, as strong growth (good for credit) could also fuel inflation, forcing the Fed to remain restrictive (bad for credit).
-   **Maturity Wall Dynamics:** Many corporations refinanced debt at ultra-low rates in 2020-2021. This has insulated them from the immediate impact of higher rates, suppressing default risk for now. However, a "maturity wall" approaches in 2026-2027, which could become a focus for markets.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior centered on the non-recessionary base rate seems most appropriate. Suggest a distribution centered at **3.75%** with significant mass between 3.25% and 4.50% (equivalent n ≈ 10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The current market level of 2.95% and recent momentum provide a powerful anchor, suggesting the market has strong conviction in the low-risk narrative.
    -   (↓ Moderate) Reports of solid corporate fundamentals and improved credit quality provide a fundamental justification for spreads to be tighter than the historical average.
    -   (↑ Moderate) Persistent inflation and the resulting "higher for longer" Fed stance act as a countervailing force, placing a floor under spreads and creating risk of a snapback.
    -   (→ Small) Recent economic data has been stable, not providing a strong catalyst for a breakout in either direction in the immediate term.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pulls the prior downwards. The posterior should be significantly lower than the 3.75% prior, likely centered just above the current 2.95% level (e.g., in the **3.05% - 3.25%** range) to account for slight mean reversion and asymmetric risks.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (spreads widen):**
    -   October jobs report (released early Nov) showing a sharp rise in unemployment.
    -   Q3 2025 earnings reports (ongoing) with widespread negative guidance for Q4.
    -   A spike in the VIX index above 20, signaling a broader "risk-off" shift.
    -   Unexpectedly high CPI/PCE inflation data for September/October.
    -   Hawkish commentary from key Fed officials.
-   **DOWN indicators (spreads tighten):**
    -   Clear signs of a "soft landing" in incoming GDP and inflation data.
    -   Dovish pivot in Fed communications, hinting at potential rate cuts in early 2026.
    -   Exceptionally strong corporate earnings and upward revisions to guidance.
    -   A sustained drop in the VIX index below 15.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Asymmetric Risk Profile:** With spreads near historical lows (2.41%), the potential for significant further tightening is limited, while the potential for a sharp widening event is substantial.
-   **Lagged Policy Effects:** The full economic impact of the Fed's tightening cycle may not have fully materialized. A sudden slowdown could catch the market by surprise.
-   **Geopolitical/Exogenous Shocks:** Unforeseen geopolitical events or a crisis in another market segment could trigger a rapid flight to safety, causing spreads to widen irrespective of US corporate fundamentals.
-   **Liquidity Risk:** High-yield markets can be less liquid than equities or Treasuries. In a stress event, spreads can "gap out" quickly as liquidity evaporates.
-   **Data Measurement:** The resolution is the final daily value. A single day's market volatility at the end of the period could determine the outcome, which may not reflect the period's average sentiment.

Final Research Summary:
The high-yield spread is currently priced for perfection near historic lows, supported by solid corporate fundamentals and a resilient economy. The most probable outcome is a value close to the current 2.95%, but risks are skewed asymmetrically towards a wider spread should any negative inflation or growth surprises emerge.

To forecast the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the biweekly period of October 27 - November 7, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The non-recessionary/stable growth periods base rate is most appropriate given the current economic context. This range is 3.25% to 4.50%, with a central tendency around 3.75%.
- **Rationale:** This base rate reflects periods without major economic shocks, aligning with the current environment of stable growth and solid corporate fundamentals.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Current economic conditions are stable, with no immediate recessionary threats, aligning with the non-recessionary base rate.
- **Differences:** The current OAS of 2.95% is below the historical non-recessionary median, indicating a market perception of low risk. This suggests a tighter spread than the base rate, driven by improved credit quality and corporate resilience.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Current OAS Reading (2.95%):** Strong anchor for low spreads (↓ Large).
- **Fed's "Higher for Longer" Stance:** Slight upward pressure on spreads due to potential rate hikes (↑ Moderate).
- **Strong Corporate Earnings:** Supports tight spreads (↓ Moderate).
- **Persistent Inflation:** Risk of wider spreads if inflation persists (↑ Moderate).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered at 3.75% with a spread between 3.25% and 4.50%.
- **Evidence Impact:** The strong evidence of a low current OAS and solid corporate fundamentals pulls the distribution downward.
- **Posterior:** Centered around 3.10% to 3.25%, reflecting a slight upward adjustment from the current OAS due to inflation and Fed policy risks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for potential volatility and unexpected economic shifts.
- **Tail Risks:** Consider geopolitical events or sudden economic downturns that could widen spreads.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario with worsening inflation or economic data could push the OAS above 3.50%.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS are:

P10: 2.90  
P20: 3.00  
P40: 3.10  
P60: 3.20  
P80: 3.30  
P90: 3.40

# Forecasting the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS for Oct 27 - Nov 7, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference distributions to inform my prior:

- **Long-term historical median (1997-present)**: ~4.80% with mean of 5.23%
- **Non-recessionary periods**: 3.25% to 4.50% (median ~3.75%)
- **Recent 24-month period (Q4 2023-Q4 2025)**: median ~3.40%
- **Current value (Oct 2025)**: 2.95%

Given the current economic environment (not in recession, but with persistent inflation concerns), I'll use the non-recessionary median of 3.75% as my primary base rate, but with significant weight on the more recent period. This gives me a prior centered around 3.50% with a standard deviation of approximately 0.75 percentage points.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The economy is not in recession, similar to the non-recessionary periods in the base rate
- The Federal Reserve is maintaining a data-dependent stance, similar to previous tightening cycles
- Corporate fundamentals remain generally solid

**Differences from base case:**
- Current spreads (2.95%) are significantly tighter than historical non-recessionary averages
- Improved credit quality in the high-yield index compared to historical periods
- Persistent inflation backdrop creates a unique tension for credit markets
- The current spread is near historical lows, suggesting limited room for further tightening

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting tighter spreads:**
- Current market level of 2.95% reflects strong investor confidence (strong downward pull)
- Q2 2025 corporate earnings were stronger than expected (moderate downward pull)
- Lord Abbett analysis highlighting "continued resilience" in high yield (moderate downward pull)
- Improved underlying credit quality of the high-yield index (moderate downward pull)

**Evidence supporting wider spreads:**
- Fed's "higher for longer" stance limits monetary support (moderate upward pull)
- Persistent inflation above consensus (moderate upward pull)
- Historically tight spreads create asymmetric risk to the upside (strong upward pull)
- Approaching "maturity wall" in 2026-2027 (weak upward pull)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 3.50% (SD = 0.75%), I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **Update based on current market level (2.95%):**
   - This provides strong evidence that the market is pricing in low risk
   - Likelihood ratio strongly favors values closer to 3.00% than 3.50%
   - First update shifts the distribution downward to approximately 3.15% (SD = 0.60%)

2. **Update based on corporate fundamentals and credit quality:**
   - Solid earnings and improved credit quality support tighter spreads
   - Second update further shifts the distribution to approximately 3.10% (SD = 0.55%)

3. **Update based on Fed policy and inflation concerns:**
   - These factors create a floor under spreads and risk of widening
   - Third update slightly increases the mean to 3.15% and widens the distribution (SD = 0.60%)

My posterior distribution is centered at approximately 3.15% with a standard deviation of 0.60%, reflecting a balance between the current tight spreads and the risk factors that could drive widening.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk of a sudden market shock or liquidity event
- The forecast period (Oct 27-Nov 7) coincides with the U.S. election aftermath, which could create volatility
- I might be overweighting recent market conditions versus longer-term mean reversion tendencies
- The resolution depends on a single day's closing value, which could be affected by short-term volatility

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Bullish scenario (2.75-2.90%)**: Strong corporate earnings, clear signs of a soft landing, and dovish Fed pivot could push spreads even tighter
- **Bearish scenario (3.50-4.50%)**: A negative economic surprise, inflation spike, or geopolitical shock could trigger rapid spread widening
- **Extreme tail risk (5.00%+)**: A major market liquidity event or financial crisis could cause spreads to gap significantly wider

After considering these scenarios, I should widen my distribution slightly to account for these tail risks, particularly on the upside.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Adjusting my distribution to account for asymmetric risks and potential tail events:

P10: 2.65%
P20: 2.80%
P40: 3.05%
P60: 3.25%
P80: 3.60%
P90: 4.10%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate base rate is the distribution of the ICE BofA US High Yield OAS during **non-recessionary/stable growth periods**. The research report suggests this typically falls in a range of 3.25% to 4.50%. I will model this prior as a log-normal distribution centered around a median of **3.75%**.

This reference class is chosen over the full history (1997-present, median ~4.80%) because the full history is heavily skewed by major crises (2000, 2008, 2020) that do not represent the current base-case economic outlook. It is also preferable to the very recent history (last 24 months, median ~3.40%) because the recent period may be overly anchored to a specific post-tightening cycle regime, and the slightly broader non-recessionary prior better accounts for potential volatility and mean reversion.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities**: The current economic context, described as one of "continued resilience" with strong corporate fundamentals, aligns well with the characteristics of a non-recessionary period. Default rates are not currently at crisis levels.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Starting Point**: The most significant difference is the current OAS level of **2.95%** (as of 2025-10-09). This is substantially below the 3.25%-4.50% range of my prior, suggesting the market is currently pricing in a very optimistic scenario.
    *   **Monetary Policy**: The Federal Reserve's "higher for longer" stance creates a more restrictive environment than many past stable periods (e.g., the 2010s), exerting upward pressure on spreads.
    *   **Structural Credit Quality**: The report notes that the underlying quality of the high-yield index has improved over time (more BB-rated issuers). This provides a fundamental reason for spreads to be structurally tighter than the historical average.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence and their directional impact on my prior distribution.

*   **Current OAS at 2.95% (Strong Downward Pull)**: This is the most powerful piece of evidence. With the forecast period only a few weeks away, the current market pricing acts as a very strong anchor. It suggests that outcomes near 3.00% are far more likely than outcomes near the prior's median of 3.75%.
*   **Strong Corporate Fundamentals (Moderate Downward Pull)**: Evidence like strong Q2 earnings and positive commentary from Lord Abbett provides a fundamental justification for the current tight spreads, making a sharp, unprompted widening less likely.
*   **"Higher for Longer" Fed & Persistent Inflation (Moderate Upward Pull)**: This is the primary countervailing force. A restrictive Fed increases financing costs and recession risk, placing a floor under spreads and creating the potential for a rapid widening if economic data deteriorates. This makes outcomes below 2.90% less likely and outcomes above 3.50% more plausible.
*   **Asymmetric Risk Profile (Shapes Skew)**: With spreads near historical lows, the potential for further significant tightening is limited, while the room for widening is substantial. This doesn't shift the median as much as it introduces a significant right skew to the posterior distribution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Conceptual Update**: Posterior ∝ Prior (centered at 3.75%) × Likelihoods (strong evidence for ~3.00%, moderate evidence for >3.25%).
*   **Update Step**: I start with my prior centered at 3.75%. The overwhelming evidence of the current 2.95% level pulls the central tendency of my forecast dramatically lower. However, I cannot simply adopt 2.95% as my median. The countervailing risks from Fed policy and inflation, combined with natural mean-reversion pressure, suggest the most likely path involves a slight drift higher or stability.
*   **Posterior Shape**: My posterior distribution will be centered just above the current level, at approximately **3.10%**. The evidence of asymmetric risk means the distribution will be right-skewed. The downside is limited (spreads rarely fall below 2.50%), but the upside tail is long, reflecting the risk of a "risk-off" event causing a rapid 50-100 basis point widening.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Primary Risk (Over-anchoring)**: My forecast is heavily anchored to the current 2.95% level. A negative catalyst in the next few weeks—such as a poor October jobs report (released in early November), a geopolitical shock, or surprisingly bad Q3 earnings guidance—could cause spreads to "gap out" quickly.
*   **Alternative Scenario**: A plausible alternative is that the market begins to price in a 2026 slowdown more seriously. In this scenario, spreads could quickly revert to the non-recessionary average of 3.75% or higher. This scenario is not my base case but is a significant tail risk.
*   **Rebuttal**: The narrative of economic resilience has been entrenched for months. It would likely require a clear and significant negative shock to dislodge it in just a few weeks. Barring such a shock, inertia is a powerful force.
*   **Adjustment**: To account for this tail risk, I will ensure my upper percentiles (P80, P90) are set substantially higher than my median. This builds the possibility of a sharp widening event into the forecast's structure, acknowledging the asymmetric risk profile. My P90 will be set near the lower end of the historical non-recessionary range.
