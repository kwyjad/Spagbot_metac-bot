### Reference class & base rates
-   **Recent High-Rate Environment (2023-2025):** Over the last ~24 months, the 10-year yield has operated in a new regime, largely fluctuating between 3.5% and 5.0%. The mean during this period has been approximately 4.2%. This class reflects the current macroeconomic backdrop of elevated inflation and a restrictive Federal Reserve policy stance. Its limitation is the high volatility within the range.
-   **Periods of Fed Policy Pivots (e.g., 2001, 2007, 2019):** Historically, when the Fed signals an end to a hiking cycle and a potential shift towards easing, the 10-year yield tends to be volatile but often drifts lower in anticipation of rate cuts. The median yield in the 3-6 months preceding the first rate cut has historically been in the 3.0% to 4.5% range, though this varies significantly with the prevailing inflation level. This class is relevant given the market expectation of Fed cuts in 2025.
-   **Q4 Yield Behavior (Last 10 Years):** Examining the change in the 10Y yield during Q4 shows no strong seasonal pattern. However, it is often a period where market participants finalize positioning based on the full year's data and forward guidance from the Fed's December meeting. The average closing yield in Q4 over the last decade is ~2.5%, but this is heavily skewed by the pre-2022 low-rate environment and is not a reliable base rate for the current regime.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-06-26] Morningstar projects 0.50 percentage points of Fed cuts in 2025. ↓ — Reinforces the market narrative of a dovish pivot, putting downward pressure on longer-term yields as the policy rate is expected to fall.
-   [2025-07-09] Bankrate survey projects the 10-year yield to fall to 4.18% by mid-2026. ↓ — Suggests a slow, grinding decline in yields over the medium term, anchoring expectations slightly above the 4.0% mark.
-   [2025-10-01] Advisor Perspectives notes the weekly average yield was 4.16% at the end of September. (Baseline) — Provides a recent anchor point for the yield's trading range.
-   [2025-10-06] Perpetual report notes the yield fell 8bps in September to 4.23% but suggests a lift above 4.50% is likely. ↑ — Introduces a strong counter-narrative to the consensus, highlighting potential for unexpected upside pressure on yields.
-   [2025-10-10] The yield closes at 4.04% according to Trading Economics and the Fed's H.15 release. (Baseline) — Establishes the most current level, showing a distinct downward trend from late September levels (~4.2%).
-   [2025-10-13] Trading Economics forecasts a Q4 2025 ending yield of 3.9757%. ↓ — A specific, data-driven forecast that points to the yield dipping just below the 4.0% psychological level by year-end.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Federal Reserve Policy Expectations:** Market anticipation of the Fed funds rate path is the primary driver. Dovish commentary or signals of imminent rate cuts would push yields down. Hawkish surprises would push them up. (Impact: Large)
-   **Inflation Data (CPI, PCE):** Higher-than-expected inflation readings increase the "inflation premium" demanded by investors and suggest a more hawkish Fed, driving yields up. Lower readings have the opposite effect. (Impact: Large)
-   **Economic Growth Indicators (Jobs Report, GDP):** Stronger economic data (e.g., high payrolls, low unemployment) suggests the economy can withstand higher rates, pushing yields up. Weaker data signals a potential slowdown, increasing demand for safe assets and pushing yields down. (Impact: Moderate)
-   **Treasury Supply and Demand:** The size of Treasury auctions to fund government spending affects supply. Weak demand at these auctions (low bid-to-cover ratios) can force yields higher to attract buyers. (Impact: Moderate)
-   **Global Safe-Haven Demand:** Increased geopolitical instability or signs of a sharp global economic slowdown can trigger a "flight to safety," increasing demand for U.S. Treasuries and pushing yields down. (Impact: Small to Moderate, event-driven)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Post-Hike, Pre-Cut Limbo:** Unlike a stable mid-cycle period, the market is currently in a delicate phase, having fully priced in the end of hikes but uncertain about the precise timing and pace of future cuts. This makes yields exceptionally sensitive to incoming data.
-   **Elevated Inflation Uncertainty:** While inflation has moderated from its 2022 peak, its "last mile" descent to the Fed's 2% target is proving difficult. This structural uncertainty keeps long-term inflation premia higher than in the post-GFC reference period.
-   **Unprecedented Fiscal Backdrop:** The U.S. is running large structural deficits, leading to a heavy and sustained schedule of Treasury issuance. This contrasts with prior easing cycles and creates a persistent structural upward pressure on yields due to supply.
-   **Quantitative Tightening (QT) Overhang:** The Fed is still reducing the size of its balance sheet, which acts as a background tightening force. The interaction between the start of rate cuts and the continuation of QT is a novel policy environment.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior centered around **4.15%** seems reasonable, reflecting the average of the recent trading range (late Sept/early Oct). The high volatility suggests a relatively weak prior (equivalent n of ~15).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Recent downward momentum from ~4.2% to 4.04%: ↓ (Moderate)
    *   Consensus forecasts (TE, Bankrate) pointing to sub-4.2% levels: ↓ (Small)
    *   Underlying expectation of 2025 Fed cuts: ↓ (Moderate background factor)
    *   Persistent Treasury supply and one contrarian forecast (>4.50%): ↑ (Small counterweight)
    *   Proximity to the 4.0% psychological level, which may act as technical support: ↑ (Small)
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests the prior is too high. The posterior should be revised downward significantly, likely moving the central tendency to just above or at the 4.0% mark, while maintaining significant variance.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    *   October CPI report (released early Nov) showing sticky core inflation.
    *   October Non-Farm Payrolls report (released Nov 7) showing unexpectedly strong job/wage growth.
    *   Hawkish Fedspeak from FOMC members in late October.
    *   Poor demand at late-October Treasury auctions (e.g., 2Y, 5Y, 7Y notes).
    *   De-escalation of any global conflicts, reducing safe-haven demand.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Softer-than-expected October CPI or jobs data.
    *   Weak retail sales or consumer confidence figures suggesting economic slowdown.
    *   Dovish Fedspeak explicitly signaling a Q1 2026 rate cut is on the table.
    *   An unexpected geopolitical flare-up triggering a flight to safety.
    *   A decisive break and hold below the 4.0% technical level.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Extreme Short-Term Horizon:** The resolution period is just a few weeks away. The final value could be heavily skewed by a single data release (e.g., the jobs report on Nov 7) or news event in the final days.
-   **Data Release Timing:** The October jobs report is typically released on the first Friday of the month, which would be November 7, 2025. The resolution value could be the immediate market reaction to this key data.
-   **Model Lag:** Many institutional forecasts (like TE's quarterly model) may not be nimble enough to capture week-to-week sentiment shifts driven by individual data points.
-   **Geopolitical Shocks:** Unforeseen international events can cause sudden, sharp moves in Treasury yields that are independent of the U.S. economic data narrative.
-   **Technical Factors:** The 4.0% level is a significant psychological and technical threshold. A break below or bounce off this level could be driven by market positioning and algorithmic trading, not just fundamentals.

**Final Research Summary:**
The 10-year yield is currently at 4.04%, having trended down from ~4.2% in late September. While structural forces like Treasury supply provide upward pressure, the dominant narrative of impending Fed cuts and recent momentum favor a continued drift lower, making the final value highly contingent on the October inflation and jobs reports released just before or during the resolution period.

To forecast the ending value of the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period of October 27 - November 7, 2025, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process outlined.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The recent high-rate environment (2023-2025) is the most relevant reference class, with the 10-year yield fluctuating between 3.5% and 5.0%, and a mean of approximately 4.2%. This reflects the current macroeconomic backdrop of elevated inflation and a restrictive Federal Reserve policy stance.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Mean around 4.2% with high volatility.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base case in terms of the macroeconomic environment, with ongoing inflation concerns and a restrictive Fed policy.
   - **Differences:** The market is now anticipating a dovish pivot with potential Fed rate cuts in 2025, which is not fully captured in the base rate. This expectation is likely to exert downward pressure on yields.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Recent Downward Momentum:** The yield has decreased from ~4.2% to 4.04%, suggesting a downward trend. (Moderate downward pressure)
   - **Consensus Forecasts:** Projections from Trading Economics and Bankrate suggest yields will remain below 4.2%, with some forecasts below 4.0%. (Small downward pressure)
   - **Fed Cuts Expectation:** The anticipation of Fed rate cuts in 2025 reinforces the downward trend. (Moderate downward pressure)
   - **Contrarian Forecasts and Treasury Supply:** Some forecasts suggest potential for yields above 4.50%, and persistent Treasury issuance could exert upward pressure. (Small upward pressure)

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 4.15%.
   - **Evidence Impact:** The evidence suggests a downward revision is warranted. The posterior distribution should be centered closer to 4.0%, reflecting the recent downward trend and expectations of Fed cuts.
   - **Posterior Mean and Variance:** Mean around 4.0% with significant variance due to ongoing volatility and uncertainty.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of unexpected inflation data or strong economic indicators pushing yields higher.
   - **Tail Risks:** Geopolitical events or unexpected Fed communications could lead to sharp movements.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A scenario where inflation remains sticky and the Fed delays cuts could keep yields above 4.2%. However, the current evidence supports a lower central tendency.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian update, the forecasted percentiles are:
P10: 3.85
P20: 3.90
P40: 3.95
P60: 4.00
P80: 4.05
P90: 4.10

# Forecast: UST 10Y Yield for Oct 27 - Nov 7, 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior distribution, I'll use the recent high-rate environment (2023-2025) as the most relevant reference class, where the 10-year yield has fluctuated between 3.5% and 5.0%, with a mean of approximately 4.2%. 

I'll refine this by incorporating the most recent data points:
- The yield was 4.16% at the end of September 2025
- The yield closed at 4.04% as of October 10, 2025

Given the recency of these values and the short forecast horizon (just 2-3 weeks ahead), I'll center my prior at 4.05%, slightly above the most recent closing value to account for the general trading range. The standard deviation should be approximately 0.25%, reflecting the typical volatility observed in 2-3 week periods.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- We remain in the same post-pandemic, elevated inflation regime
- The Federal Reserve is still in a restrictive policy stance
- Treasury supply dynamics continue to exert upward pressure

**Differences from base case:**
- We're now in a "post-hike, pre-cut limbo" phase, with markets anticipating rate cuts in 2025-2026
- Recent momentum has been downward (from 4.23% to 4.04% in just a few weeks)
- The yield is approaching the psychologically important 4.0% level
- The forecast period includes the October jobs report (Nov 7), which could cause significant volatility

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pushing yields lower:**
- Recent downward momentum: The yield has fallen from 4.23% to 4.04% in recent weeks (moderate downward push, ~0.1%)
- Trading Economics forecasts a Q4 2025 ending yield of 3.98% (small downward push, ~0.05%)
- Bankrate survey projects yields falling to 4.18% by mid-2026, suggesting a gradual downward trend (small downward push, ~0.03%)
- Market expectation of Fed rate cuts in 2025 creates a downward bias (moderate downward push, ~0.1%)

**Evidence pushing yields higher:**
- Perpetual report suggests a lift above 4.50% is likely (small upward push, ~0.05%)
- Persistent Treasury supply due to large fiscal deficits (small upward push, ~0.05%)
- The 4.0% level may act as technical support, limiting further declines (small upward push, ~0.03%)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 4.05% with σ = 0.25%, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First update - Recent momentum:**
- The likelihood ratio favors lower yields by approximately 2:1
- This shifts my posterior mean downward by ~0.07% to 3.98%
- The uncertainty narrows slightly to σ ≈ 0.22%

**Second update - Forecast consensus:**
- The balance of forecasts (Trading Economics, Bankrate) versus contrarian views (Perpetual)
- Net likelihood ratio favors lower yields by approximately 1.5:1
- This further shifts the posterior mean to 3.95%
- Uncertainty remains similar at σ ≈ 0.22%

**Third update - Technical factors:**
- The 4.0% psychological level and supply/demand dynamics
- These factors slightly counterbalance the downward pressure
- The posterior mean adjusts slightly upward to 3.97%
- Uncertainty remains at σ ≈ 0.22%

My posterior distribution is now centered at 3.97% with a standard deviation of 0.22%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent momentum and underestimating mean reversion
- The October jobs report (Nov 7) could significantly impact the final value, and I have no way to predict its content
- Geopolitical events could trigger safe-haven flows in either direction
- Technical resistance/support levels may have stronger effects than fundamentals in short timeframes

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative would center around 4.15%, arguing that:
- Recent downward momentum will exhaust itself
- The 4.0% level will act as strong support
- October economic data will surprise to the upside
- Treasury auctions will show weak demand

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While possible, this scenario seems less likely given the consistent downward trend and the broader narrative of anticipated Fed cuts. However, it highlights the need to widen my uncertainty bands.

**Adjustments:**
- I'll slightly widen my distribution to account for event risk
- I'll adjust the lower tail to reflect the possibility of a break below 4.0%
- I'll ensure the upper tail accounts for the possibility of upside surprises in economic data

## 6. Final Percentiles

Based on my posterior distribution centered at 3.97% with σ ≈ 0.23% (slightly widened), and accounting for asymmetric risks:

P10: 3.65
P20: 3.75
P40: 3.90
P60: 4.05
P80: 4.20
P90: 4.30

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the 10-Year US Treasury (UST 10Y) yield in late 2025. An appropriate base rate is the distribution of yields during the recent high-rate environment, which began in late 2022.

*   **Reference Class:** UST 10Y Yield from January 2023 to October 2025.
*   **Reasoning:** This period represents a new macroeconomic regime characterized by elevated inflation (compared to the prior decade), a restrictive Federal Reserve policy stance, and significant Treasury supply. It is more relevant than long-term historical averages that include periods of ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy).
*   **Distribution:** During this period, the yield has fluctuated primarily between 3.5% and 5.0%, with a mean of approximately 4.2%. I will model my prior as a normal distribution centered slightly lower to account for the forward-looking nature of bond markets, with significant variance to reflect the observed volatility.
*   **Prior:** A distribution centered at **4.15%** with a standard deviation of approximately 0.40%. This places the bulk of the probability mass between 3.75% and 4.55%, consistent with the recent range but acknowledging the market's anticipation of future rate cuts.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The forecast period (late Q4 2025) is similar to the base case (2023-2025) in that structural inflation and large fiscal deficits will likely persist. However, it differs in a crucial way:

*   **Difference:** The market has shifted from pricing in Fed *hikes* to pricing in Fed *cuts*. The base case period was dominated by the question "how high will rates go?", whereas the forecast period is dominated by "when and how fast will the Fed cut?".
*   **Impact:** This change in narrative makes yields more sensitive to weak economic data (which would accelerate cuts) than strong data (which would only delay them). This introduces a potential downward skew to the distribution relative to the base rate period's average.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence from the research report, all dated shortly before the forecast period.

*   **Current Market Level (as of Oct 10, 2025):** The yield is at **4.04%**. This is a very strong signal, sitting 11 basis points below my prior's center. This evidence strongly pushes the forecast down.
*   **Recent Momentum:** The yield fell from 4.23% in September to 4.04% by October 10. This downward trend provides further evidence that the prior is too high.
*   **Quantitative Forecasts:** Trading Economics forecasts a Q4-end yield of **3.9757%**. This is a specific, data-driven forecast that points to a value below the psychologically important 4.0% level, pushing the distribution lower.
*   **Contrarian View:** The Perpetual report suggests a lift above **4.50%** is likely. This is a key piece of counter-evidence, highlighting the risk of re-accelerating inflation or a hawkish policy surprise. It argues for maintaining a wide right tail on the distribution.
*   **Event Risk:** The resolution date, November 7, 2025, is the typical release date for the October Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. The October CPI report will also be released during or just before the resolution period. These are high-impact data releases guaranteed to introduce significant volatility, arguing against a narrow, overconfident forecast.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   **Conceptual Update:** My prior was centered at 4.15%. The overwhelming weight of recent evidence (current price of 4.04%, downward momentum, consensus forecasts below 4.0%) pulls this center down significantly.
*   **Update Step:** I will shift the median of my distribution from 4.15% to just below the current level, to **4.03%**. This new center reflects the current price but also incorporates the downward momentum and the sub-4.0% TE forecast.
*   **Variance Adjustment:** The proximity to the forecast date would normally narrow the variance. However, the massive, scheduled event risk from the NFP and CPI reports requires maintaining a wide distribution. The contrarian view of >4.50% also supports a fatter right tail. Therefore, the standard deviation will be reduced from the prior's 0.40% but will remain substantial at around 0.25-0.30%. The final distribution will be centered near the current price but wide enough to encompass plausible outcomes from major data surprises.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Over-anchoring on the downward trend:** The consensus is for lower yields, but what if the October data comes in hot? A strong NFP report on the final day of the period could cause a sharp spike. The Perpetual forecast of >4.50% is a plausible scenario if inflation proves sticky. My upper percentiles (P80, P90) must be high enough to account for this risk. A move of 30-40 bps on a surprise is not out of the question.
*   **Ignoring the 4.0% "floor":** Major psychological levels can act as technical support. If the yield dips below 4.0%, it might attract buyers, pushing it back up. My central tendency is just above this level, but a sharp break lower is possible on very weak data.
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The market could enter a holding pattern, with yields trading in a tight range (e.g., 3.95% to 4.15%) as investors await definitive signals from the Fed. This would imply a much narrower distribution. I reject this alternative because the resolution date coincides with a major catalyst (NFP), making a quiet, range-bound outcome less likely than a volatile one. My wider distribution is more appropriate for this specific context.
*   **Final Adjustment:** I will ensure my distribution has a slight positive skew (mean slightly above the median). This reflects that while the central path is stable-to-down, a large surprise is more likely to be hawkish (unexpected inflation) than extremely dovish (a sudden deep recession), given the structural backdrop.

### 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3.68
P20: 3.82
P40: 3.93
P60: 4.13
P80: 4.28
P90: 4.42
