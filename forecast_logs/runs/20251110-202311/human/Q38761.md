### Reference class & base rates
-   **Stalemated Fronts in Modern Interstate Wars (e.g., Iran-Iraq War, WWI Western Front):** In wars that have settled into attritional lines after 1-2 years, the probability of one side capturing multiple major, well-defended cities in a short (<3 month) window is extremely low. Such breakthroughs typically require overwhelming superiority, a technological surprise, or the complete collapse of the opposing army, none of which are common. **Base rate for YES: <5%.**
-   **Phases of the Russo-Ukrainian War (2022-Present):** This war has seen dynamic phases (Feb-Apr 2022) and attritional phases (most of 2023-2025). During the attritional phases, the rate of capturing even one major city, let alone two, within a two-month period has been 0%. The resolution criteria demand a return to the dynamism of early 2022, but against a far more prepared adversary. **Base rate for YES: <2%.**
-   **Late-War "Last Gasp" Offensives (e.g., Battle of the Bulge):** Sometimes a belligerent will concentrate its remaining elite forces for a final, high-risk offensive to change the strategic situation. These are rare and have a low success rate against a well-supplied defender. Even if launched, achieving the capture of two major cities like Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia would be an exceptionally successful outcome. **Base rate for YES: 5-10%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-11-10] UArGuard reports Ukrainian forces repelled 12 Russian attacks in Zaporizhzhia oblast and 18 in Luhansk. — ↓ — Indicates a stable, effective Ukrainian defense in key sectors, making a Russian breakthrough less likely.
-   [2025-11-04] ISW assesses Russian forces made no confirmed advances in the Kupyansk direction despite continued attacks. — ↓ — Reinforces the view of the front as largely static and attritional, contrary to what would be needed for a major expansion.
-   [2025-10-01] The Kremlin-appointed mayor of Nova Kakhovka was assassinated in an explosion. — ↓ — Demonstrates Ukrainian operational reach into Russian-controlled areas, suggesting Russian rear-area security is porous and would complicate major offensive logistics.
-   [2024-12-02] Ukraine continues its de-Russification campaign, renaming streets. — (neutral) — Reflects long-term national identity building and high morale but has no direct, short-term impact on military capabilities.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Russian Force Generation & Concentration (Large ↑):** Russia's ability to secretly amass a large, well-equipped strategic reserve and deploy it for a surprise multi-pronged offensive is the primary mechanism for a "Yes" outcome.
-   **Ukrainian Ammunition & Materiel Collapse (Large ↑):** A sudden, critical shortage of Ukrainian artillery shells, air defense missiles, or armored vehicles, likely due to a halt in Western aid, could create vulnerabilities for a Russian breakthrough.
-   **Air Superiority (Moderate ↑):** If Russia were able to ground the Ukrainian air force and establish dominance over the front lines, it would dramatically improve the effectiveness of its ground assaults. This has not been achieved to date.
-   **Ukrainian Manpower & Morale (Large ↓):** The continued resilience and motivation of Ukrainian defenders, coupled with their deep and prepared defensive lines, is the strongest driver against a Russian breakthrough.
-   **Western Intelligence & Support (Moderate ↓):** Western ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) capabilities make a surprise large-scale Russian force concentration difficult, allowing Ukraine time to prepare and redeploy forces.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unprecedented ISR Environment:** Unlike historical reference classes, the battlefield is under constant surveillance from satellites and drones, making surprise strategic offensives exceptionally difficult to organize.
-   **High Defensive Lethality:** The proliferation of ATGMs, MANPADS, and precision artillery/drones has given a significant advantage to prepared defenders, making offensive operations costly and slow.
-   **Dependency on External Aid:** Ukraine's defensive capacity is uniquely and critically tied to the political will of Western allies, creating a potential failure point not present in most historical interstate wars.
-   **Strictness of Resolution Criteria:** The question requires Russia to *both* take significant new ground (two major cities) *and* not lose any of its key current holdings (e.g., Tokmak, Nova Kakhovka) in a very short timeframe. This double condition is much harder to meet than a simple net gain.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A low prior (~5%) is appropriate, derived from reference classes of stalemated wars where rapid, multi-city captures are exceedingly rare. The equivalent n is low (~20), reflecting the unique aspects of this conflict.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↓ (Large): Recent ISW and Ukrainian military reports show continued attritional fighting with no Russian breakthroughs, directly contradicting the necessary conditions for a "Yes".
    -   ↓ (Small): The assassination of a collaborationist mayor indicates Russian rear-area vulnerability, not the consolidated control needed to launch a massive offensive.
    -   ↓ (Moderate): The *absence* of public or intelligence reporting on a massive Russian force concentration near Kharkiv, Sumy, or Zaporizhzhia is strong evidence against an impending operation of the required scale.
-   **Net effect:** The recent evidence strongly reinforces the prior. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward from an already low base.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   Satellite imagery showing a massive buildup of Russian forces (e.g., >100k troops) near Kharkiv, Sumy, or Zaporizhzhia.
    -   A sudden operational security blackout from the Russian military, often preceding a major offensive.
    -   Confirmed reports of a localized Ukrainian front-line collapse.
    -   A definitive, complete halt of all US and European military aid to Ukraine.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Continued ISW/official reporting of positional, attritional fighting with marginal or no territorial changes.
    -   Announcement of new, major long-term military aid packages for Ukraine from the West.
    -   Successful Ukrainian deep strikes on major Russian logistics hubs, command centers, or force concentrations.
    -   Russian redeployment of forces away from offensive postures to defend against Ukrainian pressure elsewhere (e.g., in Kherson).

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Resolution Specificity:** A "Yes" requires Russia to hold *all* listed locations. A successful but temporary Ukrainian raid on Nova Kakhovka on Jan 1, 2026, would invalidate the question, even if Russia had taken Kharkiv and Odesa.
-   **Information Fog:** Both sides engage in propaganda. Rely strictly on the specified resolution source (ISW), which may have a time lag in confirming control changes.
-   **Black Swan Events:** The sudden death of a key leader, a domestic political crisis in Russia, or a technological game-changer could rapidly alter the battlefield calculus in unpredictable ways.
-   **"De Facto Control":** This can be ambiguous. A contested "grey zone" in a city's suburbs might be interpreted differently. However, the use of specific central addresses in the criteria suggests control must be comprehensive.

**Final Research Summary:** The resolution requires a massive and rapid Russian military success on a scale not seen since February 2022, within the next seven weeks. All recent evidence points to a stalemated, attritional conflict where neither side can achieve major breakthroughs, making a "Yes" outcome extremely unlikely.

To forecast the probability of Russia significantly expanding its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for Russia capturing multiple major cities in a short timeframe during an attritional phase of war is extremely low. Historical reference classes, such as stalemated fronts in modern interstate wars, suggest a base rate of less than 5%. Given the specific conditions of the Russo-Ukrainian War and the strict resolution criteria, a base rate of 2% is appropriate. This reflects the rarity of such breakthroughs without overwhelming superiority or a collapse of the opposing side.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to historical stalemates where neither side can achieve rapid territorial gains. The war has settled into an attritional phase, with both sides entrenched and prepared.
- **Differences:** The modern ISR environment and high lethality of defensive weapons make surprise offensives even more difficult than in historical cases. Additionally, Ukraine's defense is heavily supported by Western aid, which is a unique factor not present in most historical conflicts.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Stable Ukrainian Defense (↓):** Reports of Ukrainian forces repelling Russian attacks in key areas suggest a strong defense, decreasing the likelihood of a Russian breakthrough. Likelihood ratio: 0.2.
- **Lack of Russian Advances (↓):** Continued reports of no significant Russian advances reinforce the view of a static front. Likelihood ratio: 0.3.
- **Ukrainian Operational Reach (↓):** The assassination of a Russian-appointed mayor indicates vulnerabilities in Russian-controlled areas, complicating logistics for a major offensive. Likelihood ratio: 0.5.
- **Absence of Force Concentration (↓):** No evidence of a massive Russian force buildup necessary for a large-scale offensive. Likelihood ratio: 0.1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 2% probability translates to odds of 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 0.0204.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Combining the evidence, the overall likelihood ratio is approximately 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.5 × 0.1 = 0.003.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.0204 × 0.003 = 0.0000612.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.0000612 / (1 + 0.0000612) ≈ 0.0061 or 0.61%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for unexpected developments, such as a sudden halt in Western aid or a successful Russian surprise offensive.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a significant geopolitical shift or internal Russian political changes that could alter military strategies.
- **Rebuttals:** The current evidence strongly supports a low probability, but monitoring for any drastic changes in military dynamics is crucial.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of Russia significantly expanding its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026, is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Probability Assessment: Will Russia significantly expand its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on relevant reference classes:

- **Stalemated Fronts in Modern Interstate Wars**: In wars that have settled into attritional phases after 1-2 years, major territorial breakthroughs are rare. The probability of capturing multiple major cities in a short timeframe is historically very low (<5%).

- **Current Russo-Ukrainian War Dynamics**: The war has been largely attritional since 2023. During these phases, the capture rate of major cities has been effectively 0%.

- **Late-War Offensives**: Sometimes belligerents concentrate remaining forces for a final offensive, but these rarely succeed in capturing multiple major cities against a prepared defender (5-10% success rate).

Given these reference classes, and the specific requirement that Russia must capture at least two major Ukrainian cities while maintaining all its current holdings, I'll set a **prior probability of 7%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The conflict has settled into an attritional pattern typical of stalemated modern wars
- Both sides have established defensive lines and fortifications
- Neither side has demonstrated the ability to make rapid, large-scale territorial gains recently

**Key differences:**
- The resolution criteria are extremely strict, requiring Russia to both take two major new cities AND maintain all current holdings
- Modern ISR capabilities make surprise offensives much harder than in historical reference cases
- The war is now in its fourth year, with Ukrainian defenses more prepared than in earlier phases
- Russia has shown an ability to slowly advance in certain sectors, but not at the pace needed

These differences generally make a "Yes" outcome less likely than the historical base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent battlefield reports (November 2025)**
- UArGuard reports Ukrainian forces repelled 12 Russian attacks in Zaporizhzhia oblast and 18 in Luhansk
- P(E|H): If Russia were about to capture two major cities, we would expect to see successful breakthroughs, not repelled attacks
- P(E|~H): If Russia will not capture two major cities, we would expect exactly this pattern of failed attacks
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors ~H (approximately 1:10)

**Evidence 2: ISW assessment (November 2025)**
- ISW reports no confirmed Russian advances in the Kupyansk direction despite continued attacks
- P(E|H): If Russia were building momentum for major territorial gains, we would expect to see at least some successful advances
- P(E|~H): If Russia will not make major gains, this stalemate pattern is exactly what we'd expect
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors ~H (approximately 1:8)

**Evidence 3: Assassination of Nova Kakhovka mayor (October 2025)**
- Demonstrates Ukrainian operational reach into Russian-controlled areas
- P(E|H): If Russia were consolidating control and preparing for major offensives, we would expect better security in rear areas
- P(E|~H): If Russia is struggling to maintain current positions, such security breaches are more likely
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors ~H (approximately 1:3)

**Evidence 4: Absence of reports on major Russian force concentration**
- No intelligence reports indicate a massive Russian buildup near key target cities
- P(E|H): If Russia were preparing for a major offensive to capture two cities, we would likely see evidence of force concentration
- P(E|~H): If Russia is maintaining current operations, we would expect no unusual force concentrations
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors ~H (approximately 1:4)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 7:93 (7% probability), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on battlefield reports:**
- Prior odds: 7:93 = 0.075
- Likelihood ratio: 1:10 = 0.1
- Posterior odds: 0.075 × 0.1 = 0.0075
- Posterior probability: 0.0075 ÷ (1 + 0.0075) ≈ 0.75%

This seems too extreme for a single update, so I'll be more conservative and adjust to approximately 3%.

**Considering all evidence together:**
All four pieces of evidence point in the same direction, suggesting Russia is not making the progress necessary to achieve the resolution criteria. The combined evidence strongly suggests that Russia will not capture two major Ukrainian cities while maintaining all current holdings by January 1, 2026.

After considering all evidence, I estimate a posterior probability of approximately 2%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Russia's capacity for surprise strategic operations
- The timeline extends to January 1, 2026, giving Russia several more weeks to prepare and execute operations
- Winter conditions could potentially favor a Russian offensive if Ukrainian defenses are compromised by weather
- A sudden collapse in Western support could rapidly change the balance of forces

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Russia could concentrate forces for a massive, multi-pronged offensive targeting Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia
- Ukraine might face a critical ammunition shortage, creating a window for Russian advances
- Internal Ukrainian political issues could affect military cohesion and defensive capabilities

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability estimate to account for these possibilities. However, the evidence of the current battlefield situation remains strong, and the resolution criteria are very strict.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, specific evidence from recent battlefield developments, and potential alternative scenarios, I assess that Russia is very unlikely to have significantly expanded its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2026, as defined by the resolution criteria.

The requirement to capture at least two major Ukrainian cities while maintaining all current holdings within the next seven weeks, given the current battlefield situation, makes this outcome highly improbable.

Final: 3%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a rapid and significant territorial expansion by an attacker in a war that has been characterized by attritional, stalemated front lines for over two years. An appropriate reference class is the frequency of such breakthroughs in modern, protracted interstate wars after the initial dynamic phase has ended.

-   **Reference Class:** Stalemate phases of modern wars (e.g., Iran-Iraq War, WWI Western Front).
-   **Reasoning:** In such conflicts, once defensive lines are established and fortified, successful offensives that capture multiple major, well-defended urban centers in a short period (here, less than two months) are exceedingly rare. They typically require either a complete collapse of the defending army or a revolutionary technological/doctrinal advantage, neither of which is common. The historical frequency of such an event in any given two-month window of a stalemated war is very low.
-   **Initial Prior:** I will set the prior probability P(H) at **5%**. This reflects the inherent difficulty and rarity of such a large-scale breakthrough but acknowledges that it is not impossible. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in the Russo-Ukrainian war has features that both align with and deviate from the historical base case.

-   **Similarities:** The conflict features extensive trench networks, high force densities, and attritional fighting, all characteristic of a stalemate.
-   **Differences:**
    -   **Increased Lethality & Surveillance:** The modern battlefield has unprecedented levels of surveillance (satellites, drones) and highly lethal defensive weapons (ATGMs, precision artillery). This makes concentrating forces for a surprise attack extremely difficult and costly, suggesting the probability of a successful offensive is *lower* than in historical cases.
    -   **Dependency on External Aid:** Ukraine's ability to defend itself is critically dependent on a continuous flow of Western military aid. This introduces a unique vulnerability; a sudden cessation of aid could precipitate a collapse, making a Russian breakthrough *more* likely than in a self-sufficient state. This is the primary factor that could lead to a "Yes" outcome.
    -   **Strict Resolution Criteria:** The question requires Russia to capture at least two major cities *and* simultaneously not lose control of any of its key occupied towns. This "perfect outcome" is a much higher bar than simply achieving a net territorial gain, making a "Yes" resolution significantly *less* likely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The research report provides several recent pieces of evidence, all from October-November 2025, with the resolution date being January 1, 2026 (less than two months away).

-   **Evidence 1: Reports of Repelled Attacks & No Russian Advances (ISW, UArGuard).**
    -   This evidence describes classic positional, attritional warfare.
    -   P(E | H): The probability of seeing only minor, repelled attacks if Russia were secretly preparing a massive, war-altering offensive is low. We would expect to see more successful shaping operations or larger probing attacks.
    -   P(E | ~H): The probability of seeing these reports if the war remains a stalemate is very high. This is the definition of a stalemate.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

-   **Evidence 2: Assassination of Collaborationist Mayor in Nova Kakhovka.**
    -   This demonstrates Ukrainian operational reach into Russian-controlled rear areas.
    -   P(E | H): If Russia were about to launch a major offensive, such a security lapse in a key logistical area they must hold (per resolution criteria) is unlikely and indicative of poor control, which would hamper offensive operations.
    -   P(E | ~H): Partisan and special forces activity behind enemy lines is common in a protracted conflict.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio < 1.** This evidence **decreases** the probability.

-   **Evidence 3: Absence of a Visible Russian Force Buildup.**
    -   This is the most critical piece of evidence. A massive offensive to take two major cities would require the visible concentration of hundreds of thousands of troops and vast amounts of equipment.
    -   P(E | H): The probability of this buildup being completely invisible to Western and commercial ISR, just 7 weeks before the offensive, is extremely low.
    -   P(E | ~H): The probability of not seeing a buildup if one is not occurring is extremely high.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio << 1.** This is very strong evidence against the hypothesis and **strongly decreases** the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
-   **Prior Odds:** 1:19 (5% probability).
-   **Update Step:** The most powerful evidence is the absence of a visible force concentration. Let's estimate its likelihood ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H)) as roughly 0.1 (i.e., it's 10 times more likely to see no buildup if no attack is planned than if one is).
    -   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    -   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:19) × 0.1 = 0.1:19 = 1:190.
-   **Posterior Probability:** A 1:190 odds ratio corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 190) ≈ 0.5%.
-   **Summary:** The combined weight of the evidence, particularly the lack of preparation for a major offensive, drastically reduces the initial 5% prior to a value below 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a very low probability (<1%). I must challenge this.

-   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible path to a "Yes" is not a conventional military breakthrough but a sudden, catastrophic collapse of the Ukrainian army. This would most likely be triggered by a complete and immediate cut-off of Western aid, leading to a critical ammunition and materiel shortage. Could this happen and lead to the fall of two major cities in under two months?
-   **Plausibility:** While a political decision to halt aid is possible, its effects would not be instantaneous. Ukraine has some reserves, and a front-wide collapse is not a guaranteed outcome. However, this "collapse" scenario represents the most significant tail risk. The community forecast of 9.3% likely places a much higher weight on this political risk than my analysis does.
-   **Rebuttal:** Even in a collapse scenario, the dual resolution criteria (taking two new cities while losing zero key existing ones) remain a very high bar. A chaotic collapse could still see Ukrainian forces conduct a successful spoiling attack on a location like Tokmak.
-   **Adjustment:** My sub-1% forecast might be overconfident in the stability of the political situation regarding aid. The "collapse" scenario, while a tail risk, is a non-zero possibility. To account for this primary, albeit unlikely, path to a "Yes" resolution, I will adjust my forecast upward from the purely military-evidence-based calculation. A probability of 3% acknowledges this tail risk while still reflecting the overwhelming evidence that a conventional breakthrough is extremely unlikely in the given timeframe.

### Final Forecast
The combination of a low base rate for such an event, the extremely high bar set by the resolution criteria, and the uniformally negative recent evidence (especially the lack of any visible Russian preparations) makes a "Yes" outcome highly improbable. The only plausible, though remote, path is a sudden political event leading to a rapid collapse of the Ukrainian military. My final forecast incorporates this tail risk.

Final: 3%
