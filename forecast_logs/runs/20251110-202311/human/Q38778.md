### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-2010 UK Public Sector Pay Disputes with Sustained Industrial Action:** This class includes major disputes involving unions like the RCN (nurses), NEU (teachers), and the BMA itself since the start of the austerity era. In these cases, an initial government offer is often rejected, leading to strikes. A revised, improved offer is made in a significant minority of cases, often after prolonged disruption.
    *   **Base Rate:** 25-40%. Derived from observing that while strikes create pressure, governments often hold firm on their overall fiscal envelope, making only minor concessions or reallocating existing funds. The 2022-24 NHS strikes are a key instance where offers *were* improved, but this is not the norm for every dispute cycle.
2.  **New UK Government's First Major Union Negotiation:** This class looks at how newly elected governments (e.g., Labour '97, Coalition '10, Conservative '15) handle their first significant industrial dispute. The government often seeks to set a precedent, either by being conciliatory to fulfill campaign promises or by being firm to establish fiscal credibility.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~50%. The outcome is highly variable. The desire to start with a clean slate and "get things done" (e.g., reduce waiting lists) pushes towards a deal, while the need to appear fiscally responsible to markets and other unions pushes against caving to demands.
3.  **BMA Junior/Resident Doctor Pay Disputes (since 2015):** This is the most specific class, including the 2016 contract dispute and the 2022-2024 pay dispute. The BMA has shown a high willingness to sustain industrial action, and the government has previously made improved offers to end the disruption.
    *   **Base Rate:** 60-75%. In both major recent instances, sustained strike action eventually led to an improved government offer, suggesting this specific union-government dynamic is particularly prone to revision after action.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-08** Five-day strike confirmed for Nov 14 after talks fail. — ↓ — Indicates negotiations are at a complete impasse, making a swift resolution and improved offer before year-end less likely.
*   **2025-10-23** BMA announces full walk-out strike date. — ↓ — Formalizes the breakdown in talks and commits the union to disruptive action, hardening positions on both sides.
*   **2024-09-XX** (Implied by sources) BMA members accept a pay deal for 2023/24 and 2024/25. — ↓ — The government will see this as having "settled" the previous dispute, making them politically and fiscally reluctant to offer more so soon.
*   **2024-07-10** New Health Secretary Wes Streeting expresses optimism and desire to "reset" relations. — ↑ — A new government and a conciliatory opening tone created a window for a comprehensive, long-term deal, though this optimism has now faded.
*   **2024-07-08** BMA calls on the new Labour government for a new contract and to work together. — ↑ — Shows the BMA's initial willingness to engage constructively with the new administration, suggesting a deal was possible.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Government's Fiscal Resolve:** The Labour government must balance its promise to improve the NHS against its need to establish fiscal credibility. Conceding to a large pay rise could trigger similar demands from other public sector unions. (Large impact)
2.  **BMA Cohesion & Strike Efficacy:** The BMA's ability to maintain member support for repeated, financially costly strikes and cause significant disruption (e.g., cancelled appointments) is its primary lever. (Large impact)
3.  **NHS Winter Pressures:** A major strike in late November/December will exacerbate the annual winter crisis in the NHS, placing immense political pressure on the Health Secretary to find a resolution to get staff back to work. (Moderate to Large impact)
4.  **Public Opinion:** If the public blames the government for the strikes and failing NHS, pressure to settle will mount. If they view the doctors' demands as unreasonable, the government's position is strengthened. (Moderate impact)
5.  **The Pay Review Body (DDRB) Process:** The government could use a new recommendation from the DDRB as political cover to introduce an offer that exceeds the 5.4% already confirmed, potentially resolving the question even without BMA agreement. (Moderate impact)
6.  **Extremely Short Timeline:** With less than two months until the 2026 deadline, the practical window for negotiation, approval, and implementation of a new pay deal is very narrow, favouring inaction. (Large impact)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **New Labour Government:** Unlike the previous Conservative administration, this government has a historical affiliation with unions and has staked its reputation on fixing the NHS. This could make them more inclined to settle.
*   **"Settled" Precedent:** A deal for the prior two years was agreed upon only months ago (in late 2024). This makes the government's position of "we just made a deal" much stronger than in a typical annual pay round dispute.
*   **Compressed Timeline:** The dispute is coming to a head very close to the resolution deadline (Jan 1, 2026). This short timeframe dramatically reduces the opportunity for the typical cycle of strike, negotiation, and revised offer to play out.
*   **Hardened Positions:** This is not a new dispute but the continuation of a multi-year conflict. Both sides are entrenched, and trust is low, making compromise more difficult despite the "reset" attempt in July 2024.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Starting from the specific reference class of BMA disputes (~65%), but tempering it with the general public sector class (~30%), a blended prior of **~45% (n=20, k=9)** seems reasonable. This acknowledges the BMA's past success but also the general difficulty of extracting more funds.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) A deal covering 2023-25 was just accepted. The government has a strong case that the issue was settled, and re-opening it immediately is unlikely.
    *   (↓ Large) The timeline to resolution is under two months. This severely constrains the time for strikes to have an impact and for a new offer to be formulated and enacted.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Talks have already failed and a strike is called, suggesting the gap between the two sides is wide and not easily bridged.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The new Labour government has a strong political incentive to avoid prolonged NHS chaos, especially during the winter.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence points strongly downwards. The combination of a very recent pay deal and an extremely short timeline are powerful constraints that likely override the BMA's proven resolve and the government's desire for a "reset." The posterior should move **significantly down** from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Health Secretary Wes Streeting makes public statements about finding a "new way forward" or "additional funding."
    *   ACAS or another third-party mediator is brought in to facilitate talks.
    *   The BMA publicly signals a softening of its "full pay restoration" demand towards a multi-year deal.
    *   Leaks suggest the Treasury is considering a revised offer to avert pre-Christmas strikes.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Government rhetoric focuses on "fiscal responsibility" and holding firm against inflation.
    *   The November strike goes ahead with minimal political fallout or public backlash against the government.
    *   Wes Streeting or the Prime Minister explicitly rules out any further offer for the 2025-26 year.
    *   No further talks are scheduled after the November strike.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The government could impose a small, face-saving increase (e.g., 5.4% -> 5.9%) via the DDRB process. This would resolve the question as "Yes" even if the BMA rejects it and the core dispute continues.
*   **Data Gaps:** The precise origin and status of the "5.4% average uplift already confirmed" is unclear. If this is a preliminary figure, it may be easier to revise upwards than if it is a formally accepted DDRB recommendation.
*   **Political Exigency:** A catastrophic event in the NHS during the strike period could dramatically and unpredictably shift the political calculus, forcing the government's hand.
*   **Scenario Fidelity:** The provided sources create a specific scenario as of Nov 2025. Real-world events may differ, but the analysis is based purely on the provided context.

**Final Research Summary:**
Despite the BMA's proven track record of forcing concessions through strikes, a further pay rise before 2026 is unlikely. The government is strongly anchored to the deal agreed just months prior, and the extremely short timeline leaves little room for the political pressure from new strikes to translate into a revised offer.

To forecast the probability of resident doctors in England receiving a further pay increase before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant reference class is the "BMA Junior/Resident Doctor Pay Disputes (since 2015)" with a base rate of 60-75%. This reflects the BMA's history of achieving improved offers through sustained industrial action. However, given the broader context of public sector pay disputes and the new Labour government's dynamics, a blended prior of **45%** is reasonable. This accounts for the BMA's past success but also the general difficulty of extracting more funds from the government.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves the BMA, known for its effective strike actions, and a government that has previously made concessions.
- **Differences:** The recent acceptance of a pay deal for 2023-2025 and the compressed timeline before 2026 are significant constraints. The new Labour government, while historically more union-friendly, faces fiscal pressures and a need to maintain credibility.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Recent Pay Deal (↓ Large):** The acceptance of a recent pay deal makes further concessions unlikely. The likelihood of a further increase given this evidence is low.
- **Compressed Timeline (↓ Large):** With less than two months to negotiate and implement a new deal, the likelihood of a further increase is reduced.
- **Failed Talks and Strike (↓ Moderate):** The breakdown in talks and scheduled strike indicate entrenched positions, reducing the probability of a quick resolution.
- **New Labour Government (↑ Moderate):** The government has political incentives to resolve NHS issues, which could increase the probability of a deal.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 45%, the evidence largely points downwards:
- **Prior Odds:** 0.45 / 0.55 = 0.818
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong downward evidence, let's assume a likelihood ratio of 0.5 (indicating the evidence halves the odds).
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.818 * 0.5 = 0.409
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.409 / (1 + 0.409) ≈ 0.29 or 29%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The analysis might underestimate the government's willingness to act under public pressure or unforeseen NHS crises.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A significant NHS crisis or a shift in public opinion could force the government's hand.
- **Rebuttals:** The recent pay deal and tight timeline are strong constraints, making a further increase unlikely despite potential pressures.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of resident doctors in England receiving a further pay increase before 2026 is **29%**.

Final: 29%

# Will resident doctors in England receive a further pay increase before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I need to identify an appropriate base rate for this event. Looking at the most relevant reference classes:

- **BMA Junior/Resident Doctor Pay Disputes (since 2015)**: In recent disputes (2016 and 2022-2024), sustained strike action eventually led to improved government offers, suggesting a 60-75% probability.
- **Post-2010 UK Public Sector Pay Disputes with Sustained Industrial Action**: Across broader public sector disputes, governments often hold firm despite strikes, with a success rate of 25-40%.
- **New UK Government's First Major Union Negotiation**: New governments have varied responses to their first major disputes, with approximately 50% making concessions.

Given the specific nature of this dispute, I'll weight the BMA-specific reference class most heavily, but temper it with the broader classes. A blended prior of **45%** seems reasonable, acknowledging both the BMA's past success and the general difficulty of extracting additional funds from government.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The BMA has demonstrated willingness to engage in sustained industrial action
- The dispute centers on real-terms pay restoration, similar to previous disputes
- The government faces political pressure to resolve NHS disruption

**Key differences:**
- A pay deal for 2023-25 was recently accepted, creating a strong "settled issue" argument
- The timeline is extremely compressed (less than two months until the 2026 deadline)
- This is a new Labour government with different political incentives than the previous Conservative administration
- The dispute occurs during winter when NHS pressures are highest

These differences significantly alter the dynamics compared to previous disputes, particularly the compressed timeline and recent settlement.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Recent settlement of 2023-25 pay deal**
- P(E|H): Moderate-low (~0.3) - If a further increase were to happen, it would be unusual to reopen a recently settled agreement
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - If no further increase occurs, this recent settlement would be a primary reason
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 2: Extremely short timeline (less than 2 months)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - A further increase would typically require more time for negotiation, approval, and implementation
- P(E|~H): High (~0.9) - The short timeline strongly favors maintaining the status quo
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22 (significantly decreases probability)

**Evidence 3: Failed talks and confirmed five-day strike**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Strikes can lead to improved offers, but also indicate wide gaps in positions
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - Failed talks could indicate entrenched positions on both sides
- Likelihood ratio: 1.0 (neutral)

**Evidence 4: New Labour government with NHS improvement promises**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - A Labour government might be more inclined to resolve NHS disputes
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - But fiscal constraints remain regardless of party
- Likelihood ratio: 1.75 (moderately increases probability)

**Evidence 5: Winter NHS pressures**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Winter pressures create political urgency to resolve disruption
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.5) - But may not overcome other constraints
- Likelihood ratio: 1.4 (slightly increases probability)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 45:55 (0.82:1)

First update (recent settlement):
Posterior odds = 0.82 × 0.375 = 0.31
Posterior probability = 0.31 / (1 + 0.31) ≈ 24%

Second update (short timeline):
Posterior odds = 0.31 × 0.22 = 0.068
Posterior probability = 0.068 / (1 + 0.068) ≈ 6.4%

Third update (new Labour government + winter pressures combined):
Posterior odds = 0.068 × 1.75 × 1.4 = 0.17
Posterior probability = 0.17 / (1 + 0.17) ≈ 14.5%

The evidence strongly suggests a low probability of a further pay increase before 2026, primarily due to the recent settlement and extremely short timeline.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the political pressure on a new Labour government to resolve NHS disputes quickly
- The BMA might accept a smaller symbolic increase rather than full restoration
- The government could use the DDRB process to implement a small increase unilaterally
- Winter NHS crisis could be more severe than anticipated, forcing government action

**Alternative scenario:**
The most plausible alternative is that the government offers a small additional increase (e.g., 5.4% to 6%) as a face-saving measure to end the strikes before the Christmas period. This would technically resolve as "Yes" even if it falls far short of the BMA's demands.

However, even this scenario faces significant hurdles:
- The extremely short timeline makes implementation difficult
- The recent settlement creates a strong precedent against reopening negotiations
- The government would worry about setting a precedent for other public sector unions

After considering these factors, I'll adjust my estimate slightly upward to account for the possibility of a small face-saving increase, but the overall probability remains low.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I assess there is a 15% probability that resident doctors in England will receive a further pay increase before 2026.

Final: 15%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use a blend of the reference classes provided in the research report.

1.  **Most Specific Class:** BMA Junior/Resident Doctor Pay Disputes (since 2015). This class has a base rate of 60-75%, reflecting the BMA's track record of securing improved offers through sustained industrial action.
2.  **Broader Context:** Post-2010 UK Public Sector Pay Disputes. This class has a lower base rate of 25-40%, reflecting a general environment of fiscal restraint where governments often hold firm.
3.  **Situational Context:** New UK Government's First Major Union Negotiation. This has a base rate of ~50%, reflecting high uncertainty as the government seeks to balance campaign promises against establishing fiscal credibility.

The most specific class (BMA disputes) suggests a high probability, but the broader context and the unique political situation of a new government pull in opposite directions. A blended prior that acknowledges the BMA's proven effectiveness but tempers it with the general difficulty of securing public sector pay rises is appropriate. I will therefore adopt the report's reasoned starting point.

**Prior: 45%**. This corresponds to prior odds of 0.45 / (1 - 0.45) = 0.82.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation shares key features with the base case of past BMA disputes: the same actors (BMA, government), the core issue of pay restoration, and the tactic of disruptive strikes.

However, there are critical differences:
*   **New Government:** A new Labour government is in power. This creates a stronger political imperative to "fix the NHS" and avoid prolonged industrial action, but also a strong need to demonstrate fiscal responsibility to markets and other unions.
*   **Recent Settlement:** A pay deal covering the 2023/24 and 2024/25 financial years was accepted by BMA members only months ago (in late 2024). This provides the government with a powerful argument that the matter was recently settled, strengthening its resolve.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves on January 1, 2026, and the current date is November 10, 2025. This leaves less than two months for the entire cycle of strike, political pressure, negotiation, and implementation to occur, which is a very significant constraint.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence to determine their impact on the prior probability. Let H be the event that a further pay increase is enacted before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1 (Strongly Negative):** A pay deal for the previous two years was recently accepted, and the timeline to resolution is under two months.
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of these constraints existing, given that a new deal is about to be struck, is low. Deals require time, and a recent settlement makes a quick follow-on deal less likely.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of these constraints existing, given no new deal will be struck, is high. These are primary reasons why a deal would fail; the government can run out the clock and point to the previous agreement.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): << 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability of a new deal.

*   **Evidence 2 (Strongly Positive):** A new Labour government is facing its first winter, a period of maximum NHS pressure, and the strikes are timed to maximize political damage.
    *   P(E2 | H): The probability of this intense political pressure, given a deal is made, is high. This pressure is the primary driver that would force a government U-turn.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): The probability of this pressure, given the government holds firm, is lower. A government would prefer to avoid such a politically damaging scenario if possible.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR): > 1.** This evidence increases the probability of a deal.

*   **Evidence 3 (Mechanism):** The resolution can occur via a unilaterally imposed government decision, likely using a recommendation from the Pay Review Body (DDRB) as political cover.
    *   This is not evidence for or against, but a crucial mechanism. It provides a plausible, face-saving path to a "Yes" resolution that bypasses the need for a lengthy, formal negotiation with the BMA. This makes the positive pressure from Evidence 2 more potent, as the government has a viable escape route.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will perform a conceptual update based on the evidence.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 0.82 (45% probability).
2.  **Apply Negative Evidence:** The combined effect of the short timeline and the recent pay deal is a powerful argument against a new negotiated settlement. I estimate a strong likelihood ratio of approximately 0.25 for this evidence.
    *   *Updated Odds:* 0.82 × 0.25 = 0.205. (This corresponds to a ~17% probability).
3.  **Apply Positive Evidence:** The immense political pressure on a new government, combined with the plausible "DDRB escape hatch," strongly pushes back in the other direction. This scenario is exactly what would compel a government to find a way to say yes. I estimate a likelihood ratio of approximately 2.25 for this counter-pressure.
    *   *Final Odds:* 0.205 × 2.25 = 0.461.
4.  **Convert to Posterior Probability:**
    *   Posterior Probability = 0.461 / (1 + 0.461) ≈ 0.315.

The resulting posterior probability is approximately 32%. This reflects that while the structural barriers make a deal difficult, the political pressure on the new government creates a very real possibility of them forcing a solution.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 32% could be too low if I am underestimating the political panic that a full-blown winter NHS crisis could induce in a new government. Their entire political project rests on being better stewards of the NHS than the previous government, and they might pay almost any price to avoid failing on that in their first year.

Conversely, the forecast could be too high. I might be underestimating the Treasury's resolve and the government's fear of setting a precedent for other public sector unions. The timeline is a hard, physical constraint; even with political will, the machinery of government may not move fast enough to get a new pay award approved and enacted before the new year.

The 32% figure attempts to balance these risks. It correctly identifies the outcome as unlikely, but acknowledges a plausible, politically-driven path to a "Yes" resolution that has roughly a 1-in-3 chance of occurring.

### Final Forecast
The base rate for BMA disputes suggests a high chance of success, but this is a unique situation. The extremely short timeline and the existence of a recent pay deal are powerful factors against a further increase. However, the immense political pressure of a winter strike on a new Labour government, combined with the plausible face-saving mechanism of a government-imposed Pay Review Body recommendation, creates a significant chance of a "Yes" resolution. Weighing these competing factors, the negative constraints appear slightly stronger than the political pressure.

Final: 32%
