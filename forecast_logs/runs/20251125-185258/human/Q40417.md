### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the historical distribution of the release decades for UK Christmas number ones?** This will establish the overall base rate and identify different "eras" of the chart.
*   **Q2: What are the defining characteristics of the modern (post-2018) era?** This involves analyzing the end of the *X Factor*'s influence, the rise and fall of the LadBaby phenomenon, and the subsequent shift.
*   **Q3: What are the primary mechanisms driving a song to the Christmas number one spot today?** This includes the role of streaming, social media campaigns, charity appeals, and traditional releases by major artists.
*   **Q4: Why did a catalogue song ("Last Christmas," 1984) win in both 2023 and 2024?** Understanding this recent trend is critical for forecasting 2025. Is it a durable pattern or a temporary anomaly?
*   **Q5: Who are the potential actors or what are the potential song types for 2025?** This involves assessing the likelihood of a new charity champion, a major artist release, another social media campaign, or a continuation of the streaming-driven classic trend.

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

The history of the UK Christmas #1 can be divided into distinct eras. The early era (1952-2004) was dominated by contemporary releases. The *X Factor* era (2005-2014, with a 2009 interruption) institutionalized this, with the winner's debut single being the default #1. The post-*X Factor* era saw a brief return to normal before the LadBaby era (2018-2022) created a new template: a highly organized, charity-focused social media campaign releasing a contemporary (reworked) novelty song.

LadBaby's retirement in 2023 created a power vacuum. This vacuum was not filled by a new contemporary artist or a new campaign, but by the immense, passive power of streaming. Perennial holiday favorites like Wham!'s "Last Christmas" and Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" are now automatically added to millions of playlists, generating enormous, sustained streaming numbers throughout December. Without a strong, focused challenger, this streaming momentum was sufficient for "Last Christmas" (1984) to secure the top spot in both 2023 and 2024. This establishes a new default state for the chart race: a streaming-powered classic is the song to beat.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**

---

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All Christmas #1s (1952-2024):** N=73. The vast majority (approx. 90%) were contemporary releases, hitting #1 in the same year or the year after their original release. Catalogue songs winning are rare historical exceptions.
    *   **2020s:** 43% (3/7)
    *   **1980s:** 11% (8/73, inflated by Wham!'s two recent wins)
    *   **1990s:** 15% (11/73, includes RATM's 2009 win)
    *   *Limitation:* This class is dominated by a pre-streaming, sales-based market and is not representative of the current environment.

2.  **Post-X Factor Dominance Era (2015-2024):** N=10. This period reflects the modern, fragmented media landscape.
    *   **2020s:** 30% (LadBaby x3)
    *   **2010s:** 40% (Charity, Ed Sheeran, LadBaby x2)
    *   **1980s:** 20% (Wham! x2)
    *   **1960s:** 10% (NHS Choir)
    *   *Reasoning:* This class better reflects the potential for different winning formulas (charity, major artist, streaming classic) but is skewed by the five-year dominance of a single actor (LadBaby).

3.  **"Open Field" Era (2009, 2023-2024):** N=3. These are the only years in the modern chart era without a dominant, pre-established force like *X Factor* or LadBaby.
    *   **1980s:** 67% (Wham! in '23, '24)
    *   **1990s:** 33% (Rage Against the Machine in '09)
    *   **2020s:** 0%
    *   *Reasoning:* This is the most plausible reference class. It represents what happens when there is no "kingmaker," forcing a contest between organized campaigns and the passive force of streaming. It strongly favors catalogue songs.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2022-12-23** LadBaby secures their fifth and final Christmas #1. (→) — This event marked the end of a 5-year era of dominance by a contemporary charity act, creating the power vacuum for the subsequent years.
*   **2023-12-22** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) becomes Christmas #1 for the first time. (↑ for 1980s) — This established that in the absence of a LadBaby-style campaign, the sheer force of streaming for a classic song was enough to win.
*   **2024-12-20** Wham!'s "Last Christmas" repeats as Christmas #1. (↑↑ for 1980s) — This confirmed the 2023 result was not a fluke but the establishment of a new pattern and a new "song to beat" in an open field.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Streaming Momentum (Large):** Perennial Christmas classics ("Last Christmas," "All I Want for Christmas Is You") are embedded in millions of personal and curated playlists, generating a massive, hard-to-overcome baseline of chart points throughout December.
*   **Organized Social Media Campaign (Large):** A focused campaign with a compelling narrative (e.g., anti-corporate, charity) can mobilize enough purchases and dedicated streams to overcome the streaming classics. This was the model for RATM (2009) and LadBaby (2018-22).
*   **Major Artist Contemporary Release (Moderate):** A genuine blockbuster hit from a superstar like Adele, Taylor Swift, or Ed Sheeran released in Q4 could still win, but it's now harder as it must compete with both streaming classics and potential campaigns.
*   **Charity Angle (Moderate):** A strong charitable cause provides a powerful narrative for a campaign, boosting media attention and public engagement. This was key to LadBaby's success.
*   **"Incumbent Fatigue" (Small-to-Moderate):** After two consecutive wins, there may be a desire among the public or media to see a different song at #1, potentially fueling an alternative campaign against "Last Christmas."

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Structural Dominance of Streaming:** Unlike the sales-driven era that makes up most of the historical base rate, the current market gives a huge structural advantage to catalogue songs with enduring popularity.
*   **Absence of a "Kingmaker":** For most of the last 20 years, *X Factor* or LadBaby acted as institutional forces that reliably produced a contemporary winner. This institutional support is now gone.
*   **The Power Vacuum:** LadBaby's exit has not yet been filled by a successor. No new, equally effective charity/novelty act has emerged to capture public imagination.
*   **High Barrier to Entry for New Songs:** A new song must now achieve massive viral success or be backed by a superstar to overcome the built-in streaming advantage of holiday classics.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior can be anchored to the "Open Field" reference class (N=3), suggesting a ~67% chance for the 1980s, ~33% for the 1990s, and a very low probability for other decades, especially contemporary ones.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **Wham!'s 2024 repeat victory (↑ Large for 1980s):** This is the most significant piece of new evidence. It confirms the "streaming classic as default" hypothesis and establishes "Last Christmas" as the clear incumbent to beat.
    *   **Continued absence of a LadBaby successor (↑ Moderate for older decades):

To forecast the decade in which the 2025 UK Christmas number one will have been originally released, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

**Base Rate Selection:**
- **1960s or earlier:** Historically rare for Christmas number ones, especially in recent decades.
- **1970s:** Similarly rare, with few examples in recent history.
- **1980s:** Recently, Wham!'s "Last Christmas" from 1984 topped the charts in 2023 and 2024, suggesting a strong base rate for this decade.
- **1990s:** Rage Against the Machine's 1992 song topped the charts in 2009, but no recent examples.
- **2000s:** No significant examples in recent years.
- **2010s:** Some examples, but less relevant given the recent trend towards older songs.
- **2020s:** Historically dominant, but recent years have seen a shift towards older songs.

**Base Rate Probabilities:**
- **1960s or earlier:** 5%
- **1970s:** 5%
- **1980s:** 50% (due to recent wins by Wham!)
- **1990s:** 10%
- **2000s:** 5%
- **2010s:** 10%
- **2020s:** 15%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is characterized by the absence of a dominant contemporary force like LadBaby or *X Factor*, and the structural dominance of streaming, which favors older, popular songs. This is different from the historical norm where contemporary releases dominated.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Wham!'s "Last Christmas" winning in 2023 and 2024:** Strong evidence for the 1980s, as it shows the power of streaming for classic songs.
- **Absence of a new dominant contemporary force:** Increases the likelihood of older songs winning.
- **Streaming momentum:** Strongly favors older, well-loved songs that are part of holiday playlists.

**Likelihood Assessments:**
- **1980s:** High likelihood given recent trends.
- **Other decades:** Lower likelihood due to lack of recent examples and the streaming advantage for older songs.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

**Posterior Calculation for 1980s:**
- **Prior Odds (1980s):** 50% / (100% - 50%) = 1
- **Likelihood Ratio (1980s):** High likelihood due to recent wins.
- **Posterior Odds (1980s):** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 1 × High = High
- **Posterior Probability (1980s):** High / (1 + High) ≈ 60%

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a new social media campaign or a major artist release disrupting the trend.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A strong charity campaign or a viral hit from the 2020s could challenge the dominance of older songs.
- **Adjustment:** Slightly increase probabilities for 2020s and 1990s to account for these possibilities.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100% and adjust for calibration.

### 7. Output Format

Final forecast as probabilities for each option:

1960s or earlier: 5%  
1970s: 5%  
1980s: 60%  
1990s: 10%  
2000s: 5%  
2010s: 5%  
2020s: 10%  

(sum ~100%)

# Forecasting the Decade of the 2025 UK Christmas Number One

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll consider three reference classes to establish priors:

**Reference Class 1: All Christmas #1s (1952-2024)**
This is too broad as it spans different eras with different market dynamics.

**Reference Class 2: Post-X Factor Era (2015-2024)**
* 2020s: 30% (LadBaby x3)
* 2010s: 40% (Charity singles, Ed Sheeran, LadBaby x2)
* 1980s: 20% (Wham! x2)
* 1960s: 10% (NHS Choir)

**Reference Class 3: "Open Field" Era (2009, 2023-2024)**
* 1980s: 67% (Wham! in '23, '24)
* 1990s: 33% (Rage Against the Machine in '09)
* 2020s: 0%

I'll use Reference Class 3 as my primary prior since it best represents the current market conditions where there's no dominant institutional force like X Factor or LadBaby. This gives us:
- 1980s: 67%
- 1990s: 33%
- All other decades: ~0%

However, I'll adjust this slightly to account for the possibility of other decades, giving:
- 1980s: 60%
- 1990s: 25%
- 2020s: 10%
- Other decades: 5% combined

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The "open field" conditions persist with no X Factor and no LadBaby
- Streaming continues to dominate chart calculations
- Classic Christmas songs have established streaming momentum

**Key differences:**
- "Last Christmas" has now won twice in a row, potentially creating both momentum and fatigue
- By 2025, there will have been more time for a new charity campaign or artist to emerge
- The longer we go without a contemporary Christmas #1, the more likely someone will organize to create one

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Wham!'s "Last Christmas" repeat victory in 2024**
- P(E|1980s): Very high (~0.9) - This strongly reinforces the pattern of 1980s dominance
- P(E|~1980s): Low (~0.2) - This makes other decades less likely

**Evidence 2: Continued absence of a LadBaby successor**
- P(E|older decades): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Favors streaming classics from earlier decades
- P(E|2020s): Moderate-low (~0.3) - Makes contemporary releases less likely

**Evidence 3: Streaming structural advantage for classics**
- P(E|1980s/1990s): High (~0.8) - The most streamed Christmas classics are from these decades
- P(E|other decades): Low (~0.2) - Other decades have fewer streaming-friendly Christmas classics

**Evidence 4: Potential "incumbent fatigue" for "Last Christmas"**
- P(E|1980s): Moderate (~0.5) - May reduce chance of "Last Christmas" three-peat but could benefit other 1980s classics
- P(E|~1980s): Moderate-high (~0.7) - Increases chances for non-1980s songs

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on Evidence 1 (Wham!'s repeat victory) for the 1980s:

Prior odds for 1980s: 60/40 = 1.5
Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.2 = 4.5
Posterior odds: 1.5 × 4.5 = 6.75
Posterior probability: 6.75/(1+6.75) ≈ 0.87 or 87%

This seems too high given the uncertainties, so I'll temper this with other evidence.

For Evidence 4 (incumbent fatigue):
Prior probability (after Evidence 1): 87%
Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.7 ≈ 0.71
Posterior odds: (87/13) × 0.71 ≈ 4.78
Posterior probability: 4.78/(1+4.78) ≈ 0.83 or 83%

Qualitatively adjusting for all evidence:
- The 1980s remains strongly favored due to "Last Christmas" momentum and other 1980s classics like Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You"
- The 1990s has a moderate chance due to streaming classics and the RATM precedent
- The 2020s has a reduced but still significant chance if a major artist or campaign emerges
- Other decades have minimal chances but aren't impossible

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recency bias from the 2023-2024 Wham! victories
- I might be underestimating the likelihood of a new organized campaign emerging
- The research doesn't mention potential major artist releases planned for late 2025

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major artist (Taylor Swift, Adele, etc.) could release a Christmas-themed song in 2025
- A new charity campaign could emerge with strong public support
- A viral TikTok trend could propel an older song from another decade

**Best alternative forecast:**
The strongest alternative would be to give more weight to the 2020s, arguing that the vacuum left by LadBaby will eventually be filled by a contemporary artist or campaign. This would increase the 2020s probability to perhaps 25-30%.

**Rebuttal:**
While plausible, this alternative doesn't account for the structural advantage streaming now gives to established classics. The barrier for a new song to overcome this advantage is extremely high.

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and red-teaming, I'll adjust my probabilities:

- 1980s: 65% (primarily due to "Last Christmas" and other 1980s classics)
- 1990s: 15% (potential for RATM-style campaign or other 1990s classics)
- 2020s: 15% (possibility of new campaign or major artist)
- 2000s: 3% (some streaming classics from this era)
- 2010s: 1% (few enduring Christmas classics from this decade)
- 1970s: 0.5% (limited streaming classics)
- 1960s or earlier: 0.5% (very limited streaming classics)

## 7. Output Format

1960s or earlier: 0.5%
1970s: 0.5%
1980s: 65%
1990s: 15%
2000s: 3%
2010s: 1%
2020s: 15%
(sum 100%)

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The history of the UK Christmas number one can be divided into distinct eras, making a single base rate from all 73 winners (1952-2024) misleading due to fundamental changes in the music industry (e.g., the shift from physical sales to streaming).

A more appropriate, albeit small, reference class is the "Open Field" era: years in the modern chart environment without a dominant, pre-established "kingmaker" like *The X Factor* or LadBaby. These years are 2009, 2023, and 2024.

*   **2009:** Rage Against the Machine, "Killing in the Name" (1992) -> **1990s**
*   **2023:** Wham!, "Last Christmas" (1984) -> **1980s**
*   **2024:** Wham!, "Last Christmas" (1984) -> **1980s**

This small (N=3) but highly relevant sample gives a raw base rate of:
*   **1980s:** 67%
*   **1990s:** 33%
*   **All other decades:** 0%

This prior strongly suggests that in the absence of an organized contemporary campaign, a catalogue song from the 80s or 90s is the most likely winner. I will use this as a strong starting point, but smooth the probabilities to allow for the possibility of a contemporary winner, which was the norm for decades prior.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The 2025 race is highly similar to 2023 and 2024. The underlying market mechanics are dominated by streaming. There is no institutional "kingmaker" like *The X Factor*. As of now, no clear successor to the LadBaby charity campaign model has emerged. This means the "default" conditions that led to Wham!'s victories remain in place.
*   **Differences:** The primary difference is that "Last Christmas" is now a two-time consecutive winner. This could create "incumbent fatigue," where the media, public, or a competing artist might launch a more concerted effort to crown a different song, either another classic or a new release. This dynamic was not present in 2023 and was less pronounced in 2024.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Wham!'s consecutive wins in 2023 and 2024.**
    *   This evidence has a very high likelihood if the 1980s option is true (P(E|H)). It confirms that the passive, immense streaming power of a beloved classic is the new default state of the Christmas chart race in a power vacuum.
    *   The likelihood is very low if a contemporary (2020s) song is the true most likely outcome (P(E|~H)).
    *   This evidence strongly reinforces the high prior for the 1980s.

*   **Evidence 2: The continued absence of a LadBaby successor.**
    *   LadBaby's five-year streak demonstrated the power of a well-organized, contemporary charity campaign. The fact that no one successfully replicated this model in 2023 or 2024 suggests it is difficult to execute.
    *   This evidence increases the probability of older decades winning relative to the 2020s, as it suggests the path for a contemporary song is challenging.

*   **Evidence 3: The structural dominance of streaming.**
    *   Streaming platforms and user-generated holiday playlists heavily favor a small number of perennial classics. The two undisputed giants are Wham!'s "Last Christmas" (1984) and Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You" (1994).
    *   This structural feature of the market provides a massive, durable advantage to songs from the 1980s and 1990s over all other decades.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's start with the "Open Field" prior: P(1980s) ≈ 67%, P(1990s) ≈ 33%.

The evidence of Wham!'s *repeat* victory in 2024 is crucial. It's not just another data point; it establishes a trend and a clear incumbent. This confirms the "streaming classic as default" hypothesis. This evidence pushes the probability for the 1980s even higher than the initial 67% base rate, as it solidifies "Last Christmas" as the specific song to beat.

However, we must account for other possibilities. The main challenger to Wham! is Mariah Carey (1994), making the 1990s the most likely alternative classic decade. A new contemporary song (2020s) is also a significant possibility, either from a major artist or a new charity campaign aiming to break the monotony.

Let's model the scenarios:
1.  **Status Quo (Default):** No strong challenger emerges, and the passive streaming momentum of "Last Christmas" carries it to a third victory. This is the most probable single outcome.
2.  **Classic Challenger:** A campaign or organic movement forms around another classic, most likely Mariah Carey's song, to prevent a Wham! three-peat.
3.  **Contemporary Disruption:** A new charity champion emerges, or a superstar (e.g., Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran) releases a massive hit that captures the public's imagination.

Assigning probabilities to these scenarios, the Status Quo seems most likely. I'll place the initial posterior for the **1980s at ~55%**. The Classic Challenger (benefiting the **1990s**) and Contemporary Disruption (benefiting the **2020s**) are the next most likely outcomes, splitting most of the remaining probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 1980s, reflecting the new status quo. The biggest risk is overconfidence in this recent trend. The "incumbent fatigue" factor could be stronger than anticipated. The UK public and betting markets have a history of rallying around an underdog or a novelty campaign to create a "story." A third consecutive win for Wham! might be perceived as a "boring" outcome, increasing the motivation for a coordinated campaign against it.

The best alternative forecast would significantly increase the probability for the 2020s, arguing that the LadBaby era revealed a public appetite for new, engaging Christmas chart battles, and that two years of a passive classic winning is enough to spur a successful contemporary challenger into action.

While this is a plausible scenario, creating a campaign with the reach and appeal of LadBaby's is extremely difficult. The path of least resistance remains the passive victory of the streaming behemoth. Therefore, while I acknowledge the risk and have allocated a significant 15% to a 2020s song, the 1980s remain the strong favorite. The 1990s are also a major contender, as a vote for Mariah Carey could be seen as an "anti-Wham" vote without needing to back an unknown new song. My distribution reflects this, with the 1980s, 1990s, and 2020s comprising 90% of the probability mass.

### 6. Final Normalization

I will set the final probabilities based on the reasoning above, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **1980s (55%):** Represents the default scenario where the incumbent, "Last Christmas," wins again via dominant streaming numbers.
*   **1990s (20%):** The most likely challenger. Primarily represents Mariah Carey's "All I Want for Christmas Is You," which could benefit from an "anyone but Wham!" sentiment. Also covers the possibility of another RATM-style campaign.
*   **2020s (15%):** The probability of a successful contemporary challenger, either a major artist or a new charity campaign filling the LadBaby vacuum.
*   **1970s (5%):** A tier-two classic (e.g., Slade, Wizzard) could be the subject of a smaller campaign.
*   **2010s (3%):** A song from this decade is not yet a "classic" but not brand new. Less likely to have the momentum of either.
*   **1960s or earlier (1%):** Very unlikely due to changing musical tastes, but a niche campaign is not impossible.
*   **2000s (1%):** Similar to the 2010s, caught between classic and contemporary status.

The sum is 55 + 20 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 100%.
