### Reference class & base rates
- **Major US Foreign Aid/Global Health Initiatives (> $1B/year):** Programs of this scale and international standing (e.g., the Peace Corps, USAID core functions, The Global Fund contributions) are rarely eliminated outright. They may be reformed, have budgets cut, or be restructured, but complete termination is historically anomalous. The base rate of a program of this size and tenure (~20 years) being eliminated in any given year is extremely low, likely **<1%**. This is derived from observing the continuity of major foreign policy programs across different administrations over the last 50 years.
- **Politically Contentious Federal Programs During a Change in Administration:** Programs that become central to a partisan ideological battle face a higher risk. However, even highly controversial programs (e.g., the National Endowment for the Arts, Corporation for Public Broadcasting) have survived repeated termination attempts. The base rate for elimination in the first year of a hostile administration might be slightly higher, perhaps in the **2-5% range**, but still low due to legislative and bureaucratic inertia.
- **Programs Losing Bipartisan Authorization:** PEPFAR's failure to secure a five-year reauthorization in 2023, shifting to a one-year extension and now operating on annual appropriations, places it in a more vulnerable class. While not a death sentence, it signals a significant increase in risk compared to its historical status. The base rate for programs in this category facing termination or forced consolidation within two years is likely higher, perhaps **5-10%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- **2025-10-16** KFF report details ongoing administrative efforts to review and potentially reorganize PEPFAR, highlighting sustained executive pressure. (↑) — Confirms the administration's intent remains a high-level priority, moving beyond initial rhetoric.
- **2025-09-30** Fiscal Year 2025 ends without a new FY2026 appropriations bill; government begins operating on a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR). (↑) — A CR creates legislative chaos and provides opportunities for opponents to insert policy riders or force funding cuts in subsequent negotiations.
- **2025-09-15** A coalition of over 100 faith-based and global health organizations launches a high-profile "Save PEPFAR" campaign, targeting key Republican senators. (↓) — Mobilizes powerful counter-pressure, reminding legislators of the program's deep support base and humanitarian impact, making a vote for elimination more costly.
- **2025-08-05** Leaked White House memo outlines a plan to merge PEPFAR's functions into a new "America First Global Health" bureau within the State Department, effectively dissolving the current structure. (↑) — Provides a concrete mechanism for elimination that fits the resolution criteria ("merging...with PEPFAR no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization").
- **2025-07-22** The House Appropriations Committee, in a party-line vote, passes a State & Foreign Operations bill with a 50% cut to PEPFAR's budget, but not full elimination. (↑) — Signals strong hostile intent from a key part of Congress, though stopping short of the full elimination required for resolution.
- **2025-06-10** The Supreme Court declines to hear the administration's appeal of the February 2025 injunction, leaving the lower court's order to resume aid in place for now. (↓) — Reinforces that the judicial branch is a significant obstacle to the administration's attempts to unilaterally halt the program's funding and operations.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Executive Hostility & "America First" Ideology:** The Trump Administration's stated desire to review, cut, and realign foreign aid is the primary driver. This can manifest as executive orders, refusal to disburse funds (impoundment), or proposals for reorganization/merger. (Size: Large)
- **Congressional Opposition:** A vocal and organized faction in the House of Representatives, influenced by groups like the Heritage Foundation, is actively seeking to defund or terminate the program over abortion-related concerns. Their power is magnified during contentious budget negotiations. (Size: Large)
- **Judicial Restraint:** Federal courts have already demonstrated a willingness to block the administration's attempts to halt funding unilaterally. Ongoing legal challenges serve as a powerful brake on executive action. (Size: Moderate)
- **Bipartisan Legacy & Senate Support:** PEPFAR was a signature achievement of a Republican president (G.W. Bush) and retains significant, albeit weakened, support among Senate Republicans and Democrats, who can block hostile legislation from the House. (Size: Moderate)
- **Bureaucratic & Operational Inertia:** PEPFAR is a massive global operation integrated into the State Department and USAID. Dismantling its contracts, grants, and personnel in dozens of countries cannot be done overnight and would create immediate, visible chaos, generating immense diplomatic and political blowback. (Size: Moderate)
- **Appropriations Process:** The most direct path to elimination is defunding through the congressional appropriations process. The outcome of the FY2026 budget battle (or a year-end omnibus/CR) is the most critical mechanism. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Fractured Bipartisan Consensus:** Unlike most of its history, PEPFAR is no longer a point of unified bipartisan pride. Its entanglement in the US abortion debate is a recent and potent vulnerability not shared by most other major foreign aid programs.
- **Targeted Executive Animus:** The current (hypothetical) administration has shown a unique willingness to challenge long-standing foreign policy norms and institutions, unlike previous administrations that might have sought budget cuts but not outright elimination of such a landmark program.
- **Specific Dissolution Plan:** The existence of a leaked plan to merge/dissolve PEPFAR (as opposed to vague calls for cuts) makes the threat more concrete and actionable than the general political opposition faced by other controversial programs.
- **Extremely Short Timeline:** The question resolves in just over one month. This makes legislative elimination very difficult unless attached to a must-pass vehicle like a government funding bill. It also means a court-delayed executive action would likely push resolution past the deadline.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior:** Start with a low prior, ~2-4%, based on the reference class of major, established federal programs facing hostility. The "equivalent n" is high (e.g., n=50), reflecting the strong historical precedent of institutional stability.
- **Evidence mapping:**
    - (↑ Large) Sustained and specific executive branch hostility, including a concrete merger plan.
    - (↑ Moderate) House Appropriations Committee passing a major cut, showing congressional will.
    - (↓ Moderate) Judicial branch successfully blocking unilateral executive action thus far.
    - (↓ Moderate) Enduring, though weakened, bipartisan/institutional support, especially in the Senate and from advocacy groups.
    - (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (~5 weeks) presents immense procedural and logistical hurdles to completing any elimination mechanism before Jan 1, 2026.
- **Net effect:** The evidence strongly pushes the probability up from the very low base rate. However, the powerful constraints of the judicial system and, most importantly, the short timeline, cap the potential increase. The posterior should be significantly higher than the prior, but still well below 50%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators:**
    - A specific rider to defund or terminate PEPFAR is included in the next Continuing Resolution or omnibus spending bill.
    - The White House formally announces the plan to merge PEPFAR into a new bureau.
    - A key Senate moderate (e.g., Collins, Murkowski) signals they will not block PEPFAR's defunding.
    - The administration announces it will defy court orders regarding funding disbursement.
- **DOWN indicators:**
    - Congress passes a "clean" CR or omnibus bill that funds PEPFAR at or near current levels.
    - The Senate Majority Leader makes a strong public statement vowing to protect the program.
    - A new, more forceful court injunction is issued against the administration's actions.
    - High-profile Republicans (e.g., former President G.W. Bush) publicly condemn efforts to end the program.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Resolution Ambiguity:** "Ceases to exist" could be contentious. If the administration rebrands the program under a new name but with 90% of the same functions, does it count? The "no longer continuing to operate as a distinct organization" clause suggests yes, but this could be a gray area.
- **Legal Limbo:** The program could be functionally inert due to a funding freeze and legal battles on Jan 1, 2026, but not officially terminated. This would likely resolve as "No," but its status would be ambiguous.
- **Government Shutdown:** A shutdown could freeze all operations, but this is a temporary state and does not mean the program has "ceased to exist" for resolution purposes. However, a shutdown could be the political vehicle used to force a permanent change.
- **Hypothetical Scenario Risk:** The background is a detailed future scenario. Real-world events could unfold differently, and the provided sources are themselves part of this constructed narrative. The forecast is entirely dependent on the internal logic of this scenario.

**Final Research Summary:** The risk to PEPFAR's existence is the highest in its history due to a confluence of determined executive hostility and fractured congressional support. However, its elimination before Jan 1, 2026, is severely constrained by judicial roadblocks, institutional inertia, and an exceptionally short timeline, making a successful termination or merger by the deadline unlikely, though not impossible.

To forecast the probability of the PEPFAR program ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, let's follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major US foreign aid programs being eliminated is extremely low, historically less than 1%. However, given the current political climate and specific challenges PEPFAR faces, a more appropriate base rate might be in the 5-10% range, reflecting the increased risk due to political opposition and lack of long-term reauthorization.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: PEPFAR is a major, long-standing US foreign aid program, akin to others that have historically persisted despite political challenges.
   - Differences: Unlike many programs, PEPFAR is currently facing significant political opposition, a lack of bipartisan support, and specific plans for restructuring or merging, which are not typical for programs of its size and history.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Executive Hostility & Merger Plan**: The Trump Administration's hostility and the leaked merger plan increase the likelihood of PEPFAR ceasing to exist. This evidence suggests a higher probability of elimination than the base rate.
   - **Congressional Actions**: The House Appropriations Committee's budget cut indicates strong opposition, further increasing the likelihood.
   - **Judicial Restraint**: The courts blocking unilateral executive actions decrease the likelihood of PEPFAR's elimination.
   - **Bipartisan Support & Advocacy**: The ongoing support from some Senate members and advocacy groups decreases the likelihood.
   - **Short Timeline**: The short time frame before the resolution date significantly decreases the likelihood of complete elimination or restructuring.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of around 5-10%, the evidence of executive hostility and congressional actions increases this probability. However, the judicial restraint, bipartisan support, and short timeline act as significant constraints.
   - Conceptually, if we start with a prior of 7% and consider the evidence, the likelihood ratio might increase this to around 15-20%, accounting for the strong opposition but also the significant barriers to elimination.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the administration's determination or overestimating judicial and bipartisan support. However, the short timeline remains a critical factor.
   - An alternative scenario could involve a last-minute legislative maneuver or executive action that bypasses current constraints, but this remains unlikely given the procedural hurdles.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and constraints, the probability of PEPFAR ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026, is estimated to be around 15%.

Final: 15%

# Will the PEPFAR program cease to exist before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish a base rate for the likelihood of a major, established U.S. foreign aid program being eliminated within a short timeframe.

**Reference classes to consider:**
- Major U.S. foreign aid programs (>$1B/year) that have been eliminated
- Programs facing significant political opposition during administration changes
- Programs that lost bipartisan authorization support

Looking at historical precedent, major foreign aid programs with PEPFAR's scale ($6.5B/year) and longevity (20+ years) are rarely eliminated outright, especially within such a short timeframe (approximately 5 weeks from today until January 1, 2026). Even politically contentious programs typically undergo budget cuts or restructuring rather than complete elimination.

The most relevant base rate is for programs that have lost bipartisan authorization support and face both executive and legislative branch opposition. In this category, the probability of elimination within a 5-week window is still quite low, around **5-8%**.

**Prior probability: 7%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- PEPFAR is a major, established foreign aid program with significant institutional inertia
- It has international recognition and a documented track record of success
- It has some remaining bipartisan support, particularly in the Senate
- Bureaucratic and operational complexity makes rapid dismantling difficult

**Key differences:**
- Unusually strong executive branch hostility with specific plans for reorganization
- Explicit targeting in a leaked White House memo outlining a merger plan
- Recent loss of long-standing bipartisan consensus due to abortion politics
- Already operating without long-term reauthorization (only annual appropriations)
- Judicial intervention has already occurred, creating a complex legal situation
- Extremely compressed timeline (only ~5 weeks remaining until resolution date)

These differences suggest an upward adjustment from the base rate, but the extremely short timeline is a significant limiting factor on how high the probability can reasonably go.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence increasing probability:**

1. **Executive Order pausing foreign aid (January 2025)**
   - P(E|H): ~90% (Very likely to see this action if elimination is planned)
   - P(E|~H): ~30% (Could happen for other reasons, like temporary review)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
   - This signals clear executive intent against PEPFAR, but has been partially blocked by courts

2. **House Appropriations Committee 50% budget cut (July 2025)**
   - P(E|H): ~95% (Almost certain to see budget cuts if elimination is the goal)
   - P(E|~H): ~40% (Budget cuts can happen without full elimination)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~2.4
   - Shows legislative pathway is being pursued, though not yet complete elimination

3. **Leaked White House merger plan (August 2025)**
   - P(E|H): ~95% (A specific plan would be needed for elimination)
   - P(E|~H): ~20% (Unlikely to see such specific plans if not serious)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~4.8
   - Provides a concrete mechanism that would satisfy resolution criteria

**Evidence decreasing probability:**

1. **Federal judge ordering resumption of aid (February 2025)**
   - P(E|H): ~40% (Judicial intervention is possible but not guaranteed)
   - P(E|~H): ~80% (More likely to see courts block elimination attempts)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
   - Shows judicial branch is actively constraining executive action

2. **Supreme Court declining to hear appeal (June 2025)**
   - P(E|H): ~30% (Would expect more successful appeals if elimination is imminent)
   - P(E|~H): ~70% (More consistent with program continuing)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.43
   - Reinforces judicial obstacles to rapid elimination

3. **"Save PEPFAR" campaign by 100+ organizations (September 2025)**
   - P(E|H): ~60% (Would expect opposition mobilization)
   - P(E|~H): ~70% (Similar advocacy happens for threatened but continuing programs)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.86
   - Shows significant institutional resistance, though not decisive

4. **Extremely short timeline (5 weeks remaining)**
   - P(E|H): ~20% (Very difficult to complete elimination in this timeframe)
   - P(E|~H): ~95% (Consistent with program continuing past January 1)
   - Likelihood ratio: ~0.21
   - This is perhaps the strongest constraint on the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 7% (odds of 7:93 or about 1:13.3), I'll update based on the most significant evidence:

**First update - Executive hostility and merger plan:**
- Prior odds: 7:93 ≈ 0.075
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.8
- Posterior odds: 0.075 × 4.8 ≈ 0.36
- Posterior probability: 0.36/(1+0.36) ≈ 26.5%

**Second update - Judicial constraints:**
- Prior odds: 26.5:73.5 ≈ 0.36
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.5
- Posterior odds: 0.36 × 0.5 ≈ 0.18
- Posterior probability: 0.18/(1+0.18) ≈ 15.3%

**Third update - Timeline constraints:**
- Prior odds: 15.3:84.7 ≈ 0.18
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.21
- Posterior odds: 0.18 × 0.21 ≈ 0.038
- Posterior probability: 0.038/(1+0.038) ≈ 3.7%

After these updates, I need to reconsider whether I've underweighted some factors.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the timeline constraints. Executive actions can sometimes be implemented very rapidly, especially with determined leadership.
- The merger plan could be executed quickly if preparations have been ongoing behind the scenes.
- I might be overestimating judicial constraints if the administration finds ways to comply technically while still effectively ending the program.
- The continuing resolution situation creates a unique opportunity for legislative action that might not be reflected in historical base rates.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A government shutdown scenario in December could create leverage for PEPFAR opponents to demand its elimination in exchange for reopening government.
- The administration could announce the merger/reorganization in December but with an effective date of January 1, 2026, which might still count as "ceasing to exist" under the resolution criteria.
- Congressional Republicans might attach PEPFAR elimination to must-pass legislation in December.

**Adjustments:**
These considerations suggest I may have underestimated the probability. The existence of a specific merger plan and the leverage created by budget negotiations are particularly important factors. However, the timeline remains extremely tight, and judicial constraints are real.

I'll adjust my estimate upward to account for these factors, but still keeping it below 10% given the significant practical and legal hurdles to elimination within 5 weeks.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I assess that PEPFAR has approximately a 6% chance of ceasing to exist before January 1, 2026. This reflects:

1. The clear executive intent to eliminate or fundamentally transform the program
2. The existence of a specific merger plan that would satisfy resolution criteria
3. The significant legislative opposition in the House
4. BUT CONSTRAINED BY:
   - The extremely short timeline (only 5 weeks)
   - Judicial intervention that has already blocked similar attempts
   - The operational complexity of dismantling a $6.5B global program
   - Remaining bipartisan support, especially in the Senate

Final: 6%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the termination of a major, long-standing US federal program. The appropriate reference class is other large-scale (> $1 billion/year), established (>15 years) foreign policy or global health initiatives (e.g., USAID, Peace Corps, contributions to The Global Fund).

Historically, the outright elimination of such programs is extremely rare. They possess significant bureaucratic, political, and international inertia. Even when facing political hostility, they tend to be reformed or have their budgets cut rather than being completely terminated. The base rate of a program in this class being eliminated in any given year is very low, likely under 2%.

However, PEPFAR in this scenario has lost its key protection: bipartisan consensus. It is now operating on temporary authorizations and is the subject of intense partisan attack from both the executive and legislative branches. A more appropriate reference class might be "major federal programs under active termination threat from a hostile administration." Even in this class (e.g., NEA, CPB), termination is rare, but the risk is significantly elevated.

Given this heightened risk profile, I will select a prior probability of **5%** for the program being eliminated within a one-year timeframe under these hostile conditions. This corresponds to prior odds of 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   PEPFAR is a large, complex global operation with deep institutional roots in the State Department and USAID, creating significant inertia against rapid change.
*   It retains a powerful support base, including faith-based organizations, the global health community, and some moderate Republicans, who can exert counter-pressure.

**Differences:**
*   **Extreme Executive Hostility:** Unlike typical partisan disagreements over funding levels, the hypothetical Trump administration has a stated ideological goal to overhaul foreign aid and has already taken concrete, albeit legally challenged, steps against PEPFAR. The existence of a leaked merger plan makes the threat specific and actionable.
*   **Loss of Bipartisan Shield:** The program's entanglement in the US abortion debate has transformed it from a symbol of bipartisan unity into a partisan flashpoint, making it uniquely vulnerable.
*   **Extremely Short Timeline:** The most critical factor is the timeline. The question resolves on January 1, 2026, which is only five weeks from the scenario's current date of November 25, 2025. This period includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, when legislative and administrative action typically slows. This short window is a massive constraint on implementing such a major policy change.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event "PEPFAR ceases to exist before Jan 1, 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Leaked White House memo on merger plan & House Appropriations vote for a 50% cut.**
    *   P(E | H): High. These actions are strong precursors to an actual termination attempt. A successful termination would almost certainly be preceded by such planning and legislative signaling.
    *   P(E | ~H): Moderate. Such plans and votes can also be political posturing or opening bids in a negotiation that ultimately results in a compromise (e.g., smaller cuts) that leaves the program in existence.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1:** This evidence strongly increases the probability from the base rate.

*   **Evidence 2: Ongoing judicial injunctions blocking unilateral executive action.**
    *   P(E | H): Low. For the program to be eliminated via executive action, these legal barriers would have to be overcome or defied, which is a difficult and high-risk path.
    *   P(E | ~H): High. The existence of successful legal challenges is a primary reason why the program would survive an executive-led termination attempt.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio << 1:** This evidence strongly decreases the probability, acting as a major brake on the executive path to elimination.

*   **Evidence 3: The government is operating on a Continuing Resolution (CR).**
    *   This is an ambiguous piece of evidence. A CR creates a high-stakes, must-pass legislative vehicle, which is the perfect opportunity for opponents to attach a rider to defund or terminate PEPFAR (increasing P(H)). However, the need to pass the bill also gives leverage to the program's defenders in the Senate, who can demand a "clean" bill that preserves the status quo (decreasing P(H)). It increases the variance and creates an opportunity, so I view it as slightly increasing the probability of a decisive outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The core of the problem is whether the hostile actors (White House, House GOP) can overcome the institutional barriers (Senate, Judiciary, bureaucracy) within the tight 5-week deadline. I will model the two most plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution.

1.  **The Legislative Path:** Opponents succeed in attaching a rider to a must-pass spending bill in December that either eliminates funding for PEPFAR or legislatively terminates/merges it.
    *   The House would likely pass such a measure.
    *   However, it would face a near-certain filibuster in the Senate, where PEPFAR retains some bipartisan support. Overcoming this filibuster in a short, holiday-adjacent timeframe is highly unlikely. The most probable outcomes are a compromise that preserves PEPFAR (perhaps with cuts) or another clean CR that pushes the fight into 2026.
    *   I estimate the probability of the Senate caving and passing a full termination rider at **8%**.

2.  **The Executive Path:** The administration takes new, unilateral action to merge or terminate the program, defying or attempting to circumvent the existing court orders.
    *   This is plausible given the administration's stated goals and past actions.
    *   However, it would trigger an immediate and intense legal and political battle. The resolution criteria could be met if the administration formally declares the program dissolved, even if the action is later overturned.
    *   Given the existing injunctions, this would be a legally and politically risky move. I estimate the probability of such an action being taken and successfully meeting the resolution criteria before Jan 1 at **6%**.

Assuming these paths are roughly independent, the combined probability is approximately:
P(H) ≈ P(Legislative Path) + P(Executive Path) = 8% + 6% = 14%.

This posterior is significantly higher than the initial base rate, reflecting the specific and severe threat. However, it remains well below 50%, acknowledging the formidable institutional and temporal constraints.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 14% could be too low if I am underestimating the resolve of the administration and its allies in Congress. In a chaotic, must-pass budget scenario, a determined minority can extract major concessions. A bold, norm-breaking executive order could be issued specifically to meet the deadline, leaving the consequences for later. In this view, the probability might be closer to 20-25%.

Conversely, the forecast could be too high. I might be underestimating institutional inertia and the political toxicity of shutting down the government over the holidays to end a famous humanitarian program. The path of least resistance is almost always to maintain the status quo via another CR. From this perspective, the true probability might be closer to 5-10%.

My 14% forecast attempts to balance these competing factors. It treats the termination of PEPFAR as a serious possibility but not a likely outcome given the immense hurdles to be cleared in just five weeks.

### 6. Final Forecast
The probability is driven upward by the clear and present threat from a hostile executive and House, with a specific plan and an imminent legislative opportunity. However, this is strongly counteracted by judicial blocks, likely Senate opposition, and, most critically, an extremely short 5-week timeline that makes overcoming these barriers very difficult. My final probability synthesizes these competing forces.

Final: 14%
