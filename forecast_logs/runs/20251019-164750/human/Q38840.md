### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: EUR/USD trading history (1999-2023).** The Euro has existed for ~25 years (~300 months). It has traded below parity (1.0000) for a total of approximately 36 months, primarily from 2000-2002, and for a brief two-month period in late 2022.
    -   **Base Rate:** This suggests a raw historical base rate of ~12% (36/300) for any given month being below parity. The probability of it happening at least once over a ~14-month period would be significantly higher, perhaps in the **20-30% range**, assuming independence (which is a flawed assumption but useful for a starting point).
-   **Reference Class 2: Major currency pair declines of >15% within ~14 months.** The current EUR/USD rate is ~1.17. Reaching <1.0000 requires a drop of ~15% or more. Such moves in G10 currencies are uncommon but not unprecedented, especially during periods of high volatility or major policy divergence.
    -   **Base Rate:** Occurrences of this magnitude happen perhaps once every 5-10 years for a given pair, suggesting a ballpark probability in the **10-20% range** for any given ~14-month window.
-   **Limitations:** These base rates are weak priors. Currency markets are non-stationary; the drivers of the early 2000s (post-Euro introduction uncertainty) are different from today. The 2022 dip was driven by a specific energy crisis and aggressive Fed hiking, which may not be analogous to the current situation.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-10-17] Current EUR/USD rate is 1.1681, per ECB data. (↓) — The rate is significantly above the 1.0000 threshold, creating a large gap to close in the remaining ~14 months.
-   [2025-09-19] Forex.com notes rising stagflation risk in the US following the second consecutive September Fed rate cut. (↑) — Stagflation could force the Fed into a difficult choice, potentially leading to policy volatility that strengthens the USD (a risk-off asset).
-   [2025-09-17] EUR/USD reached a yearly high of 1.1837, per ECB data. (↓) — Reinforces the recent trend of Euro strength and dollar weakness, moving further away from the parity threshold.
-   [2025-09-XX] Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, following a similar cut in Sep 2024. (↓) — Lower US interest rates decrease the attractiveness of the dollar, putting downward pressure on the USD and upward pressure on EUR/USD.
-   [2025-01-13] EUR/USD hit a yearly low of 1.0198, per ECB data. (↑) — This is the strongest evidence for "Yes". It demonstrates that despite the recent rally, the pair was extremely close to parity within the last 10 months, indicating high underlying volatility.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Interest Rate Differentials (Fed vs. ECB):** The relative difference in central bank policy rates is a primary driver. Further Fed cuts relative to the ECB will weaken the dollar. A hawkish pivot by the Fed or a dovish one by the ECB would strengthen it. **(Size: Large)**
-   **Relative Economic Growth Outlooks:** Stronger relative growth in the Eurozone compared to the US would support the Euro. Conversely, signs of a US economic rebound or a deep Eurozone recession would strengthen the dollar. **(Size: Large)**
-   **Geopolitical Shocks / Risk Sentiment:** The US dollar is the world's primary safe-haven currency. A major global crisis (e.g., military conflict, financial instability) would likely trigger a flight to safety, causing a rapid and significant strengthening of the dollar. **(Size: Large, but low probability)**
-   **Energy Prices:** The Eurozone is a major net energy importer, making the Euro more sensitive to energy price shocks than the dollar. A sudden, sharp spike in oil or natural gas prices would disproportionately harm the European economy and weaken the Euro. **(Size: Moderate)**
-   **Inflation Dynamics:** Persistently high inflation in the US could force the Fed to reverse its rate cuts, strengthening the dollar. Conversely, if Eurozone inflation proves stickier than US inflation, it could pressure the ECB to be more hawkish. **(Size: Moderate)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Monetary Policy Stance:** Unlike the 2022 period of aggressive Fed *hiking* that drove the dollar up to parity, the current environment (late 2025) is defined by a Fed *easing* cycle. This creates a fundamental headwind against dollar strength.
-   **Starting Point:** The current rate of ~1.17 is significantly higher than the levels from which the pair fell in 2022 (e.g., it was ~1.13 in Feb 2022 before the main decline). A larger shock is required to reach parity from this level.
-   **Market Consensus:** There is a strong consensus among major financial institutions (RBC, J.P. Morgan) for continued dollar weakness into 2026. This is a strong contrast to 2022 when the consensus was for dollar strength.
-   **Demonstrated Volatility:** While the trend is for a weaker dollar, the dip to 1.0198 in January 2025 shows that the market remains highly volatile and capable of large swings, a feature more pronounced now than in many historical periods.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior based on the historical reference classes suggests a probability of around **15-25%**, with a low equivalent n (e.g., n=5) due to the non-stationary nature of FX markets.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The current Fed easing cycle and strong institutional consensus for further dollar weakness are powerful arguments against reaching parity.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The current exchange rate of ~1.17 provides a significant buffer, requiring a >15% drop in ~14 months.
    -   (↑ Large) The demonstrated dip to 1.0198 in Jan 2025 is a critical piece of evidence, showing that parity is well within the recent volatile trading range.
    -   (↑ Small) The mention of rising US stagflation risks introduces a plausible path to a Fed policy reversal or market panic that could strengthen the dollar.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The strong recent trend and policy environment (↓) are countered by the demonstrated high volatility and proximity to the threshold earlier in the year (↑). The net effect should likely be a **slight downward revision** from the initial prior, as the current trend and policy direction are more certain than the potential for a future shock.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (EUR/USD < 1.0000 becomes more likely):**
    -   Hawkish commentary from Federal Reserve officials suggesting an end or reversal of the easing cycle.
    -   US inflation (CPI, PCE) data coming in consistently above expectations.
    -   Deteriorating Eurozone economic data (e.g., German PMI, EU-wide GDP forecasts).
    -   A significant escalation of any global geopolitical conflict.
    -   The Dollar Index (DXY) breaking and holding above key technical levels (e.g., 100).
-   **DOWN indicators (EUR/USD < 1.0000 becomes less likely):**
    -   The Federal Reserve signaling more rate cuts are planned for 2026.
    -   Stronger-than-expected economic growth data from the Eurozone.
    -   A sustained decline in energy prices.
    -   The EUR/USD exchange rate breaking above the recent high of 1.1837.
    -   ECB officials signaling a more hawkish stance to combat inflation.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Forecast Unreliability:** Institutional FX forecasts are notoriously unreliable and often extrapolate recent trends. The strong consensus for dollar weakness could be a contrarian indicator.
-   **Black Swan Events:** The forecast horizon of ~14 months is long enough for an unforeseen geopolitical or financial crisis to occur, which would render current economic models moot and likely trigger a safe-haven run to the dollar.
-   **Non-Linearity:** Currency movements are not linear. The approach to a major psychological level like 1.0000 can trigger complex market dynamics, including the defense of options barriers, which can either accelerate or halt a decline.
-   **Data Interpretation:** The provided sources are a snapshot. The narrative around stagflation or a DXY bottom could be a minority view that does not materialize.
-   **Resolution Source:** The resolution depends on Google Finance. While generally reliable, brief, anomalous ticks could theoretically trigger resolution, though this is unlikely for a major pair like EUR/USD.

**Final Research Summary:**
The current monetary policy environment and institutional forecasts strongly suggest continued dollar weakness, making a drop to parity unlikely. However, the market has shown extreme volatility within the last year, coming within 2% of the threshold, indicating that a significant economic or geopolitical shock could still plausibly push the Euro below the dollar before 2026.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for the EUR/USD exchange rate being below parity is approximately 12% for any given month, based on the 36 months out of 300 months since the Euro's inception. For a 14-month period, this base rate could be adjusted to around 20-30%, assuming independence.
   - Given the historical frequency and the non-stationary nature of currency markets, a base rate of 20% is a reasonable starting point.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves the potential for significant currency fluctuations, as seen in past periods when the Euro traded below parity.
   - Differences: The current monetary policy environment is characterized by a Fed easing cycle, contrasting with the aggressive Fed hiking in 2022. The starting exchange rate is also higher, requiring a larger drop to reach parity.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Current Fed easing cycle and consensus for dollar weakness (↓): This evidence suggests a lower likelihood of the Euro dropping below parity, as it decreases the attractiveness of the dollar. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - Recent exchange rate of ~1.17 (↓): The significant gap from parity suggests a lower probability of reaching parity. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - Dip to 1.0198 in January 2025 (↑): Demonstrates high volatility and proximity to parity, increasing the likelihood of a drop below parity. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - Rising US stagflation risks (↑): Introduces a plausible scenario for dollar strengthening, increasing the likelihood of parity. Likelihood ratio > 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.20 / 0.80 = 0.25
   - Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratios for the Fed easing cycle and current exchange rate suggest a downward adjustment, while the dip to 1.0198 and stagflation risks suggest an upward adjustment.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × (Likelihood ratio for evidence)
   - Assuming a net likelihood ratio slightly less than 1 due to stronger evidence against parity, the posterior probability is adjusted downward from the prior.
   - Posterior probability ≈ 15%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for unforeseen shocks or policy changes.
   - Alternative scenario: A geopolitical crisis or unexpected economic data could rapidly strengthen the dollar.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slightly higher probability to account for tail risks and market volatility.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential risks, the final calibrated probability is 18%.

Final: 18%

# Will 1 Euro be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider two relevant reference classes:

1. **Historical EUR/USD parity occurrences**: The Euro has existed for ~25 years (300 months) and has traded below parity for approximately 36 months total - primarily in 2000-2002 and briefly in late 2022. This gives a base rate of 12% for any given month being below parity.

2. **Major currency pair declines of >15% within ~14 months**: The current EUR/USD rate is around 1.17, meaning we need a ~15% decline to reach parity. Such significant moves in G10 currencies typically occur once every 5-10 years, suggesting a 10-20% probability in any given 14-month window.

Considering both reference classes and the specific timeframe (until January 2026, about 14 months from now), I'll set my prior at **18%**. This reflects the historical frequency of parity events while accounting for the magnitude of the required move within the specified timeframe.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The EUR/USD pair remains subject to the same fundamental drivers as historically: interest rate differentials, economic growth differentials, and risk sentiment.
- Currency markets continue to exhibit periods of high volatility, as shown by the dip to 1.0198 in January 2025.

**Key differences:**
- **Monetary policy stance**: Unlike the 2022 period when the Fed was aggressively hiking rates (which drove the dollar to parity), we're now in a Fed easing cycle with two recent rate cuts (September 2024 and 2025).
- **Starting point**: The current rate of ~1.17 is significantly higher than pre-decline levels in 2022 (~1.13), requiring a larger shock to reach parity.
- **Market consensus**: Major financial institutions (RBC, J.P. Morgan) forecast continued dollar weakness into 2026, with RBC projecting EUR/USD at 1.24 by end-2026.

These differences suggest a lower probability than the base rate would indicate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Current EUR/USD rate of 1.1681 (October 2025)**
- P(E|H): If parity will occur, we would expect the current rate to be closer to 1.00
- P(E|~H): If parity won't occur, we would expect the rate to be comfortably above 1.00
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|~H) > P(E|H), decreasing probability
- The current level requires a significant 15% decline in ~14 months, which is a substantial hurdle

**Evidence 2: Recent Fed rate cuts (September 2024 and 2025)**
- P(E|H): If parity will occur, we would expect tightening US monetary policy, not easing
- P(E|~H): If parity won't occur, we would expect exactly what we're seeing - Fed easing
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|~H) > P(E|H), decreasing probability
- Fed cuts typically weaken the dollar, pushing EUR/USD higher, not lower

**Evidence 3: EUR/USD dipped to 1.0198 in January 2025**
- P(E|H): If parity will occur, we would expect to see recent approaches to parity
- P(E|~H): If parity won't occur, such dips would be less likely or less severe
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H) > P(E|~H), increasing probability
- This demonstrates high volatility and shows parity was within reach recently

**Evidence 4: Rising stagflation risk in the US (September 2025)**
- P(E|H): If parity will occur, economic complications like stagflation could force policy volatility
- P(E|~H): If parity won't occur, such risks would be contained or not materialize
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H) slightly > P(E|~H), slightly increasing probability
- Stagflation could force the Fed into difficult choices that might strengthen USD as a safe haven

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 18% (odds of 0.22:1), I'll update based on the key evidence:

**Update 1: Current EUR/USD rate and Fed easing cycle (combined)**
- These factors strongly suggest parity is less likely
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5 (conservative estimate)
- Posterior odds = 0.22 × 0.5 = 0.11
- Posterior probability = 0.11 ÷ (1 + 0.11) ≈ 10%

**Update 2: January 2025 dip to 1.0198**
- This demonstrates volatility and proximity to parity
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5 (conservative estimate)
- Posterior odds = 0.11 × 1.5 = 0.165
- Posterior probability = 0.165 ÷ (1 + 0.165) ≈ 14%

**Update 3: Stagflation risk in the US**
- This introduces a plausible path to dollar strength
- Likelihood ratio: 1.1 (small effect)
- Posterior odds = 0.165 × 1.1 = 0.1815
- Posterior probability = 0.1815 ÷ (1 + 0.1815) ≈ 15%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent trends (dollar weakness) and underestimating the potential for rapid reversals in FX markets.
- The consensus for dollar weakness could be a contrarian indicator - when everyone expects one outcome, markets often deliver the opposite.
- I haven't fully accounted for potential black swan events (major geopolitical conflicts, financial crises) that could trigger a flight to safety and dollar strength.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 25-30%, arguing that:
1. The January 2025 dip to 1.0198 shows we're just one shock away from parity
2. 14 months is a long time in FX markets, with ample opportunity for trend reversals
3. Historical volatility suggests larger swings are common

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, the current monetary policy divergence (Fed cutting while ECB holds) creates a fundamental headwind against dollar strength that would be difficult to overcome without a major crisis. The trend since January 2025 has been consistently away from parity, not toward it.

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll make a small upward adjustment to account for tail risks and the demonstrated volatility, moving from 15% to 17%.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the historical base rates, the current market conditions, and the specific evidence available, I believe there is a 17% probability that 1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2026.

Final: 17%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, I will use two reference classes:
1.  **Frequency of Parity in 2-Year Windows:** The Euro has existed since 1999. We can look at non-overlapping 2-year periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, ..., 2021-2022). Out of 12 such periods, the EUR/USD rate fell below 1.00 in 3 of them (the first two periods, 2000-2002, and the last one, 2022). This gives a raw base rate of 3/12 = 25%.
2.  **Magnitude of Required Move:** The current rate (as of Oct 2025 in the report) is ~1.17. Reaching parity requires a drop of over 14.5% in the remaining ~14 months. For major G10 currency pairs, a move of this size over such a period is uncommon but not unprecedented, happening perhaps once every 5-10 years. This suggests an annual probability of 10-20%.

Considering these two approaches, I will select a prior probability of **20%**. This acknowledges that such an event is relatively infrequent but has happened multiple times, including recently.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the historical average in several key ways:
*   **Monetary Policy Divergence:** The most recent instance of parity (2022) was driven by an aggressive Federal Reserve *hiking* cycle, which created a strong tailwind for the US dollar. The current scenario described in the report is the opposite: a Fed *easing* cycle (rate cuts), which creates a fundamental headwind for the dollar. This makes the current situation less conducive to dollar strength than the 2022 precedent.
*   **Starting Exchange Rate:** The current rate of ~1.17 is a significant buffer. The decline in 2022 started from a lower peak (around 1.13-1.14). A larger shock or a more sustained trend is required to close the gap this time.
*   **Market Volatility:** On the other hand, the report notes a dip to 1.0198 in January 2025. This demonstrates that despite the higher average rate, the market has recently shown extreme volatility and has come very close to the threshold, making it more similar to a high-volatility regime.

Overall, the fundamental policy environment makes reaching parity harder than in the most recent successful case, suggesting our final probability should be lower than the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis "1 Euro will be worth less than 1 US Dollar before 2026".
*   **Evidence 1 (Pro-H): Dip to 1.0198 in Jan 2025.**
    *   P(E1 | H): It is very likely we would see a near-miss or high volatility around the parity level if it were to be breached. This dip shows that parity is within the market's recent trading range.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): It is less likely that the rate would get so close to parity if it were destined to stay comfortably above it for the entire period.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1:** This is strong evidence *increasing* the probability of H. It demonstrates the market's capacity for a large swing.

*   **Evidence 2 (Anti-H): Fed Easing Cycle.**
    *   P(E2 | H): A dollar surge strong enough to break parity is unlikely to occur while the Fed is actively cutting rates (which weakens the dollar), unless the cuts are a response to a crisis that also triggers a massive flight to safety.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): A Fed easing cycle is highly consistent with a weaker dollar and the EUR/USD rate remaining elevated.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio < 1:** This is very strong evidence *decreasing* the probability of H. It is the primary fundamental factor working against a dollar rally.

*   **Evidence 3 (Pro-H): Rising US Stagflation Risk.**
    *   P(E3 | H): Stagflation (high inflation, low growth) could force the Fed to abandon its easing cycle and raise rates to fight inflation, providing a plausible mechanism for a sharp dollar rally.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): If the Euro remains strong, it's more likely that US inflation is under control, making a hawkish Fed reversal less probable.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio > 1:** This is moderate evidence *increasing* the probability of H, as it provides a clear causal path for the main anti-H evidence (Fed easing) to be invalidated.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** A 20% probability corresponds to prior odds of 0.20 / 0.80 = **1:4**.
2.  **Update with Strongest Evidence:** The Fed's easing cycle is the most powerful piece of evidence. This is a strong headwind for the dollar. Let's estimate its likelihood ratio as 1/4 (i.e., this evidence is 4 times more likely if parity is *not* reached).
    *   Posterior Odds = (1:4) × (1/4) = **1:16**.
    *   This corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 16) ≈ 5.9%.
3.  **Update with Counter-Evidence:** The dip to 1.0198 is a powerful reminder of volatility. It shows that despite the fundamentals, the market can swing wildly. This evidence makes H more likely. Let's assign it a likelihood ratio of 2.5. The stagflation risk adds to this, providing a mechanism for the volatility to be directed toward a stronger dollar. Let's combine these for a total likelihood ratio of ~3.
    *   Posterior Odds = (1:16) × 3 = **3:16**.
    *   This corresponds to a final probability of 3 / (3 + 16) = 3/19 ≈ 15.8%.

This calculation feels a bit high. The Fed's policy is a more certain, ongoing factor than the *potential* for a future shock. I will moderate the update from the pro-H evidence. A combined likelihood ratio of 2 for the volatility and stagflation risk seems more appropriate.
*   Revised Final Odds = (1:16) x 2 = 2:16 = **1:8**.
*   Revised Final Probability = 1 / (1 + 8) = 1/9 ≈ **11.1%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of ~11% is significantly higher than the Manifold market's forecast of 5.4%. Am I being overconfident in the "tail risk" scenario? The market may be correctly assessing that the bar for the Fed to reverse its easing cycle is extremely high, and that without that, a flight-to-safety shock would have to be enormous to counteract the monetary policy headwind. The 15% move required from the current level of 1.17 is substantial.

However, the market could be extrapolating the recent trend of dollar weakness too readily. A 14-month period is long enough for a significant economic or geopolitical shock to occur, and the US dollar remains the ultimate safe haven. The dip to 1.0198 is a factual data point showing this is not a purely theoretical risk. My forecast is an attempt to price in this non-trivial tail risk of a shock event, which the market seems to be under-pricing. I will stick to a forecast in this range, slightly higher than a simple trend extrapolation would suggest. I'll adjust my final number to 12% to reflect a slightly higher weight on the demonstrated volatility.

### Final Forecast
The final forecast synthesizes a 20% base rate with conflicting evidence. The strong fundamental headwind of the Federal Reserve's easing cycle pushes the probability down significantly. However, this is countered by the market's recently demonstrated high volatility (dipping to 1.0198) and the existence of plausible scenarios (like a stagflation-induced policy reversal) that could cause a rapid dollar appreciation. The resulting probability is low, but meaningfully above zero to account for the tail risk of a major shock over the next 14 months.

Final: 12%
