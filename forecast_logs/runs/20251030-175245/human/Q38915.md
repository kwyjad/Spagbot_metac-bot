### Reference class & base rates
-   **Major US Intellectual Property (IP) Lawsuits:** Historically, court-ordered damages or fines exceeding $100M in copyright or trade secret cases are rare. They typically involve willful, large-scale commercial infringement between direct competitors (e.g., patent disputes) or massive piracy operations. The base rate for a novel technology case reaching such a judgment within ~3 years of filing is likely low, perhaps **5-10%**.
-   **Class-Action Lawsuits Against Major Tech Companies:** These frequently result in settlements, with a non-trivial number exceeding $100M. However, these are almost always for privacy violations (e.g., BIPA in Illinois) or antitrust issues, not copyright infringement. The legal theories and potential for statutory damages are different. This class suggests a higher possibility of a large payout (**10-20%**), but the underlying legal cause is a poor match.
-   **Litigation Involving Transformative New Technologies:** Cases involving new technologies that disrupt existing industries (e.g., VCRs in *Sony v. Universal*, music file-sharing in *A&M Records v. Napster*) often take many years to resolve and can involve landmark Supreme Court rulings. A swift, high-penalty outcome is atypical; courts tend to proceed cautiously. This reference class suggests a very low base rate for a resolution by 2026, perhaps **<5%**.

*Reasoning:* Blending these, the most relevant class is novel IP litigation. The legal questions around AI training are foundational and unsettled, suggesting a long and cautious judicial process. A plausible base rate prior to examining recent evidence is in the **5-15% range**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2024-09-XX] Appeal Certified in Copilot Case — ↓ — The Ninth Circuit certifying an appeal on dismissed claims, as noted in a source, introduces significant delay. Appeals processes make a final resolution and payment by the end of 2025 extremely unlikely for this specific, leading case.
-   [2024-07-30] GitHub Copilot Lawsuit "Largely Dismissed" — ↓ — A federal judge dismissed the majority of the 22 original claims, significantly weakening the plaintiffs' overall case and reducing the likelihood of a massive damages award.
-   [2024-07-08] Key DMCA Claim Dismissed in Copilot Case — ↓ (large) — The dismissal of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claim is critical. DMCA violations carry statutory damages that can be aggregated across a class, representing one of the clearest paths to a >$100M award. Its removal guts a major financial threat.
-   [2024-07-09] Only Two Claims Remain in Copilot Case — ↓ — With only breach of contract and an open-source license violation claim remaining, the potential for damages is substantially lower than under the dismissed copyright and DMCA claims. These claims are harder to scale to a nine-figure sum across a class.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Judicial Interpretation of "Fair Use" (Large):** This is the central, unresolved legal question. A definitive ruling that training AI models on copyrighted data is *not* fair use would dramatically increase defendants' liability and drive settlement values up. Conversely, a ruling favoring fair use would cripple most ongoing cases.
-   **Pace of US Federal Litigation (Large):** The timeline is a primary driver. Complex, novel class-action lawsuits typically take 3-5+ years to reach trial, with appeals adding more time. The short horizon to resolution (end of 2025) makes a court-ordered judgment highly improbable. This is a strong downward driver.
-   **Surprise Settlement Pressure (Moderate):** The most plausible path to a "YES" resolution. A company might pay a large sum to eliminate legal uncertainty, avoid damaging revelations during discovery, or quell public/investor backlash, even if they believe they would ultimately win in court.
-   **Statutory Damages Availability (Moderate):** The ability to claim statutory damages (e.g., up to $150,000 per infringed work under copyright law) is the primary mechanism for reaching a >$100M award. The dismissal of DMCA claims in the Copilot case significantly weakens this driver.
-   **Discovery of a "Smoking Gun" (Small):** If discovery in any of the major cases (e.g., *NYT v. OpenAI*) uncovers internal communications showing developers knew they were infringing copyright and proceeded anyway, it would destroy a "good faith" defense and massively increase pressure for a high-value settlement.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Unsettled Core Legal Question:** Unlike typical IP cases where infringement is more clear-cut (e.g., pirating a film), the question of whether AI training constitutes "fair use" is entirely novel. This legal ambiguity encourages lengthy litigation rather than quick resolution.
-   **"Transformative Use" Defense:** The argument that AI models transform ingested data into something fundamentally new is a powerful, modern application of the fair use doctrine, making this case distinct from past precedents like Napster, which involved simple distribution of identical copies.
-   **Scale of Potential Infringement:** The number of potentially infringed works used in training is astronomical (billions of images, texts, code snippets), creating a theoretical damages figure so large it may seem punitive and unrealistic to a court, potentially encouraging judicial restraint.
-   **Economic and Strategic Importance:** The defendants are among the world's largest and best-capitalized companies, and the technology is foundational to their future strategy. They have immense resources and motivation to fight a precedent-setting case to the end, rather than accept a large, early settlement that would invite further lawsuits.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A prior of **~10%** seems reasonable, reflecting the general rarity of such large, swift judgments in novel and complex IP litigation. (Equivalent n of ~10-20 observations).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   ↓ (Large): Dismissal of the most financially potent claims (DMCA, direct copyright) in the leading *GitHub Copilot* lawsuit severely curtails the most direct path to a >$100M award.
    -   ↓ (Large): The slow pace of litigation, now compounded by an appeal in the *Copilot* case, makes the Dec 31, 2025 deadline for a final court order exceptionally difficult to meet.
    -   ↓ (Moderate): The remaining claims (breach of contract) are less likely to aggregate to a nine-figure sum than the dismissed statutory claims.
    -   ↑ (Small): The existence of multiple, parallel lawsuits (*NYT v. OpenAI*, *Getty v. Stability AI*, etc.) increases the number of "shots on goal" for a potential large settlement or surprise ruling, slightly countering the negative news from the *Copilot* case.
-   **Net effect:** The recent evidence, particularly the procedural and substantive setbacks for plaintiffs in the most advanced case, is overwhelmingly negative. The posterior probability should be revised **significantly downward**.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A major AI company (e.g., OpenAI, Microsoft) unexpectedly announces a settlement >$100M in any of the ongoing cases.
    -   A judge in a different case (e.g., *NYT v. OpenAI*) rules that AI training is *not* protected by fair use at a preliminary stage (e.g., denying a motion to dismiss).
    -   The Ninth Circuit quickly reverses the lower court's dismissal of DMCA claims in the *Copilot* case (highly unlikely within the timeframe).
    -   Leaked internal documents from an AI company suggesting willful infringement.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Judges grant motions to dismiss in other major AI training lawsuits.
    -   Courts grant summary judgment in favor of AI companies on the basis of fair use.
    -   Parties in the *NYT* or *Getty* cases agree to discovery and trial schedules that extend into 2026 or beyond.
    -   Major plaintiffs' firms

To forecast the probability of a US court fining or ordering a company to pay >=$100M due to data usage in AI model training before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for major US intellectual property lawsuits resulting in damages or fines exceeding $100M is historically low, especially for novel technology cases. Given the novelty and complexity of AI-related copyright issues, a base rate of **5-15%** is reasonable. This reflects the rarity of such large judgments in similar contexts and the typical duration of complex litigation.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves novel IP litigation, similar to past cases involving transformative technologies (e.g., VCRs, file-sharing). These cases often take years to resolve and involve complex legal questions.
- **Differences:** The legal questions around AI training are more foundational and unsettled, suggesting a cautious judicial approach. The scale of potential infringement is vast, but the legal theories are untested, making swift, large judgments unlikely.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Dismissal of Key Claims:** The dismissal of DMCA and other potent claims in the GitHub Copilot case significantly reduces the likelihood of a large damages award. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.
- **Appeal Process:** The certification of an appeal introduces further delays, making a resolution by the end of 2025 unlikely. This also decreases the probability.
- **Remaining Claims:** The remaining claims (breach of contract) are less likely to result in a nine-figure sum. This decreases the probability.
- **Parallel Lawsuits:** The existence of multiple lawsuits provides more opportunities for a large settlement or ruling, but the setbacks in the leading case outweigh this factor. This slightly increases the probability but is overshadowed by negative evidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** Start with a prior of 10%.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The dismissal of key claims and the appeal process are strong negative indicators. Assume a likelihood ratio of 0.2 for these combined factors.
- **Posterior Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 10% / 90% = 0.111
  - Posterior odds = 0.111 × 0.2 = 0.0222
  - Posterior probability = 0.0222 / (1 + 0.0222) ≈ 2.17%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the potential for a surprise settlement or a rapid legal development. However, given the current legal landscape and procedural delays, the low probability seems justified.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A major company might settle to avoid uncertainty, but the likelihood of this leading to a >$100M payout by 2025 is low given the current legal setbacks.
- **Adjustments:** Consider a slight upward adjustment for the possibility of an unexpected settlement, but the overall probability remains low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for unforeseen developments, the final calibrated probability is **3%**.

Final: 3%

# Probability Assessment: Will a US court fine or order a company to pay ≥$100M for AI training data use before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for large court-ordered payments (≥$100M) in novel technology/intellectual property cases within a limited timeframe.

Relevant reference classes:
- **Major IP litigation outcomes**: Large judgments (≥$100M) in copyright/IP cases are uncommon, especially for novel legal questions
- **Timeline for complex litigation**: Federal IP cases typically take 3-5+ years to reach final judgment
- **Novel technology precedents**: Cases involving transformative technologies (VCRs, file sharing) often take many years to resolve

Based on these reference classes, I'll set a prior of **10%**. This reflects the general rarity of such large judgments in novel IP cases, especially within a ~3 year timeframe from initial filing to final resolution.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Involves alleged IP infringement at scale
- Major tech companies with substantial resources to fight litigation
- Potential for class action structure

**Key differences**:
- The legal question is entirely novel - whether AI training constitutes "fair use" has no direct precedent
- The scale of potential infringement is unprecedented (billions of works)
- The timeline constraint (by end of 2025) is extremely tight for complex litigation
- The defendants are among the world's most valuable companies with existential interest in the outcome

These differences generally make a swift, large judgment less likely than the base rate would suggest.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Dismissal of DMCA claims in GitHub Copilot case (July 2024)**
- P(E|H): If a large judgment will occur, we would expect core claims to survive dismissal = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If no large judgment will occur, we would expect dismissal of key claims = 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Only breach of contract claims remain in leading case**
- P(E|H): If a large judgment will occur, we would expect statutory damage claims to remain = 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no large judgment will occur, we would expect only weaker claims to remain = 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.7 = 0.286 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Appeal certified in Copilot case, extending timeline**
- P(E|H): If a large judgment will occur by 2026, we would expect expedited proceedings = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If no large judgment will occur by 2026, we would expect normal/extended timeline = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.333 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 4: Multiple parallel lawsuits ongoing (NYT v. OpenAI, Getty v. Stability AI)**
- P(E|H): If a large judgment will occur, we would expect multiple "shots on goal" = 0.7
- P(E|~H): If no large judgment will occur, we might still see multiple lawsuits = 0.6
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.6 = 1.167 (weak evidence for)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 10%/90% = 1/9

First update (DMCA dismissal):
- Posterior odds = 1/9 × 0.375 = 0.042
- Posterior probability = 0.042/(1+0.042) ≈ 4%

Second update (remaining claims):
- Posterior odds = 0.042 × 0.286 = 0.012
- Posterior probability = 0.012/(1+0.012) ≈ 1.2%

Third update (appeal timeline):
- Posterior odds = 0.012 × 0.333 = 0.004
- Posterior probability = 0.004/(1+0.004) ≈ 0.4%

Fourth update (multiple lawsuits):
- Posterior odds = 0.004 × 1.167 = 0.0047
- Posterior probability = 0.0047/(1+0.0047) ≈ 0.47%

The evidence strongly suggests that a large judgment before 2026 is highly unlikely. The dismissal of key claims that could lead to statutory damages, combined with the extended timeline from appeals, makes the path to a $100M+ judgment extremely difficult.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a surprise settlement. Companies might settle even unfavorable cases to eliminate uncertainty.
- I haven't fully accounted for the NYT v. OpenAI case, which could proceed on a different timeline or legal theory.
- There could be undisclosed internal documents that might emerge in discovery showing willful infringement.

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A judge in a different case could make an early, unexpected ruling that AI training is not fair use, creating immediate settlement pressure.
- A company might choose to settle quickly to avoid damaging discovery revelations, even if they believe they would ultimately win.
- Legislative or regulatory action could change the legal landscape, though this seems unlikely to affect ongoing litigation by 2026.

**Adjustments**:
Given these considerations, I should slightly increase my probability to account for settlement possibilities and unknown factors in parallel cases. However, the timeline constraint remains extremely challenging.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate for large IP judgments, the novel legal questions involved, the recent dismissal of key claims in the leading case, the extended timeline from appeals, and the limited time remaining before 2026, I assess the probability at 2%.

The most likely path to a "yes" resolution would be a surprise settlement rather than a court judgment, but even this seems highly unlikely given the defendants' resources and strategic interests.

Final: 2%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a US court ordering a payment of $100M or more in a novel intellectual property case related to a new technology, with the resolution required within a specific, relatively short timeframe (originally ~2.5 years, now just two months).

A suitable reference class is major, precedent-setting litigation involving new technologies and copyright law (e.g., cases concerning VCRs, MP3s, or Google Books). Historically, such cases are complex, slow-moving, and often take many years to resolve, frequently involving appeals up to the Supreme Court. The base rate for such a case to proceed from filing to a final, non-appealable court order of over $100M within 2-3 years is very low, likely in the range of 5-10%.

However, the most critical piece of context is the current date: October 30, 2025. The deadline is December 31, 2025. Therefore, the relevant base rate is the probability that any complex federal lawsuit, which is currently in pre-trial or appellate stages, will fully resolve with a court-ordered payment of this magnitude in the next two months. This base rate is extremely low, as the procedural steps for trials, judgments, and court approval of settlements take far longer than two months. A more appropriate prior, given the time constraint, would be **under 1%**. For the sake of a clear update, I will start with a more generous prior of **10%** (or 1:9 odds) from the question's opening in mid-2023 and apply the evidence.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities**: The current lawsuits against AI companies fit the reference class of complex, high-stakes litigation over a transformative technology that challenges existing copyright frameworks. The defendants are large, well-funded corporations, similar to defendants in past landmark cases.
*   **Differences**:
    *   **Legal Novelty**: The central question of whether training AI models constitutes "fair use" is entirely unsettled law. This ambiguity strongly favors a lengthy, cautious legal process over a swift resolution.
    *   **Strategic Importance**: For the defendants (e.g., Microsoft, OpenAI), the outcome of these cases is existential for their business models. They have immense incentives to litigate the core issues fully rather than accept a large, early settlement that would set a negative precedent and invite a flood of similar lawsuits.
    *   **Imminent Deadline**: The most significant difference is the proximity of the deadline. We are not forecasting over a multi-year period but over the next 62 days. This makes the current status of the litigation the most important factor.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence overwhelmingly points toward a "NO" resolution due to the timeline.

*   **Evidence 1: Slow Pace of Litigation and Imminent Deadline.** The US federal court system moves slowly. With only two months remaining, there is insufficient time for any of the ongoing cases to proceed through discovery, summary judgment motions, trial, post-trial motions, and a final judgment ordering payment.
    *   This evidence is far more likely if the event does not happen (P(E|~H) is high) than if it does (P(E|H) is extremely low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Very strongly favors NO.

*   **Evidence 2: Dismissal of Key Claims in the *GitHub Copilot* Lawsuit.** In July 2024, a judge dismissed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims, which represented the clearest path to a >$100M award through aggregated statutory damages. This substantially weakened the plaintiffs' financial leverage.
    *   This evidence is much more likely given ~H (no large payout) than H (a large payout is coming).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Strongly favors NO.

*   **Evidence 3: The *GitHub Copilot* Case is on Appeal.** In September 2024, an appeal on the dismissed claims was certified. This action effectively freezes the trial court proceedings, making it impossible for this specific case to resolve and result in a payment order before the end of 2025.
    *   This evidence makes H (a payout from this case) impossible within the timeframe.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio**: Extremely strongly favors NO.

*   **Evidence 4: Status of Other Lawsuits (e.g., *NYT v. OpenAI*).** Other major lawsuits are still in early, pre-trial stages. They are not scheduled for trial, let alone a final judgment, within the resolution window. The only plausible path to a "YES" is a sudden, massive settlement that is also formally approved and ordered by a court before the deadline.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's start with the 10% prior (1:9 odds) from 2023.

1.  **Initial Evidence (Slow Pace & Legal Novelty)**: The complexity and slow pace of the litigation, evident throughout 2023-2024, would have already lowered the probability significantly. Let's say this reduces the odds by a factor of 4. New odds: 1:36 (approx. 2.7%).
2.  **Updating on the *Copilot* Dismissals and Appeal**: This evidence is a near-fatal blow to the chances of a "YES" resolution. It removes the most advanced case from contention and signals judicial skepticism towards the most financially potent claims. This evidence carries an extremely strong likelihood ratio against H. Let's use a conservative likelihood ratio of 1/20.
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 1:36 × (1/20) = 1:720.
    *   Posterior Probability = 1 / (1 + 720) ≈ 0.14%.

3.  **Final Update on Timeline**: The fact that it is now October 30, 2025, makes the remaining possibility—a surprise settlement being reached and court-ordered in the next two months—extremely remote. This final condition reduces the probability to a fraction of its already low value.

The calculation confirms that the probability is very low. The only path to a "YES" is a "black swan" event: a shocking discovery in a case like *NYT v. OpenAI* forces an immediate settlement of over $100M, and the parties get a judge to sign a payment order before year-end.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "YES" outcome is a scenario where a defendant like OpenAI, facing the imminent revelation of a "smoking gun" document in discovery (e.g., proof of willful infringement), decides to pay a massive premium to the New York Times to settle the case immediately and seal the record. If both parties urgently present a settlement to a judge, it could plausibly be "so-ordered" within a few weeks.

However, the probability of such a smoking gun existing, being discovered now, and forcing a settlement of this size and speed is extremely small. The defendants have consistently postured for a long fight over the fair use principle. A sudden capitulation is unlikely. My final probability should be low but non-zero to account for this tail risk. A 1% chance feels appropriate for such a low-probability, high-impact event.

### Final Forecast
The primary factor driving this forecast is the extremely short time remaining until the December 31, 2025, deadline. The standard pace of the US federal judicial system makes it procedurally impossible for any of the major, ongoing AI training lawsuits to reach a conclusion via trial and judgment. The most advanced case is stayed pending appeal. The only remaining, albeit highly improbable, path to a "YES" is a sudden and massive settlement that is formally ordered by a court in the next two months. The likelihood of this specific sequence of events is very small.

Final: 1%
