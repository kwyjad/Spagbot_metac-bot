### Reference class & base rates
*   **Spanish minority governments since 1977:** Since Spain's transition to democracy, legislatures have frequently failed to complete their full four-year term. Of the 15 legislatures, at least 8 (53%) ended in early elections. Minority governments, like the current one, are inherently less stable. **Base rate: ~50-60% chance of a snap election *at some point* during the term.**
*   **Governments facing major corruption scandals:** Spanish governments facing significant, high-profile corruption scandals (e.g., Felipe González in 1996, Mariano Rajoy in 2018) have a higher propensity to call early elections or be removed via a no-confidence vote. However, the outcome is not deterministic. **Base rate: ~60-70% chance of term interruption.**
*   **Prime Ministers in their third year of a term:** The third year is often a period of high risk for a government as it loses momentum and faces the upcoming budget cycle for the election year. This is a common time for instability to peak. **Limitation:** These base rates apply to the entire legislative term. The question concerns an extremely short ~45-day window, for which the unconditional probability is much lower.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-09-25] Sánchez confirms his intention to seek re-election in 2027, despite ongoing scandals. — ↓ — Signals a clear strategy of resistance and intent to complete the term, directly countering speculation of an early exit.
*   [2025-09-25] Reports confirm Sánchez's wife faces embezzlement charges and his brother is set for trial. — ↑ — The legal pressure is escalating from investigation to formal charges and trial, increasing the political cost and potential for a critical event.
*   [2025-06-22] The Guardian describes Sánchez as fighting for his political life amid mounting allegations. — ↑ — Highlights the severity of the crisis, suggesting the situation may be becoming untenable and forcing a drastic move like a snap election.
*   [2024-04-29] Sánchez, after five days of reflection on resigning, decides to stay and fight what he terms 'lawfare'. — ↓ — Establishes a key precedent: his response to intense personal and political pressure is to double down and resist, not to fold and call an election.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Loss of Parliamentary Support (Large):** The minority government depends on a fragile coalition of diverse parties (e.g., Sumar, ERC, Junts). If a key partner withdraws support, particularly during the upcoming 2026 budget negotiations, the government would likely fall.
*   **Strategic Political Calculation (Moderate):** Sánchez might call a snap election if he perceives a moment of political opportunity, believing he can rally his base against the 'lawfare' narrative and win a stronger mandate. This is his signature high-risk, high-reward style.
*   **Escalation of Legal Crises (Moderate):** A "smoking gun" in the corruption cases or a particularly damaging judicial ruling against his wife or brother could make his position untenable, forcing him to resign or seek a new mandate via an election.
*   **Public Opinion and Protests (Small):** While significant public discontent can erode a leader's standing, it is unlikely to be a direct trigger for an election in the short term without a corresponding loss of parliamentary support.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **The 'Lawfare' Counter-Narrative:** Unlike previous corruption scandals, Sánchez has effectively framed these investigations as a coordinated, anti-democratic political attack by the far-right. This narrative provides a powerful shield and a rallying cry for his supporters, turning a defensive issue into an offensive one.
*   **Interests of Coalition Partners:** Sánchez's Catalan and Basque nationalist partners have a strong incentive to keep him in power. A snap election could bring a right-wing PP-Vox government to power, which would be far more hostile to their interests (e.g., regional autonomy, amnesty). This creates a "mutually assured destruction" dynamic that promotes stability.
*   **Sánchez's Political Profile:** Pedro Sánchez has a well-established reputation as a political survivor ("El Manual de Resistencia"). His career is defined by comebacks and surviving seemingly impossible situations. His past behavior suggests he is far more likely to endure a crisis than to call an election from a position of weakness.
*   **Extreme Political Polarization:** The current political climate is exceptionally toxic. This reduces the space for negotiation but also solidifies the two main political blocs, making defections from his supporting coalition less likely as the alternative is seen as unacceptable.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Given the high base rate of early elections in Spain but the very short time horizon (~45 days), a low-to-moderate prior is appropriate. Let's start at **20%** (equivalent to observing 1 such event in 5 similar short-term, high-pressure situations).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   Sánchez's stated intent to serve until 2027 and his precedent of not resigning in April 2024. (↓, moderate)
    *   The strategic incentive for his coalition partners to maintain the government to avoid a PP-Vox alternative. (↓, large)
    *   The successful 'lawfare' framing, which provides political cover. (↓, moderate)
    *   The ongoing, high-stakes 2026 budget negotiations, which represent the single greatest point of failure. (↑, moderate)
    *   The formalization of charges against his family, increasing personal and political pressure. (↑, small)
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly suggests resilience. The forces holding the government together, primarily Sánchez's own resolve and the strategic interests of his partners, appear to outweigh the immediate pressures. The posterior should move **down significantly** from the initial prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Public statements from ERC or Junts threatening to vote against the 2026 budget.
    *   A judge places Sánchez's wife, Begoña Gómez, in pre-trial detention or imposes other severe precautionary measures.
    *   Polling shows a sudden, significant surge for PSOE, creating a strategic window to call an election.
    *   Key figures within PSOE begin publicly distancing themselves from Sánchez.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The government successfully negotiates and passes the 2026 budget.
    *   Coalition partners (Junts, ERC) publicly reaffirm their support for the government through 2026.
    *   Courts dismiss or significantly scale back the investigations into Sánchez's family.
    *   Sánchez announces a major, long-term policy initiative for 2026.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Unpredictability of Key Actor:** Pedro Sánchez is known for bold, unexpected political maneuvers. Standard political calculus may not fully capture his decision-making process.
*   **Judicial "Black Swan":** The timing and severity of judicial decisions are outside of political control. A sudden, damning revelation could change the entire landscape overnight.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** With less than two months to resolution, the forecast is highly sensitive to breaking news. A stable situation can be upended by a single event.
*   **Definition of "Called":** The resolution is tied to the official call for elections. Political turmoil or a declaration of intent does not count, creating a potential gap between political reality and formal resolution.

**Final Research Summary:**
Despite facing severe legal and political pressure, Pedro Sánchez's demonstrated resilience, his successful 'lawfare' counter-narrative, and the strong self-interest of his coalition partners in avoiding a right-wing government make it unlikely he will call a snap election in the very short term. The primary risk remains a collapse of the government over the 2026 budget.

To forecast the probability of Pedro Sánchez calling for general elections before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for early elections in Spain is approximately 50-60% for minority governments and 60-70% for governments facing major corruption scandals. However, given the very short time frame of 45 days, the unconditional probability is much lower. A reasonable starting prior for this specific situation is 20%, reflecting the historical frequency of early elections but adjusted for the short time horizon.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: Sánchez's government is a minority and is facing significant corruption scandals, aligning with the base cases where early elections are more likely.
   - Differences: The current situation includes Sánchez's strong narrative of 'lawfare', his coalition partners' interest in maintaining the government, and his personal history of political resilience. These factors suggest a lower likelihood of calling early elections compared to the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Sánchez's intent to serve until 2027 and his history of not resigning under pressure (Likelihood ratio < 1, decreases probability).
   - Coalition partners' strategic interest in avoiding a right-wing government (Likelihood ratio < 1, significantly decreases probability).
   - Successful 'lawfare' framing providing political cover (Likelihood ratio < 1, decreases probability).
   - High-stakes 2026 budget negotiations (Likelihood ratio > 1, increases probability).
   - Formal charges against Sánchez's family (Likelihood ratio > 1, slightly increases probability).

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Starting with a prior probability of 20%, the evidence largely suggests resilience and stability, with the coalition partners' interests and Sánchez's narrative being strong factors against calling early elections.
   - The likelihood ratios for the evidence collectively suggest a decrease in probability. For example, if we assume the combined likelihood ratio of the evidence is around 0.5, the posterior odds would be 0.2 / (1 - 0.2) * 0.5 = 0.125. Converting back to probability gives us approximately 11%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of overconfidence: The short time frame and potential for unexpected judicial developments are significant uncertainties. However, the strong coalition dynamics and Sánchez's political strategy mitigate these risks.
   - Alternative forecast: A scenario where a major judicial decision or coalition breakdown occurs could increase the probability, but current evidence does not strongly support this.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential uncertainties, the final calibrated probability that Pedro Sánchez will call for general elections before 2026 is:

Final: 11%

# Will Pedro Sánchez call for general elections before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for snap elections being called in Spain within the next ~45 days (from November 12, 2025 to January 1, 2026).

Relevant base rates:
- Spanish minority governments since 1977 have a ~53% chance of ending in early elections during their full term
- Governments facing corruption scandals have a ~60-70% chance of term interruption
- However, these rates apply to entire 4-year terms, not a specific 45-day window

Given a 4-year term (1,460 days), the unconditional daily probability of calling elections would be roughly 0.04-0.05% per day. For a 45-day window, this translates to approximately 1.8-2.3% if evenly distributed.

However, this period is not random - it's during a specific crisis period with heightened pressure. I'll adjust the base rate to account for this, setting a prior of **15%** - higher than the unconditional rate but still relatively low given the short timeframe.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Sánchez leads a minority government dependent on coalition partners
- He faces serious corruption allegations involving close family members
- Spanish political history shows vulnerability of minority governments

**Key differences:**
- Extremely short time horizon (~45 days) versus typical term instability
- Sánchez has successfully framed investigations as "lawfare" by political opponents
- Coalition partners have strong incentives to maintain the government to prevent a right-wing PP-Vox government
- Sánchez has explicitly confirmed his intention to seek re-election in 2027
- He has already demonstrated resilience by not resigning in April 2024 when facing similar pressure

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Sánchez's stated intention to serve until 2027**
- P(E|H): If he plans to call snap elections, probability he would publicly commit to 2027 is low (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If he doesn't plan snap elections, probability of this statement is high (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22, strongly decreasing probability

**Evidence 2: Sánchez's previous resistance to resignation in April 2024**
- P(E|H): If planning snap elections, probability of previously resisting similar pressure is moderate (~40%)
- P(E|~H): If not planning snap elections, probability of this precedent is high (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5, moderately decreasing probability

**Evidence 3: Formalization of charges against family members**
- P(E|H): If planning snap elections, probability of escalating legal pressure is high (~80%)
- P(E|~H): If not planning snap elections, probability is still moderate (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33, slightly increasing probability

**Evidence 4: Coalition partners' strategic interests**
- P(E|H): If planning snap elections, probability of partners maintaining strong incentives to support government is low (~30%)
- P(E|~H): If not planning snap elections, probability is high (~85%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.35, strongly decreasing probability

**Evidence 5: Ongoing 2026 budget negotiations**
- P(E|H): If planning snap elections, probability of difficult budget negotiations is high (~90%)
- P(E|~H): If not planning snap elections, probability is moderate (~60%)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5, moderately increasing probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 15:85 (0.176)

Applying the strongest evidence first (coalition partners' strategic interests):
- Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.35 = 0.0616
- Posterior probability = 0.0616 / (1 + 0.0616) ≈ 5.8%

Applying Sánchez's stated intention to serve until 2027:
- Posterior odds = 0.0616 × 0.22 = 0.0136
- Posterior probability = 0.0136 / (1 + 0.0136) ≈ 1.3%

Applying previous resistance to resignation:
- Posterior odds = 0.0136 × 0.5 = 0.0068
- Posterior probability = 0.0068 / (1 + 0.0068) ≈ 0.7%

Applying formalization of charges:
- Posterior odds = 0.0068 × 1.33 = 0.0090
- Posterior probability = 0.0090 / (1 + 0.0090) ≈ 0.9%

Applying budget negotiations:
- Posterior odds = 0.0090 × 1.5 = 0.0135
- Posterior probability = 0.0135 / (1 + 0.0135) ≈ 1.3%

This Bayesian update suggests a very low probability of snap elections in the next 45 days.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating Sánchez's unpredictability and history of bold political moves
- The judicial process could produce a "black swan" event (e.g., detention of his wife)
- The budget negotiations could collapse suddenly if a coalition partner withdraws support
- I might be overweighting Sánchez's public statements and underweighting private calculations

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 10-15%, arguing that:
- Spanish politics is inherently volatile
- Corruption scandals have historically been powerful destabilizing forces
- Sánchez might calculate that a snap election now is better than waiting for worse revelations
- The coalition is fragile and could collapse at any moment

**Rebuttal:**
While these concerns are valid, they don't overcome:
1. The extremely short time horizon (45 days)
2. Sánchez's demonstrated resilience and political survival skills
3. The mutual interest of coalition partners in avoiding a right-wing government
4. The successful "lawfare" narrative that provides political cover

Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for uncertainty and unpredictability, but maintain a low probability.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, base rates, and potential blind spots, I assess that there is a very low probability that Pedro Sánchez will call for general elections before 2026. The short time horizon, Sánchez's demonstrated resilience, and the strategic interests of his coalition partners strongly suggest he will not call snap elections in the next 45 days.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether a snap general election will be called in a very specific, short time frame: between today (November 12, 2025) and December 31, 2025, a period of about 49 days.

A broad base rate for early elections in Spain is that 8 of 15 legislatures (53%) since 1977 have not completed their full four-year term. A simple prorated probability for a 1.5-month period would be very low: (1.5 months / 48 months) * 53% ≈ 1.7%.

However, this is not a random period. The current government is a minority coalition facing significant political and legal pressure. Such periods of crisis are when snap elections are most likely. Therefore, the base rate should be adjusted upwards significantly from the naive prorated figure. A prior probability of **15%** seems appropriate, acknowledging the heightened risk environment while still respecting the very short time horizon.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
- The government is a minority coalition, which is inherently less stable than a majority government.
- The Prime Minister is facing serious corruption allegations involving his inner circle, a situation that has led to the downfall of previous Spanish governments (e.g., Mariano Rajoy in 2018).

**Differences:**
- **Sánchez's Political Profile:** Pedro Sánchez has a well-documented history of political survival against long odds ("El Manual de Resistencia"). His decision in April 2024 to stay and fight after a period of reflection sets a strong precedent that his response to pressure is defiance, not resignation.
- **The 'Lawfare' Narrative:** Unlike past scandals, Sánchez has effectively framed the investigations as a politically motivated attack from the right-wing establishment. This narrative serves as a powerful shield, solidifying his support among his base and coalition partners.
- **Coalition Incentives:** This is the most critical difference. Sánchez's government relies on Catalan and Basque nationalist parties. These parties have an overriding strategic interest in preventing a snap election, which polls suggest could bring a right-wing PP-Vox government to power—an outcome far more hostile to their goals of regional autonomy and amnesty. This creates a "mutually assured destruction" dynamic that strongly favors stability.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that an election is called before 2026.

- **Evidence 1 (Negative): Coalition partners' incentive to keep the government alive.**
  - P(E | H): Low. An election would require these partners to withdraw support, which is against their core interests.
  - P(E | ~H): High. Their continued support is the most likely reason the government will survive the current crisis.
  - **Likelihood Ratio: << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).**

- **Evidence 2 (Negative): Sánchez's demonstrated resilience and stated intent to serve until 2027.**
  - P(E | H): Low. This behavior is inconsistent with someone planning an imminent election out of weakness.
  - P(E | ~H): High. This is the expected behavior of a leader intending to complete their term.
  - **Likelihood Ratio: < 1 (Decreases probability).**

- **Evidence 3 (Positive): The 2026 budget negotiations.**
  - P(E | H): High. A failure to pass the budget is the most plausible and timely mechanism for a government collapse leading to a snap election. These negotiations are happening within the resolution window.
  - P(E | ~H): Moderate. While negotiations will be tense, the coalition partners' strong incentive to avoid an election makes an eventual deal more likely than a collapse.
  - **Likelihood Ratio: > 1 (Increases probability).**

- **Evidence 4 (Positive): Escalating legal pressure on Sánchez's family.**
  - P(E | H): High. A sufficiently damaging judicial development (a "smoking gun" or severe precautionary measure) could make Sánchez's position untenable, forcing an election.
  - P(E | ~H): Moderate. Sánchez has so far weathered these scandals by framing them as lawfare, and may be able to continue doing so.
  - **Likelihood Ratio: > 1 (Increases probability).**

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a **15% prior**, we must weigh the evidence. The structural incentives of the coalition partners are an extremely powerful force for stability, pushing the probability down significantly. Sánchez's own track record reinforces this. This combined evidence might reduce the odds by a factor of 3 or 4, bringing the probability into the mid-single digits (~4-5%).

However, we must then account for the acute risks. The 2026 budget negotiation is a specific, high-stakes event occurring within the forecast window that provides a clear path to failure. This risk, along with the tail risk of a judicial "black swan" or a strategic gamble by Sánchez, pushes the probability back up. The budget risk is the most significant factor, likely doubling or tripling the otherwise low odds.

The net effect is a posterior probability that is lower than the initial prior but remains in the low double-digits, reflecting a situation where stability is the most likely outcome but a collapse is a very real possibility.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be too low if I am underestimating Pedro Sánchez's capacity for surprise. He is a political gambler who called a snap election in July 2023 against all advice. If he perceives a moment of opportunity to rally the electorate against the "lawfare" campaign, he might call an election strategically, even if the polls are not clearly in his favor. This "high-risk, high-reward" personality trait is a major source of uncertainty.

Conversely, the forecast might be too high. The political and legislative inertia is immense. Even if budget negotiations fail, the government could attempt to function with a rolled-over budget, pushing any potential election call into early 2026, just past the resolution date. The "mutually assured destruction" logic among the coalition partners may be even stronger than I've estimated, making a budget deal almost inevitable despite the public posturing.

Considering these factors, the central estimate seems reasonable. The risk of a strategic call by Sánchez is the best argument for a higher probability, while the power of inertia and the possibility of delays are the best arguments for a lower one. They roughly balance out, keeping the forecast in the low double-digits.

### Final Forecast
The probability of a snap election being called in the next 49 days is low. The powerful incentives for Sánchez's coalition partners to maintain the government in the face of a potential right-wing alternative create a strong anchor of stability. This is reinforced by Sánchez's own history of resilience. However, this stability is being tested by the high-stakes 2026 budget negotiations and escalating legal scandals. These factors create a tangible, non-trivial risk of collapse within the short resolution window.

Final: 12%
