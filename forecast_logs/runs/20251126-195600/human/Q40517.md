### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Fiscal Years with Continuing Resolutions (CRs) since 2000.** In fiscal years where Congress failed to pass all appropriations bills by October 1 and resorted to one or more CRs, subsequent legislative action is typically clustered around the CR expiration dates. It is rare for Congress to finalize and enact appropriations bills in the middle of a CR period, especially during a holiday-shortened December, unless a CR is set to expire.
    -   **Base Rate:** In such years, the number of additional regular appropriations bills enacted between late November and December 31 is very low, likely averaging **0 to 1 bill**. The focus is on avoiding the next fiscal cliff, not on finalizing work early.
-   **Reference Class 2: Lame-Duck Sessions in Divided Government.** The period between an election and the start of a new Congress can be either productive or gridlocked. When appropriations are unfinished, the session is often defined by a single, large package (omnibus or minibus) passed at the last minute to clear the decks.
    -   **Base Rate:** The process tends to produce either a large package (counting as many bills) or nothing (another CR). The probability of passing a few, but not all, remaining bills individually during this window is low. The historical pattern favors all-or-nothing outcomes right at a deadline.
-   **Limitations:** The current scenario is unique due to the severity of the recent shutdown and the fact that three bills have already been enacted. This "clearing of the easy bills" may concentrate conflict in the remaining nine, making them harder to pass than a typical historical average.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-11-18** A CR is signed, ending a 43-day shutdown. It funds most of the government until January 30, 2026. **↓** — This date is the key action-forcing deadline. By setting it in late January, it removes any urgency for Congress to act before the December 31 resolution date for this question.
-   **2025-11-18** Three FY2026 bills (Agriculture, Leg. Branch, MilCon-VA) are enacted as part of the CR deal. **↑** — This sets a floor of 3 enacted bills. It also removes the least controversial bills from the negotiating table, potentially increasing the difficulty of bundling the remaining ones.
-   **2025-11-13** CRFB Appropriations Watch notes the deep divisions between House and Senate versions of the remaining bills. **↓** — Highlights that significant policy and funding disagreements on the nine remaining bills (e.g., Defense, Labor-HHS, Homeland Security) still need to be resolved, a time-consuming process.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **CR Expiration Date (Large):** The January 30, 2026, deadline is the primary driver of legislative action. With over a month of buffer after this question's resolution date (Dec 31), the incentive to negotiate intensely in December is minimal.
-   **Holiday Recess (Large):** The congressional calendar for December is extremely short. Lawmakers are highly motivated to leave Washington for the holidays, making complex, multi-bill negotiations before Christmas highly improbable.
-   **Bundling Strategy (Omnibus/Minibus) (Moderate):** The remaining nine bills will almost certainly be negotiated as one or more packages ("minibuses" or a single "omnibus"). This process is complex and time-consuming, making a quick deal in December unlikely. The focus will be on a January package.
-   **Shutdown Fatigue (Moderate):** Having just emerged from a long and politically damaging shutdown, leadership in both parties may be risk-averse. This is more likely to manifest as a desire to "kick the can" to the January deadline rather than rush a flawed deal in December.
-   **Contentiousness of Remaining Bills (Moderate):** The three enacted bills are typically among the least controversial. The remaining nine include major battlegrounds like Defense (policy riders), Homeland Security (border policy), and Labor-HHS (social policy riders), which require extensive negotiation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Pre-Resolved Bills:** Unlike most historical instances where all 12 bills are unresolved, three are already enacted. This changes the negotiation dynamic, as there are fewer "sweeteners" (easy bills) to package with the controversial ones.
-   **Post-Shutdown Environment:** The extreme length and political pain of the recent shutdown could alter typical behavior. While it creates pressure to avoid another one, it may also have hardened partisan lines, making compromise on the remaining bills even more difficult.
-   **Artificial Deadline:** The question's resolution date of December 31, 2025, does not align with any legislative deadline. The base rate is driven by action around fiscal cliffs (like CR expirations), and there is no such cliff in December. This makes historical comparisons of December productivity less relevant.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a strong prior based on the reference class of CR scenarios: very few, likely zero, additional bills are passed in a short December window that lacks a fiscal deadline. The prior should be heavily concentrated on the current number of 3. (Equivalent n > 10).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   **↓ (Large):** The CR deadline is January 30, 2026, which removes all urgency to act in December.
    -   **↓ (Large):** The impending holiday recess drastically shortens the available time and motivation for complex legislative work.
    -   **↓ (Moderate):** The remaining nine bills are the most controversial, requiring more time to negotiate than is available.
    -   **↑ (Small):** The three enacted bills provide a floor, but this evidence is already incorporated into the current state of the world.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. The posterior should move even more strongly toward the conclusion that no additional bills will be enacted before January 1, 2026. The final count will remain at 3.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   House and Senate leadership explicitly state a goal to pass another minibus package before Christmas.
    -   Top-line funding levels ("302(b) allocations") for the remaining nine subcommittees are announced as agreed upon.
    -   News reports of a bipartisan "gang" reaching a breakthrough on a contentious bill like Homeland Security.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Leadership announces the legislative schedule for December with no mention of appropriations bills.
    -   Public statements from key negotiators focus on the January 30 deadline.
    -   Partisan fighting over non-appropriations issues dominates the news cycle, consuming floor time and political capital.
    -   Congress adjourns for the holiday recess earlier than scheduled.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Surprise "Christmas Tree" Bill:** A sudden, unexpected deal could be struck to attach a few more appropriations bills to must-pass legislation, though this is unlikely given the lack of a deadline.
-   **Definitional Gotcha:** The resolution depends on the bill being "enacted" (signed by the President). A bill could pass Congress in late December but not be signed until January, which would not count.
-   **Scenario Plausibility:** The provided background is a hypothetical future scenario. Real-world political dynamics, such as a change in party control or leadership, could dramatically alter incentives in ways not captured here.
-   **Complexity Misjudgment:** We may be underestimating the desire of leadership to show progress and clear the decks before the new year, even without a hard deadline.

**Final Research Summary:**
Three of the twelve bills have already been enacted. Given the short legislative calendar before the holiday recess and a continuing resolution that funds the government until January 30, 2026, there is virtually no incentive or time for Congress to negotiate and pass any of the nine remaining, more controversial bills before the new year.

To forecast the number of FY 2026 regular appropriations bills enacted before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 1:** Fiscal Years with Continuing Resolutions (CRs) since 2000. The base rate for additional bills enacted between late November and December 31 in such years is very low, averaging 0 to 1 bill.
   - **Reference Class 2:** Lame-Duck Sessions in Divided Government. Historically, this period tends to produce either a large package or nothing, with a low probability of passing a few bills individually.
   - **Chosen Base Rate:** Given the context, the base rate is centered around 0 to 1 additional bill enacted in December, with a strong prior on 3 total enacted bills (the current state).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation involves a CR and a divided government, aligning with historical patterns where few bills are enacted in December.
   - **Differences:** The recent shutdown and the enactment of three bills alter the dynamics slightly, but the lack of a December deadline and the contentious nature of remaining bills reinforce the base rate.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **CR Expiration Date (Large ↓):** The January 30 deadline reduces urgency for December action.
   - **Holiday Recess (Large ↓):** Short legislative calendar decreases likelihood of additional bills.
   - **Contentious Bills (Moderate ↓):** Remaining bills are controversial, requiring extensive negotiation.
   - **Pre-Resolved Bills (Small ↑):** Sets a floor of 3 enacted bills, but this is already accounted for.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Strong prior on 3 enacted bills.
   - **Likelihoods:** Evidence overwhelmingly supports the prior, reinforcing the expectation of no additional bills enacted by December 31.
   - **Posterior:** The distribution remains heavily skewed towards 3 enacted bills, with minimal probability of more.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise "Christmas Tree" bill, though unlikely.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** Leadership may push for progress before the new year, but lack of a deadline makes this improbable.
   - **Adjustment:** Maintain a conservative forecast, acknowledging low probability of additional bills.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the analysis, the forecast is heavily weighted towards 3 enacted bills, with slight consideration for 4 if an unexpected deal occurs.

P10: 3  
P20: 3  
P40: 3  
P60: 3  
P80: 3  
P90: 4

# Forecast: How many of the 12 FY 2026 regular appropriations bills will be enacted before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the base rate of appropriations bills enacted before January 1st in fiscal years where:
- A continuing resolution (CR) was needed after October 1
- The CR extends beyond December 31 into January
- Some but not all bills were already enacted

Looking at historical patterns since 2000, when Congress has already passed some bills (as in this case with 3 bills) and has a CR extending into January, they typically don't pass additional bills before January 1st. The incentive structure strongly favors waiting until closer to the CR deadline.

**Prior distribution:**
- Mean/Median: 3 bills (the current number already enacted)
- Spread: Highly concentrated at 3, with small probability of 4-5 bills, and very small probability of >5 bills

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class:**
- We have a CR extending well past December 31 (to January 30, 2026)
- Some bills (3) have already been enacted
- The remaining bills include the most contentious ones
- Congress typically focuses on deadlines, and January 30 is the next deadline

**Differences from reference class:**
- The recent shutdown was unusually long (43 days), which might create more pressure to show progress
- Three bills have already been enacted, which is somewhat unusual (often it's either 0 or all 12)
- The specific political dynamics of this hypothetical 2025 scenario may differ from historical patterns

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing toward fewer bills (≤3):**
- The CR extends to January 30, 2026, removing any urgency to act before December 31 (strong evidence, ~5:1 likelihood ratio favoring no additional bills)
- The December legislative calendar is extremely short due to holiday recess (strong evidence, ~4:1 likelihood ratio)
- The three easiest bills have already been enacted, leaving only the most contentious ones (moderate evidence, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)
- The recent shutdown experience may make leadership risk-averse and unwilling to force quick negotiations (moderate evidence, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)

**Evidence pushing toward more bills (>3):**
- Post-shutdown political pressure to show progress (weak evidence, ~1:2 likelihood ratio)
- Potential desire to clear the decks before the new year (very weak evidence, ~1:1.5 likelihood ratio)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 3 bills, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**First update - CR deadline effect:**
- Prior: Centered at 3 bills
- Likelihood: ~5:1 favoring no additional bills before December 31
- Posterior: Even more concentrated at 3 bills, with reduced probability of 4+ bills

**Second update - Holiday calendar constraints:**
- Prior: Updated distribution heavily favoring 3 bills
- Likelihood: ~4:1 favoring no additional bills
- Posterior: Further concentrated at 3 bills, with very small probability of 4+ bills

The combined effect of these updates significantly strengthens the case that no additional bills will be enacted before January 1, 2026. The posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at exactly 3 bills, with small probability mass at 4 bills and minimal probability at 5+ bills.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the political incentives to show progress after a long shutdown
- There could be a surprise package deal negotiated in December that includes some of the less controversial remaining bills
- I may be overweighting the importance of the January 30 deadline and underweighting other political factors

**Alternative scenario:**
A plausible alternative is that leadership might want to demonstrate progress by passing a "mini-minibus" with 2-3 additional bills in mid-December. This could happen if there's strong political pressure to show the government is functioning after the shutdown. However, even in this scenario, it's unlikely they'd pass more than a few additional bills given time constraints and the contentiousness of the remaining bills.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
The historical pattern strongly suggests that without a deadline forcing action, Congress rarely passes appropriations bills. With the CR extending to January 30, there's simply no forcing mechanism to drive action in December, especially during the shortened holiday session.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3

Here is a full probabilistic forecast following the specified Bayesian reasoning steps.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The target variable is the number of appropriations bills enacted in a specific, short legislative window (late November to December 31) under particular circumstances.

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is *legislative sessions in December where a Continuing Resolution (CR) is already in place funding the government into the next calendar year*. In these situations, the primary action-forcing mechanism (a government funding deadline) is absent.
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** Historically, Congress accomplishes very little in December without a pressing deadline. The legislative calendar is short due to the holidays, and members are not incentivized to engage in complex, contentious negotiations. Therefore, the base rate for the number of *additional* appropriations bills passed in such a window is extremely low.
*   **Prior Specification:** My prior distribution for the *total* number of enacted bills is strongly centered on the current number, which is 3. I'll model this as a discrete distribution with a very high probability (e.g., >80%) that the number will remain 3, and a rapidly decaying tail for any higher numbers. The prior mean is just slightly above 3.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation aligns almost perfectly with the reference class. A CR is in place until January 30, 2026, removing any fiscal cliff before this question's resolution date. The impending holiday recess drastically shortens the available time and motivation for legislative work.
*   **Differences:**
    1.  **Recent Shutdown:** The government just emerged from a historically long shutdown. This could be a key difference. "Shutdown fatigue" might make leadership risk-averse and prefer to "kick the can" to the January deadline, reinforcing the base rate. Alternatively, it could create pressure to show progress and clear less-controversial bills now to avoid another crisis, which would push against the base rate. I assess the "kick the can" dynamic as more probable.
    2.  **Three Bills Already Enacted:** The three least controversial bills are already law. This means the remaining nine bills are, on average, more difficult to negotiate. This difference makes passing additional bills *harder* than in a typical scenario, strengthening the expectation of inaction.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate the evidence in terms of how it affects the probability of passing *additional* bills beyond the current three.

*   **Evidence 1: CR Expiration Date of January 30, 2026.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It removes all urgency for Congress to act in December. This makes the "no additional bills" hypothesis (total = 3) vastly more likely than any "additional bills" hypothesis (total > 3). This is a very strong update toward 3.
*   **Evidence 2: Impending Holiday Recess.** This severely constrains the legislative calendar, leaving insufficient time for the complex staff- and member-level negotiations required for appropriations. This is also strong evidence favoring the "no additional bills" outcome.
*   **Evidence 3: Contentiousness of Remaining Bills.** The background notes "deep divisions" on the remaining nine bills (e.g., Defense, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS). These are not bills that can be finalized quickly. This evidence makes a swift deal in December highly improbable, again strongly favoring the "no additional bills" outcome.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood**
*   **Conceptual Update:** My prior was already heavily concentrated on 3. All major pieces of evidence (the CR deadline, the holiday schedule, the difficulty of the remaining bills) act as strong likelihood multipliers for the outcome of 3. The evidence overwhelmingly reinforces the prior.
*   **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution becomes even more sharply peaked at 3 than the prior. The probability mass assigned to the outcome of exactly 3 bills increases significantly. The mean of the distribution will be very close to 3, and the variance will be small. However, I must retain some probability for a surprise outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Alternative Scenario:** What if I'm wrong? The most plausible alternative is that congressional leadership, scarred by the shutdown, wants to demonstrate an ability to govern. They could force through a "minibus" of the *next* 2-3 least controversial bills to build goodwill and simplify the January negotiations. This would result in a total of 5 or 6 enacted bills.
*   **Plausibility:** This is possible but unlikely. It would require an unusual burst of bipartisan cooperation in a short, holiday-disrupted month with no deadline pressure. The default behavior of "waiting for the deadline" is a much stronger force.
*   **Tail Risk:** There is a very small chance of a "Christmas miracle" where a grand bargain is struck on all remaining nine bills, bringing the total to 12. This is a tail risk worth assigning a tiny amount of probability to.
*   **Adjustment:** My initial posterior was likely overconfident in the "exactly 3" outcome. The red team exercise convinces me to shift some probability mass from 3 to the 4-6 range to account for the "show progress" minibus scenario, and a tiny fraction to the high-end tail. My final distribution will still have a high concentration at 3, but with fatter tails than my initial update suggested.

My final probability distribution is approximately: P(3) = 70%, P(4) = 10%, P(5) = 8%, P(6) = 7%, P(>6) = 5%.

### 6. Final Percentiles

This distribution translates to the following percentiles. The concentration of probability at the low end means several percentiles will share the same value.

P10: 3
P20: 3
P40: 3
P60: 3
P80: 4
P90: 6
