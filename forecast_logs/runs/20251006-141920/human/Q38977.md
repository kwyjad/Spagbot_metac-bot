### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Maritime Chokepoint Disruptions by Non-State Actors:** This class includes events like the peak of Somali piracy (c. 2008-2012). Shipping was disrupted and rerouted, but the chokepoint (Gulf of Aden) never fully closed. It took 4-5 years of concerted international naval action and on-board security to bring the threat under control. **Base Rate: ~10-20% chance of resolution within 1.5 years of onset.** This suggests long-duration problems.
2.  **State-led Closures of the Suez Canal:** The most significant precedent is the 1967-1975 closure following the Six-Day War. This was a physical closure by a state actor (Egypt) and lasted eight years. While the actors and methods differ, it shows that the global shipping system can adapt to a long-term bypass of the Suez Canal. **Base Rate: <5% chance of resolution within 1.5 years.**
3.  **Corporate Reversal of Major Logistical Strategy:** This class considers how quickly a company like Maersk reverses a fundamental, costly network redesign. Once new schedules, contracts, and partnerships (like the Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd) are built around the Cape of Good Hope, the institutional inertia to switch back is significant. Such reversals typically require a dramatic and sustained change in the underlying conditions. **Base Rate: ~25% chance of reversal within a year of implementation.**

Limitations: The current situation is a hybrid; a non-state actor is creating a de facto closure through risk, not a physical blockage. The geopolitical and economic contexts are also unique.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Houthi Capability & Intent:** (Large) The primary driver. As long as the Houthis possess the will and the missile/drone capability to credibly threaten ships, Maersk's risk assessment will prevent a return. This is the fundamental barrier.
2.  **Maersk's Profitability & Market Dynamics:** (Large) The crisis has been highly profitable for Maersk. Rerouting absorbs massive industry overcapacity, driving up freight rates. A return to the Suez Canal would unleash that capacity, likely causing rates to crash. This creates a strong financial disincentive to be a first-mover in returning.
3.  **Geopolitical De-escalation (Israel-Gaza):** (Moderate) A durable ceasefire in Gaza would remove the Houthis' stated justification for the attacks. While they may have other motives, this would be a key step toward a political resolution and would increase international pressure on them to cease.
4.  **Effectiveness of International Naval Coalitions:** (Moderate) Operations like Prosperity Guardian and Aspides have intercepted many attacks but have not eliminated the threat. For Maersk to return, the risk must be reduced to a near-negligible level, which has not yet been achieved.
5.  **Competitive Pressure:** (Small) If a major competitor (e.g., MSC, CMA CGM) were to resume Red Sea transit safely and sustainably, it could pressure Maersk to follow. However, the industry has largely acted in concert, making this unlikely without a fundamental change in the security situation.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Actor Motivation:** Unlike state actors (Suez 1967) or financially motivated pirates (Somalia), the Houthis are an ideologically driven non-state actor with sophisticated military hardware. Their actions are less predictable and not easily deterred by conventional naval patrols or financial incentives.
*   **Paradoxical Economic Benefit:** The disruption began when the container shipping industry was facing a glut of post-pandemic vessel capacity. The crisis conveniently solved this problem by effectively removing capacity via longer routes, leading to record profits. This economic feedback loop, which actively discourages a return to normalcy, was not present in prior disruptions.
*   **Nature of the Blockade:** The Suez Canal is not physically blocked. This is a "risk blockade," making the decision to transit a function of corporate risk tolerance, insurance costs, and crew safety, rather than a physical impossibility. This places the decision squarely with Maersk's board, where financial considerations are paramount.
*   **Explicit Forward Guidance:** Maersk's leadership has been unusually clear and consistent in guiding for a long-term disruption, culminating in operationalizing this view through its 2025 network plans with Hapag-Lloyd. This level of transparent, long-range planning around a disruption is a strong signal of intent.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior of ~20% YES seems plausible, derived from reference classes of major, multi-year maritime disruptions. This should be a relatively weak prior (low "n") due to the unique characteristics of this event.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓) Maersk's operational decisions, specifically planning its 2025 Gemini Cooperation network around Africa, provide very strong evidence against a 2025 return.
    *   (↓↓) The company's record 2024 profits, explicitly linked to the crisis, establish a powerful financial incentive to maintain the new, more profitable status quo.
    *   (↓) Consistent and increasingly pessimistic public statements from the CEO throughout 2024 and into 2025 have systematically lowered expectations for a near-term resolution.
    *   (↓) The ongoing, un-suppressed threat from Houthi attacks and the lack of a clear path to geopolitical de-escalation in the region.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The posterior probability should be significantly lower than the prior, reflecting both the stated intent and the powerful financial incentives against resumption in 2025.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (suggesting YES is more likely):**
    *   A durable, internationally recognized ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
    *   A public announcement by Houthi leadership that they are ceasing all attacks on maritime shipping.
    *   A major competitor (e.g., MSC) successfully and *sustainably* resumes Red Sea sailings for several weeks without incident.
    *   Maersk's CEO Vincent Clerc publicly changes his tone to one of cautious optimism regarding a return.
    *   A sharp, sustained crash in container freight rates, eroding the profitability of rerouting.
*   **DOWN indicators (suggesting NO is more likely):**
    *   Any successful Houthi attack on a commercial or naval vessel in the Red Sea.
    *   Maersk announces Q3 or Q4 2025 earnings that continue to benefit from elevated freight rates.
    *   Renewal or extension of vessel-sharing agreements that explicitly name the Cape of Good Hope as the planned route.
    *   Escalation of the broader regional conflict involving Iran.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The question resolves on an "announcement" or "credible report." Maersk could announce a *conditional* or *phased* return for a small number of vessels to test the waters, which might trigger resolution even if the bulk of their fleet remains on the Africa route.
*   **Deception Risk:** Maersk has an incentive to publicly project a long-term disruption to keep freight rates high. There is a small chance they are posturing while maintaining the operational flexibility to return quickly if the security situation changes abruptly.
*   **Black Swan Event:** A sudden, decisive military action that completely degrades Houthi anti-ship capabilities could change the entire strategic picture in a matter of days, rendering all prior analysis moot.
*   **Definition of "Resumed":** The criteria do not specify a volume threshold. A single Maersk-operated vessel transiting the Red Sea could be

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate for this situation is the "Major Maritime Chokepoint Disruptions by Non-State Actors," which suggests a 10-20% chance of resolution within 1.5 years of onset. This is based on historical events like Somali piracy, where disruptions took several years to resolve. Given the current situation's complexity and the involvement of non-state actors, this base rate seems appropriate.
   - Initial prior: 15% probability (midpoint of the 10-20% range).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The disruption is caused by non-state actors (Houthis) using military tactics to threaten shipping, similar to Somali piracy.
   - Differences: The current situation involves a significant economic incentive for Maersk to maintain the status quo due to high freight rates, which was not a factor in the Somali piracy case. Additionally, the geopolitical context is different, with ongoing regional conflicts influencing the situation.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Maersk's operational decisions and public statements (↓↓): The company's planning around the Africa route and consistent messaging about prolonged disruption strongly suggest they do not anticipate a quick resolution. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
   - Record profits linked to the crisis (↓↓): The financial incentive to maintain the current routing is strong, decreasing the likelihood of resuming Red Sea shipping. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
   - Ongoing Houthi threat (↓): The persistent threat from the Houthis without a clear path to resolution decreases the likelihood of resumption. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
   - Overall, the evidence points towards a lower probability of resumption in 2025.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 15% / 85% = 0.176
   - Given the strong negative evidence, let's assume a combined likelihood ratio of 0.2 (reflecting the strong disincentives and operational decisions).
   - Posterior odds = 0.176 × 0.2 = 0.0352
   - Posterior probability = 0.0352 / (1 + 0.0352) ≈ 3.4%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The analysis heavily weighs Maersk's current incentives and statements, which could change if geopolitical conditions improve unexpectedly.
   - Alternative scenario: A sudden geopolitical shift, such as a ceasefire or international intervention, could rapidly change the situation. However, current indicators do not suggest this is imminent.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence against resumption and the low likelihood of a sudden positive shift, the forecast remains low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final probability reflects the strong disincentives and operational decisions against resumption in 2025.

Final: 3%

# Will Maersk resume shipping in the Red Sea in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for how likely Maersk is to resume Red Sea shipping in 2025.

Looking at the reference classes provided:
- Major maritime chokepoint disruptions by non-state actors: ~10-20% chance of resolution within 1.5 years
- State-led closures of the Suez Canal: <5% chance of resolution within 1.5 years
- Corporate reversal of major logistical strategy: ~25% chance of reversal within a year of implementation

Given that this situation combines elements of all three reference classes, but is most similar to a non-state actor disruption with corporate strategic adaptation, I'll weight the first and third reference classes more heavily. The disruption began in January 2024, so by the end of 2025, it will have been approximately 2 years.

**Prior probability**: 20%

This prior reflects that maritime disruptions of this magnitude typically last multiple years, and corporations are reluctant to quickly reverse major logistical adaptations once implemented.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Like previous maritime disruptions, this involves a security threat making a key shipping route unsafe
- The situation involves international naval responses that have proven only partially effective
- The disruption has forced major shipping companies to implement costly alternative routes

**Key differences**:
- The Houthi attacks are ideologically motivated rather than financially motivated (unlike Somali piracy)
- Maersk is experiencing a paradoxical economic benefit from the disruption through higher freight rates
- The company has explicitly built its 2025 strategy (Gemini Cooperation with Hapag-Lloyd) around avoiding the Red Sea
- Maersk's CEO has made unusually clear and consistent statements about not expecting to return until "well into 2025"
- The disruption coincided with industry overcapacity, making the longer routes financially advantageous

These differences generally suggest a lower probability than the base rate would indicate, as they point to both stronger external threats and weaker internal incentives to resume Red Sea shipping.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Maersk's explicit forward guidance**
- CEO stated no return expected until "well into 2025" (October 2024)
- P(E|H): If Maersk will resume in 2025, the probability they would make this statement is low (~0.2)
- P(E|~H): If Maersk will not resume in 2025, this statement is highly likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22 (strong evidence against resumption)

**Evidence 2: Operational decisions for 2025**
- Maersk has built its 2025 vessel-sharing partnership around the Africa route
- P(E|H): If planning to resume in 2025, probability of making this operational commitment is very low (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If not planning to resume in 2025, this operational commitment is nearly certain (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.95 = 0.11 (very strong evidence against resumption)

**Evidence 3: Financial incentives from disruption**
- Red Sea crisis has led to Maersk's third-best annual profits ever in 2024
- P(E|H): If planning to resume in 2025, the probability of benefiting this much is moderate (~0.5)
- P(E|~H): If not planning to resume, this financial benefit is highly likely (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56 (moderate evidence against resumption)

**Evidence 4: Ongoing Houthi threat**
- Despite international naval operations, attacks continue and the threat remains credible
- P(E|H): If Maersk will resume in 2025, the probability of continued threat is low (~0.3)
- P(E|~H): If Maersk will not resume, continued threat is highly likely (~0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.38 (moderate evidence against resumption)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 20:80 (0.25), I'll update based on the strongest evidence first:

**Update on operational decisions for 2025:**
- Prior odds: 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 0.11 = 0.0275
- Posterior probability: 0.0275/(1+0.0275) ≈ 2.7%

**Update on explicit forward guidance:**
- Prior odds: 0.0275
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 0.0275 × 0.22 = 0.00605
- Posterior probability: 0.00605/(1+0.00605) ≈ 0.6%

**Update on financial incentives:**
- Prior odds: 0.00605
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 0.00605 × 0.56 = 0.00339
- Posterior probability: 0.00339/(1+0.00339) ≈ 0.34%

**Update on ongoing Houthi threat:**
- Prior odds: 0.00339
- Likelihood ratio: 0.38
- Posterior odds: 0.00339 × 0.38 = 0.00129
- Posterior probability: 0.00129/(1+0.00129) ≈ 0.13%

This extremely low probability suggests I may have overweighted the evidence or double-counted some factors. Let me reconsider more holistically.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis may be flawed in several ways:

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overweighting Maersk's public statements, which could be strategic posturing
- The evidence pieces are not fully independent; they reflect the same underlying factors
- I haven't adequately accounted for potential rapid changes in the geopolitical situation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A ceasefire in Gaza could remove the Houthis' stated justification for attacks
- A decisive military action could degrade Houthi capabilities
- Competitive pressure could force Maersk to resume if other carriers do
- The definition of "resumed" is ambiguous - even a single test vessel could qualify

**Market comparison:**
- The Manifold market shows a community forecast of 36.8%, far higher than my calculation
- This suggests I may be missing important considerations or overweighting negative evidence

Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability upward from the mechanistic calculation. The market's 36.8% seems too high given the strong evidence against resumption, but my calculation of 0.13% is unrealistically low.

## 6. Final Forecast

Reconsidering all factors:
- The base rate suggests around 20% probability
- Strong evidence from Maersk's operational decisions and public statements points significantly downward
- Financial incentives strongly favor continued avoidance of the Red Sea
- The security situation shows no signs of imminent resolution
- However, I must account for unexpected geopolitical developments and the ambiguity in resolution criteria

Balancing these considerations, I believe a reasonable probability is around 10%. This reflects the strong evidence against resumption while acknowledging the possibility of unexpected developments or limited test voyages that could technically satisfy the resolution criteria.

Final: 10%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The question asks whether Maersk will resume shipping in the Red Sea in 2025. A crucial piece of context is the date of this analysis: October 6, 2025. This means over 75% of the resolution period has already passed without the event occurring.

My initial base rate, formulated at the beginning of 2025, would have been around 20%. This was derived from reference classes like the Somali piracy crisis (suggesting a long duration) and corporate strategy reversals (suggesting some flexibility).

However, given that we are now in Q4 2025, I must significantly adjust this prior. If we assume the initial 20% chance was uniformly distributed throughout the year, the probability of the event occurring in the final quarter would be roughly 20% / 4 = 5%. This time-adjusted figure serves as a much more relevant prior for the remaining period.

*   **Prior P(H):** 5% (The probability of resumption occurring in the last ~3 months of 2025).
*   **Prior Odds:** 0.05 / 0.95 = 1:19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is one of an entrenched status quo. Maersk and its partners have been operating on the rerouted path around Africa for over a year and a half. The logistical inertia to change this network is now even greater than it was at the start of 2025. Any decision to resume Red Sea transit would not just be a reversal of a recent decision but an abandonment of a long-standing, profitable, and stable operational plan.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most powerful piece of evidence is the passage of time itself.

*   **Evidence 1: No resumption in the first nine months of 2025.**
    *   This fact is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that Maersk will *not* resume in 2025 (P(E | ~H) = 1).
    *   It is also highly consistent with a resumption happening late in the year, as per the CEO's guidance of "well into 2025" (P(E | H) is high, perhaps 0.9).
    *   The likelihood ratio (P(E | H) / P(E | ~H)) is approximately 0.9/1.0 = 0.9, which slightly decreases the probability. However, the main impact of the time passage is captured in the adjusted prior.

*   **Evidence 2: The underlying drivers remain unchanged.**
    *   The Houthi threat has not been neutralized.
    *   The geopolitical situation (including the Israel-Gaza conflict) has not reached a durable resolution.
    *   The rerouting remains highly profitable for Maersk, solving the industry's vessel overcapacity problem.
    *   The fact that these conditions, which argued against resumption at the start of the year, have persisted for nine months strengthens their predictive power. The world in which these were temporary problems that would resolve by mid-2025 has failed to materialize. This significantly strengthens the case for NO.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with our time-adjusted prior of 5% (1:19 odds), we must update based on the evidence. The primary negative evidence is the immense operational inertia and the lack of a compelling trigger for change.

To resume in Q4 2025, Maersk would have to disrupt its established network for just a few weeks of benefit before the year ends. This makes little logistical or financial sense. Any significant operational change would more logically be planned for the start of 2026.

Let's model the remaining paths to a "Yes" resolution:

1.  **Full Operational Resumption:** This would require a sudden, dramatic improvement in the security situation in October/November, followed by a rushed, costly, and chaotic decision by Maersk to immediately reroute its fleet. The probability of the security situation changing so drastically in the next ~2 months is low (perhaps 5%), and the probability of Maersk reacting so precipitously instead of planning for 2026 is also very low (perhaps 10%). This path's probability is ~0.05 * 0.10 = 0.5%.

2.  **Token/Symbolic Resumption:** Maersk could send one or a few ships through the Red Sea to test the waters, send a market signal for 2026 contracts, or for PR reasons. This could satisfy the resolution criteria ("shipping... has resumed"). This is more plausible than a full network reversal. I estimate a small but non-trivial probability for this scenario, perhaps 3%.

Combining these paths gives a posterior probability of approximately 0.5% + 3% = 3.5%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is very low, contrasting with a much higher community forecast on Manifold (36.8%). Why might I be wrong?

*   **The Manifold market may be stale or not factoring in the late date.** I believe this is likely.
*   **I am underestimating the chance of a sudden geopolitical breakthrough.** A peace deal could be announced at any time. While unlikely, it's a tail risk.
*   **The CEO's "well into 2025" statement was a deliberate signal for a Q4 return.** This is the strongest argument for a higher probability. Perhaps a plan for a Q4 resumption has been in place all along, contingent on a security improvement that has not yet occurred but is still hoped for.
*   **The resolution criteria are looser than I assume.** A simple announcement could be sufficient, even if ships don't move for weeks. However, the text "has resumed" seems to imply active shipping.

Even considering these points, the logistical hurdle of changing a global shipping network for just the last few weeks of the year is immense. The arguments against a Q4 resumption are very strong. My analysis suggests the community forecast is too high. I will adjust my 3.5% estimate slightly upwards to 4% to account for the tail risks and the ambiguity in the CEO's statement.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial 20% base rate is drastically reduced by the fact that over three-quarters of 2025 has passed without a resumption, leading to a time-adjusted prior of ~5%. The continued presence of the security threat, coupled with the immense operational inertia and financial benefits of the status quo, makes a full operational return in the final quarter highly improbable (<1%). The main remaining possibility for a "Yes" resolution is a limited, symbolic resumption of service. I estimate the combined probability of these scenarios at 4%.

Final: 4%
