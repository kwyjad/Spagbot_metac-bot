### Research Plan

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: What is the baseline probability of a CEO of a major tech company using a key strategic partner's primary communication software?** This establishes the reference class and base rate.
*   **Q2: What is the current nature of the OpenAI-Microsoft relationship?** Is it primarily collaborative, competitive, or a mix ("frenemy")? How has this evolved recently?
*   **Q3: What are Sam Altman's and OpenAI's established communication tool preferences and internal standards?** This helps understand the inertia and switching costs.
*   **Q4: What specific events or circumstances would necessitate Altman using Microsoft Teams?** This identifies potential triggers for a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Q5: What would cause such usage to be publicly reported by a credible source?** This is crucial, as the resolution depends on public knowledge, not private use.

**2. Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1:**
    *   `"CEO communication tools" "strategic partnership"`
    *   `"Sundar Pichai" uses "AWS Chime"` (analogous query)
    *   `"Tim Cook" uses "Google Meet"` (analogous query)
    *   `tech CEO software usage patterns`
*   **Q2:**
    *   `"Sam Altman" "Satya Nadella" relationship 2025`
    *   `"OpenAI" "Microsoft" partnership status October 2025`
    *   `OpenAI competition with Microsoft enterprise AI`
    *   `Sam Altman on Microsoft partnership recent interview`
*   **Q3:**
    *   `"Sam Altman" interview communication tools 2025`
    *   `"OpenAI" internal communication platform Slack`
    *   `OpenAI job postings "Slack" OR "Teams"`
    *   `Sam Altman productivity tools`
*   **Q4 & Q5:**
    *   `Microsoft OpenAI joint press conference`
    *   `Satya Nadella Sam Altman joint call platform`
    *   `reporting on CEO software usage tech news`
    *   `Microsoft Teams high profile guest users`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

*   The base rate for a CEO using a partner's tool is non-trivial but not a given; it often happens in the context of joint public appearances or deeply integrated projects.
*   The OpenAI-Microsoft relationship is exceptionally deep financially and infrastructurally (Azure) but also has significant competitive friction, as OpenAI now competes for enterprise customers. The May 2025 Build appearance shows the collaborative front is still strong, but the underlying tension remains.
*   Altman's and OpenAI's preference for Slack is well-documented and recent (Jan 2024). This indicates strong institutional and personal inertia against switching to Teams for internal work.
*   The most likely trigger for a "Yes" resolution would be a formal, high-stakes meeting *with Microsoft executives* or a joint public event hosted on the Teams platform. The resolution hinges on this event being newsworthy enough for a journalist to mention the specific software used.
*   The time horizon is extremely short (less than 3 months). This dramatically reduces the window of opportunity for such an event to occur and be reported.

**4. Drafting the Comprehensive Answer:**

The following brief is the result of this research and synthesis process.

***

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **CEOs of major tech companies using a competitor's product:** The base rate is very low. CEOs are brand ambassadors and typically use their own company's (or a neutral third-party's) software. Ballpark: <5% over a two-year period.
2.  **CEOs of tech companies using a *key strategic partner's* communication product:** This is a more relevant class. Usage is more common, often as a gesture of goodwill or for practical reasons in joint projects. The relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft is unusually deep, pushing this probability higher than a typical partnership. Ballpark: 20-40% probability of at least one reported use over a two-year period.
3.  **High-profile individuals' specific software usage being publicly reported:** This is a filter on the above classes. A CEO might use a tool, but it's not always newsworthy. Given the intense media scrutiny on Altman and the OpenAI-Microsoft dynamic, the probability of reporting *if use occurs* is unusually high.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-05-19** Altman appears with Nadella at Microsoft Build — ↑ — Reaffirms the public-facing strength and importance of the partnership, making a joint appearance on a Microsoft platform more plausible.
*   **2024-04-12** Report on OpenAI poaching Microsoft's customers — ↓ — Highlights the underlying competitive tension, which could create resistance to symbolic gestures like using a partner's flagship software.
*   **2024-01-15** Altman states his most-used app is Slack — ↓ — Confirms a strong personal and organizational preference for a direct competitor to Teams, indicating high inertia.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Partnership Optics (Large ↑):** A high-profile, joint OpenAI-Microsoft announcement or meeting is the most likely trigger. Using Teams for such an event would be a powerful and simple way to signal partnership alignment.
2.  **Internal Inertia (Large ↓):** OpenAI is a Slack-native organization. Altman himself is a stated power user. The friction to use a different tool for any non-essential purpose is significant.
3.  **External Meeting Requirements (Moderate ↑):** Altman may be required to join a Teams call hosted by a major enterprise customer, government body, or Microsoft itself. The probability of this specific scenario being *reported* is the key uncertainty.
4.  **Symbolism of the 2023 Firing (Moderate ↓):** Altman was fired over Google Meet. The choice of video conferencing tool in high-stakes situations at OpenAI is now freighted with meaning. This could lead to deliberate avoidance of any platform not explicitly chosen by OpenAI (like their preferred Slack Huddles/Canvas).
5.  **Short Time Horizon (Large ↓):** With less than three months until the end of 2025, the window for a suitable event to occur *and* be credibly reported is very small.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Partnership Depth:** The relationship is not a typical B2B partnership. Microsoft's >$10B investment and role as primary cloud provider make it more akin to a corporate parent/subsidiary, increasing pressure for symbolic integration.
*   **Direct "Frenemy" Dynamic:** Unlike most strategic partners, OpenAI and Microsoft are increasingly direct competitors in the enterprise AI software layer. This creates a unique tension not present in the base rate.
*   **Intense Media Scrutiny:** Sam Altman's every move is watched. While a typical CEO's choice of video call software is trivial, his would likely be noted and reported if it occurred in a public or semi-public context, especially given the history.
*   **High Symbolic Stakes:** The 2023 firing over Google Meet makes the choice of communication tool a non-trivial, symbolic act for OpenAI's leadership, a factor absent in the general reference class.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the reference class of a CEO using a key partner's tool, might be around 25% (equivalent n≈4), acknowledging it's plausible but not a default action over a ~2-year period.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The financial and strategic depth of the Microsoft partnership creates strong incentives for gestures of collaboration.
    *   (↓ Large) Strong, demonstrated preference for Slack at both the personal (Altman) and organizational (OpenAI) level creates powerful inertia.
    *   (↓ Large) The extremely short time remaining (~2.5 months) drastically limits the opportunity for a qualifying event to occur and be reported.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The underlying competitive dynamic disincentivizes symbolic concessions.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence for "No" is stronger, primarily due to the combination of strong inertia and the very short time horizon. The posterior should move down significantly from the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Announcement of a new, major joint initiative between OpenAI and Microsoft.
    *   A scheduled joint interview or press conference featuring both Altman and Nadella.
    *   Leaked reports of Microsoft pushing for deeper operational integration with OpenAI.
    *   Altman being scheduled to speak at a Microsoft-hosted event.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Altman conducts a high-profile virtual meeting on a non-Teams platform (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet).
    *   OpenAI announces a renewed or expanded enterprise license with Slack.
    *   Reports of increased friction or competition over enterprise customers.
    *   The end of the year approaches with no significant joint public appearances scheduled.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Ambiguity:** The use must be "clear and not speculative." A passing mention in an article could be debated. Resolution hinges on the quality and clarity of the source.
*   **Pragmatism vs. Symbolism:** We may be over-analyzing the symbolic weight. Altman might pragmatically use Teams for a single call without a second thought, and it happens to get reported.
*   **Private vs. Public Information:** We lack insight into the specific operational agreements between the two companies. There could be a mandate for using Teams for inter-company collaboration that we are unaware of.
*   **Randomness:** With such a short timeline, the outcome is highly sensitive to a single, unpredictable event (e.g., an urgent, unexpected joint crisis call that a reporter learns about).

**Final Research Summary:**
The deep strategic partnership with Microsoft provides a strong reason for Sam Altman to use Teams, but this is heavily counteracted by his and OpenAI's established preference for Slack, underlying competitive tensions, and an extremely short time horizon for the event to occur and be reported. The weight of evidence, particularly the lack of time, points toward "No."

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for a CEO of a major tech company using a key strategic partner's communication software is estimated to be around 20-40% over a two-year period. This is based on the nature of strategic partnerships where such usage is more common, often as a gesture of goodwill or for practical reasons in joint projects. Given the deep financial and strategic relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft, a prior probability of 25% seems reasonable.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft is exceptionally deep, akin to a corporate parent/subsidiary relationship, which increases the likelihood of using Microsoft Teams as a gesture of collaboration.
   - Differences: OpenAI's strong preference for Slack and the competitive tension between OpenAI and Microsoft create significant inertia against switching to Teams. Additionally, the short time horizon until the end of 2025 limits the opportunity for such an event to occur and be reported.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Partnership Optics (Large ↑):** The financial and strategic depth of the Microsoft partnership creates strong incentives for gestures of collaboration, increasing the likelihood of using Teams.
   - **Internal Inertia (Large ↓):** The strong preference for Slack at both the personal (Altman) and organizational (OpenAI) level creates powerful inertia against using Teams.
   - **Short Time Horizon (Large ↓):** The limited time remaining drastically reduces the opportunity for a qualifying event to occur and be reported.
   - **Competitive Dynamic (Moderate ↓):** The underlying competitive tension disincentivizes symbolic concessions like using a competitor's software.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 25% / 75% = 1/3
   - Likelihood ratio: The evidence for "No" (internal inertia, short time horizon, competitive dynamic) is stronger than for "Yes" (partnership optics), suggesting a likelihood ratio less than 1.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio < 1/3
   - Posterior probability = (Posterior odds) / (1 + Posterior odds) < 25%
   - The evidence suggests a significant decrease from the prior probability due to the strong inertia and short time horizon.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence could arise from underestimating the potential for a high-profile joint event or unexpected collaboration that necessitates using Teams. However, the short time frame and strong preference for Slack are compelling counterarguments.
   - An alternative forecast might consider a higher probability if there were indications of an upcoming major joint initiative or event. However, the lack of such indicators and the competitive tension support the current forecast.
   - Adjustments: Given the strong evidence against and the short time frame, the probability should be adjusted downward.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and short time horizon, the final forecast reflects a lower probability than the initial prior due to the strong inertia and limited time for the event to occur and be reported.

Final: 15%

# Will Sam Altman Use Microsoft Teams before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a base rate for a CEO of a major tech company using a key strategic partner's primary communication software within a specific timeframe.

The most relevant reference class is: **CEOs of tech companies using a key strategic partner's communication product**. This is more appropriate than the broader class of "CEOs using competitors' products" because Microsoft and OpenAI have a deep strategic partnership, not just a competitive relationship.

Based on the research report, the base rate for this reference class is estimated at 20-40% probability over a two-year period. However, we need to adjust this for our specific timeframe:
- The question resolves on December 31, 2025
- Today is October 14, 2025
- This leaves only ~2.5 months remaining

Given the short timeframe (about 1/10th of the two-year period used for the base rate), a reasonable starting prior would be approximately 5-10% (scaling down from the 20-40% two-year rate).

**Initial prior: 8%** (expressed as odds: 1:11.5)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Sam Altman is a CEO of a major tech company with a significant strategic partnership
- Microsoft is a key partner for OpenAI with substantial investment ($10B+)
- There are plausible scenarios where using the partner's software would be expected

**Key differences:**
- **Unusually deep partnership**: Microsoft's investment in OpenAI is exceptionally large, creating stronger incentives for symbolic gestures of partnership
- **Very short timeframe**: With only 2.5 months remaining in 2025, there's a severely limited window for a qualifying event
- **Established preference**: Altman has explicitly stated his preference for Slack (a Teams competitor) as recently as January 2024
- **Competitive tension**: Despite the partnership, OpenAI and Microsoft have competitive elements in their relationship, with reports of OpenAI poaching Microsoft customers
- **Symbolic weight**: The fact that Altman was fired over Google Meet in 2023 adds unusual symbolic significance to his choice of communication platforms

These differences suggest both upward and downward pressure on the base rate, with the short timeframe being particularly significant.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Extremely short time horizon (~2.5 months)**
- P(Short time | Will use Teams) = Low (~0.3) - If Altman were to use Teams, it would be more likely to happen over a longer timeframe
- P(Short time | Won't use Teams) = High (~0.9) - The short timeframe significantly reduces opportunities for a qualifying event
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33
- This evidence strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Altman's stated preference for Slack (Jan 2024)**
- P(Slack preference | Will use Teams) = Moderate (~0.5) - Even with a preference, he might use Teams for specific partnership contexts
- P(Slack preference | Won't use Teams) = High (~0.9) - A strong preference makes avoiding Teams more likely
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: May 2025 joint appearance with Nadella at Microsoft Build**
- P(Joint appearance | Will use Teams) = High (~0.8) - Such collaboration increases chances of Teams usage
- P(Joint appearance | Won't use Teams) = Moderate (~0.6) - Collaboration doesn't necessitate Teams usage
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.6 = 1.33
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Reports of competitive tension (OpenAI poaching Microsoft customers)**
- P(Competitive tension | Will use Teams) = Moderate (~0.6) - Competition doesn't preclude using a partner's tools
- P(Competitive tension | Won't use Teams) = High (~0.8) - Competition reduces incentives for symbolic gestures
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.8 = 0.75
- This evidence slightly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with our prior odds of 1:11.5 (8% probability), let's update based on the evidence:

Posterior odds = Prior odds × LR1 × LR2 × LR3 × LR4
Posterior odds = (1/11.5) × 0.33 × 0.56 × 1.33 × 0.75
Posterior odds = (1/11.5) × 0.165
Posterior odds ≈ 1:69.7

Converting to probability:
Posterior probability = 1/(1+69.7) ≈ 0.014 or about 1.4%

This seems excessively low given the uncertainties involved. Let me reconsider the strength of some of these likelihood ratios, which may be overstated.

Revised calculation with more conservative likelihood ratios:
- LR1 (short time): 0.5 (less extreme)
- LR2 (Slack preference): 0.7 (less extreme)
- LR3 (joint appearance): 1.2 (less extreme)
- LR4 (competitive tension): 0.8 (similar)

Posterior odds = (1/11.5) × 0.5 × 0.7 × 1.2 × 0.8
Posterior odds ≈ (1/11.5) × 0.336
Posterior odds ≈ 1:34.2

Revised posterior probability = 1/(1+34.2) ≈ 0.028 or about 2.8%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the frequency of high-level meetings between OpenAI and Microsoft executives that could necessitate Teams usage
- The research doesn't mention whether OpenAI has any formal agreements about using Microsoft products
- I might be overweighting the importance of Altman's personal preference versus organizational requirements

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A crisis scenario could emerge requiring urgent communication between OpenAI and Microsoft leadership
- Microsoft could host a year-end strategic planning session with key partners including OpenAI
- A major joint announcement before year-end could involve Teams-based preparation meetings

**Best alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 10-15%, arguing that:
- The Microsoft-OpenAI relationship is exceptionally important to both companies
- End-of-year strategic planning is common in December
- Only one instance of Teams usage needs to be reported for a "Yes" resolution

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
- The extremely short timeframe remains the dominant factor
- For the usage to be reported, it would likely need to be in a public or semi-public context
- Most end-of-year planning would have already been scheduled by October, and no such events are mentioned in the research

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to account for the possibility of unforeseen circumstances or events that might necessitate Teams usage in the short remaining timeframe.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of Sam Altman using Microsoft Teams before 2026 is approximately 4%.

The extremely short timeframe (2.5 months) is the most significant limiting factor, combined with Altman's stated preference for Slack and the competitive elements in the Microsoft-OpenAI relationship. While the deep partnership creates some pressure for symbolic gestures like using Teams, the weight of evidence points toward a low probability outcome.

Final: 4%

```md

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is "the probability that a CEO of a major tech company has at least one publicly reported use of a key strategic partner's primary communication software over a two-year period."
*   **Reasoning:** This class is more specific than "any CEO using a competitor's product" (which would be very low) and captures the essential dynamic of the OpenAI-Microsoft relationship. The partnership is exceptionally deep, involving billions of dollars and critical infrastructure, making some level of tool-sharing plausible for collaboration and symbolic unity. However, inertia and brand loyalty are also strong forces.
*   **Initial Prior:** A reasonable prior probability is **30%**. This reflects that such an event is plausible and more likely than not to happen over a long period in a deep partnership, but is far from a certainty. In odds form, this is 0.30 / 0.70 ≈ 0.43 to 1.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The situation involves two major tech companies in a deep strategic partnership, which is the core of the reference class.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **(Increases Probability):** The OpenAI-Microsoft partnership is deeper and more financially significant than almost any other in the tech industry. This increases the pressure and number of opportunities for joint activities. Furthermore, the intense media scrutiny on Sam Altman means any use is more likely to be *reported* than for a generic CEO, which is a key part of the resolution criteria.
    *   **(Decreases Probability):** OpenAI and Altman have a strong, publicly stated preference for Slack, a direct competitor to Teams, creating significant inertia. The two companies are also increasingly direct competitors for enterprise AI customers, which can create friction that discourages symbolic gestures of unity. Finally, the history of Altman's firing over Google Meet may make the choice of communication platform a more sensitive and deliberately controlled decision than in the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

The most critical piece of evidence is the passage of time.

*   **Evidence:** The question covers the period from late 2023 to the end of 2025 (a ~25-month window). As of mid-October 2025, approximately 22.5 months (~90% of the total time) have passed without a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Likelihood Ratio Analysis (P(E|H) / P(E|~H)):**
    *   P(E | H): The likelihood of observing no reported use for the first ~90% of the period, *given that a reported use will happen*, is low. It implies the event is clustered at the very end of the period.
    *   P(E | ~H): The likelihood of observing no reported use for the first ~90% of the period, *given that no reported use will ever happen*, is very high (it is 1).
    *   The likelihood ratio is therefore significantly less than 1, providing a very strong update in the direction of "No."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

We can model this as a time-decay problem. If we assume the 30% prior was for the entire ~25-month period, we can estimate the probability of the event occurring in the remaining ~2.5 months.

*   **Prior:** 30% over ~25 months.
*   **Update with Time Decay:** A simple approach is to assume the probability of the event is uniformly distributed over time. With ~10% of the time remaining (2.5 / 25 months), the initial 30% probability is reduced proportionally. However, a more robust method is to consider the scenarios that could still lead to a "Yes".
*   **Scenario Decomposition:**
    1.  **Major Joint Event:** A planned virtual press conference, product launch, or strategy summit hosted by Microsoft. The end of the year is a plausible time for such events.
        *   Probability of such an event in the next 2.5 months: ~5%
        *   Probability he uses Teams if the event occurs: ~80%
        *   Contribution to total probability: 0.05 * 0.80 = **4%**
    2.  **Routine Call Gets Reported:** Altman uses Teams for a pragmatic, routine call with Microsoft executives, and this detail is credibly reported by the media.
        *   Probability he uses Teams for at least one routine call: High, perhaps 70%.
        *   Probability of this specific detail being reported: Very low, perhaps 5%.
        *   Contribution to total probability: 0.70 * 0.05 = **3.5%**
    3.  **Other Scenarios:** He joins a Teams call hosted by a third party (e.g., a government body) that gets reported.
        *   Contribution to total probability: ~**1%**

*   **Posterior Probability:** Summing these disjoint paths gives a posterior probability of 4% + 3.5% + 1% = **8.5%**.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

*   **Why might the forecast be too low?** The primary reason for a "Yes" would be a single, scheduled event. My estimate of a 5% chance of a major joint event in the next 2.5 months might be too pessimistic. A surprise end-of-year announcement or a joint appearance at a late-year conference could easily happen. If such an event is already on the calendar internally, the true probability is much higher. I might also be underestimating the media's ability to report on a routine call.
*   **Why might the forecast be too high?** The inertia of using Slack and the symbolic weight of avoiding other platforms might be stronger than assumed. It's possible that OpenAI's policy is to host all high-stakes virtual meetings themselves or use a neutral platform like Zoom, making the probability near-zero. The 8.5% still feels plausible as it accounts for the non-zero chance of a surprise event.
*   **Adjustment:** The 8.5% result from the scenario analysis feels robust. It correctly identifies that the probability is low due to the short timeline but acknowledges the plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution. I will round this to a final forecast.

### 6. Final Forecast

The initial base rate of ~30% is dramatically reduced by the fact that ~90% of the resolution period has passed without the event occurring. While the deep partnership and intense media scrutiny provide plausible paths to a "Yes" resolution, these are low-probability scenarios in the short time remaining. The most likely path is a single, significant joint event, but the chances of one materializing and being reported in the next ~2.5 months are small.

Final: 9%
