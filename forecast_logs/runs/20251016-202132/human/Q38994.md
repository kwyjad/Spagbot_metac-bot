### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: OPEC Membership Changes (2000–2024).** In this 25-year period, there have been 7 major membership events (3 joins: Angola, Eq. Guinea, Congo; 4 departures: Ecuador, Indonesia, Qatar, Angola). This yields a base rate of approximately one change every 3.6 years. The probability of a change (either join or leave) in any given year is ~28%. The probability of a change in the remaining ~2.5 months of 2025 is therefore very low, roughly 6% (2.5/12 * 0.28).
-   **Reference Class 2: OPEC Departures by Small Producers.** Three of the four most recent departures (Ecuador, Qatar, Angola) were driven by disagreements over production quotas or a desire for independent energy policy. Smaller producers with declining output (like Equatorial Guinea) or those with ambitions to maximize production (like Angola) are more likely to find the constraints of membership non-beneficial. This suggests focusing on the stability of the smaller/more discontented members.
-   **Limitations:** Base rates assume a static environment. The creation of OPEC+ in 2016 provides a new "membership-lite" alternative, potentially reducing the incentive for new countries to formally join OPEC and offering a softer landing for those who leave.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2024-05-06] Report highlights Equatorial Guinea's shrinking oil industry. ↓ — Increases the probability of a departure, as the benefits of membership diminish for a small, declining producer.
-   [2024-10-04] EIA brief notes Saudi Arabia's production cuts to balance the market. ↔ — This reflects standard OPEC+ policy execution, indicating stability and cohesion among core members, making a major schism less likely.
-   [2025-10-13] OPEC's October MOMR shows stable market analysis and outlook. ↔ — "Business as usual" reporting suggests no internal crises or major policy shifts that would precipitate a membership change.
-   [2025-10-14] OPEC maintains its 2025 oil demand growth forecast. ↔ — A stable, consensus-based outlook indicates internal alignment and reduces the likelihood of a sudden, contentious departure before year-end.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Disagreement over Production Quotas (Large):** This is the primary driver for departures. A member may feel its quota is unfairly low (e.g., UAE's past concerns) or too restrictive for its national interests (e.g., Angola's reason for leaving).
-   **Declining Production Capacity (Moderate):** For smaller members, if production falls significantly, the costs and political overhead of OPEC membership may outweigh the benefits of coordinated action (e.g., Equatorial Guinea).
-   **Geopolitical Realignment (Moderate):** A country may choose to leave to align with different partners or to focus on a different aspect of its energy strategy (e.g., Qatar's focus on natural gas).
-   **Desire for Influence (Moderate):** A significant non-OPEC producer might join to gain a voice in global oil policy and benefit from price stability. However, the existence of OPEC+ makes this less necessary.
-   **Procedural Inertia (Large):** Joining or leaving is a formal state decision requiring notification and process. Changes are typically announced in advance and often take effect at the start of a new calendar year. This makes a change within a <3 month window highly unlikely without a prior announcement.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extremely Short Horizon:** The forecast is for Dec 31, 2025, less than three months away. The base rate is calculated over years; procedural delays alone make a change in this short window improbable unless it has already been announced.
-   **Existence of OPEC+:** Unlike most of the reference period, the OPEC+ framework provides a forum for cooperation without full membership. This lowers the incentive for countries like Mexico or Azerbaijan to join OPEC and provides an alternative for members who might otherwise leave entirely.
-   **Known Departure Precedent:** Angola's departure in January 2024 over quota disputes provides a recent, clear template for how and why a member might leave, making it a more "thinkable" event for other dissatisfied members.
-   **Identified At-Risk Member:** Equatorial Guinea's well-documented production decline makes it a specific, plausible candidate for departure, moving beyond the generalized base rate.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** The base rate suggests a low probability of change in a short window. Start with a strong prior centered on **12 members** (the current number after Angola's departure), with an "equivalent n" of ~20, reflecting high confidence in stability.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑) **Short Time Horizon:** The procedural requirements for leaving/joining make a change effective by Dec 31, 2025, extremely unlikely at this point. (Large positive impact on the probability of staying at 12).
    -   (↓) **Equatorial Guinea's Decline:** The country's weakening production creates a plausible motive for departure. (Small negative impact).
    -   (↓) **Angola Precedent:** The recent departure normalizes leaving over policy disputes. (Small negative impact).
    -   (↑) **Lack of Joining Candidates:** There are no active, credible rumors of a new country joining in the immediate future. (Small positive impact).
-   **Net effect:** The evidence, particularly the extremely short time horizon, overwhelmingly reinforces the prior. The posterior should be more sharply peaked at 12 members than the prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators (probability of >12 members):**
    -   An official announcement from a non-member (e.g., Azerbaijan, Brunei) of its intent to apply for OPEC membership.
    -   High-level diplomatic meetings between OPEC leadership and a potential new member.
    -   A surprise resolution at the next OPEC Ministerial Meeting (typically late Nov/early Dec) to admit a new member.
-   **DOWN indicators (probability of <12 members):**
    -   An official announcement from any member country of its intent to withdraw.
    -   Public, high-stakes criticism of OPEC policy or quotas by an oil minister, particularly from Equatorial Guinea or UAE.
    -   A breakdown or failure to reach consensus at the next OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Sudden Political Shocks:** A coup, revolution, or major diplomatic fallout could lead a country to make a sudden, unexpected decision to withdraw.
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** A country could be "suspended" rather than formally withdrawn, creating ambiguity. The resolution criteria's reliance on the official OPEC members list mitigates this, but a dispute could arise.
-   **Information Asymmetry:** A decision to leave could be made internally and not be publicly announced until the last minute, though this is unlikely.
-   **Misinterpretation of "OPEC+":** The question is strictly about OPEC. News related to OPEC+ cohesion or disputes should be carefully evaluated for its specific impact on full OPEC members.

**Final Research Summary:** The current number of OPEC members is 12. Given the very short time until resolution, institutional and procedural inertia make any change highly improbable, as no such change has been announced.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for OPEC membership changes is approximately one change every 3.6 years, based on historical data from 2000 to 2024. This suggests a low probability of change in any given year, especially within a short timeframe like the remaining months of 2025. The mean is 12 members, with a variance reflecting the historical frequency of changes.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution in that there have been no recent announcements of membership changes, and the procedural inertia of OPEC makes sudden changes unlikely. However, the existence of OPEC+ provides an alternative for countries considering joining or leaving, which could slightly increase the stability of current membership.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Short Time Horizon:** Strongly suggests stability, as procedural requirements make a change unlikely without prior announcement. This increases the likelihood of remaining at 12 members.
   - **Equatorial Guinea's Decline:** Suggests a potential departure, but the impact is small given the short timeframe.
   - **Angola Precedent:** Slightly increases the plausibility of a departure, but again, the impact is minimal due to the short timeframe.
   - **Lack of Joining Candidates:** Reinforces stability, as there are no credible rumors of new members.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior centered on 12 members, the evidence overwhelmingly supports stability. The likelihood of a change is low, so the posterior distribution remains sharply peaked at 12 members, with a slightly reduced variance due to the reinforcing evidence of stability.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks such as sudden political shocks or definitional ambiguities is important, but these are unlikely to affect the forecast significantly given the current evidence. The best alternative forecast would consider a departure by Equatorial Guinea, but the procedural and temporal constraints make this unlikely before the end of 2025.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the strong evidence for stability and the short timeframe, the percentiles reflect a high confidence in no change.

# Forecast: How many countries will be in OPEC on December 31, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the current OPEC membership as the central point. As of October 2025, OPEC has 12 members (after Angola's departure in January 2024): Algeria, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Venezuela.

Historical data shows OPEC membership has been relatively stable with infrequent changes:
- From 2000-2024: 7 major membership events (3 joins, 4 departures)
- This gives a base rate of approximately one change every 3.6 years
- Annual probability of change: ~28%

My prior distribution is therefore centered at 12 members, with some probability mass at 11 and 13 members, and very small probability at more extreme values.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- OPEC continues to function as a coordinating body for oil-producing nations
- The core members (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran) remain stable
- The organization still serves its primary purpose of coordinating production

**Differences from base rate:**
- Extremely short time horizon: Only ~2.5 months remain until December 31, 2025
- Procedural requirements: Joining or leaving OPEC typically requires formal notification and takes time
- OPEC+ existence: Provides an alternative forum for cooperation without full membership
- Recent precedent: Angola's departure in January 2024 may make leaving more "thinkable"

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for stability (12 members):**
- Short time horizon: The ~2.5 months remaining makes any change highly unlikely without prior announcement (strong evidence, likelihood ratio ~10:1 favoring stability)
- No public announcements: No country has formally announced intention to join or leave (moderate evidence, LR ~3:1)
- OPEC's October 2025 MOMR shows stable market analysis and outlook, suggesting no internal crisis (weak evidence, LR ~1.5:1)

**Evidence for potential decrease (11 or fewer):**
- Equatorial Guinea's declining oil production reduces its benefits from membership (moderate evidence, LR ~2:1 favoring departure)
- Angola's recent departure provides a template for other dissatisfied members (weak evidence, LR ~1.2:1)

**Evidence for potential increase (13 or more):**
- No credible rumors or diplomatic signals of a new country joining (strong evidence against increase, LR ~8:1 against)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 12 members with ~70% probability, 15% for 11 members, and 15% for 13 members.

First update: Short time horizon
- Prior: P(12) = 70%, P(11) = 15%, P(13) = 15%
- Likelihood: LR(12:11 or 13) = 10:1
- Posterior: P(12) = 95.9%, P(11) = 2.05%, P(13) = 2.05%

Second update: Equatorial Guinea's declining production
- Prior: P(12) = 95.9%, P(11) = 2.05%, P(13) = 2.05%
- Likelihood: LR(11:12) = 2:1, LR(13:12) = 1:8
- Posterior: P(12) = 92.3%, P(11) = 7.4%, P(13) = 0.3%

The posterior distribution is now heavily concentrated at 12 members, with a small chance of 11 members and a very small chance of 13 or more members.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be overestimating procedural inertia; a country could announce departure with immediate effect
- There could be ongoing secret negotiations not reflected in public sources
- A major geopolitical crisis could trigger sudden membership changes

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Equatorial Guinea could announce departure before year-end due to continued production decline
- A non-OPEC+ country could seek emergency admission for economic reasons
- Multiple smaller producers could coordinate departures as a bloc

After considering these scenarios, I still believe 12 members is by far the most likely outcome, but I should slightly increase the probability of 11 members to account for the Equatorial Guinea risk.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of OPEC member countries on a specific future date. A suitable reference class is the history of membership changes in OPEC.
- **Reference Class:** OPEC membership changes from 2000 to 2024.
- **Data:** Over this 25-year period, there were 7 changes (3 countries joining, 4 leaving). This establishes a base rate of 7/25 = 0.28 changes per year.
- **Prior Distribution:** The question's time horizon is very short, from October 16, 2025, to December 31, 2025 (~2.5 months or 0.208 years). Using a Poisson process, the probability of at least one change in this window is `1 - exp(-0.28 * 0.208)`, which is approximately 5.7%. Therefore, my prior distribution is heavily centered on the current number of 12 members, with a ~94.3% probability of no change. The small probability of change is split roughly between a departure (to 11) and a join (to 13).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the long-term average in one critical way that reinforces the base rate's conclusion.
- **Similarity:** The underlying political and economic drivers for joining or leaving OPEC (e.g., disagreements over production quotas, desire for independent policy) remain the same.
- **Difference:** The most significant difference is the **extremely short time horizon**. Joining or leaving an international organization like OPEC is a formal process that involves high-level political decisions, official notifications, and typically takes effect at the start of a new calendar year. A change being finalized and officially reflected on OPEC's member list within a 2.5-month window without any prior announcement is highly improbable due to this procedural inertia.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate key pieces of evidence for how they shift the probability away from the prior.
- **Evidence 1: Short Time Horizon & Procedural Inertia.** As of mid-October 2025, there are no public announcements of any country intending to join or leave. For a change to be effective by December 31, an announcement would be expected. This lack of signal, combined with the typical procedural delays, makes the status quo (12 members) much more likely. This evidence provides a strong update in favor of 12. (Likelihood Ratio for 12 vs. not-12 is high, perhaps 3:1).
- **Evidence 2: Equatorial Guinea's Declining Production.** The research report highlights the country's shrinking oil industry. This provides a clear motive for a potential departure, as the costs of membership may outweigh the benefits. This makes the outcome of 11 members more plausible than it would be otherwise. However, this is a long-term pressure, not a specific trigger for a departure in the next 10 weeks. This is a weak update towards 11.
- **Evidence 3: Lack of Joining Candidates & Existence of OPEC+.** There are no prominent non-member countries actively seeking to join. The OPEC+ framework provides a "membership-lite" option for cooperation, reducing the incentive for formal membership. This makes the outcome of 13 members less likely. This is a weak update against 13.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Conceptual Update:** Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood
- **Step-by-step:**
    1.  **Start with the Prior:** P(12) ≈ 94%, P(not 12) ≈ 6%. The prior odds of the number staying at 12 are approximately 94/6 ≈ 15.7 to 1.
    2.  **Apply Evidence:** The main evidence is the short time horizon and lack of any announcement, which strongly favors the status quo. I'll model this with a likelihood ratio of 3. The other pieces of evidence (Equatorial Guinea's situation vs. lack of joiners) are weaker and roughly cancel each other out in terms of net impact on the probability of *any* change.
    3.  **Calculate Posterior Odds:** Posterior Odds ≈ Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 15.7 × 3 = 47.1 to 1.
    4.  **Convert to Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability of the number remaining 12 is 47.1 / (47.1 + 1) ≈ 97.9%.
- **Posterior Description:** The posterior distribution is even more sharply peaked at 12 than the prior. The probability of a change has been revised downwards from ~6% to ~2%. The most likely change is a departure, making 11 the only other plausible outcome.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** My forecast implies a >97% chance of the number of members being 12. Is this overconfident? The primary risk is a "surprise" announcement. A country could have a sudden political shift (e.g., a coup) or a major diplomatic fallout with OPEC leadership, leading to an immediate withdrawal announcement.
- **Plausible Alternative:** The most plausible alternative is that one country leaves, resulting in 11 members. The precedent is Angola's departure, which was announced on December 21, 2023, and became effective shortly after on January 1, 2024. A similar event could happen at the final OPEC meeting of 2025 (typically late November/early December), with a country like Equatorial Guinea announcing a departure effective December 31.
- **Adjustment:** While this scenario is possible, it remains a low-probability event. A ~2% chance of such a departure seems reasonable. The chance of a new member joining in this timeframe is even lower, close to zero. Therefore, my posterior distribution with P(12) ≈ 98%, P(11) ≈ 2%, and P(>12) < 0.1% seems robust. This distribution is so concentrated that all percentiles from P10 to P90 will fall on the value 12. This is an accurate reflection of a high-confidence forecast in a stable, slow-moving system over a short period.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated on the current number of 12 members. I estimate a ~98% probability that the number will be 12, with a ~2% chance of a single departure to 11, and a negligible chance of any other outcome. This means that the entire range from the 10th to the 90th percentile falls on the single value of 12.
