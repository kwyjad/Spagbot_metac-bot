### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**
*   **Q1: What are the possible ways Khamenei could cease to be Supreme Leader?** This involves identifying all potential exit scenarios: natural death, health-related incapacitation/resignation, assassination, or internal removal (coup/deposition).
*   **Q2: What is the baseline probability of each exit scenario, absent the current crisis?** This requires establishing a base rate for mortality based on his age and known health, and assessing the historical precedent for other forms of removal for a leader in his position.
*   **Q3: How does the fictional June 2025 war with Israel alter these probabilities?** This involves analyzing the provided source material to assess the credibility and capability behind the assassination threats from Israel and the US.
*   **Q4: What is the state of the Iranian regime's internal stability?** This requires evaluating how the assassinations of top military leaders (Bagheri, Salami) and external pressure might affect the cohesion of the IRGC, the Assembly of Experts, and other power centers.
*   **Q5: What are the key constraints and accelerators on the primary scenarios?** This focuses on the role of the US (Trump's position), the operational capabilities of Israel, and Khamenei's own defensive measures (hiding, succession planning).

**2. Search Queries (Simulated based on general knowledge and provided text):**
*   **Q1/Q2:**
    *   `actuarial life table 86 year old male mortality rate`
    *   `Ali Khamenei health history prostate cancer`
    *   `powers of Iranian Assembly of Experts to remove Supreme Leader`
    *   `history of forced removal of autocratic leaders`
*   **Q3:**
    *   `Israeli Mossad assassination capabilities and history`
    *   `US Executive Order 12333 assassination ban exceptions`
    *   `impact of leadership decapitation strikes on state stability`
    *   `analysis of Trump administration policy towards Iran regime change`
*   **Q4/Q5:**
    *   `Iran Supreme Leader succession process`
    *   `IRGC power structure after Salami and Bagheri`
    *   `internal political factions in Iran 2025`
    *   `Iranian regime response to extreme external pressure`

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**
The analysis reveals two dominant, intertwined pathways for Khamenei ceasing to be leader in 2025: natural causes and assassination. The baseline risk from age (86) and reported health issues is already significant. The fictional June 2025 war dramatically elevates the risk of assassination, transforming it from a tail risk into a primary driver. The successful elimination of Iran's top military command demonstrates that Israel possesses the intelligence and operational capability to strike at the regime's core. The US position, while publicly restraining Israel, is conditional and includes its own threats, making the situation highly volatile. Internal removal remains a less probable but non-zero scenario, potentially triggered by instability following further leadership losses. Khamenei's own reported actions (hiding, planning for succession) confirm that the regime perceives the threat to his life as acute and credible.

**4. Drafting the Research Brief:**
The final brief will be structured according to the required format, integrating these synthesized findings into each section. The focus will be on quantifying where possible (base rates), analyzing the causal mechanisms (drivers), and highlighting the unprecedented nature of the current situation compared to historical norms.

### **Research Brief for Bayesian Forecasting Panel**

**To:** Forecasting Statistician
**From:** Research Desk
**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Subject:** Likelihood of Ali Khamenei Ceasing to be Supreme Leader of Iran in 2025

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Autocratic Leaders Aged 85+:** This class captures the significant risk of natural mortality or health-related incapacitation. Based on US Social Security actuarial tables, an 86-year-old male has an approximate **13% chance of dying within one year**. Given reports of Khamenei's past health issues (e.g., prostate cancer), this can be considered a floor. The annual base rate of leaving office for any reason in this group is likely in the **15-20%** range.
2.  **Heads of State Targeted for Removal by a Capable Adversary:** This class includes leaders like Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi. The base rate of removal/death within a year of being explicitly targeted during active hostilities is very high, potentially **>50%**. However, this class is difficult to define precisely. Iran is a more robust and established state than Iraq (2003) or Libya (2011), but Israel is not a superpower leading a broad coalition.
3.  **Iran's Supreme Leadership Tenure:** There has only been one leadership transition (Khomeini to Khamenei in 1989), which occurred upon Khomeini's death. This gives a base rate of 0% for removal via coup, resignation, or deposition over a ~36-year period, making natural death the only historical precedent.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-06-13** Israel launches a major air campaign, killing IRGC commander Hossein Salami and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri. — ↑ (large) — Demonstrates unprecedented capability and willingness to decapitate Iran's senior military leadership.
*   **2025-06-15** US President Trump reportedly vetoes an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei but issues a public threat that US "patience is wearing thin." — ↓ (moderate) / ↑ (small) — The US acts as a temporary brake but confirms Khamenei is a target and makes US restraint conditional and fragile.
*   **2025-06-19** Israel's Defense Minister states Khamenei "absolutely should not continue to exist." — ↑ (large) — An explicit, high-level declaration of intent to kill Khamenei, removing ambiguity about Israeli objectives.
*   **2025-06-21** Reports emerge that Khamenei is in a bunker and has nominated three potential successors. — ↑ (moderate) — Indicates Khamenei and the regime perceive the threat to his life as immediate and existential, prompting contingency planning.
*   **2025-10-03** CFR report notes the conflict has escalated to direct military exchanges involving the US, which has struck nuclear sites. — ↑ (small) — Confirms the strategic environment is one of sustained, direct, high-stakes conflict, not a limited skirmish.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Targeted Assassination:** Direct action by Israel, with or without tacit US approval. The explicit threats and demonstrated capability make this the most significant driver. (Size: Large)
2.  **Natural Mortality / Health Failure:** Khamenei's advanced age (86) and prior health issues create a high baseline probability of death or incapacitation, which is severely exacerbated by the immense stress of war. (Size: Large)
3.  **Internal Coup / Power Struggle:** The elimination of top IRGC and military leaders could create a power vacuum, destabilize the chain of command, and embolden internal rivals to act against Khamenei, either to seize power or negotiate an end to the conflict. (Size: Small-to-Moderate)
4.  **Regime Collapse:** A combination of military defeat, economic hardship, and popular unrest could lead to a systemic collapse, though this is a slower-moving mechanism unlikely to fully manifest by year-end. (Size: Small)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Explicit and Public Threat:** Unlike most leaders in the "autocrat aged 85+" reference class, Khamenei is under a public, credible, and immediate death threat from a highly capable state actor (Israel).
*   **Demonstrated Vulnerability:** The successful strikes on his top two military commanders within the regime's heartland shatter the perception of invulnerability that typically protects such leaders.
*   **Ambiguous US Position:** The US is simultaneously a shield (vetoing a direct strike "for now") and a sword (issuing its own threats, striking other sites). This strategic ambiguity creates high volatility, unlike a clear US protection or opposition scenario.
*   **Forced Contingency Planning:** Khamenei's reported move to nominate successors under duress is a sign of acute crisis, not the orderly, long-term succession planning typical of stable autocracies.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **15%** (equivalent n≈10) seems reasonable, reflecting the base rate mortality and health risks for an 86-year-old leader.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   ↑ (Large): Explicit Israeli intent to kill Khamenei, moving assassination from a tail risk to a central scenario.
    *   ↑ (Large): Successful decapitation of Iran's top military command, proving intelligence penetration and operational reach.
    *   ↑ (Moderate): Extreme psychological and physical stress of the war, likely accelerating any underlying health decline.
    *   ↓ (Moderate): Conditional US restraint, which serves as the primary factor preventing an immediate assassination attempt.
    *   ↑ (Small): Khamenei's own defensive actions (hiding, succession prep) provide evidence that the regime assesses the threat as critical.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence provides a powerful update. The posterior probability should move substantially upward from the 15% prior, as the risk of assassination now rivals or exceeds the already high risk of natural death.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Renewed Israeli airstrikes in or near Tehran.
    *   US rhetoric shifting to explicitly support or greenlight regime change/leadership removal.
    *   Unusual movements of IRGC units or security forces within Iran, suggesting internal power shifts.
    *   Prolonged absence of Khamenei from public view or credible reports of declining health.
    *   Further successful assassinations of high-ranking Iranian officials.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   A formal ceasefire or de-escalation agreement between Iran and Israel/US.
    *   Unambiguous and unconditional US statements guaranteeing Khamenei's safety.
    *   A healthy-looking Khamenei appearing in public, reasserting control.
    *   Successful Iranian deterrence (e.g., a counter-strike that inflicts significant damage on Israel).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Information Opacity:** All information regarding Khamenei's location, health, and internal regime dynamics will be heavily controlled and subject to disinformation

To forecast the probability of Ali Khamenei ceasing to be the Supreme Leader of Iran in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate for Natural Causes:** Given Khamenei's age of 86, the actuarial life table suggests a 13% chance of mortality within a year. Considering his past health issues, a base rate of 15% for natural causes seems reasonable.
- **Base Rate for Assassination/Forced Removal:** Historical cases of leaders targeted by capable adversaries during active hostilities suggest a high risk, potentially over 50%. However, Iran's robustness as a state and the lack of a broad coalition against it suggest a more conservative estimate. A base rate of 20% for forced removal or assassination is plausible.
- **Combined Base Rate:** Considering both natural and forced removal scenarios, a combined base rate of around 30% is a reasonable starting point.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** Khamenei's age and health issues align with the natural mortality base rate. The explicit targeting by Israel and the volatile geopolitical situation align with the forced removal base rate.
- **Differences:** The current situation is more volatile due to the active conflict and explicit threats, which are not typical for most leaders in the base rate reference class.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Israeli Air Campaign and Assassinations:** The successful strikes on top Iranian military leaders increase the likelihood of Khamenei's removal. Likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
- **US Position:** Trump's veto on assassination provides temporary restraint, but his conditional threats increase volatility. Mixed impact, but overall increases risk.
- **Khamenei's Defensive Measures:** His hiding and succession planning indicate a high perceived threat, increasing the likelihood of removal.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence collectively suggests a strong likelihood ratio favoring the event occurring.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 30% probability translates to odds of 0.43.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence, a likelihood ratio of 3 seems reasonable.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.43 * 3 = 1.29.
- **Posterior Probability:** 1.29 / (1 + 1.29) ≈ 56%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The high volatility and uncertainty in the geopolitical situation warrant caution. The probability should not be too high given the potential for de-escalation.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A ceasefire or diplomatic resolution could significantly reduce the risk. The probability should account for this possibility.
- **Adjustment:** Considering these factors, a slight downward adjustment to account for potential de-escalation is prudent.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for de-escalation, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect a balanced view of the risks and uncertainties.

Final: 50%

# Will Ali Khamenei cease to be supreme leader of Iran in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on appropriate reference classes. Since we're in November 2025 and asking about the remainder of 2025, I'm looking at a roughly 6-week timeframe.

The most relevant reference classes are:
- **Age-based mortality**: Khamenei is 86 years old. The annual mortality rate for an 86-year-old male is approximately 13%. For a 6-week period, this translates to roughly 1.5%.
- **Autocratic leaders under external threat**: Leaders explicitly targeted for removal during active hostilities have historically faced high risks of removal.
- **Iranian Supreme Leadership transitions**: There has only been one transition (Khomeini to Khamenei in 1989), which occurred upon Khomeini's death.

Given these considerations, I'll start with a base rate of approximately 15% annual risk, which translates to roughly 1.7% for the remaining 6 weeks of 2025. However, the extraordinary circumstances described in the background significantly alter this baseline.

**Prior probability: 1.7%** for the 6-week period remaining in 2025.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Khamenei is an elderly autocratic leader with reported health issues
- The Iranian regime has historically been resilient to external pressure
- The Supreme Leader position has strong institutional protection

**Key differences:**
- Khamenei is under explicit, public assassination threats from Israel
- Israel has demonstrated unprecedented capability by successfully eliminating top Iranian military leaders
- The US position is ambiguous, with Trump both restraining Israel but also issuing threats
- Iran is in an active military conflict with Israel, creating extreme stress and vulnerability
- Khamenei is reportedly hiding in a bunker and has nominated potential successors

These differences dramatically increase the risk compared to the base case. The successful elimination of Iran's top military command demonstrates that Israel possesses both the intelligence and operational capability to strike at the regime's core.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Israel's successful assassination of top Iranian military leaders**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If Khamenei ceases to be leader, it's highly likely we would have seen prior successful assassinations of other leaders
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Even if Khamenei remains leader, Israel might still target other officials
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Explicit Israeli statement that Khamenei "absolutely should not continue to exist"**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.95) - Such explicit threats would almost certainly precede an actual removal
- P(E|~H): Low-moderate (~0.2) - These statements could be posturing without follow-through
- Likelihood ratio: ~4.75
- This substantially increases the probability

**Evidence 3: Trump's conditional restraint ("at least not for now")**
- P(E|H): Moderate-high (~0.7) - If Khamenei is removed, such conditional language would likely have preceded it
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.4) - This language is compatible with continued restraint
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.75
- This moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Khamenei hiding in a bunker and naming potential successors**
- P(E|H): High (~0.8) - Such defensive and contingency actions would likely precede a successful removal
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - These are prudent precautions even if he remains in power
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.67
- This significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 5: Limited time remaining in 2025 (6 weeks)**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.15) - If Khamenei is to be removed in 2025, the window is quite narrow
- P(E|~H): Very high (~0.9) - The short timeframe makes continued leadership more likely
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.17
- This substantially decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 1.7% for the 6-week period, I'll update based on the evidence:

Prior odds: 0.017 / 0.983 = 0.0173

Posterior odds after Evidence 1: 0.0173 × 3.0 = 0.0519
Posterior probability: 0.0519 / (1 + 0.0519) = 4.9%

Posterior odds after Evidence 2: 0.0519 × 4.75 = 0.2465
Posterior probability: 0.2465 / (1 + 0.2465) = 19.8%

Posterior odds after Evidence 3: 0.2465 × 1.75 = 0.4314
Posterior probability: 0.4314 / (1 + 0.4314) = 30.1%

Posterior odds after Evidence 4: 0.4314 × 2.67 = 1.1518
Posterior probability: 1.1518 / (1 + 1.1518) = 53.5%

Posterior odds after Evidence 5: 1.1518 × 0.17 = 0.1958
Posterior probability: 0.1958 / (1 + 0.1958) = 16.4%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence:**
- I may be overestimating Israel's willingness to assassinate Khamenei given the potential for massive regional destabilization
- The evidence provided is from a fictional scenario, which may not accurately reflect real-world constraints
- I might be underestimating the protective measures around Khamenei
- The short timeframe (6 weeks) is a significant constraint that I may not be weighing heavily enough

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Israel might prefer to continue targeting military leaders rather than Khamenei himself
- The US could exert stronger pressure against targeting Khamenei directly
- Iran might negotiate a ceasefire that reduces immediate threats to Khamenei
- Khamenei could voluntarily step down to protect himself while maintaining regime stability

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my forecast downward slightly. The short timeframe is particularly constraining, and the risks of targeting Khamenei directly are extremely high. While the situation is volatile, the probability should reflect these constraints.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all evidence and red-teaming my analysis, I believe the probability that Ali Khamenei will cease to be supreme leader of Iran in the remaining weeks of 2025 is approximately 14%.

Final: 14%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The question asks if Ali Khamenei will cease to be the supreme leader of Iran in 2025. The forecast is being made on November 19, 2025. As he is still in power, the question is effectively asking about the probability of this event occurring in the remaining 42 days of the year (from Nov 19 to Dec 31).

The most appropriate base rate is the annual probability that a leader of his profile ceases to hold office for any reason, adjusted for this shorter time frame. The research brief suggests a reference class of autocratic leaders aged 85+, with an annual probability of leaving office (due to death, incapacitation, etc.) of 15-20%. I will use the midpoint of 17.5%.

To find the prior for the 42-day period, I will adjust this annual rate:
Prior P(H) = Annual Rate × (Time Period / 365)
Prior P(H) = 0.175 × (42 / 365) ≈ 0.020
This gives a prior probability of **2%**.
In odds form, this is 0.02 / 0.98, which is approximately 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
*   **Similarities:** The base case of an 86-year-old autocratic leader accurately captures the significant underlying risk of natural death or health-related incapacitation, which Khamenei faces regardless of other circumstances.
*   **Differences:** The current situation deviates dramatically from the base case. Khamenei is not just an elderly leader; he is the leader of a nation in an active, high-intensity (though fictional) war with a highly capable adversary (Israel). This adversary has not only declared its intent to remove him but has also demonstrated its capacity to strike the regime's highest echelons by killing his top military commanders. This transforms the primary risk profile from one dominated by natural causes to one where assassination is a major, if not dominant, factor. The immense stress of this situation also likely multiplies the baseline health risks.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "Khamenei ceases to be leader in the last 42 days of 2025" and ~H be the alternative.

*   **Evidence 1: Successful Israeli decapitation strikes on top Iranian military leaders (Salami, Bagheri) in June.**
    *   P(E1 | H): If Israel intends to and is capable of removing Khamenei, it is highly probable they would first eliminate key deputies to disrupt command and control and prove their reach. This evidence is very consistent with H.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): It's possible for these strikes to occur as part of a broader campaign even if Khamenei himself is not successfully targeted. However, their success makes an attempt on the top leader far more credible.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR) is significantly greater than 1.** This evidence strongly increases the probability of H.

*   **Evidence 2: Explicit public threats against Khamenei's life from Israel's Defense Minister.**
    *   P(E2 | H): If an assassination is planned, public declarations can serve to legitimize the action and apply psychological pressure. This is highly consistent with H.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): Such threats could be mere psychological warfare without a concrete plan to follow through.
    *   **LR is significantly greater than 1.** This evidence removes ambiguity about Israeli intent, making the threat credible, especially when combined with Evidence 1.

*   **Evidence 3: US vetoed a direct strike "for now" but the conflict has since escalated to include direct US strikes on other Iranian targets.**
    *   This is mixed evidence. The initial veto (in June) is a powerful constraint and evidence against H (LR < 1). However, the "for now" conditionality and the subsequent escalation five months later suggest this constraint may have weakened or been removed. The escalation makes it more likely the US would consent to, or turn a blind eye to, a strike on Khamenei.
    *   **Net LR is likely now slightly greater than 1.** The initial downward pressure of the veto has been eroded by time and further escalation.

*   **Evidence 4: The passage of five months (June-November) without a direct attack on Khamenei.**
    *   P(E4 | H): If an attack were imminent, a five-month delay is somewhat surprising, suggesting significant obstacles.
    *   P(E4 | ~H): If no attack is coming, or if the obstacles are insurmountable, this is exactly what we would expect to see.
    *   **LR is less than 1.** This is the strongest piece of evidence against H, suggesting either the US veto is a hard stop, or Khamenei's security is too effective.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
I will use a pathway analysis approach, which is clearer than multiplying LRs here. The two primary, independent-ish pathways for Khamenei to cease being leader in the next 42 days are (A) natural causes/health failure and (B) external action (assassination).

1.  **P(A) - Natural Causes:** My base rate for this period is ~2%. The extreme stress of leading a country during a war where he is personally targeted would severely exacerbate any underlying health conditions. A stress multiplier of 2x to 3x on the baseline mortality risk is conservative.
    *   P(A) ≈ 2% × 2.5 = **5%**

2.  **P(B) - Assassination:** This is the new risk factor. The evidence of Israeli capability and intent is very strong. The main counter-evidence is the US veto and the five-month lull. However, the conflict is described as ongoing and escalating. The probability of a successful assassination is a product of P(Attempt) and P(Success | Attempt). Given the stakes and the short timeframe, let's estimate the chance of a serious attempt in the next 42 days as 15%. Given Mossad's demonstrated success, the probability of success, if an attempt is made, is high, perhaps 70%.
    *   P(B) ≈ P(Attempt) × P(Success) ≈ 0.15 × 0.70 = **10.5%**

3.  **Total Probability:** The total probability is the chance that either of these events occurs.
    *   P(H) = 1 - [ (1 - P(A)) × (1 - P(B)) ]
    *   P(H) = 1 - [ (1 - 0.05) × (1 - 0.105) ]
    *   P(H) = 1 - [ 0.95 × 0.895 ]
    *   P(H) = 1 - 0.85025 ≈ **15%**

The posterior probability is approximately 15%, a significant update from the 2% prior, driven by the extreme circumstances of the fictional war.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of 15% might be too low if the US veto from June is now irrelevant due to the conflict's escalation. If the US has given a green light, the probability of an attempt would be much higher, pushing the final probability towards 20-25%. Conversely, the forecast might be too high. Assassinating a head of state is a monumental step with unpredictable consequences (e.g., full-scale regional war). Israel and the US might see this as a step too far, making the threats a form of coercive psychological warfare. The five-month lull could be strong evidence that this line will not be crossed. A lower forecast of 8-10% would be plausible if one weighs this constraint more heavily.

However, the combination of two distinct and elevated risk factors—severely stressed health and a credible assassination threat—makes a double-digit probability for the remaining 1.5-month period seem appropriate. The 15% figure balances the demonstrated capability and intent against the significant political and operational hurdles.

### Final Forecast
My final assessment combines the significantly elevated risk of natural death due to wartime stress with the new, credible threat of assassination by a capable state actor. While significant constraints remain, the evidence points to a situation of acute and immediate peril for Khamenei.

Final: 15%
