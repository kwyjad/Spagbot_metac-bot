### **Research Plan**

1.  **Identify Core Questions:**
    *   What is the legislative history and success rate of attempts to require women to register for Selective Service, particularly within the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)?
    *   What are the current political dynamics in the House and Senate, specifically within the Armed Services Committees and party leadership, that influence this issue?
    *   What is the status of the FY2025 and the likely trajectory of the FY2026 NDAA, as these are the only two legislative vehicles before the deadline?
    *   Is there a plausible judicial path that could compel this change before 2026, despite the Supreme Court's 2021 deference to Congress?
    *   Who are the key actors and interest groups, and what are their current positions and influence levels?

2.  **Search Queries:**
    *   `"women selective service" NDAA FY2025 status`
    *   `House Armed Services Committee markup FY2025 NDAA "selective service"`
    *   `Senate Armed Services Committee position "women draft registration" 2024`
    *   `"National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System" update`
    *   `conservative opposition women draft registration Congress`
    *   `ACLU position women selective service 2024`
    *   `legislative history women selective service NDAA`

3.  **Information Synthesis:**
    *   The legislative pathway is the only viable one. The Supreme Court explicitly deferred to Congress in 2021.
    *   The primary legislative vehicle is the annual NDAA.
    *   Attempts to include this provision in the FY2022 and FY2023 NDAAs passed through committees but were stripped from the final bills during conference negotiations. The key blocking factor was opposition from a minority of socially conservative Republicans, primarily in the House.
    *   The FY2025 NDAA process is underway. The House version, passed by the Armed Services Committee in May 2024, not only omits the provision to add women but includes a measure to *automatically* register men. This indicates the political energy has shifted away from gender inclusion and towards a different debate over registration mechanics.
    *   The deadline of January 1, 2026, allows for two legislative attempts: the FY2025 NDAA (to be passed late 2024) and the FY2026 NDAA (to be passed late 2025).
    *   The established pattern of failure, combined with the current direction of the FY2025 House bill, suggests the political will to overcome the entrenched opposition is absent.

4.  **Draft Comprehensive Answer:** Based on the synthesis, I will now construct the brief following the required format.

***

### Reference class & base rates
*   **Specific Legislative Provision Attempts:** Provisions to require women to register for Selective Service have been included in committee-approved versions of the NDAA at least twice in recent years (FY2022, FY2023) but have failed to be included in the final enacted law.
    *   **Base Rate:** 0% (0 successes / 2 recent, high-profile attempts).
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the most specific and relevant reference class. It reflects the exact political and procedural hurdles the measure faces. Its limitation is the small sample size.
*   **Controversial Social Policy Riders in Must-Pass Legislation:** The NDAA is a "must-pass" bill, but controversial provisions unrelated to the core funding of the military are often stripped out to ensure passage.
    *   **Base Rate:** 10-20%.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the dynamic where party leadership prioritizes the passage of the main bill over fighting for a divisive amendment. This issue functions as such a rider.
*   **Enactment of National Commission Recommendations:** The proposal stems from the 2020 report by the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service. Such commissions often have their recommendations adopted, but typically over a long period.
    *   **Base Rate:** ~30% within a 5-year window.
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides a more optimistic view, suggesting that expert consensus can eventually translate into law. However, it does not account for the specific, recurring political opposition this issue faces.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2024-05-22] HASC passes FY25 NDAA with automatic male registration. (↓↓) — The House committee not only omitted female registration but moved to a different reform, signaling a strong shift in focus away from this issue.
*   [2022-12-09] Provision to add women is stripped from the final FY23 NDAA. (↓) — Reinforced the pattern of failure from the previous year, showing the conservative opposition remains an effective veto point.
*   [2022-06-27] SASC includes female registration in its version of the FY23 NDAA. (↑) — Showed continued support from Senate defense leadership, but this support was ultimately insufficient.
*   [2021-12-07] Provision is stripped from the final FY22 NDAA. (↓) — The first clear failure after the National Commission report, establishing the political dynamic of committee support being overruled in final negotiations.
*   [2021-06-07] Supreme Court denies cert in *National Coalition for Men v. SSS*. (↓) — Removed immediate judicial pressure on Congress to act, allowing legislators to continue deferring the decision.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Vocal Conservative Opposition (Large ↓):** A determined bloc of socially conservative members, primarily in the House, has successfully blocked this measure by threatening to vote against the entire NDAA, making it too politically costly for leadership to include.
*   **Legislative Inertia / Status Quo Bias (Large ↓):** On a non-urgent, socially divisive issue, the default outcome in a polarized Congress is inaction. It is easier to remove the provision than to fight for it.
*   **Bipartisan Elite Support (Moderate ↑):** Leadership in the Armed Services Committees (e.g., Sen. Jack Reed) and the Department of Defense support the change on grounds of military readiness and gender equality. However, this has proven insufficient to overcome grassroots political opposition.
*   **Low Public Salience (Moderate ↓):** The issue does not command significant public attention. This lack of broad public pressure allows a motivated minority in Congress to exert outsized influence.
*   **Constitutional Pressure (Small ↑):** The legal basis for male-only registration (*Rostker v. Goldberg*, 1981) is widely seen as obsolete since the integration of women into all combat roles. This creates a background pressure for reform but has not triggered action.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Established Pattern of Failure:** Unlike a novel proposal, this measure now has a clear track record of failing at the final hurdle. The political playbook to defeat it is well-established.
*   **Shift in Reform Focus:** The FY2025 House NDAA's focus on *automatic* male registration suggests that key actors are pivoting to a different, less socially contentious Selective Service reform, drawing political oxygen away from the gender-inclusion debate.
*   **Post-2024 Election Uncertainty:** The political composition of Congress in 2025, which will handle the FY2026 NDAA (the last chance before the deadline), is unknown. A significant shift in the balance of power could alter the dynamic, though this is a major uncertainty.
*   **Diminishing Momentum:** The energy from the 2020 National Commission report and the 2021 Supreme Court statement has dissipated after two consecutive legislative failures. The issue now appears stale rather than urgent.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior is warranted, anchored on the specific reference class of 0% success in recent NDAAs. A starting point of ~10% seems reasonable, reflecting that elite support keeps the issue alive. (Equivalent n ≈ 5).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓ Large) Failure in FY22 and FY23 NDAAs establishes a strong pattern of opposition being decisive.
    *   (↓↓ Large) The House FY25 NDAA's pivot to automatic male registration is a powerful new signal that momentum for including women has stalled or reversed.
    *   (↓ Small) Continued deference from the judiciary means no external actor is forcing the issue.

To forecast the probability of women being required to register for US Selective Service before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the success rate of attempts to include women in the Selective Service registration through the NDAA. Historically, this has been 0% (0 successes out of 2 recent attempts).
- **Reasoning:** This base rate is chosen because it directly reflects the legislative process and political dynamics that have repeatedly blocked this provision. The small sample size is a limitation, but it is the most specific reference class available.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation mirrors past attempts where the provision was included in committee versions but removed in final negotiations due to opposition.
- **Differences:** The FY2025 NDAA's focus on automatic male registration indicates a shift in legislative priorities, potentially reducing the likelihood of addressing female registration.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Failure in FY22 and FY23 NDAAs:** The repeated removal of the provision suggests strong opposition. Likelihood ratio: Low likelihood of success given past failures (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).
- **FY2025 NDAA's focus on male registration:** This shift suggests decreased momentum for female registration. Likelihood ratio: Strong evidence against the event (P(E | H) << P(E | ~H)).
- **Judicial deference:** The lack of judicial pressure means Congress is not compelled to act. Likelihood ratio: Slightly decreases probability (P(E | H) < P(E | ~H)).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** Start with a low prior probability of 10% (odds of 1:9).
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The evidence strongly suggests a continuation of the status quo, with significant opposition and a shift in legislative focus.
- **Posterior Odds Calculation:**
  - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio
  - Given the strong evidence against the event, the likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1.
  - Posterior probability remains low, likely decreasing from the prior.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a major political shift post-2024 elections that could change the legislative landscape.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A significant change in public opinion or a major geopolitical event could alter priorities.
- **Rebuttals:** The entrenched opposition and legislative inertia are strong counterarguments to these scenarios.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Given the strong evidence against the event and the established pattern of failure, the probability remains low. Adjusting for potential uncertainties, a final probability of 5% seems reasonable.

Final: 5%

# Will women be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for whether women will be required to register for US Selective Service before 2026.

The most relevant reference class is the recent legislative attempts to include women in Selective Service registration through the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA):
- Provisions to require women to register were included in committee-approved versions of the NDAA at least twice in recent years (FY2022, FY2023)
- Both attempts failed to be included in the final enacted law
- This gives a base rate of 0% (0 successes / 2 attempts)

However, this is a small sample size. Looking at a broader reference class of controversial social policy riders in must-pass legislation like the NDAA, the success rate is approximately 10-20%.

Given the specific history of this issue and the pattern established, I'll use a prior of 10% - acknowledging both the specific failures of this provision and the small possibility that such provisions can sometimes succeed in must-pass legislation.

**Prior probability: 10%**

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The legislative pathway remains the primary viable route, as the Supreme Court explicitly deferred to Congress in 2021
- The NDAA continues to be the most likely vehicle for such a change
- The same political dynamics that blocked previous attempts (conservative opposition) remain in place
- The issue continues to have bipartisan elite support but faces grassroots opposition

**Differences from base case:**
- There is now an established pattern of failure (FY2022, FY2023), making it easier for opponents to block the measure
- The FY2025 House NDAA has shifted focus to automatic male registration rather than including women, suggesting diminishing political will for gender inclusion
- We have only two remaining opportunities before the 2026 deadline: the FY2025 NDAA (late 2024) and the FY2026 NDAA (late 2025)
- The political composition after the 2024 election will affect the FY2026 NDAA, introducing uncertainty

These differences generally suggest a lower probability than the base rate, as momentum appears to be moving away from including women in Selective Service registration.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Established pattern of legislative failure**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect some legislative success or growing momentum, not repeated failures. Probability: 0.2
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, repeated legislative failures are exactly what we'd expect. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: FY2025 NDAA focus on automatic male registration**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register soon, we would expect continued focus on this issue, not a pivot to a different reform. Probability: 0.3
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, a pivot to a different reform makes sense. Probability: 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Continued bipartisan elite support**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, we would expect continued elite support. Probability: 0.9
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, we might still see elite support that fails to translate into law. Probability: 0.6
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.6 = 1.5
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Supreme Court's deference to Congress**
- P(E|H): If women will be required to register, the Court's deference allows Congress to act. Probability: 0.7
- P(E|~H): If women will not be required to register, the Court's deference removes judicial pressure to act. Probability: 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.9 = 0.78
- This evidence slightly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with the prior probability of 10% (odds of 1:9), I'll update based on the evidence:

**Update based on Evidence 1 (established pattern of failure):**
- Prior odds: 1:9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.22
- Posterior odds: 1:9 × 0.22 = 0.22:9 = 1:40.9
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+40.9) ≈ 2.4%

**Update based on Evidence 2 (FY2025 NDAA focus shift):**
- Prior odds: 1:40.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 1:40.9 × 0.375 = 0.375:40.9 = 1:109.1
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+109.1) ≈ 0.9%

**Update based on Evidence 3 (continued elite support):**
- Prior odds: 1:109.1
- Likelihood ratio: 1.5
- Posterior odds: 1:109.1 × 1.5 = 1.5:109.1 = 1:72.7
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+72.7) ≈ 1.4%

**Update based on Evidence 4 (Supreme Court deference):**
- Prior odds: 1:72.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.78
- Posterior odds: 1:72.7 × 0.78 = 0.78:72.7 = 1:93.2
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+93.2) ≈ 1.1%

After considering all the evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 1.1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting recent failures and underestimating the possibility of political change after the 2024 election
- The National Commission's recommendation still carries weight and could gain renewed attention
- There could be external events (e.g., international conflicts) that suddenly make military readiness a higher priority, increasing pressure to expand the registration pool

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A significant shift in Congress after the 2024 election could change the political dynamics
- A new Supreme Court case could emerge that doesn't defer to Congress
- Public opinion could shift dramatically on gender equality in military service

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might put the probability at 5-10%, arguing that:
- Two legislative attempts is a small sample size
- The bipartisan elite support could eventually overcome opposition
- The constitutional pressure for gender equality in military obligations remains

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, they don't overcome the established pattern and current trajectory:
- The opposition has proven effective and has a clear playbook
- The FY2025 NDAA's focus on automatic male registration shows diminishing momentum for including women
- With only two legislative opportunities remaining before 2026, the window is narrowing

**Adjustment:**
Given these considerations, I'll slightly increase my forecast from 1.1% to 2% to account for the possibility of unexpected political shifts or external events that could change the dynamics.

## 6. Final Forecast

Final: 2%

Here is a step-by-step probabilistic forecast using Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most relevant reference class is the success rate of this specific legislative provision in recent years. The proposal to require women to register for Selective Service has been a serious contender in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 and FY2023. In both instances, the provision was approved by the relevant Senate committee but was ultimately stripped from the final bill passed by Congress.

*   **Reference Class:** Attempts to include female Selective Service registration in the final version of the NDAA.
*   **Data:** 0 successes in 2 high-profile attempts.
*   **Base Rate:** A raw base rate of 0% is too extreme. A more conservative approach is to use a broader reference class, such as "controversial social policy riders in must-pass legislation." These often have a low success rate, perhaps in the 10-20% range, as party leadership prioritizes passing the main bill.

Given the specific history of failure, I will select a pessimistic prior at the low end of this broader range.
*   **Initial Prior (P(H)): 10%**. This acknowledges that the proposal has high-level support and is a recurring issue, but faces significant, proven opposition. In odds form, this is 1-to-9 against.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to the previous attempts in that the legislative vehicle (NDAA) and the political polarization are the same. However, there are key differences that make passage even less likely now:

*   **Established Pattern of Failure:** The political playbook to defeat this measure is now well-established and proven effective. Opponents know they can force its removal during final negotiations.
*   **Waning Momentum:** The energy from the 2020 National Commission report and the 2021 Supreme Court statement has dissipated after two consecutive legislative defeats.
*   **Shift in Focus:** The House Armed Services Committee's (HASC) FY2025 bill includes a provision for *automatic male registration*. This indicates that key actors are pivoting to a different, less controversial reform, drawing political attention and capital away from the gender-inclusion debate.

These differences suggest the probability of success is now lower than the initial 10% base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event that women are required to register before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: Failure in FY2022 and FY2023 NDAAs.**
    *   This pattern of failure is much more likely if the proposal is ultimately doomed (P(E|~H) is high) than if it is on a path to success (P(E|H) is low).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<< 1). This evidence significantly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The HASC FY2025 NDAA pivots to automatic male registration.**
    *   This is a powerful new piece of evidence. It is highly unlikely that proponents would shift focus to a different reform if they believed they could succeed in adding women (low P(E|H)). It is very likely they would seek an alternative if they considered the gender-inclusion effort politically blocked (high P(E|~H)).
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1 (<< 1). This evidence provides a strong downward update.

*   **Evidence 3: Continued support from defense leadership (e.g., Senate Armed Services Committee).**
    *   This support is a necessary condition for success, so P(E|H) is high. However, we have already seen that this support is insufficient to overcome the opposition, so P(E|~H) is also reasonably high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Slightly greater than 1 (> 1). This is weak evidence in favor, essentially preventing the probability from dropping to zero.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with a prior of 10% (1-to-9 odds against).

The evidence of repeated failures and, most importantly, the recent pivot in the House bill, are strong indicators against success. The path through the current Congress for the FY2025 NDAA is effectively blocked.

The only remaining plausible path is through the FY2026 NDAA, which will be debated in 2025 after the 2024 elections. Success is therefore contingent on a significant political realignment.

Let's model this as a conditional probability:
P(Success) = P(Favorable Political Change) × P(Passage | Favorable Change)

1.  **P(Favorable Political Change):** This would likely require Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives and maintain control of the Senate. Current election forecasts view this as possible but far from certain. A reasonable estimate is around **40%**.
2.  **P(Passage | Favorable Change):** Even with a Democratic-controlled Congress, passage is not guaranteed. The issue is not a top priority for the party, and leadership may not want to spend political capital on a divisive issue with low public salience, especially when they have other major legislative goals. The momentum is gone. Let's estimate the probability of them prioritizing and passing this at **15%**.

*   **Posterior Probability ≈ 40% × 15% = 6%**

This calculation integrates the prior assumption (low chance of success) with the evidence (the only path forward is a political shift, which is itself uncertain and doesn't guarantee success).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast of 6% is low, but is it too low? A major international crisis could scramble all political calculations and create an urgent push for expanding the draft pool. This is a tail risk that could lead to a surprise "Yes" resolution. Alternatively, is the forecast too high? The bipartisan, cross-ideological opposition (social conservatives who oppose women in combat roles, and some anti-war progressives who oppose expanding the draft system at all) may be more resilient than I assume, making passage nearly impossible even under a Democratic-controlled government. The pivot to automatic male registration may have permanently taken the wind out of the sails of this specific reform. On balance, the 6% figure seems to correctly weigh the very narrow path to success against the powerful forces of the status quo.

### 6. Final Forecast

The combination of a low base rate, a consistent pattern of legislative failure, and a recent shift in focus away from the issue by key congressional actors strongly suggests a low probability of success. The only viable path requires a specific outcome in the 2024 election, and even then, the issue would need to become a priority for a new Congress, which is unlikely.

Final: 6%
