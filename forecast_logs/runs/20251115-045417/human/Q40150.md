### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New, limited, unilateral US military strikes against a sovereign state.** This class includes actions like the 2017 and 2018 strikes on Syria or the 1998 strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan. These are rare events, typically occurring in response to a perceived egregious act (chemical weapons use, terrorist attacks) and against adversarial or pariah states. The base rate is very low, perhaps 1-2 such *new* interventions per presidential term, making the probability in any given 45-day window extremely low, likely **<0.5%**.
2.  **US military operations in Sub-Saharan Africa.** This class includes drone strikes, special forces raids, and advisory missions. Operations are common in countries like Somalia, but are almost always conducted with at least the tacit consent of the host government against non-state actors (al-Shabaab, ISIS affiliates). A unilateral strike against the wishes of a major partner like Nigeria is unprecedented. The base rate for a *cooperative* operation is high, but for a *unilateral attack* it is near **0%**.
3.  **Public presidential threats of military action followed by action.** Presidents often use threats as a diplomatic tool. The follow-through rate is low, especially when the threat is made publicly and institutional/allied opposition is high. The base rate of a public threat against a non-adversary leading to kinetic action within two months is likely very low, estimated at **<5%**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   [2025-11-12] Unnamed Pentagon officials reportedly express deep reservations about potential military action, citing risks to regional stability and ongoing counter-terrorism partnerships. (↓) — Signals significant institutional friction and resistance to the President's directive, a key brake on action.
*   [2025-11-08] The Nigerian government publicly condemns Trump's statements as "a grave accusation and a threat to our national sovereignty," while also announcing a new security initiative for the Middle Belt region. (↓) — Nigeria is attempting a dual-track response: public defiance mixed with a domestic action that could serve as a diplomatic off-ramp for the US.
*   [2025-11-01] CNN reports President Trump has ordered the Department of Defense to "prepare for possible action" in Nigeria, lending operational weight to his public threats. (↑) — Moves the threat from pure rhetoric towards the planning stage, making it more credible.
*   [2025-10-31] President Trump threatens military action on Truth Social and halts aid to Nigeria, citing the persecution of Christians and re-designating Nigeria as a "Country of Particular Concern." (↑) — This is the primary catalyst, establishing a public commitment and political justification for a potential strike.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Presidential Volition & Domestic Politics (Large ↑):** The primary driver is President Trump's personal commitment, impulsiveness, and desire to deliver for his evangelical base. His public statements create a political cost for inaction, making a symbolic strike more likely.
2.  **Institutional Drag & Bureaucratic Resistance (Large ↓):** The Department of Defense, State Department, and intelligence agencies would likely view a unilateral strike on Nigeria as catastrophic for US interests in Africa. They would resist, slow-roll planning, and present prohibitive risk assessments, acting as a powerful brake.
3.  **Operational Feasibility (Moderate ↑):** US Africa Command (AFRICOM) has the assets (drones, special operations forces) in the region to conduct a limited strike (e.g., against a Boko Haram or bandit camp) relatively quickly. The logistical capability exists.
4.  **Geopolitical & Diplomatic Fallout (Large ↓):** Nigeria is a continental power and a linchpin of West African stability. A US attack would shatter the US-Nigeria relationship, end counter-terrorism cooperation, alienate the African Union, and be condemned by most US allies. This high cost would be a major deterrent.
5.  **Availability of a "Face-Saving" Off-Ramp (Moderate ↓):** If the Nigerian government takes credible, highly-publicized steps to improve security in the affected regions, it could provide the White House with a "win" to declare victory and stand down without losing face.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Target is a Partner, Not a Pariah:** Unlike Syria, Sudan, or Houthi-controlled Yemen, Nigeria is a major strategic partner, Africa's largest economy, and a democracy. Unilaterally striking such a nation is a radical departure from post-WWII US foreign policy.
*   **Public Threat Precedes Planning:** The threat was made publicly on social media before, or concurrent with, any formal military planning. This is highly irregular and suggests a decision driven by political performance rather than a deliberate national security process.
*   **Justification is R2P-style, not Direct Threat:** The stated rationale is the protection of a religious minority, not a direct threat to US personnel or national security. While the US has engaged in humanitarian interventions, a unilateral strike on these grounds is rare and legally tenuous.
*   **Extreme Time Compression:** The public threat and the short timeline (to Jan 1, 2026) create immense pressure. The normal, months-long process of intelligence gathering, target vetting, and diplomatic signaling is being bypassed, increasing both the likelihood of an impulsive decision and the risk of error.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior is low, around **2%**, reflecting the extreme rarity of the US initiating unprovoked military action against a large, non-hostile partner nation. (Equivalent n of ~50).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) Trump's direct, public threat and order to the DoD is a powerful signal of intent from the ultimate decision-maker, overcoming the low base rate.
    *   (↓ Large) The immense strategic cost and likely fierce resistance from the national security bureaucracy represent a formidable barrier to execution.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Nigeria's dual response of condemnation and domestic action provides a potential off-ramp, reducing the political necessity for a strike.
    *   (↑ Small) The operational capacity of AFRICOM makes a limited strike technically feasible on a short timeline.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence dramatically increases the probability from the near-zero base rate. The President's direct intent is a very strong signal. However, the powerful structural constraints are likely to prevent a major operation. The update should be significantly upward, but the probability should remain low, likely settling in the **10-15% range**, reflecting the chance of a limited, symbolic strike overcoming institutional friction.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Movement of US military assets (e.g., ISR drones, naval assets) towards West Africa.
    *   State Department issuing a travel advisory or ordering the evacuation of non-essential personnel from the US Embassy in Abuja.
    *   Leaks of specific target packages being prepared by the Pentagon (e.g., ISWAP training camps).
    *   Escalation of Trump's rhetoric, specifying a deadline or "red line."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   High-level diplomatic engagement (e.g., a visit by the Secretary of State to Abuja).
    *   Public statements of concern or opposition from key allies (UK, France) or senior Congressional Republicans.
    *   The Nigerian military launching a well-publicized, successful offensive against extremist groups.
    *   President Trump's public attention shifts to a different domestic or international issue.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Attack":** The resolution criteria are broad. A single drone strike on a remote extremist camp, even if symbolic, would resolve this "Yes." This is far more plausible than a major raid or bombing campaign.
*   **Unpredictability of Key Actor:** President Trump's decision-making is highly personalized and can defy traditional models of statecraft. He may be bluffing for leverage, or he may be determined to act regardless of advice.
*   **The "Wag the Dog" Scenario:** The President could use a limited, "successful" strike to distract from domestic problems or to demonstrate strength, increasing the odds beyond a purely strategic calculation.
*   **Intelligence Gaps:** We have no visibility into the private conversations between the President, the National Security Advisor, and the Pentagon. The strength of the institutional resistance is an estimate.
*   **Accidental Escalation:** A US operation intended to be limited could go wrong, leading to Nigerian military casualties and a much larger crisis, though this would not affect the binary resolution.

**Final Research Summary:** The President's public threat has substantially raised the probability of a US military strike in Nigeria from a near-zero base rate. However, the immense diplomatic and strategic costs, coupled with strong institutional resistance, make a strike unlikely, though a limited, symbolic action remains a distinct possibility given the President's political motivations and the short timeline.

To forecast the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for a new, unilateral US military strike against a sovereign state like Nigeria is extremely low. Historically, such actions are rare and typically occur in response to significant provocations or threats. Given the reference class of new, limited, unilateral US military strikes, the base rate is likely less than 0.5% in any given short timeframe. However, considering the specific context of Trump's presidency and his past actions, a slightly higher base rate of around 2% is reasonable, reflecting the potential for impulsive decisions.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves a public threat of military action, which is a common precursor to military interventions. The operational capability for a limited strike exists.
- **Differences:** Nigeria is a strategic partner, not an adversary, and the justification is based on humanitarian grounds rather than direct threats to US security. The public nature of the threat and the short timeline are unusual, suggesting a politically motivated rather than strategically driven decision.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Trump's Public Threat and DoD Order (↑):** This is a strong indicator of intent, increasing the likelihood of action. Likelihood ratio significantly greater than 1.
- **Institutional Resistance (↓):** Strong opposition from the Pentagon and other agencies decreases the likelihood of action. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **Nigeria's Dual Response (↓):** Provides a diplomatic off-ramp, reducing the necessity for military action. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Operational Feasibility (↑):** AFRICOM's capability to conduct a limited strike increases feasibility. Likelihood ratio slightly greater than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 2% probability translates to odds of 0.02 / 0.98 ≈ 0.0204.
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, a rough composite likelihood ratio might be around 0.5, reflecting the strong institutional resistance and diplomatic costs.
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.0204 × 0.5 = 0.0102.
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.0102 / (1 + 0.0102) ≈ 1.01%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the impulsiveness of the decision-making process. However, the institutional and diplomatic barriers are substantial.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A symbolic strike could occur if domestic political pressures increase or if Nigeria fails to take visible action against extremists.
- **Rebuttals:** The strategic costs and institutional resistance are likely to prevail, making a strike unlikely.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential for impulsive decision-making, the probability of the US conducting a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 is low but not negligible. The final calibrated probability is:

Final: 5%

# Will the US conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for the US conducting a military attack within a sovereign nation like Nigeria.

The most relevant reference class is: **US unilateral military strikes against sovereign nations with which the US is not in an active conflict**. Looking at historical data:

- The US has conducted limited strikes against Syria (2017, 2018)
- Strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan (1998)
- Libya (2011, though with NATO)
- Yemen (against AQAP and Houthis, though with some consent)

Nigeria is a democratic partner nation, not a pariah state or adversary. The US has rarely, if ever, conducted military strikes against established partner nations.

**Prior probability**: Approximately 2-3%. This reflects the extreme rarity of the US initiating unprovoked military action against a large, non-hostile partner nation, especially in Africa where the US typically operates with host nation consent.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- The US has military capabilities in the region (AFRICOM)
- There are terrorist/extremist groups operating in Nigeria that the US opposes
- The US has previously conducted limited strikes against terrorist groups in Africa

**Key differences**:
- Nigeria is a major strategic partner, Africa's largest economy, and a democracy
- The threat was made publicly before formal military planning
- The justification is protection of Christians, not direct US security interests
- The timeline is extremely compressed (weeks, not months)
- The threat comes from a president known for impulsive decisions and strong rhetoric

These differences significantly alter the probability, as they represent a major departure from historical US foreign policy patterns.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Trump's direct threat and order to DoD**
- P(E|H): Very high (~0.9) - If the US were planning to attack, such a public threat would be likely
- P(E|~H): Moderate (~0.3) - Trump has made threats without follow-through before
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0
- This evidence significantly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Institutional resistance from Pentagon**
- P(E|H): Low (~0.2) - If an attack were imminent, we'd expect less public resistance
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - Strong institutional resistance is expected when no attack is planned
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.25
- This evidence decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Nigeria's dual-track response (condemnation + security initiative)**
- P(E|H): Moderate (~0.5) - Such a response could occur regardless
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This response creates a diplomatic off-ramp
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.625
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: Operational feasibility via AFRICOM**
- P(E|H): High (~0.9) - An attack would require this capability
- P(E|~H): High (~0.8) - This capability exists regardless
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.125
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2% / 98% = 0.0204

First update (Trump's threat):
Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 3.0 = 0.0612
Posterior probability = 0.0612 / (1 + 0.0612) ≈ 5.8%

Second update (Pentagon resistance):
Posterior odds = 0.0612 × 0.25 = 0.0153
Posterior probability = 0.0153 / (1 + 0.0153) ≈ 1.5%

Third update (Nigeria's response):
Posterior odds = 0.0153 × 0.625 = 0.0096
Posterior probability = 0.0096 / (1 + 0.0096) ≈ 0.95%

Fourth update (Operational feasibility):
Posterior odds = 0.0096 × 1.125 = 0.0108
Posterior probability = 0.0108 / (1 + 0.0108) ≈ 1.1%

However, I need to consider that the President has ultimate authority as Commander-in-Chief, and his personal intent is a very strong signal that may override institutional resistance. This suggests I should adjust upward from the mechanical calculation.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots in my analysis**:
- I may be underestimating Trump's willingness to act unilaterally against institutional advice
- The "wag the dog" scenario: Trump might use a limited strike to distract from domestic issues
- The threshold for "attack" is low - even a single drone strike would count as "Yes"
- Historical precedent may be less relevant with this particular administration

**Alternative forecast**:
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 10-15%, arguing that:
1. Trump has demonstrated willingness to order strikes (Syria)
2. The political benefits with his evangelical base could be substantial
3. A limited, symbolic strike against an extremist target could be framed as "helping Nigeria"
4. The institutional barriers might be overcome by a determined Commander-in-Chief

**Rebuttal to alternative**:
The costs of attacking Nigeria are orders of magnitude higher than Syria:
1. Would destroy US-Africa relations broadly
2. Would end counter-terrorism cooperation across the Sahel
3. Would be condemned by virtually all US allies
4. Would likely face significant legal challenges domestically

After considering these points, I believe my forecast should be adjusted upward somewhat, but remain low.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence, the base rate, the unique circumstances, and potential blind spots, I assess the probability that the US will conduct a military attack within Nigeria before 2026 at 8%.

This reflects:
- The extremely low base rate for attacks on partner nations
- The significant institutional resistance
- The high diplomatic and strategic costs
- The President's demonstrated intent and authority
- The possibility of a limited, symbolic strike
- The short timeline (approximately 6 weeks remaining in 2025)

Final: 8%

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is a US military attack within the territory of Nigeria, a large, democratic, strategic partner. The most appropriate reference class is "new, unilateral US military strikes against a sovereign state that is not an active adversary."

Historically, this is an extremely rare event. While the US has conducted numerous military operations, they are typically against declared adversaries (e.g., Syria, Iraq), non-state actors in ungoverned spaces (e.g., Somalia, Yemen), or with the consent of the host government. A unilateral strike on a major partner like Nigeria is nearly unprecedented in the post-Cold War era.

Based on this, the prior probability is very low. I will set the base rate at **2%**. This acknowledges that such an event is not impossible but is a radical departure from standard US foreign policy. In odds form, this is 1:49.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case in several critical ways:

*   **The Target:** Unlike typical targets (Syria, Sudan, etc.), Nigeria is a major partner, Africa's largest economy, and a democracy. This dramatically increases the diplomatic and strategic costs of an attack, making it *less* likely than the base case.
*   **The Decision-Maker:** The President is Donald Trump, whose decision-making is known to be less constrained by traditional foreign policy norms, more impulsive, and highly sensitive to his domestic political base (in this case, evangelicals concerned about the persecution of Christians). This makes an unconventional action *more* likely than with a different president.
*   **The Justification:** The rationale is humanitarian (protecting Christians), not a direct threat to US national security. This provides a powerful domestic political justification but is weaker in terms of international law and building institutional consensus.
*   **The Public Commitment:** The threat was made publicly and forcefully on social media. This creates a "commitment trap" where the President may feel political pressure to act to avoid looking weak, increasing the odds of at least a symbolic strike.

The conflict between the unprecedented nature of the target and the unique nature of the decision-maker is the central tension of this forecast.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence provided:

*   **Evidence 1 (For): President Trump's public threat and order to the DoD to "prepare for possible action."**
    *   This is the single most important piece of evidence. A direct order from the Commander-in-Chief moves the situation from rhetoric to operational planning.
    *   P(E | H): If an attack were to happen, a preceding order to prepare is virtually certain.
    *   P(E | ~H): If an attack were not to happen, could the President still issue such an order for political posturing? Yes, but an explicit order to the DoD is a significant step beyond mere threats.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors H (the event happening). This evidence dramatically increases the probability from the low base rate.

*   **Evidence 2 (Against): Pentagon officials expressing "deep reservations."**
    *   This signals significant institutional friction. The national security bureaucracy sees this as a strategically disastrous idea.
    *   P(E | H): An attack could still happen *despite* these reservations if the President overrules them.
    *   P(E | ~H): These reservations are a primary causal mechanism for the attack *not* happening.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Favors ~H (the event not happening). This acts as a powerful brake on the President's intent.

*   **Evidence 3 (Against): Nigeria's dual-track response (condemnation + new security initiative).**
    *   By taking domestic action, Nigeria is providing the US with a "diplomatic off-ramp." President Trump can claim his threat "worked" and that his pressure forced the Nigerian government to act, allowing him to declare victory without launching a risky military strike.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** Favors ~H. This reduces the political necessity for the US to follow through on the threat.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 2% (odds of 1:49), I will update based on the evidence.

1.  **Prior:** P(H) = 2% (Odds ≈ 1:49)
2.  **Update with Trump's Order:** The evidence of a direct presidential threat and order is extremely strong. This is not just noise; it's a signal of intent from the ultimate authority. This warrants a large update, moving the odds significantly. A likelihood ratio of ~5-10 seems appropriate. Let's use a factor of 7.
    *   New Odds ≈ 1:49 × 7 = 7:49 = 1:7
    *   New Probability ≈ 1 / (1 + 7) = 1/8 = 12.5%
3.  **Update with Countervailing Evidence:** The combined force of institutional resistance (Pentagon) and the diplomatic off-ramp (Nigeria's response) pushes back strongly. This evidence makes the "no attack" scenario more likely. I'll apply a combined likelihood ratio of ~0.5 to the updated odds.
    *   Final Odds ≈ 1:7 × 0.5 = 0.5:7 = 1:14
    *   **Final Probability** ≈ 1 / (1 + 14) = 1/15 ≈ 6.7%

My initial calculation leads to ~7%. However, the definition of "attack" is broad and could include a single, symbolic drone strike. Such a limited action is easier for a President to force through against bureaucratic resistance than a major campaign. The "Wag the Dog" scenario, where a strike is used for domestic political gain, is also a real possibility with this particular President. Therefore, I believe my quantitative update might be too conservative and underweights the President's ability to force a limited action. I will adjust my final probability upward to account for this.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The biggest risk of my forecast being wrong is underestimating President Trump's willingness to defy his advisors and norms to satisfy his political base. The entire national security establishment could advise against it, but if he perceives a political win from a "punitive" strike, he might order it anyway. The Soleimani strike is a relevant, albeit imperfect, precedent. Conversely, I might be taking the rhetoric too seriously. This could be pure political theater, and the President has no real intention of acting, making the true probability closer to the base rate.

The most plausible path to "Yes" is a limited, symbolic drone strike against a known terrorist group like Boko Haram or ISWAP. This would allow the White House to claim it took action against "Islamic Terrorists" killing Christians, fulfilling the promise to Trump's base while creating a veneer of a counter-terrorism operation. This path of least resistance makes the "Yes" case more plausible than a direct confrontation with the Nigerian state.

Considering these factors, I will adjust my final forecast slightly higher than my calculation, settling in the low double digits. This balances the extremely low base rate and strong institutional opposition against the powerful and unpredictable will of the President.

### Final Forecast
My final assessment balances the very low prior probability of such an unprecedented military action against the strong evidence of presidential intent. The powerful institutional and diplomatic counter-pressures make an attack unlikely. However, the President's known impulsiveness and the political appeal of a symbolic strike create a non-trivial risk.

Final: 12%
