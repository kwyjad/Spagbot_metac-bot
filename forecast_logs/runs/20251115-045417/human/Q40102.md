### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New, Politically-Contentious Government Programs:** Such programs often face significant initial friction, including administrative delays, IT system failures, legal challenges, and political opposition. The initial rollout phase typically sees very low throughput compared to stated goals. The base rate for success in the first 3-6 months is low, with output often being <10% of the annualized target rate. For this scheme, the "target" is implicitly the number of crossings, which is in the tens of thousands per year, suggesting a target of thousands per month. A base rate of <10% of this would be in the low hundreds per month.
2.  **International Returns/Resettlement Agreements:** Schemes like the EU-Turkey deal (2016) or other bilateral return agreements are a relevant class. These are notoriously difficult to implement. The EU-Turkey deal, for example, saw very few returns relative to arrivals in its initial months due to legal appeals in Greece and logistical hurdles. The base rate for these schemes is a slow, legally-contested start, with numbers in the dozens or low hundreds over the first quarter of operation.
3.  **Extrapolation from Initial Program Data:** This is the most specific, but also the most volatile, reference class. The program admitted its first people around late September 2025.
    *   Sep 24: 3 people
    *   Oct 9: 18 people (15 new people in 15 days ≈ 1.0 person/day)
    *   Oct 24: 23 people (5 new people in 15 days ≈ 0.33 people/day)
    This suggests a very low, and potentially decelerating, rate of admissions. Extrapolating this rate (~0.5 people/day) from Oct 24 to Dec 31 (68 days) would yield approximately 34 more people, for a total of around **50-60**.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-08-04** UK-France treaty ratified and comes into force. — (→) Establishes the legal basis for the program, but implementation is the key variable.
*   **2025-09-10** Reports of multiple deaths in the Channel. — (↑) Increases political pressure on the UK government to demonstrate its new policy is working, potentially accelerating efforts.
*   **2025-09-24** First family of three admitted under the scheme. — (→) Confirms the program is operational, but the number is nominal. Sets a low initial baseline.
*   **2025-10-09** Total admissions reach 18 people. — (↓) Establishes a low rate of ~1 person/day. Far below the rate of Channel crossings, indicating major bottlenecks.
*   **2025-10-24** Total admissions reach 23 people; RFI reports criticism is mounting. — (↓) The rate of admissions appears to be slowing, and negative press suggests the program is failing to deter crossings or operate smoothly.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **The "One-In, One-Out" Linkage (Large):** This is the master mechanism. The number of admissions is strictly capped by the number of successful returns to France. Returns are legally complex, face individual appeals, and require French operational consent for each case. This creates a severe bottleneck, driving the number of admissions down.
2.  **Administrative Capacity (UK & France) (Large):** Both the UK Home Office and French authorities must process two sets of people: the returnees and the new online applicants. This dual administrative burden on a new, untested system is a major driver of low numbers.
3.  **Legal Challenges (Moderate/Large):** Any attempt to return an individual to France is likely to be met with legal challenges in UK courts. A single successful injunction could pause the entire returns process, thereby halting all new admissions under the scheme.
4.  **Political Will & Cooperation (Moderate):** The UK government is highly motivated for the scheme to appear successful. However, French cooperation may be less enthusiastic, especially if the scheme creates political problems for them or is seen as ineffective. Waning French cooperation would directly throttle the rate of returns and thus admissions.
5.  **Rate of Channel Crossings (Small):** While a high number of crossings (as seen in 2025) creates a large pool of *potential* individuals for return, this has little effect on the final number if the return mechanism itself is blocked. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Contingent on Returns, Not Just Resettlement:** Unlike standard refugee resettlement programs (e.g., for Syrians, Ukrainians), this scheme's intake is not driven by a humanitarian target but is a direct consequence of a legally fraught enforcement action (returns). This makes it inherently slower and more prone to failure.
*   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** The forecast is for the end of 2025, only ~4.5 months after the program's inception. Base rate programs often take 6-12 months to overcome initial hurdles; this program has no time to ramp up before the resolution date.
*   **High Political Salience:** The policy is a cornerstone of the current UK government's immigration strategy. This creates immense pressure to produce results, but can also lead to rushed implementation and attract intense legal and media scrutiny, which can paradoxically slow it down.
*   **Bilateral Dependency:** The program's success depends entirely on day-to-day cooperation with another sovereign government (France), which has its own domestic political pressures. This is a significant point of failure compared to a unilateral UK resettlement scheme.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior centered around **75-150 people** could be established based on a conservative view of a new government program's initial quarterly output, acknowledging the high political pressure to make it work. Equivalent n: low, perhaps n=5, reflecting high uncertainty.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The "one-in, one-out" mechanism is a structural bottleneck, as returns are far more difficult than resettlement.
    *   (↓ Large) The initial data from Sep-Oct shows a very low rate (~0.5-1.0 person/day) that is *decelerating*, not accelerating.
    *   (↓ Moderate) Reports of mounting criticism and lack of deterrent effect suggest the program is not functioning as intended, which may reduce political/operational momentum.
    *   (↑ Small) The record-high number of Channel crossings provides a large pool of candidates, but this is a weak factor given the return bottleneck.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly contradicts an optimistic prior. The posterior should be revised **sharply downwards**, with the median likely falling below 100 and the probability mass concentrating in the low double digits (e.g., 40-80).

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official UK/French government announcement of the first large-scale return operation (e.g., a flight with >20 people).
    *   Weekly admission numbers (if reported) showing a sustained acceleration (e.g., >10 people per week).
    *   A UK High Court ruling that dismisses a legal challenge to the returns policy, setting a favorable precedent.
    *   Joint press conference by UK and French interior ministers reaffirming commitment and announcing streamlined processes.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Media reports of a successful legal challenge that places an injunction on all returns to France.
    *   Weeks passing with no new admission numbers reported by the media or government.
    *   Public statements from French officials criticizing the deal or refusing to accept returns.
    *   UK government officials beginning to downplay the scheme's immediate impact in public statements.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Data Opacity:** The key metric—the number of people successfully returned to France—is not being publicly reported. The forecast relies on the lagging indicator of admissions.
*   **Definitional Ambiguity:** The resolution is "received visas." This may not be the same as "arrived in the UK." A batch of visas could be approved on Dec 31st, resolving the question high, even if no one has traveled.
*   **Political Manipulation:** With a short deadline and high political stakes, the UK government could try to process a large batch of applications in the last weeks of December to generate a "success" headline, leading to a non-linear spike.
*   **Lumpiness of Data:** People may be admitted in batches rather than a steady stream. A single flight could dramatically change the total, making linear extrapolation risky.
*   **Source Reliability:** The data comes from sporadic media reports, not a consistent, official statistical release, making it prone to error or reporting lags.

**Final Research Summary:** The program's design, which links admissions to the legally and logistically difficult process of returning migrants, acts as a severe structural bottleneck. Early data confirms this, showing a very low and decelerating rate of admissions, suggesting the final number for 2025 will be in the low double digits.

To forecast the number of people who will be admitted to the UK under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for this forecast is informed by the performance of new, politically contentious government programs and international resettlement agreements. These programs typically face significant initial friction, resulting in low throughput compared to stated goals. The EU-Turkey deal and similar agreements suggest a slow start, with numbers in the dozens or low hundreds over the first quarter. Given the current admissions data, a base rate centered around 75-150 people for the initial months is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation aligns with the base case in terms of the slow start and legal complexities. However, the "one-in, one-out" mechanism is a unique bottleneck, making the situation more constrained than typical resettlement programs. The high political pressure for success could push numbers slightly higher, but the structural and legal challenges are significant.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **"One-In, One-Out" Mechanism:** This structural bottleneck makes higher outcomes less likely. (↓ Large)
- **Initial Data:** The low and decelerating rate of admissions suggests a downward adjustment. (↓ Large)
- **Political Pressure:** While there is pressure to succeed, the mounting criticism and lack of deterrent effect suggest operational challenges. (↓ Moderate)
- **High Channel Crossings:** Provides a large pool of candidates but is limited by the return bottleneck. (↑ Small)

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Starting with a prior centered around 75-150 people, the evidence strongly suggests a downward revision. The "one-in, one-out" mechanism and initial data indicate a much lower rate of admissions. The posterior distribution should concentrate in the low double digits, likely around 40-80 people.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Consideration of tail risks and alternative scenarios suggests that while a sudden political push could increase numbers, the structural and legal challenges are significant barriers. The possibility of a last-minute batch of visas being issued is a risk, but the consistent low admissions rate makes this unlikely.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Based on the analysis, the forecasted percentiles for the number of people admitted by the end of 2025 are:

P10: 30  
P20: 40  
P40: 50  
P60: 60  
P80: 70  
P90: 80

# Forecasting the Number of UK Admissions Under the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Journeys

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Initial program data extrapolation**: The most direct evidence shows:
   - Sep 24, 2025: 3 people admitted
   - Oct 9, 2025: 18 people (15 new people in 15 days ≈ 1.0 person/day)
   - Oct 24, 2025: 23 people (5 new people in 15 days ≈ 0.33 people/day)

   This suggests a decelerating rate, currently averaging ~0.67 people/day. Extrapolating from Oct 24 to Dec 31 (68 days) at this rate would yield ~45 more people, for a total of ~68 people.

2. **Similar international agreements**: Programs like the EU-Turkey deal saw very low implementation rates in early months. Such agreements typically process only dozens to low hundreds of cases in their first 3-6 months due to legal, administrative, and political challenges.

Based on these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around **70 people** with a wide variance (roughly 30-150) to reflect the high uncertainty in a new program's implementation.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference class**:
- Like other international migration agreements, this program faces complex implementation challenges
- The program is politically contentious, creating both pressure to succeed and opposition
- The program requires bilateral cooperation between two sovereign states
- The program is in its very early implementation phase

**Key differences**:
- The "one-in, one-out" mechanism creates a unique bottleneck - admissions are directly contingent on successful returns
- The timeframe is extremely short (only ~4.5 months from inception to resolution date)
- The program has higher political salience than many similar agreements
- The program is operating during record-high Channel crossing attempts

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence pushing estimates lower**:
- **Decelerating admission rate** (Strong, ↓): The rate has dropped from 1.0 to 0.33 people/day between early and late October, suggesting implementation difficulties are increasing, not decreasing.
- **"One-in, one-out" mechanism** (Strong, ↓): Each admission requires a successful return to France, which faces legal challenges and requires French cooperation.
- **Mounting criticism** (Moderate, ↓): Reports indicate the program is failing to deter crossings, potentially reducing political will to accelerate implementation.
- **Short timeframe** (Moderate, ↓): With resolution by December 31, 2025, there's limited time for the program to overcome initial hurdles.

**Evidence pushing estimates higher**:
- **High political pressure** (Moderate, ↑): The UK government has strong incentives to make the program appear successful.
- **Record Channel crossings** (Weak, ↑): High crossing numbers provide many potential candidates for return/admission, though this is limited by processing capacity.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 70 people, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update 1 - Decelerating admission rate**:
- The observed deceleration suggests implementation problems are worsening
- This makes lower numbers (30-60 range) about 3× more likely than higher numbers
- Shifting my distribution downward, with new median around 55 people

**Update 2 - "One-in-one-out" bottleneck**:
- The structural constraint of requiring successful returns makes very high numbers implausible
- This makes numbers above 100 about 4× less likely
- Tightening my distribution, with reduced probability in the upper tail

**Update 3 - Short timeframe remaining**:
- With only ~1.5 months left in 2025 after the latest data point
- Even if the program maintains its current rate (which evidence suggests is optimistic), this caps the likely total
- Further shifts my distribution downward, with new median around 45-50 people

My posterior distribution is now centered lower than my prior, with a median around 45-50 people and a narrower spread, particularly in the upper tail.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- **Batch processing**: Admissions might occur in batches rather than steadily. A single large batch in December could significantly increase the total.
- **Data reporting lags**: The actual number of admissions might be higher than reported in media sources.
- **Political intervention**: With high stakes, the UK government might push for accelerated processing in December to show success.
- **Legal developments**: A favorable court ruling could suddenly remove barriers to returns, accelerating the program.

**Alternative forecast**:
A reasonable alternative forecast would be centered higher (80-100 people) based on the assumption that implementation problems will be resolved and the rate will accelerate rather than decelerate. This could happen if:
- The UK and France establish a more streamlined process for returns
- Legal challenges are overcome through procedural adjustments
- Political pressure leads to dedicated resources to make the program work

However, the evidence of deceleration and the structural constraints of the program make this scenario less likely than my main forecast.

**Adjustments**:
I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for these possibilities, particularly in the upper tail to reflect the possibility of batch processing or political intervention leading to a December surge.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, I'll provide my calibrated forecast:

P10: 30
P20: 35
P40: 45
P60: 55
P80: 70
P90: 85

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The primary reference class is **new, politically contentious, bilateral government programs**. Such programs are notorious for slow starts due to administrative friction, IT system failures, legal challenges, and the complexities of international cooperation. A good example is the EU-Turkey migrant deal, which saw very low numbers of returns relative to arrivals in its initial months.

A secondary, more specific reference class is an extrapolation from the program's own initial data. This is often volatile but provides the most direct evidence.

Based on the general reference class of difficult government rollouts, a prior for the first ~4.5 months of operation would be centered low, perhaps with a median of around **100-150 people**, but with a very wide, right-skewed distribution to account for the possibility of either near-total failure (low single digits) or a surprise success (several hundred).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has features that make it even more difficult than a typical government program rollout:

*   **Structural Bottleneck:** The "one-in, one-out" mechanism is the key difference. The number of admissions is strictly capped by the number of successful returns to France. Returns are legally and logistically far more complex than simple resettlement, creating a severe, built-in bottleneck. This strongly suggests the outcome will be lower than a standard resettlement program.
*   **Short Time Horizon:** The forecast period ends on December 31, 2025, less than five months after the program's inception. This leaves very little time to overcome the inevitable "teething problems" that plague new schemes, making a significant ramp-up unlikely.
*   **Bilateral Dependency:** Success depends not just on UK administrative capacity but on daily cooperation with France, which has its own political and operational constraints. This introduces another major point of potential failure.

These factors suggest the initial prior of 100-150 is likely too optimistic.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The available evidence consists of three data points on admissions:
1.  **September 24:** 3 people
2.  **October 9:** 18 people total (an increase of 15 people in 15 days, or **1.0 person/day**)
3.  **October 24:** 23 people total (an increase of 5 people in 15 days, or **~0.33 people/day**)

*   **Likelihood Impact:** This evidence is extremely powerful and points strongly towards a low final number.
    *   The absolute numbers are very small, confirming the existence of major bottlenecks.
    *   Crucially, the rate of admissions appears to be *decelerating*, not accelerating. This is highly consistent with a program grinding to a halt as it encounters legal or administrative barriers, and highly inconsistent with a program that is successfully scaling up.
    *   The report of "mounting criticism" further suggests the program is not functioning as intended, which could reduce the political will to force it through.

This evidence provides a strong downward update to the prior. It makes outcomes above 200 extremely unlikely and shifts the bulk of the probability mass to the low double digits.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** Median ~100-150, wide and right-skewed.
*   **Likelihood:** The early data (23 people by late October with a decelerating rate) is far more consistent with a final total below 100 than above it.
*   **Posterior:** I must significantly revise my prior downwards. The initial data acts as a strong anchor. A simple extrapolation from the most recent rate (~0.33/day) over the remaining 68 days of the year would yield only ~22 more people, for a total of 45. An extrapolation of the average rate since inception (~0.7/day) would yield ~48 more people, for a total of 71.
*   My posterior distribution will therefore be centered in the **60-70 range**. The initial wide uncertainty is now much reduced, though the distribution remains right-skewed to account for tail risks.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Why might the forecast be too low?** The primary risk is **batch processing driven by political incentives**. The UK government has a strong motive to present the scheme as a success. They could expedite a large batch of returns and corresponding visa approvals in December to generate a positive headline before the end of the year. This could lead to a sudden, non-linear jump of 50-100 people, which my extrapolation-based model would miss. The resolution criteria ("received visas") is an administrative step that could be done in a batch.
*   **Why might the forecast be too high?** The primary risk is a **legal injunction**. A single successful court case could halt all returns to France, which would, by the agreement's design, halt all new admissions. In this scenario, the number could be frozen at whatever it is in November/December, potentially not much higher than the current 23. The decelerating rate could also be a sign of the system seizing up, meaning even the slow trickle could stop.
*   **Adjustment:** The risk of a politically motivated end-of-year batch requires a fatter right tail than a simple extrapolation would suggest. The risk of a legal injunction reinforces the plausibility of the lower end of the forecast. I will therefore maintain a right-skewed distribution with a median around 65, but with a P90 that allows for a significant late surge.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast is centered on a continuation of the slow trickle observed so far, but with tails adjusted for the risks of a complete legal halt (downside) or a politically motivated batch approval (upside).

P10: 35
P20: 40
P40: 50
P60: 80
P80: 120
P90: 180
