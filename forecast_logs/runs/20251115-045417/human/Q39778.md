Here is the research plan I will follow to construct the brief.

### **Research Plan**

**1. Identify Core Questions:**
*   **Q1: What is the standard operating procedure for selecting a COP host within a UN regional group, particularly WEOG?** How often are bids contested, and what are the historical outcomes of such contests (e.g., withdrawal, compromise, default to Bonn)?
*   **Q2: What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the Australian bid?** This includes the narrative power of the Pacific partnership, the level of concrete support within WEOG, and domestic political commitment.
*   **Q3: What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of the Turkish bid?** This includes its geopolitical rationale, its level of support, and any potential obstacles.
*   **Q4: What is the nature of the current stalemate?** What is the primary leverage each side possesses? How credible is the possibility of a compromise, such as co-hosting?
*   **Q5: What is the probability and implication of the default scenario (Bonn, Germany)?** Under what conditions does this become the most likely outcome?
*   **Q6: What is the decision timeline and who are the key actors?** What are the key upcoming milestones or meetings where a decision could be forced or finalized?

**2. Propose Search Queries:**
*   **Q1:** `history of UNFCCC COP host selection`, `contested COP host bids WEOG`, `UNFCCC regional group rotation rules`, `COP host selection consensus rule`, `has a COP defaulted to Bonn Germany before`
*   **Q2:** `"Australia COP31 bid" support`, `"WEOG members supporting Australia COP31"`, `"Australia Pacific partnership COP31"`, `"Adelaide COP31 feasibility"`
*   **Q3:** `"Turkey COP31 bid" support`, `"Turkey climate change policy"`, `"Turkey WEOG relations"`
*   **Q4:** `"Australia Turkey COP31 deadlock"`, `"COP31 host stalemate"`, `"Australia Turkey shared hosting COP31"`
*   **Q5:** `"UNFCCC Bonn default host"`, `"conditions for COP in Bonn"`
*   **Q6:** `"COP31 host decision date"`, `"WEOG meeting schedule UNFCCC"`, `"COP30 Belém agenda COP31"`

**3. Synthesize Key Findings:**
*   The selection process is governed by a strict consensus rule within the regional group. This gives any member, including Turkey, effective veto power.
*   Australia's bid is numerically dominant, reportedly backed by at least 23 of the 28 WEOG members. Its partnership with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations provides a powerful moral and political argument.
*   Turkey's bid appears to be a diplomatic play, leveraging the consensus rule. Its path to a consensus victory seems non-existent given the numbers; its power lies in blocking Australia.
*   The stalemate has persisted through mid-2025, indicating both sides are entrenched. The mention of a "shared hosting" arrangement is a potential, but complex, off-ramp.
*   The default to Germany is a credible threat that grows more likely as the deadline (before COP30 in late 2025) approaches. This outcome represents a diplomatic failure for both bidders.
*   The final decision is expected at or before COP30 in Belém, Brazil (November 2025). The preceding months will feature intense, behind-the-scenes negotiations.

**4. Draft the Comprehensive Answer:**
I will now proceed to write the research brief using the specified format, integrating the synthesized findings.

### **Research Brief: COP 31 Host Country**

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Contested COP Host Selections:** Bids for hosting a COP are often settled uncontested within the designated regional group. However, contested bids occur periodically, especially when geopolitical tensions are high. In these cases, intense diplomacy ensues. The most recent parallel is the Eastern European Group's selection for COP29, which was deadlocked by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. A last-minute deal saw Armenia and Azerbaijan reach an agreement, allowing Baku to host. This suggests that even deep-seated deadlocks are typically resolved through a political deal rather than defaulting.
2.  **Consensus-Based Decisions in UN Bodies:** The requirement for consensus is a high bar. In cases with two committed candidates, outcomes can be: (a) one candidate withdraws in exchange for diplomatic concessions or a future opportunity (most common); (b) a compromise is found (e.g., co-hosting); or (c) a persistent stalemate leads to a procedural/default outcome.
3.  **Default to UNFCCC Headquarters (Bonn):** The UNFCCC has a standing provision to host events in Bonn, Germany, if no host country is agreed upon. This serves as a backstop. A base rate for this is very low; it is a rare outcome reserved for complete diplomatic failure, as host countries gain significant prestige. A ballpark estimate for a contested bid defaulting is likely <10%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-11** Ethiopia announced as COP32 host, while the source explicitly notes the COP31 stalemate between Australia and Turkey *persists*. (↓ Australia/Turkey, ↑ Germany) — Shows the deadlock is entrenched and other future business is moving forward, increasing pressure.
*   **2025-11-05** Australia's government reiterates its firm commitment to the COP31 bid in its official priorities for the upcoming COP30. (↑ Australia) — Signals no intention of backing down and continued high-level political investment.
*   **2025-10-31** A news report suggests Australia and Turkey are considering a shared hosting arrangement amid negotiations. (↔ Australia/Turkey) — Introduces a potential compromise to break the stalemate, though the mechanics are unclear. This could still resolve to "Australia" if Adelaide is the host city.
*   **2025-10-31** The same report claims Australia's bid is supported by "at least 23 members" of the Western European and Others Group (WEOG). (↑↑ Australia, ↓↓ Turkey) — This is a critical piece of information, indicating overwhelming numerical superiority for Australia within the 28-member group.
*   **2025-06-16** (Prospective) The Bonn Climate Change Conference was flagged as a key meeting for the WEOG group to decide on a nomination. The fact that the stalemate is reported as persisting in November implies no decision was reached. (↑ Germany, ↓ Australia/Turkey) — A missed deadline suggests the deadlock is not easily resolved, slightly increasing the probability of the default scenario.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **WEOG Consensus Rule:** The single most important mechanism. It grants Turkey de facto veto power over Australia's bid, regardless of Australia's majority support. This transforms the contest from a vote into a bilateral negotiation. (Size: Large)
2.  **Numerical Support within WEOG:** Australia's reported backing from 23+ of 28 members provides immense diplomatic legitimacy and pressure on Turkey to concede. It makes a consensus *for* Turkey nearly impossible. (Size: Large)
3.  **Bid Narrative and "Soft Power":** Australia's co-bid with Pacific Island nations, who are on the front lines of climate change, is a powerful and compelling narrative. This aligns with the core mission of the UNFCCC and likely swayed many WEOG members. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Risk of Diplomatic Failure (Default to Bonn):** The prospect of the entire WEOG group failing to select a host is embarrassing and reduces the bloc's influence. This creates pressure on *both* Australia and Turkey to find a resolution before the deadline. (Size: Moderate)
5.  **Geopolitical Leverage:** Turkey may be using its veto as leverage for unrelated diplomatic goals with Australia or other key WEOG members (e.g., EU states). The substance of its bid is secondary to the power of the holdout. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Asymmetry of Support:** Unlike many contested bids where support is more evenly split, this case features a supermajority for one candidate (Australia) being blocked by a very small minority (potentially just Turkey).
*   **Co-Hosting with Vulnerable Nations:** The formal partnership with Pacific Island nations is a relatively novel and potent feature for a COP bid from a developed country, framing it as an act of solidarity.
*   **Explicit Compromise Option:** The public mention of a "shared hosting" arrangement provides a specific, visible off-ramp for negotiators to resolve the deadlock, which is not always present in historical cases.
*   **Bidder Profiles:** The bidders are a G20, OECD nation with recently renewed climate ambition (Australia) versus a G20, NATO nation at the crossroads of Europe and Asia with a complex relationship with many WEOG members (Turkey).

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, given two official bids and a default option, might be Australia (45%), Turkey (25%), Germany (30%), reflecting Australia's stronger profile but the high uncertainty of the consensus rule. (Equivalent n

To forecast which country will host COP 31 in 2026, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Australia**: Given the strong support from 23 out of 28 WEOG members, Australia's bid is strong. Historically, bids with significant support within the group have a high chance of success. Prior probability: 45%.
- **Turkey**: Turkey's bid seems more of a diplomatic maneuver, with little chance of gaining consensus support. Prior probability: 15%.
- **Germany (Bonn)**: The default option is rare but possible if a stalemate persists. Prior probability: 25%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: This is unlikely as the bid is primarily led by Australia with Pacific nations as partners. Prior probability: 5%.
- **Other**: Unlikely given the current bids and the default option. Prior probability: 10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Australia**: The strong majority support within WEOG is a significant advantage, similar to past successful bids.
- **Turkey**: The lack of broad support makes it different from typical successful bids.
- **Germany**: The default scenario is rare but becomes more likely as the stalemate continues.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Unlikely as they are not leading the bid.
- **Other**: No indication of other bids.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Australia**: The support from 23 WEOG members (P(E | H) is high) and the partnership with Pacific nations strengthen its bid.
- **Turkey**: The lack of support (P(E | H) is low) and the use of veto power suggest a strategic rather than a viable bid.
- **Germany**: The ongoing stalemate (P(E | H) is moderate) increases the likelihood of default.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: No evidence supports this as a lead bid.
- **Other**: No evidence of other bids.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Australia**: Prior odds = 45/55. Likelihood ratio (based on support) = 0.9/0.1. Posterior odds = (45/55) * (0.9/0.1) = 8.18. Posterior probability = 8.18 / (1 + 8.18) ≈ 89%.
- **Turkey**: Prior odds = 15/85. Likelihood ratio (based on lack of support) = 0.1/0.9. Posterior odds = (15/85) * (0.1/0.9) = 0.0196. Posterior probability ≈ 2%.
- **Germany**: Prior odds = 25/75. Likelihood ratio (based on stalemate) = 0.5/0.5. Posterior odds = (25/75) * (0.5/0.5) = 0.333. Posterior probability ≈ 25%.
- **Another Pacific Island Nation**: Remains low due to lack of evidence.
- **Other**: Remains low due to lack of evidence.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- Consider the possibility of a shared hosting arrangement, which could still resolve to "Australia" if Adelaide is the host city.
- The risk of overconfidence in Australia's bid is mitigated by the strong support evidence.
- The default to Germany remains a credible threat if negotiations fail.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to 100%:

- Australia: 60%
- Turkey: 5%
- Germany: 25%
- Another Pacific Island Nation: 5%
- Other: 5%

### 7. Output Format

Australia: 60%  
Turkey: 5%  
Germany: 25%  
Another Pacific Island Nation: 5%  
Other: 5%

# Analysis of COP 31 Host Country Probabilities

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option:

**Australia**: 45%
- Rationale: Australia has a formal bid with reported support from 23 of 28 WEOG members, giving it strong numerical backing.
- The partnership with Pacific Island nations provides a compelling narrative aligned with climate action goals.

**Turkey**: 25%
- Rationale: Turkey has an official bid but appears to have limited support within WEOG.
- However, the consensus requirement gives Turkey significant blocking power.

**Germany**: 20%
- Rationale: As the default option (Bonn hosts UNFCCC headquarters), Germany becomes relevant if consensus fails.
- Historical precedent suggests defaults are rare but possible when deadlocks persist.

**Another Pacific Island Nation**: 5%
- Rationale: While mentioned as partners with Australia, there's no indication they would host independently.
- The rotation system assigns hosting to WEOG, making this unlikely.

**Other**: 5%
- Rationale: This covers any unexpected outcome, such as another WEOG country emerging as a compromise.
- The late stage of negotiations makes this unlikely but not impossible.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- The selection follows the established UN regional rotation system (WEOG's turn)
- The process requires consensus within the regional group
- Multiple countries have submitted formal bids
- The default option (Bonn, Germany) exists as a backstop

**Key differences:**
- The asymmetry of support (23 of 28 members backing Australia) is unusually stark
- Australia's co-hosting arrangement with Pacific nations is innovative
- The explicit mention of a potential shared hosting arrangement provides a visible compromise path
- The stalemate has persisted unusually long, with a decision deadline approaching

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Australia has support from "at least 23 members" of WEOG**
- P(E|Australia hosts): ~0.9 (Very likely to see this level of support if Australia will host)
- P(E|Australia doesn't host): ~0.3 (Less likely but possible if Australia ultimately fails)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.0 (Strongly favors Australia)

**Evidence 2: The stalemate persists as of November 2025, despite earlier opportunities to resolve**
- P(E|Australia hosts): ~0.4 (Somewhat unexpected if Australia will ultimately prevail cleanly)
- P(E|Turkey hosts): ~0.4 (Also somewhat unexpected if Turkey will prevail)
- P(E|Germany hosts): ~0.8 (Very consistent with a deadlock leading to default)
- Likelihood ratio: Favors Germany over both Australia and Turkey

**Evidence 3: Reports of a potential shared hosting arrangement**
- P(E|Australia hosts): ~0.7 (Consistent with Australia being the primary host in a compromise)
- P(E|Turkey hosts): ~0.5 (Possible but less likely given Australia's stronger position)
- P(E|Germany hosts): ~0.2 (Unlikely to see compromise discussions if default is imminent)
- Likelihood ratio: Favors Australia over Germany, slightly favors Australia over Turkey

**Evidence 4: Ethiopia announced as COP32 host while COP31 remains undecided**
- P(E|Any specific country hosts): ~0.7 (Neutral across specific countries)
- P(E|Germany hosts by default): ~0.9 (Very consistent with a persistent deadlock)
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors the default scenario

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update based on the strongest evidence: Australia's supermajority support within WEOG.

For Australia:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 3.0
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 3.0 = 2.46
- Posterior probability: 2.46/(1+2.46) = 71%

However, this must be adjusted downward due to the persistent stalemate evidence:
- The continued deadlock suggests Australia cannot convert its numerical advantage into consensus
- This reduces Australia's probability to approximately 55%

For Turkey:
- The numerical disadvantage significantly reduces Turkey's chances of being the primary host
- However, Turkey's blocking power and the mention of shared hosting increases its chances of being involved
- Adjusting from 25% to approximately 15%

For Germany:
- The persistent stalemate increases Germany's chances as the default option
- The approaching deadline (decision expected before COP30 in late 2025) makes the default more likely
- Adjusting from 20% to approximately 25%

For Another Pacific Island Nation:
- No evidence suggests they would host independently rather than with Australia
- Maintaining at approximately 2%

For Other:
- No evidence suggests another country emerging at this late stage
- Reducing slightly to approximately 3%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating Australia's position despite numerical support, as consensus rules can empower determined minorities
- The shared hosting arrangement could be more complex than anticipated, potentially qualifying as "Other"
- I might be underestimating the diplomatic pressure on Turkey to concede given its isolation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Turkey could leverage its position for significant concessions, potentially resulting in a true co-hosting arrangement that might qualify as "Other"
- A completely unexpected compromise candidate from WEOG could emerge (e.g., Canada, Switzerland)
- The deadline could pass without resolution, forcing a default to Bonn more likely than I've estimated

**Adjustments:**
- Slightly reducing Australia's probability to account for the consensus challenge
- Slightly increasing Germany's probability given the persistent stalemate
- Maintaining Turkey's probability given its blocking leverage

## 6. Final Normalization

Adjusting and normalizing the probabilities:

Australia: 52%
Turkey: 15%
Germany: 28%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%

## 7. Output Format

Australia: 52%
Turkey: 15%
Germany: 28%
Another Pacific Island Nation: 2%
Other: 3%
(sum 100%)

```md

Here is my probabilistic forecast based on the provided information and a structured reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** Contested host selections for major UN conferences within a regional group requiring consensus.
*   **Prior Probabilities:** In such a contest with two official bids (Australia, Turkey) and a default option (Germany), a naive starting point would be to distribute the probability among them. However, the candidates are not equal. Australia, as a G20/OECD nation with strong alliances in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), and a compelling bid narrative (partnering with climate-vulnerable Pacific nations), starts as a stronger candidate than Turkey, which has more complex geopolitical relationships with many WEOG members. The default option (Germany) is historically rare, as it represents a diplomatic failure for the entire group.
*   **Initial Priors:**
    *   Australia: 50% (Stronger candidate profile and narrative)
    *   Turkey: 30% (A credible bidder but with higher diplomatic hurdles)
    *   Germany: 15% (Default option, a real but unlikely outcome)
    *   Another Pacific Island Nation: 2% (Unlikely to host independently of Australia)
    *   Other: 3% (A surprise compromise candidate emerges)

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The process follows the standard UN model of regional rotation and consensus-based decision-making. Geopolitical leverage is a key factor, as is common in these negotiations.
*   **Differences:** The most significant difference is the extreme asymmetry of support. One candidate (Australia) has overwhelming backing (23+ of 28 members), while the other (Turkey) is leveraging the consensus rule to create a deadlock. This is less of a contest between two viable options and more of a "game of chicken," where a supermajority is being held up by a small minority. This increases the probability of either the supermajority eventually prevailing or a complete breakdown (default to Germany).

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Australia has support from "at least 23 members" of the 28-member WEOG.**
    *   This evidence is highly likely if Australia is the eventual host (P(E|Australia)) and extremely unlikely if Turkey wins a straight vote (P(E|Turkey)). It makes a consensus victory for Turkey virtually impossible.
    *   This evidence is also quite likely if the outcome is a default to Germany (P(E|Germany)), as it perfectly describes the conditions for a deadlock (a supermajority is blocked by a veto).
    *   **Impact:** This evidence drastically reduces Turkey's probability and shifts that probability primarily to Australia, with a smaller portion going to Germany.

*   **Evidence 2: The stalemate has "persisted" through mid-November 2025, past a soft deadline in June.**
    *   The longer the stalemate continues, the less likely an easy victory for Australia becomes, and the more credible the default-to-Germany scenario appears. This evidence slightly weakens the Australia case and strengthens the Germany case.

*   **Evidence 3: Reports suggest Australia and Turkey are considering a "shared hosting arrangement."**
    *   This provides a plausible off-ramp to break the deadlock. A "shared" arrangement would likely be a face-saving measure for Turkey to concede, with the main conference still being held in Australia (Adelaide).
    *   This evidence makes the "total failure" default to Germany less likely, as it shows a path to compromise is being actively explored.
    *   **Impact:** This evidence strengthens the case for Australia and weakens the case for Germany.

*   **Evidence 4: The recent COP29 deadlock was resolved via a last-minute political deal.**
    *   This precedent from a similar situation (Eastern European Group deadlock) shows that there is a strong preference to avoid the default outcome. These situations tend to be resolved through intense, last-minute diplomacy.
    *   **Impact:** This reinforces the idea that a deal is more likely than a default, which again favors Australia (as the party with majority support) over Germany.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

1.  **Start with Priors:** Australia (50%), Turkey (30%), Germany (15%).
2.  **Apply Evidence of Asymmetric Support:** Turkey's chances of a direct win plummet. Let's move its probability down to ~5%. The 25% removed is split between Australia (+15%) and Germany (+10%), as the deadlock scenario becomes more defined. **New state: Australia (65%), Turkey (5%), Germany (25%).**
3.  **Apply Evidence of Stalemate vs. Precedent/Compromise:** The persistent stalemate pushes towards Germany, but the COP29 precedent and talks of a "shared" deal push more strongly towards a negotiated settlement favoring Australia. The net effect is a significant shift away from the Germany/default scenario and towards the Australia/negotiated win scenario. Let's move ~13% from Germany to Australia.
4.  **Final Posterior Estimate:** This leaves Australia as the very strong favorite, but with a non-trivial chance that the deadlock cannot be broken, leading to the default in Germany. Turkey's only remaining path is to extract an unlikely full concession from Australia.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My primary forecast heavily favors Australia. The biggest risk is underestimating the power of a veto in a consensus system. Turkey's resolve has been strong enough to maintain the stalemate for a long time. If their demands are completely unacceptable to Australia and its allies, and neither side is willing to accept the diplomatic embarrassment of a default, the situation could persist until time runs out. The probability for Germany at 14% reflects this risk. I might also be underestimating Turkey's ability to leverage this veto for an actual win, perhaps by tying it to a completely unrelated and more important geopolitical issue. I've assigned 5% to this, which seems appropriate for a high-impact, low-probability event. The "Other" options remain tail risks. The forecast seems reasonably robust.

### 6. Final Normalization

The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the analysis above, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **Australia (78%):** The most probable outcome. They have overwhelming support and a clear diplomatic path to victory through a negotiated settlement that gives Turkey a face-saving exit (like a "co-hosting" title).
*   **Turkey (5%):** A low-probability outcome. Their path to victory is not through building consensus but by using their veto as leverage to force Australia to withdraw, which is highly unlikely given the political capital Australia has invested.
*   **Germany (14%):** The second most likely outcome. This happens if the game of chicken ends in a crash—if negotiations fail and the deadline passes, the conference defaults to Bonn. The persistence of the stalemate makes this a credible threat.
*   **Another Pacific Island Nation (1%):** A tail risk. This would require a fundamental restructuring of the current Australian-led bid.
*   **Other (2%):** A different tail risk, primarily representing a surprise compromise candidate from WEOG stepping in to break the deadlock.
