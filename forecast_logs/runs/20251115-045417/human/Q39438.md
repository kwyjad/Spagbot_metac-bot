### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Major Executive Actions Involving National Security/Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Supreme Court grants significant deference to the President in these areas. In cases like *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018), the Court upheld broad executive action. A base rate from this class would suggest a ~60-70% chance of the action being upheld ("Tariffs lawful"). However, this class is limited because the current case involves economic/tariff powers historically reserved for Congress, not immigration control.
2.  **Supreme Court Rulings on "Major Questions Doctrine" Challenges:** In recent years, the Court has increasingly used this doctrine to strike down executive agency actions on issues of vast economic and political significance that Congress has not clearly authorized. Examples include *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *Biden v. Nebraska* (2023). The base rate for this class is a ~70-80% chance of the executive action being struck down ("Tariffs unlawful"). This class is highly relevant as imposing trillions of dollars in tariffs via a novel interpretation of a 1977 law is a quintessential "major question."
3.  **Supreme Court Rulings on Statutory Interpretation of Presidential Authority:** This is a broader class where the Court interprets the scope of a statute granting power to the President. Outcomes are highly dependent on the specific text and context. The base rate is roughly 50/50, offering little predictive power on its own but highlighting that the outcome is not pre-determined by deference alone.

Given the direct conflict between the deference principle (Class 1) and the major questions doctrine (Class 2), a blended prior is appropriate, leaning towards the more recent and contextually relevant "major questions" trend.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-05** Oral arguments held before the Supreme Court. Reports indicate a majority of justices expressed skepticism about the administration's broad interpretation of IEEPA. **(↓ for Tariffs lawful)** — This is the single most important recent event, providing direct insight into the justices' thinking and suggesting a high probability of reversal.
*   **2025-09-09** Supreme Court agrees to hear the consolidated cases on an expedited schedule. **(↑ for a 2025 ruling, neutral on outcome)** — Signals the Court views the issue as urgent and of national importance, making a ruling before year-end more likely and a procedural dodge ("Other ruling") less likely.
*   **2025-08-29** The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 decision, affirms the lower court ruling that the tariffs exceeded presidential authority. **(↓ for Tariffs lawful)** — A decisive ruling from the specialized appellate court on trade matters strengthens the legal case against the tariffs.
*   **2025-06-17** Plaintiffs in *Learning Resources* petition for Supreme Court review before the appellate court judgment. **(Neutral)** — This procedural move simply accelerated the timeline to the Supreme Court.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Major Questions Doctrine:** The Court's current conservative majority is highly skeptical of executive agencies claiming transformative new powers without explicit congressional authorization. Imposing tariffs, a core legislative power, under a general "regulation" authority is a prime candidate for invalidation under this doctrine. **(Large driver, ↓ for Tariffs lawful)**
2.  **Textual Interpretation of IEEPA:** The government's case rests on the word "regulate" in the IEEPA statute encompassing the power to set tariffs. Opponents argue that the power to tax/tariff is distinct and not mentioned. The Court's textualist/originalist members may find the absence of explicit tariff authority dispositive. **(Large driver, ↓ for Tariffs lawful)**
3.  **Deference to Presidential Foreign Policy/National Security Powers:** The government's strongest argument is that the President requires broad discretion to respond to foreign threats, and the Court should not second-guess the national emergency declaration or the chosen remedy. This is a longstanding principle of judicial restraint. **(Large driver, ↑ for Tariffs lawful)**
4.  **Separation of Powers:** The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power "To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" (Article I, Section 8). A ruling for the government would represent a massive transfer of this power to the Executive, a concern that could unite justices across the ideological spectrum. **(Moderate driver, ↓ for Tariffs lawful)**
5.  **Distinction Between Tariff Types:** The Court could differentiate between the "trafficking tariffs" and the "reciprocal tariffs." The former have a clearer (though still debatable) link to a traditional national security threat (cartels), while the latter, aimed at trade deficits, appear to be pure economic policymaking, making them more vulnerable to being struck down. This could lead to a "Mixed ruling." **(Moderate driver, ↑ for Mixed ruling)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Novel Application of IEEPA:** Unlike past uses of IEEPA for targeted sanctions (e.g., freezing assets), this is an unprecedented application to impose broad-based tariffs on major trading partners, fundamentally altering its scope.
*   **Conflict of Judicial Doctrines:** This case creates a direct collision between two powerful, but opposing, lines of precedent: deference to the executive in foreign affairs (*Trump v. Hawaii*) versus skepticism of executive overreach on major domestic issues (*West Virginia v. EPA*). The tariffs blur the line between foreign and domestic policy.
*   **Nature of the "Emergency":** Using a chronic trade deficit as the basis for a national "emergency" under IEEPA is a significant stretch of the statutory language, which refers to an "unusual and extraordinary threat." This is much weaker than traditional national security justifications.
*   **Cross-Ideological Skepticism:** The legal issues at play (separation of powers, statutory limits) have the potential to create an unusual coalition on the Court. Both conservative textualists wary of executive overreach and liberal justices concerned with unchecked presidential power may find common ground to rule against the administration.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A plausible prior, blending the competing reference classes, would place "Unlawful" and "Mixed ruling" as more likely than "Lawful." E.g., Unlawful: 40%, Mixed: 30%, Lawful: 20%, Other/No Ruling: 10%. (Equivalent n=10, reflecting moderate initial confidence).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓ Large) Oral argument reports showing widespread judicial skepticism is the strongest piece of evidence, significantly reducing the probability of "Tariffs lawful."
    *   (↓ Moderate) The current Court's strong trend of applying the Major Questions Doctrine to curb executive power in other high-profile cases.
    *   (↓ Small) The consensus of two different lower courts ruling the tariffs unlawful, which creates a strong headwind for the government.
    *   (↑ Small) The countervailing, but likely weaker, principle of deference in national security provides some remaining support for the "Lawful" or "Mixed" outcomes.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the prior inclination against the tariffs' lawfulness. The posterior probability for "Tariffs lawful" should be significantly reduced (<10%), with the probability mass shifting primarily to "Tariffs unlawful" and secondarily to "Mixed ruling."

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (for Tariffs lawful):**
    *   Unusual public statements or speeches by conservative justices (e.g., Alito, Thomas) defending broad executive power in national emergencies.
    *   Op-eds from prominent conservative legal scholars, potentially signaling a shift in the intellectual climate, arguing IEEPA does authorize tariffs.
    *   Leaks from the Court suggesting the internal deliberations are more favorable to the government than oral arguments indicated.
*   **DOWN indicators (for Tariffs lawful):**
    *   Any delay in the ruling past late December, which could signal a complex, fractured opinion set, making a clean "Lawful" ruling less likely.
    *   Public comments from justices emphasizing the separation of powers or Congress's role in economic matters.
    *   The Court releasing other major decisions first, potentially clearing the deck for a landmark ruling on this case.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Oral Argument Predictability:** While often indicative, oral arguments are not infallible predictors of a case's outcome. Justices may play devil's advocate or change their minds during deliberations.
*   **Resolution Criteria Nuance:** The distinction between "Unlawful" (all tariffs struck down) and "Mixed" (some upheld, some struck down) is critical. The Court could easily find the trafficking tariffs permissible but the reciprocal tariffs unlawful.
*   **"Other Ruling" Possibility:** While unlikely given the expedited review, the Court could issue a narrow procedural ruling (e.g., on standing) or vacate and remand without a clear merits holding, which would resolve as "Other ruling."
*   **Hypothetical Scenario:** This analysis is based on a fictional but plausible scenario. The reasoning relies on applying real-world legal doctrines to this specific fact pattern, which introduces model uncertainty.
*   **Timing Risk:** The resolution deadline is December 31, 2025. While the expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling likely, any delay into January 2026 would resolve the question as "No 2025 ruling."

**Final Research Summary:** The Supreme Court is highly likely to rule against the Trump administration. The combination of a novel and expansive use of IEEPA, the Court's recent skepticism of executive overreach under the major questions doctrine, and skeptical questioning during oral arguments all point toward

To forecast the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Tariffs lawful**: Historically, the Supreme Court has shown deference to executive actions in national security and foreign affairs, suggesting a base rate of 60-70%. However, this case involves economic powers typically reserved for Congress, reducing the relevance of this base rate.
- **Tariffs unlawful**: The "Major Questions Doctrine" has been increasingly used to strike down executive actions lacking clear congressional authorization, suggesting a base rate of 70-80% for striking down such actions.
- **Mixed ruling**: Given the complexity and potential for distinguishing between different types of tariffs, a base rate of 20-30% is reasonable.
- **Other ruling**: Procedural outcomes are less common but possible, suggesting a base rate of 10-15%.
- **No 2025 ruling**: Given the expedited schedule, this is unlikely, suggesting a base rate of 5-10%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities**: The case involves executive action under national security pretexts, similar to past cases where deference was granted.
- **Differences**: The tariffs are a novel application of IEEPA, and the case involves significant economic implications, making it a strong candidate for the Major Questions Doctrine.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Oral arguments**: Reports of skepticism from justices suggest a high likelihood of ruling against the tariffs if they are unlawful (P(E | H) high for "Tariffs unlawful").
- **Lower court rulings**: Both lower courts ruled against the tariffs, reinforcing the likelihood of an "unlawful" ruling.
- **Expedited Supreme Court review**: Indicates the Court's recognition of the issue's importance, increasing the likelihood of a 2025 ruling.
- **Major Questions Doctrine trend**: Recent rulings suggest a high likelihood of applying this doctrine to strike down the tariffs.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)
- **Prior for "Tariffs unlawful"**: 70%
- **Likelihood of oral arguments and lower court rulings**: Strongly supports "Tariffs unlawful," increasing posterior probability.
- **Posterior for "Tariffs unlawful"**: ~80%
- **Posterior for "Mixed ruling"**: ~15%, considering the possibility of distinguishing between tariff types.
- **Posterior for "Tariffs lawful"**: ~5%, given the strong evidence against it.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence**: The strong trend towards "unlawful" could lead to overconfidence. Consider the possibility of a mixed ruling or procedural outcome.
- **Alternative scenarios**: A procedural ruling or delay could occur, though unlikely given the expedited schedule.

### 6. Final Normalization
- Ensure probabilities sum to 100% and reflect the evidence and reasoning.

### 7. Output Format
Tariffs lawful: 5%  
Tariffs unlawful: 75%  
Mixed ruling: 15%  
Other ruling: 3%  
No 2025 ruling: 2%  

These probabilities reflect the strong evidence against the tariffs' lawfulness, the potential for a mixed ruling, and the low likelihood of procedural outcomes or delays.

# Analysis of Supreme Court Ruling on Trump's Tariffs in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll establish base rates for each option by examining relevant Supreme Court precedents:

**Tariffs unlawful (45% prior):**
- The Supreme Court has increasingly applied the "major questions doctrine" to limit executive power in cases of vast economic significance without clear Congressional authorization (e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, Biden v. Nebraska)
- The Court has historically protected Congress's Article I powers to regulate commerce and impose tariffs
- Lower courts have unanimously ruled against these tariffs (both district courts and the Federal Circuit)

**Mixed ruling (25% prior):**
- The Court often seeks compromise positions in politically charged cases
- The two types of tariffs (trafficking vs. reciprocal) have different justifications, allowing for a split decision
- The Court frequently narrows broad lower court rulings rather than fully affirming or reversing

**Tariffs lawful (15% prior):**
- The Court has historically granted significant deference to presidential authority in foreign affairs and national security (e.g., Trump v. Hawaii)
- IEEPA explicitly grants the president power to "regulate" commerce during declared emergencies

**Other ruling (10% prior):**
- The Court sometimes avoids deciding contentious issues on procedural grounds
- Possibilities include standing issues, ripeness concerns, or remanding for further fact-finding

**No 2025 ruling (5% prior):**
- The expedited schedule makes a 2025 ruling highly likely
- The Court has already granted certiorari and scheduled oral arguments
- The economic importance creates pressure for a timely resolution

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenarios:**
- Like other major questions doctrine cases, this involves a significant expansion of executive power with enormous economic consequences
- Like other national security cases, it involves presidential claims of emergency powers
- The Court's current 6-3 conservative majority remains intact

**Key differences:**
- The unprecedented scope of these tariffs (affecting major trading partners and trillions in trade) exceeds previous IEEPA applications
- The use of "trade deficits" as a national emergency is novel and stretches the statutory language
- The case creates a direct collision between two powerful judicial doctrines: deference in foreign affairs vs. limits on executive power in major economic questions

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence strongly suggesting "Tariffs unlawful":**
- Oral arguments on November 5, 2025, showed widespread judicial skepticism (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.2)
- Unanimous lower court rulings against the tariffs (P(E|H) = 0.7, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- The Court's recent trend of limiting executive power in major economic questions (P(E|H) = 0.8, P(E|~H) = 0.3)
- Constitutional text explicitly grants tariff powers to Congress (P(E|H) = 0.9, P(E|~H) = 0.4)

**Evidence suggesting "Mixed ruling" possibility:**
- Different legal bases for the trafficking vs. reciprocal tariffs (P(E|Mixed) = 0.7, P(E|~Mixed) = 0.3)
- The Court often seeks compromise in politically charged cases (P(E|Mixed) = 0.6, P(E|~Mixed) = 0.4)

**Evidence supporting "Tariffs lawful":**
- Traditional deference to the executive in foreign affairs (P(E|Lawful) = 0.9, P(E|~Lawful) = 0.5)
- Broad statutory language in IEEPA ("regulate" commerce) (P(E|Lawful) = 0.7, P(E|~Lawful) = 0.4)

**Evidence for timing:**
- Expedited schedule with November oral arguments (P(E|2025 ruling) = 0.95, P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.1)
- Court's recognition of the economic urgency (P(E|2025 ruling) = 0.9, P(E|No 2025 ruling) = 0.2)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Let's update our prior for "Tariffs unlawful" based on the oral argument evidence:
- Prior probability: 45%
- Prior odds: 45/55 = 0.82
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.2 = 4
- Posterior odds: 0.82 × 4 = 3.28
- Posterior probability: 3.28/(1+3.28) = 76.6%

This is a significant increase from our prior, reflecting the strong signal from oral arguments.

For "Mixed ruling," updating based on the different legal bases for the two types of tariffs:
- Prior probability: 25%
- Prior odds: 25/75 = 0.33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.3 = 2.33
- Posterior odds: 0.33 × 2.33 = 0.77
- Posterior probability: 0.77/(1+0.77) = 43.5%

However, this doesn't account for the strong evidence against tariffs generally, which would reduce this probability.

For "No 2025 ruling," updating based on the expedited schedule:
- Prior probability: 5%
- Prior odds: 5/95 = 0.053
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.95 = 0.105
- Posterior odds: 0.053 × 0.105 = 0.0056
- Posterior probability: 0.0056/(1+0.0056) = 0.56%

This confirms the extremely low probability of no ruling in 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overweighting the significance of oral arguments, which don't always predict outcomes
- The Court could find a narrow statutory interpretation that allows some tariffs while limiting others
- I might underestimate the Court's deference to presidential national security claims, especially with a conservative majority
- The Court could issue a procedural ruling that avoids the merits entirely

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The Court could uphold the trafficking tariffs (linked to cartels) while striking down the reciprocal tariffs (trade deficits)
- The Court might remand for further proceedings on the specific application of IEEPA to different countries
- The justices could split along unusual lines, with some conservatives joining liberals to protect Congress's Article I powers

**Adjustments:**
- I should increase the probability of a "Mixed ruling" somewhat, as the Court often seeks compromise positions
- I should slightly decrease "Tariffs unlawful" to account for the possibility of some deference on national security grounds
- I should maintain a small probability for "Other ruling" given the Court's occasional procedural dodges

## 6. Final Normalization

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots:

Tariffs unlawful: 60%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Tariffs lawful: 5%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%

## 7. Output Format

Tariffs unlawful: 60%
Mixed ruling: 30%
Tariffs lawful: 5%
Other ruling: 4%
No 2025 ruling: 1%
(sum 100%)

Here is a careful probabilistic forecast based on Bayesian reasoning.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

To establish a prior probability, I will consider two primary reference classes for Supreme Court cases:

1.  **Deference to Executive on National Security/Foreign Affairs:** Historically, the Court grants significant deference to the President in these domains. Cases like *Trump v. Hawaii* (upholding the travel ban) suggest a high probability (perhaps 60-70%) of the executive action being upheld. This would favor the "Tariffs lawful" option.
2.  **Major Questions Doctrine Challenges:** In recent years, the current Court has aggressively used this doctrine to strike down major executive actions not explicitly authorized by Congress (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Biden v. Nebraska*). This reference class suggests a high probability (perhaps 70-80%) of the executive action being struck down, favoring the "Tariffs unlawful" option.

This case sits at the intersection of these two conflicting doctrines. The use of IEEPA invokes national security, but the action (imposing broad tariffs) is a massive economic policy change, a core legislative function. Given the current Court's clear trend, the "Major Questions Doctrine" reference class is more relevant. Therefore, my initial prior will lean towards the tariffs being struck down in whole or in part.

A blended, un-evidenced prior might be:
*   Tariffs lawful: 20%
*   Tariffs unlawful: 45%
*   Mixed ruling: 25%
*   Other ruling / No 2025 ruling: 10%

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

This case differs from the base cases in crucial ways:

*   **Difference from *Trump v. Hawaii***: The power to impose tariffs and duties is explicitly granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. This case involves a much more direct intrusion into legislative power than the immigration powers at issue in *Hawaii*.
*   **Difference from *West Virginia v. EPA***: While similar in invoking the major questions doctrine, this case also has a foreign affairs component that *WV v. EPA* lacked. The government's strongest argument is that IEEPA is *intended* to give the President broad, flexible power to respond to foreign threats, an area where the judiciary is traditionally hesitant to interfere.
*   **Novelty of Action**: The use of IEEPA for broad-based tariffs against major trading partners based on justifications like "trade deficits" is an unprecedented and aggressive interpretation of the statute, making it more vulnerable to judicial skepticism than prior uses of the act for targeted sanctions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

I will evaluate three key pieces of evidence from the provided text:

*   **Evidence 1: Lower Court Rulings.** Two different federal courts (the Court of International Trade and the D.C. District Court) and one appellate court (the Federal Circuit) have all ruled against the administration.
    *   P(E1 | Tariffs unlawful) is high. A consensus against the government in the lower courts is expected if the legal theory is weak.
    *   P(E1 | Tariffs lawful) is low. It would be unusual for the Supreme Court to reverse a unanimous trend from the lower courts, including a specialized appellate court, on a matter of statutory interpretation.
    *   **Effect:** This evidence strongly shifts probability away from "Tariffs lawful" and towards "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

*   **Evidence 2: Expedited Supreme Court Schedule.** The Court consolidated the cases and scheduled them for argument and decision on a fast track.
    *   P(E2 | A merits ruling in 2025) is high. The Court would only expedite a case of this magnitude if it intended to provide a swift, decisive answer.
    *   P(E2 | "Other ruling" or "No 2025 ruling") is very low. An expedited schedule makes a procedural dodge or a delay past the end of the year highly unlikely.
    *   **Effect:** This evidence significantly reduces the probability of "Other ruling" and "No 2025 ruling," concentrating the probability mass on the three substantive outcomes.

*   **Evidence 3: Oral Argument Reports.** The research report states, "Reports indicate a majority of justices expressed skepticism about the administration's broad interpretation of IEEPA."
    *   P(E3 | "Tariffs unlawful" or "Mixed ruling") is very high. Widespread skepticism from the bench during oral argument is one of the strongest available indicators that the government is likely to lose on the merits, at least in part.
    *   P(E3 | "Tariffs lawful") is extremely low. It is rare for a majority of justices to signal strong doubt and then vote to uphold the challenged action in its entirety.
    *   **Effect:** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. It dramatically reduces the remaining probability of "Tariffs lawful" and shifts that probability mass to "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling."

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's conceptually walk through the update for the "Tariffs lawful" option.

1.  **Prior:** Start with P(Lawful) = 20%. The prior odds are 0.20 / 0.80 = 1-to-4.
2.  **Update on Lower Courts:** The consensus in lower courts against the tariffs makes the "Lawful" outcome less likely. The likelihood ratio is unfavorable. The odds might shift to 1-to-8, for a new P(Lawful) ≈ 11%.
3.  **Update on Oral Arguments:** This is the strongest evidence. The likelihood ratio P(skepticism | Lawful) / P(skepticism | Not Lawful) is very small, perhaps 1/10. Applying this to the current odds: New Odds = (1/8) * (1/10) = 1/80. This would imply a posterior probability for "Lawful" of around 1.2%. To be more conservative and account for the unreliability of oral arguments, I will update to a less extreme but still very low posterior.

The probability mass taken from "Tariffs lawful," "Other ruling," and "No 2025 ruling" must be redistributed. Most of it goes to "Tariffs unlawful" and "Mixed ruling." A complete rejection of the tariffs ("Unlawful") seems more probable than a partial one ("Mixed") because the core legal arguments (IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs at all; major questions doctrine) would likely apply to both the trafficking and reciprocal tariffs. However, a mixed ruling is a very plausible outcome, as it allows the Court to curb the most expansive claim of power (reciprocal tariffs) while showing some deference on the more traditional security-related claim (trafficking tariffs).

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily reliant on the reported skepticism at oral argument and the Court's recent trend on the major questions doctrine.
*   **Could I be wrong?** Yes. Justices sometimes use oral arguments to test theories and may vote differently than their questions suggest. A powerful dissent or a change of heart from a key justice like the Chief Justice could lead to a different outcome. The principle of deference in national security is a powerful one, and the Court may ultimately decide it cannot substitute its judgment for the President's in a declared emergency. This is the primary scenario for a "Tariffs lawful" outcome.
*   **Alternative Forecast:** The best alternative forecast would increase the probability of a "Mixed ruling" to be the most likely outcome. The argument would be that this path allows the Court to strike a compromise, reining in executive overreach on economic policy while preserving presidential power for more traditional security threats. This would attract a broader, more stable majority.
*   **Adjustment:** I believe my current ordering ("Unlawful" > "Mixed" > "Lawful") is correct, as the legal flaws seem to apply to the entire tariff scheme. However, the possibility of a compromise ruling is significant. I will ensure "Mixed ruling" has a substantial probability assigned to it. The chances for "Other" and "No 2025 ruling" are small but non-zero, accounting for unexpected procedural issues or delays in a contentious case.

### 6. Final Normalization

After weighing the priors and the evidence, I have distributed the probabilities as follows, ensuring they sum to 100%.

*   **Tariffs unlawful (56%):** This is the most likely outcome. The combination of the major questions doctrine, the clear constitutional role of Congress in setting tariffs, and the reported skepticism from a majority of justices makes a complete rejection of this novel use of IEEPA the leading scenario.
*   **Mixed ruling (31%):** This is the second most likely outcome. The Court could draw a distinction between the trafficking tariffs (with a colorable, if weak, national security link) and the reciprocal tariffs (pure economic policy), striking down the latter while upholding or remanding the former.
*   **Tariffs lawful (8%):** This is a low-probability outcome. It would require the Court to prioritize presidential deference in foreign affairs above all other concerns, setting aside the major questions doctrine and separation of powers issues.
*   **No 2025 ruling (3%):** A delay into 2026 is possible if the opinion-writing process is unusually difficult and contentious, but unlikely given the expedited schedule.
*   **Other ruling (2%):** A procedural dismissal after granting expedited review on a major national issue is highly improbable.
