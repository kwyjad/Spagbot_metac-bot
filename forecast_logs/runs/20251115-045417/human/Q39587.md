### **Research Plan**

**1. Core Questions to Investigate:**

*   **Q1: Base Rate Analysis:** What is the historical frequency of protests in France exceeding 600,000 participants according to the Ministry of the Interior (MoI)? What were the triggers for these events? This will establish a relevant reference class.
*   **Q2: Recent Mobilization Capacity:** Analyze the trajectory of the recent protests in September/October 2025. What does the decline in numbers from >500k to 195k signify? Is this typical, or does it signal protest fatigue?
*   **Q3: Causal Mechanisms & Triggers:** What are the primary drivers that could escalate the current situation to a >600k protest? Specifically, what is the status of union unity (the "intersyndicale"), the likelihood of the government using Article 49.3 of the constitution, and public sentiment towards the specific austerity measures (e.g., abolishing holidays)?
*   **Q4: Timeline & Constraints:** What is the parliamentary and social calendar between now (November 15, 2025) and the deadline (January 1, 2026)? The short, 1.5-month window, which includes the Christmas holiday period, is a major constraint that needs to be assessed.

**2. Search Queries for Each Question:**

*   **Q1 (Base Rate):**
    *   `historique manifestations France chiffres ministère intérieur` (history of protests France Ministry of Interior numbers)
    *   `plus grandes manifestations France depuis 2000 chiffres police` (largest protests in France since 2000 police numbers)
    *   `chiffres manifestations réforme des retraites 2023 ministère intérieur` (protest numbers pension reform 2023 Ministry of Interior)
*   **Q2 (Recent Mobilization):**
    *   `analyse mobilisation sociale France automne 2025` (analysis of social mobilization France autumn 2025)
    *   `dynamique participation manifestations France septembre octobre 2025` (participation dynamics protests France September October 2025)
    *   `fatigue militante syndicats France 2025` (activist fatigue unions France 2025)
*   **Q3 (Mechanisms & Triggers):**
    *   `position intersyndicale budget 2026 Lecornu` (position of inter-union coalition on Lecornu's 2026 budget)
    *   `probabilité recours article 49.3 budget 2026` (probability of using article 49.3 for 2026 budget)
    *   `sondage opinion mesures austérité France 2025` (opinion poll on austerity measures France 2025)
    *   `réaction publique suppression jours fériés France` (public reaction to removal of public holidays France)
*   **Q4 (Timeline & Constraints):**
    *   `calendrier parlementaire examen budget 2026 France` (parliamentary calendar for 2026 budget review France)
    *   `agenda social syndicats France fin 2025` (social agenda unions France end of 2025)
    *   `impact fêtes de fin d'année sur les mobilisations sociales` (impact of end-of-year holidays on social mobilizations)

**3. Synthesis of Findings:**

My research indicates that while the 600,000 MoI threshold is high, it has been met multiple times during recent major social conflicts, notably the 2023 pension reform protests. The current situation shares key ingredients with those past events: an unpopular government policy driven by budget constraints and a unified union front. However, there are critical differences. The most significant is the observed *decline* in protest numbers between September and October 2025, suggesting waning momentum or "protest fatigue" after the intense (and ultimately unsuccessful) 2023 mobilizations. Furthermore, the extremely short time horizon of ~6 weeks, which includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays, traditionally a period of demobilization, presents a formidable obstacle. The government's likely use of Article 49.3 to pass the budget is a known trigger, but its impact may be lessened if the public is already resigned to the outcome.

**4. Drafting the Comprehensive Answer:**

I will now structure these synthesized findings into the required format for the research brief.

### **Research Brief**

**To:** Bayesian Forecasting Panel
**From:** Lead Researcher
**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Subject:** Forecast Update: Probability of a ≥600,000 Participant Protest in France Before 2026

### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Major Social Conflicts in France (post-2000):** This is the most relevant class. In the last 20 years, France has experienced several major social conflicts (e.g., 2006 CPE, 2010/2019/2023 pension reforms) that have produced protests exceeding 600,000 participants (MoI figures). During the 2023 pension reform crisis, this threshold was crossed at least three times in a 3-month period. This suggests that during an active, high-stakes conflict, the probability of such an event in a 1.5-month window is substantial, perhaps in the **30-50% range**.
2.  **Any 1.5-Month Period in France (2010-2025):** Looking at any arbitrary 1.5-month period over the last ~15 years, the base rate is very low. There have been perhaps 5-10 such protest days in ~180 months. This gives a naive base rate of **<5%**. This class is less useful as it ignores the current, highly contentious context.
3.  **Protests Against Austerity Budgets:** Protests specifically against general austerity (as opposed to a single, visceral issue like pensions) have historically struggled to achieve the same peak mobilization. The base rate for this specific trigger reaching the 600k threshold is likely lower than for pension reforms, perhaps in the **15-25% range** for a crisis period.

*Reasoning:* The current situation is clearly a "major social conflict," making the first reference class the most appropriate starting point. The specific trigger (austerity) suggests we should adjust downwards slightly, as per the third class.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-09-08** Bayrou government falls — ↑ — The ousting of a PM over the budget demonstrates the issue's political potency and the government's weakness, emboldening opposition.
*   **2025-09-09** Lecornu appointed PM — ↓ — Lecornu signals policy continuity, but a new government can temporarily reset the political dynamic and disrupt opposition momentum.
*   **2025-09-18** Nationwide protest draws >500,000 (unions) — ↑ — This initial high turnout confirms unions have the capacity to mobilize close to the required threshold, establishing a credible threat.
*   **2025-09-24** Talks between unions and PM judged "unproductive" — ↑ — Failure of dialogue closes off an exit ramp for de-escalation and makes further street confrontation more likely.
*   **2025-10-02** Second nationwide protest draws 195,000 (MoI) — ↓↓ — This sharp drop-off is the most significant recent event, suggesting protest fatigue and a failure to build momentum from the September peak.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Union Unity & Strategy (Large):** The "intersyndicale" (a unified front of all major unions) was the engine of the 2023 protests. Its continued cohesion is essential for mass mobilization. A call for a general, rolling strike would be a major escalation.
*   **Government's Use of Article 49.3 (Moderate):** The government lacks a stable majority and is widely expected to use Article 49.3 to force the budget through parliament. This is often perceived as anti-democratic and can trigger a backlash, boosting protest numbers.
*   **Salience of Specific Measures (Moderate):** Abstract "€44 billion in cuts" is less motivating than concrete, unpopular measures. The proposal to abolish two public holidays is a highly salient grievance that could broaden the protest base beyond union loyalists.
*   **Protest Fatigue (Large):** The French public underwent a prolonged and intense (but ultimately unsuccessful) protest cycle over pension reform in 2023. There is a significant risk that the appetite for repeated, large-scale mobilization is diminished. The October turnout supports this.
*   **Timeline & Holiday Season (Moderate):** The very short ~6-week window before year-end, which includes the Christmas holidays, is a powerful demobilizing force. Organizing a massive protest during this period is logistically and culturally difficult.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Waning Momentum:** Unlike the 2023 pension protests where participation generally built over the first few events, the current cycle has started high and dropped sharply. This is a significant bearish signal.
*   **Proximity to Prior Conflict:** This crisis comes on the heels of

To forecast the probability of a political protest with at least 600,000 participants in France before 2026, we will follow the structured Bayesian reasoning process.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection:** The most relevant reference class is major social conflicts in France post-2000, where protests have exceeded 600,000 participants during high-stakes conflicts. Historical data suggests that during such periods, the probability of a protest reaching this size in a 1.5-month window is substantial, estimated in the **30-50% range**.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the current context of political instability and austerity measures, I will start with a prior probability of **40%**.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a contentious budget and political instability, similar to past events that triggered large protests.
- **Differences:** The recent decline in protest numbers and the short timeline, including the holiday season, are significant differences that could reduce the likelihood of reaching the 600,000 threshold.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence 1:** The ousting of the Prime Minister and appointment of a new one suggests political instability, which historically increases protest likelihood. This evidence slightly increases the probability.
- **Evidence 2:** The initial protest with over 500,000 participants shows strong mobilization capacity, increasing the probability.
- **Evidence 3:** The sharp drop to 195,000 participants in the subsequent protest suggests protest fatigue, significantly decreasing the probability.
- **Evidence 4:** The use of Article 49.3 could trigger backlash, but its impact may be lessened by public resignation, providing a moderate increase in probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 0.4 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.67
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the evidence, the likelihood ratio is approximately 0.5 (due to the significant drop in protest numbers).
- **Posterior Odds:** 0.67 * 0.5 = 0.335
- **Posterior Probability:** 0.335 / (1 + 0.335) ≈ 0.25 or 25%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The initial high prior may have been optimistic given the recent decline in protest numbers.
- **Tail Risks:** A sudden political scandal or highly unpopular measure could reignite protests.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A more conservative estimate might focus on the logistical challenges and protest fatigue, suggesting a lower probability.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential biases, the final forecast is adjusted to reflect the significant challenges in reaching the 600,000 threshold within the given timeframe.

Final: 25%

# Will there be a political protest with at least 600,000 participants in France before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on the frequency of protests exceeding 600,000 participants in France.

The most relevant reference class is major social conflicts in France since 2000, particularly those involving austerity measures or significant government reforms. From the research, we know:

- During the 2023 pension reform protests, the 600,000 threshold was crossed at least three times in a 3-month period
- Protests specifically against general austerity measures (rather than specific issues like pensions) have historically struggled to achieve the same peak mobilization
- The base rate for protests exceeding 600,000 participants during a major social conflict in a 1.5-month window is estimated at 30-50%
- For protests specifically against austerity budgets, the base rate is lower, around 15-25% during a crisis period

Given that we're dealing with austerity measures (€44 billion budget squeeze) and have only about 1.5 months until the end of 2025, I'll set my prior at **20%**. This reflects the lower end of the range for austerity-specific protests during a crisis period, accounting for the short timeframe.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- There is an active social conflict over unpopular government policy (austerity measures)
- Unions have mobilized and called for nationwide protests
- The government lacks a stable majority and may use Article 49.3 to force the budget through
- There are specific, salient grievances (e.g., proposal to abolish two public holidays)

**Differences from base case:**
- The timeframe is extremely short (only ~6 weeks) and includes the Christmas holiday period, which typically reduces mobilization
- There's evidence of declining momentum: protest participation dropped from >500,000 to 195,000 between September and October 2025
- This crisis follows closely after the intense but ultimately unsuccessful 2023 pension reform protests, suggesting possible protest fatigue
- The current Prime Minister is newly appointed, which can temporarily reset political dynamics

These differences, particularly the declining momentum and the holiday season constraint, suggest we should adjust our prior downward.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: September 18 protest with >500,000 participants**
- P(E|H): If a 600,000+ protest will occur, it's very likely (0.9) we would have seen a 500,000+ protest already
- P(E|~H): If no 600,000+ protest will occur, it's moderately likely (0.4) we would still see a 500,000+ protest
- Likelihood ratio: 0.9/0.4 = 2.25
- This evidence increases the probability

**Evidence 2: October 2 protest with only 195,000 participants (sharp decline)**
- P(E|H): If a 600,000+ protest will occur, it's unlikely (0.2) we would see such a sharp decline in participation
- P(E|~H): If no 600,000+ protest will occur, it's quite likely (0.7) we would see declining participation
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.7 = 0.29
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Talks between unions and PM judged "unproductive"**
- P(E|H): If a 600,000+ protest will occur, it's very likely (0.8) that talks would be unproductive
- P(E|~H): If no 600,000+ protest will occur, it's still fairly likely (0.6) that talks would be unproductive
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.6 = 1.33
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: Short timeframe including holiday season**
- P(E|H): If a 600,000+ protest will occur, we would still have this timeframe constraint (1.0)
- P(E|~H): If no 600,000+ protest will occur, we would still have this timeframe constraint (1.0)
- Likelihood ratio: 1.0/1.0 = 1.0
- This evidence is neutral but important for context

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with our prior of 20% (odds of 1:4), let's update based on the evidence:

**Update based on Evidence 1 (September 18 protest):**
- Prior odds: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 2.25
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 2.25 = 0.5625
- Posterior probability: 0.5625/(1 + 0.5625) = 0.36 or 36%

**Update based on Evidence 2 (October 2 protest decline):**
- Prior odds: 0.36/0.64 = 0.5625
- Likelihood ratio: 0.29
- Posterior odds: 0.5625 × 0.29 = 0.163
- Posterior probability: 0.163/(1 + 0.163) = 0.14 or 14%

**Update based on Evidence 3 (unproductive talks):**
- Prior odds: 0.14/0.86 = 0.163
- Likelihood ratio: 1.33
- Posterior odds: 0.163 × 1.33 = 0.217
- Posterior probability: 0.217/(1 + 0.217) = 0.18 or 18%

After incorporating all the evidence, our posterior probability is approximately 18%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the impact of specific austerity measures like abolishing public holidays, which could trigger stronger public reaction
- The research doesn't mention the role of non-union actors (students, yellow vests) who could amplify protests
- I might be overweighting the significance of the October decline, which could be a temporary lull rather than a trend

**Alternative scenarios:**
- The government could announce additional unpopular measures that reignite protest momentum
- A unified call for a general strike by all unions could rapidly escalate participation
- The use of Article 49.3 could trigger a stronger-than-expected backlash

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might put the probability at 30-35%, arguing that:
1. The 500,000+ protest in September shows mobilization capacity exists
2. The October decline was due to tactical pausing by unions to build energy for a larger showdown
3. The Christmas period could be strategically used by unions to maximize economic impact

**Rebuttal:**
While these points have merit, the evidence of declining momentum is strong, and the historical pattern suggests that protests against general austerity (versus specific issues like pensions) struggle to maintain peak mobilization. Additionally, the holiday period presents genuine logistical challenges for organizing massive protests.

After this consideration, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 20% to account for these potential scenarios.

## 6. Final Forecast

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The most appropriate reference class is the frequency of protests exceeding 600,000 participants (according to the Ministry of the Interior) during periods of major social conflict in France. The current standoff over the 2026 austerity budget clearly qualifies as such a conflict.

Looking at recent major conflicts:
*   **2023 Pension Reform:** This threshold was crossed at least three times (Jan 31, Mar 7, Mar 23) within a three-month period. This suggests that during an intense, active conflict, the probability of such an event occurring in a given 1.5-month window is high.
*   **Other Conflicts (e.g., 2010 Pension Reform, 2006 CPE):** These also produced mobilizations of this scale.

However, protests specifically against broad "austerity" have sometimes struggled to achieve the same peak numbers as those against a single, highly visceral issue like pension age.

Balancing these, a reasonable prior for a protest of this magnitude occurring in a 1.5-month window *during an established major social conflict* is approximately **35%**. This acknowledges the proven capacity for mobilization (like in 2023) but tempers it slightly for the less focused nature of an "austerity" protest.

Prior P(H) = 35% (Prior Odds ≈ 0.54, or roughly 1:2).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

The current situation is similar to the base case of a major French social conflict in that it involves a unified union front ("intersyndicale") opposing an unpopular government policy. The government's lack of a stable majority also mirrors the recent political context, making controversial legislative tools likely.

However, there are two critical differences that make this situation weaker than the 2023 pension reform benchmark:
1.  **Protest Fatigue:** The current conflict comes immediately after the prolonged, intense, and ultimately unsuccessful mobilization against pension reform in 2023. There is a high risk that activists and the general public have a diminished appetite for another sustained street battle.
2.  **Waning Momentum:** Unlike the 2023 protests where participation numbers were sustained or grew over the initial events, the current cycle has shown a sharp decline. This is a significant departure from the typical pattern of a movement building towards a peak.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event that a protest with ≥600,000 participants occurs before 2026.

*   **Evidence 1: The protest on Oct 2 drew 195,000 participants (MoI), a sharp drop from the initial mobilization in September.**
    *   P(E | H): It is unlikely, though not impossible, for a movement to experience such a dramatic drop in participation and then rebound to achieve a peak of over 600,000. This would require a powerful new catalyst.
    *   P(E | ~H): This pattern is very typical of a protest movement that is losing steam and failing to broaden its base.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) is significantly less than 1.** This is strong evidence against the event occurring.

*   **Evidence 2: The remaining timeframe is ~6 weeks and includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays.**
    *   P(E | H): Organizing a massive national protest during the holiday season is extremely difficult. While not impossible (e.g., the Gilets Jaunes), it acts as a powerful demobilizing force.
    *   P(E | ~H): It is very common for social movements to pause or wind down during this period.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is less than 1.** This evidence decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: The government is expected to use Article 49.3, and the budget contains saliently unpopular measures (e.g., abolishing two public holidays).**
    *   P(E | H): A massive protest would likely be triggered by a specific, anger-inducing event. The use of Article 49.3 combined with a measure as tangible as removing holidays is a very plausible catalyst for such a surge.
    *   P(E | ~H): The government may use 49.3 regardless, and the public may be angry but too fatigued or disorganized to mobilize in sufficient numbers.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is greater than 1.** This is the primary mechanism through which the event *could* still happen, providing a clear potential trigger. It pushes the probability up.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

We start with a prior of 35% (Odds ≈ 0.54).

The most crucial piece of evidence is the sharp drop in participation in October. This is not a forecast but a hard data point about the movement's current trajectory. This evidence is strong enough to warrant a significant downward revision. An LR of perhaps 0.25 is appropriate.

*   **Step 1: Update for Waning Momentum.**
    *   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ 0.54 × 0.25 = 0.135
    *   This translates to a new probability of 0.135 / (1 + 0.135) ≈ **12%**.

Now, we consider the other factors. The holiday timeline further pushes this down (LR < 1), while the potential for a 49.3/holiday-abolition backlash pushes it up (LR > 1). These factors are speculative and likely have a smaller, partially offsetting effect. The holiday constraint is a near-certainty, while the backlash is a possibility. The net effect of these two factors will likely decrease the probability slightly further. For instance, a negative LR of 0.7 for the timeline and a positive LR of 1.3 for the trigger would result in a combined LR of ~0.9, nudging the 12% down to around 11%.

The posterior probability is therefore anchored in the low teens, primarily due to the observed protest fatigue and waning momentum.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My analysis hinges heavily on the drop in protest numbers being indicative of terminal decline. Could I be wrong?
*   **Alternative Scenario:** The unions could be playing a long game, intentionally holding a smaller mobilization in October to conserve energy for an all-out push when the government formally uses Article 49.3. In this view, the 195,000 was a placeholder, not a sign of weakness.
*   **Rebuttal:** This is strategically risky and counterintuitive. Social movements thrive on momentum. Ceding the narrative of momentum to the government is a significant gamble. Furthermore, it doesn't negate the powerful demobilizing effect of the upcoming holiday season.
*   **Overconfidence Check:** The 600,000 threshold is high but has been met before. The French capacity for social "explosions" should not be underestimated. A single event could galvanize public opinion unexpectedly. My forecast of ~11-13% is low, but it is not 1-5%; it correctly leaves room for this tail risk. The core of the forecast remains that the *observed evidence* points strongly against a successful mobilization in the short time remaining.

The reasoning appears robust. The negative evidence is more concrete (observed numbers, fixed calendar) than the positive evidence (speculative reaction to a future event).

### 6. Final Forecast

The base rate for a protest of this size during a major conflict is significant (around 35%). However, this is not a typical conflict. The clear evidence of waning momentum and protest fatigue, combined with the severe time constraint imposed by the upcoming holiday season, are powerful negative indicators. While a specific government action like using Article 49.3 on an unpopular measure could serve as a trigger, it would need to overcome a great deal of inertia. The probability of this happening is low.

Final: 13%
