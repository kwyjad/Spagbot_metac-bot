### Reference class & base rates
1.  **States of Emergency under President Noboa (2023-Present):** Since taking office, Noboa's administration has frequently used states of emergency to address security crises. The most significant was the nationwide (24 provinces) declaration in January 2024, which established an "internal armed conflict." This class suggests a high propensity for broad, security-focused declarations. The base rate for *any* province being under a state of emergency during his tenure is high, perhaps 40-50% of the time, with the number of provinces often being either 0, a handful (3-7), or all 24.
2.  **States of Emergency for Major Social/Indigenous Protests (2019-2025):** Major protests, particularly led by the indigenous confederation CONAIE over economic policies like fuel subsidies, have historically triggered states of emergency (e.g., under President Moreno in 2019 and Lasso in 2022). These are intense but tend to resolve through negotiation after 2-4 weeks. This class suggests a pattern of declaration followed by dialogue and eventual lifting. The base rate for a protest-driven state of emergency lasting more than 60 days is low.
3.  **Constitutional Limits on States of Emergency:** The Ecuadorian Constitution limits states of emergency to 60 days, with one possible 30-day extension. The Constitutional Court actively reviews these declarations and has previously struck down or limited those it deems unjustified. This creates a structural bias towards shorter durations. A base rate derived from this would suggest that any given 60-day declaration has a <50% chance of being active 80 days after its inception.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-04** Declaration of a 60-day state of emergency in 10 provinces due to protests over diesel subsidy cuts. — ↑ — Establishes the initial scope and trigger of the current crisis.
*   **2025-10-06** State of emergency expanded to 16 provinces. — ↑ — Shows the crisis was escalating in its early days, requiring a broader government response.
*   **2025-10-07** Government alleges an assassination attempt on President Noboa's convoy in Cañar province during the protests. — ↑ — Significantly hardens the government's stance, frames protesters as violent criminals, and makes a negotiated de-escalation much less likely.
*   **2025-10-08** (Implied) President Noboa explicitly blames the Venezuelan cartel "Tren de Aragua" for the protests and threatens terrorism charges. — ↑ — This rhetoric escalates the conflict from a social protest to a national security threat, justifying a prolonged and robust state response.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Noboa's "Mano Dura" (Iron Fist) Policy:** The administration's core political identity is built on a hardline security stance. Backing down from protesters, especially after framing them as terrorists, would be politically costly. (Large driver for ↑)
2.  **Protest Persistence & Grievances:** The removal of fuel subsidies is a deeply felt economic issue that has historically fueled sustained, large-scale protests. The underlying grievance is unlikely to disappear quickly. (Large driver for ↑)
3.  **Constitutional Court Intervention:** The Court is the primary institutional check on the executive's power to declare and extend states of emergency. It could rule an extension unconstitutional, forcing the government to lift it. (Moderate driver for ↓)
4.  **Negotiation & Dialogue:** Despite the harsh rhetoric, back-channel or public negotiations between the government and indigenous leaders (CONAIE) could lead to a deal that ends the protests and the state of emergency. (Moderate driver for ↓)
5.  **Holiday Season De-escalation:** There may be political and social pressure to de-escalate a major internal conflict ahead of the Christmas holidays to allow for travel and economic activity. (Small driver for ↓)
6.  **Conflation with Organized Crime:** By linking protests to cartels, the government can use the ongoing "internal armed conflict" as a pretext to extend or issue a new state of emergency, even if protests subside. (Large driver for ↑)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Strategic Conflation of Actors:** Unlike previous protest-driven crises (e.g., 2019, 2022), the Noboa administration has immediately and forcefully blamed transnational organized crime for social protests. This changes the political calculus from negotiation to combat.
*   **Personalization of the Conflict:** The alleged assassination attempt on the President makes the conflict existential for the administration. This is a significant departure from past protests, which were primarily clashes over policy, not perceived threats to the head of state.
*   **Pre-existing Security Framework:** The ongoing "internal armed conflict" declared in January 2024 provides a legal and narrative foundation for the government to take extraordinary measures, which was not in place during prior major protests.
*   **Noboa's Political Position:** Noboa's political brand is heavily invested in projecting strength. Unlike his predecessors who were often seen as weak or forced to negotiate, Noboa's political survival may depend on not caving to pressure.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** The current 60-day state of emergency is scheduled to expire in early December, before the resolution date. A reasonable prior, based on the temporary nature of these declarations, would be centered on 0 provinces, but with a fat tail acknowledging the possibility of renewal (e.g., 60% chance of 0, 40% chance of >0). Equivalent n=5 (weak prior).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The government's rhetoric (terrorism, cartels) and the alleged assassination attempt have escalated the situation beyond a typical protest, making a simple expiration and return to normalcy highly unlikely.
    *   (↑ Large) The underlying cause (subsidy cuts) is a core policy, suggesting the government is prepared for a sustained confrontation rather than a quick reversal.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The precedent of the nationwide "internal armed conflict" shows this administration's preference for broad, long-lasting security measures over targeted, temporary ones.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The Constitutional Court remains a significant wildcard and could block an extension, forcing the number to 0.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests the crisis will persist past the initial 60-day period. The posterior should shift dramatically away from 0 and toward a high number of provinces. The most likely outcomes are a renewal covering the same 16 provinces or an escalation to a nationwide (24 province) declaration.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Official announcements of failed talks or refusal to negotiate with protest leaders.
    *   Further violent clashes between security forces and protesters.
    *   Government presenting "evidence" (e.g., captured weapons, suspect confessions) linking protesters to cartels.
    *   A formal request by the President to the Constitutional Court to extend the state of emergency.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Formation of a negotiation table with CONAIE and other social movements, possibly with third-party mediation (e.g., the Catholic Church).
    *   A preliminary ruling or statement of concern from the Constitutional Court regarding the current declaration's scope or basis.
    *   A significant rollback or modification of the diesel subsidy policy.
    *   Statements from protest leaders announcing a "truce" or pause for dialogue.

To forecast the number of provinces in Ecuador that will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The historical use of states of emergency in Ecuador, particularly under President Noboa, suggests a high propensity for such declarations. The base rate for any province being under a state of emergency during his tenure is high, with notable instances of either no provinces, a handful (3-7), or all 24 provinces being under emergency.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Given the historical context, a reasonable prior distribution might center around 0 provinces with a significant probability mass on higher numbers, reflecting the possibility of a broad declaration. The variance would be high due to the potential for both low and high outcomes.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves significant protests, similar to past instances where states of emergency were declared.
- **Differences:** The current crisis is escalated by allegations of cartel involvement and an assassination attempt on the President, which are not typical in past protest scenarios. This suggests a shift towards a more severe and prolonged state of emergency.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Increased Likelihood of High Values:**
  - The government's rhetoric and framing of the protests as linked to terrorism and organized crime increase the likelihood of a prolonged and extensive state of emergency.
  - The persistence of the underlying economic grievances (fuel subsidy cuts) suggests sustained unrest.
  - The administration's "Mano Dura" policy and political identity make backing down unlikely.
- **Decreased Likelihood of High Values:**
  - The Constitutional Court's potential intervention could limit the duration or scope of the emergency.
  - Possible negotiations or de-escalation due to the holiday season could reduce the number of provinces under emergency.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Assume a prior with a mean around 0 but with a significant probability of higher numbers.
- **Evidence Impact:** The evidence strongly suggests a shift towards higher numbers due to the government's hardline stance and the framing of the crisis as a national security issue.
- **Posterior Shift:** The posterior distribution shifts towards a higher mean, with increased variance to account for the possibility of both a broad declaration and potential court intervention.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of overestimating the government's ability to maintain a prolonged state of emergency without judicial or public backlash.
- **Tail Risks:** The risk of a nationwide declaration (24 provinces) is non-negligible given the current rhetoric and security framing.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A scenario where negotiations lead to a reduction in emergency measures is plausible but currently less likely.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecasted distribution for the number of provinces under a state of emergency on December 25, 2025, is as follows:

P10: 0  
P20: 8  
P40: 16  
P60: 20  
P80: 22  
P90: 24

# Forecast: How many provinces in Ecuador will be in a state of emergency on December 25, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Historical States of Emergency in Ecuador (2019-2025):**
- Under President Noboa (2023-present): Nationwide (24 provinces) in January 2024 for gang violence
- Current situation: 16 provinces as of October 6, 2025
- Previous protest-driven states of emergency (2019, 2022): Typically lasted 2-4 weeks before negotiated resolution

The constitutional limit is 60 days with a possible 30-day extension (90 days total). The current declaration began October 4, 2025, so the initial 60 days would end around December 3, 2025.

**Prior Distribution:**
- Mean/Median: ~5 provinces
- Spread: 0-24 provinces with significant mass at 0 (expired) and 16-24 (renewal/expansion)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Involves indigenous-led protests over economic policies (fuel subsidies)
- Constitutional constraints remain the same (60+30 day maximum)
- Same president (Noboa) with consistent security-focused approach

**Key differences:**
- Unprecedented framing of protesters as terrorists/cartel-affiliated
- Alleged assassination attempt against President Noboa
- Builds on existing "internal armed conflict" framework from January 2024
- Timing: The current 60-day period ends ~December 3, with Christmas falling within a potential 30-day extension period

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for higher numbers:**
- Noboa's rhetoric linking protests to Tren de Aragua cartel (strong upward push, ~3x likelihood)
- Alleged assassination attempt against Noboa (strong upward push, ~2.5x likelihood)
- Precedent of nationwide declaration in January 2024 (moderate upward push, ~1.5x likelihood)
- Underlying economic grievance (fuel subsidies) remains unresolved (moderate upward push, ~1.5x likelihood)

**Evidence for lower numbers:**
- Constitutional Court oversight could block extension (moderate downward push, ~0.7x likelihood)
- Holiday season pressure for normalization (weak downward push, ~0.9x likelihood)
- Historical pattern of negotiated resolutions to protests (weak downward push, ~0.9x likelihood)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 5 provinces with significant probability at 0 and 16-24.

**First update - Security framing and assassination claim:**
- This dramatically shifts the posterior toward higher values
- The likelihood ratio strongly favors 16+ provinces over 0 provinces
- Posterior mean shifts from ~5 to ~12 provinces

**Second update - Constitutional timing:**
- The initial 60 days expires around December 3
- For provinces to be under emergency on December 25, an extension is required
- This creates a bimodal distribution: either 0 (expired) or 16+ (extended)
- The posterior probability of 0 decreases but remains significant (~25%)
- The posterior probability of 16+ increases substantially (~65%)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the government's willingness to maintain emergency powers during Christmas
- I might be underestimating the Constitutional Court's independence and willingness to block extensions
- The situation could evolve significantly between now (November 15) and December 25

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Rapid de-escalation: Negotiations succeed, protests end, emergency lifted (→ 0 provinces)
- Targeted approach: Emergency maintained only in provinces with active protests (→ 5-10 provinces)
- Nationwide escalation: Violence increases, leading to all 24 provinces under emergency

**Adjustments:**
- Increasing the probability of intermediate outcomes (5-15 provinces)
- Slightly increasing the probability of 0 provinces to account for constitutional constraints

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 12
P60: 16
P80: 20
P90: 24

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

The primary base rate is the typical duration and outcome of states of emergency in Ecuador, particularly those triggered by social protests. The Ecuadorian Constitution limits a state of emergency to 60 days, with a single 30-day extension possible. The current declaration from October 4/6, 2025, is set to expire in early December, before the resolution date of December 25.

Historically, protest-driven states of emergency are intense but often resolve through negotiation before reaching the 90-day maximum. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court often acts as a check on executive power, sometimes limiting or blocking extensions.

Therefore, a reasonable prior distribution would be heavily skewed towards zero. The initial 60-day period will have ended. For the state of emergency to be active on Dec 25, it would need to be extended. Let's set a prior probability of 60% that the state of emergency will have been lifted (0 provinces) and a 40% chance that it is extended or replaced, covering a high number of provinces (e.g., 16 or more). This results in a bimodal prior with a primary mode at 0 and a secondary mode in the 16-24 range. The median of this prior is 0.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:** The trigger for the crisis—the removal of fuel subsidies—is a classic driver of major indigenous-led protests in Ecuador, similar to the events of 2019 and 2022. The key actors (the government vs. social movements like CONAIE) are familiar.

**Differences:** The current situation deviates significantly from the base case in several critical ways:
1.  **President Noboa's Stance:** Unlike his predecessors who were often forced to negotiate, President Noboa has built his political brand on a hardline ("mano dura") security policy. Backing down would severely damage his political identity.
2.  **Conflict Framing:** The government has immediately and aggressively framed the protests not as a social issue but as "narco-terrorism" linked to the Venezuelan cartel "Tren de Aragua." This narrative was massively amplified by the allegation of an assassination attempt on the President.
3.  **Legal Precedent:** The ongoing "internal armed conflict" declared in January 2024 provides a pre-existing legal and political framework for the government to justify prolonged and sweeping security measures, conflating social protest with organized crime.

These differences make a simple de-escalation and return to normalcy, as seen in past protest cycles, much less likely. The government has transformed a political dispute into a national security crisis.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

*   **Evidence 1: Expansion from 10 to 16 provinces (Oct 4-6).** This shows an escalating crisis in its early days, making a quick resolution less probable. This evidence pushes the forecast **up**.
*   **Evidence 2: Alleged assassination attempt and "terrorism" rhetoric.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence. By framing the opposition as terrorists who tried to kill the president, the government has made negotiation politically toxic and a prolonged security response almost necessary. This evidence makes a high number of provinces on Dec 25 vastly more likely than zero. This is a very strong update **upwards**.
*   **Evidence 3: Constitutional Court's role.** The Court is the primary mechanism that could force the number to zero by blocking an extension. This is the strongest evidence for a lower outcome. However, its power may be diminished when faced with a government arguing a national security emergency involving an assassination attempt. This evidence pushes the forecast **down**, but its effect is dampened by the government's narrative.
*   **Evidence 4: Christmas Holiday.** There is social and economic pressure to de-escalate before the holidays. This provides a small push **downwards**, but it is likely to be a secondary concern if the government perceives the situation as an existential security threat.

The net effect of the evidence is a massive shift away from the prior's median of 0. The likelihood of a prolonged state of emergency is now much higher than the likelihood of it expiring.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

*   **Prior:** 60% chance of 0 provinces, 40% chance of >0 provinces (likely 16-24).
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence (especially the assassination claim and terrorism framing) is far more consistent with a prolonged state of emergency than a short one. The likelihood ratio of this evidence given a prolonged vs. short state of emergency is very high (e.g., >5:1).
*   **Conceptual Update:**
    *   Prior Odds (prolonged / short) = 40 / 60 = 2/3.
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (2/3) * 5 = 10/3.
    *   This implies a posterior probability of a prolonged state of emergency of roughly 10 / (10+3) ≈ 77%.
*   **Posterior Shape:** The probability of 0 provinces has decreased from 60% to ~23%. The bulk of the probability mass (77%) has shifted to high-end outcomes. The two most plausible high-end scenarios are:
    1.  An extension of the current state of emergency, covering the same **16 provinces**.
    2.  An escalation to a new, nationwide state of emergency, justified by the "terrorism" narrative, covering all **24 provinces**.
    These two scenarios seem roughly equally likely. The posterior distribution is now strongly bimodal, with a small mode at 0 and a large, broad mode spanning 16 to 24. The median has shifted from 0 to approximately 16.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is heavily reliant on the government's rhetoric being a true signal of its intentions. What if it's a bluff? The government could be using this harsh language as a negotiating tactic to enter talks from a position of strength, intending to de-escalate before Christmas. In this scenario, the number could easily be 0. The Constitutional Court could also act more decisively than I anticipate, viewing the government's claims as a pretext and striking down any extension. This is the most plausible path to a low outcome.

Conversely, am I underestimating the high end? The situation could deteriorate further, making a nationwide (24 province) declaration not just a possibility but a near-certainty. The alleged assassination attempt is a Rubicon-crossing event that may make any de-escalation impossible for Noboa.

My distribution accounts for the "bluff/Court" scenario by assigning a ~25% probability to 0 provinces. It accounts for the high-end risk by placing significant weight on 24 provinces. The bimodal shape (0, or 16/24) seems robust to these critiques, as a middle-ground outcome (e.g., 5-10 provinces) appears unlikely given the polarized situation.

### 6. Final Percentiles

The final distribution reflects a roughly 25% chance of the state of emergency being lifted (0 provinces) and a 75% chance of it being extended or escalated. Within that 75%, the probability is split between an extension covering the current 16 provinces and an escalation to all 24.

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 16
P60: 16
P80: 24
P90: 24
