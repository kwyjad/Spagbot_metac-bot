### Reference class & base rates
1.  **New Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs):** This class includes treaties like the Minamata Convention on Mercury or the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. From initiation of formal negotiations to securing 10 ratifications/signatures typically takes 3-7 years. The base rate of an MEA achieving 10 state commitments within 3 years of a major proposal (like the 2022 Non-Use initiative) is perhaps 10-20%. The rate for this happening in the final 1.5 months of that period is extremely low, likely <1%.
2.  **Technology Prohibition Treaties (Arms Control Analogy):** This class includes the Ottawa Treaty (anti-personnel landmines) and the Convention on Cluster Munitions. These are often driven by a coalition of "like-minded" states against the opposition of major powers. This process, from the start of a concerted diplomatic push to reaching 10+ signatories, typically takes 2-5 years. The base rate of success in under 3 years is low, maybe 5-10%.
3.  **Rapid International Responses to Crises:** This class involves swift diplomatic action following a clear, undeniable event (e.g., responses to a specific act of aggression, a pandemic, or a major industrial disaster). Such responses can produce agreements in months. However, solar geoengineering (SG) lacks a single focusing event or crisis, making this reference class a poor fit, but it provides an upper bound on the speed of diplomacy. The base rate for this question falling into this class is near 0%.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-10** UNFCCC COP30 begins in Belém, Brazil. — **↓** — The agenda is dominated by the second Global Stocktake and climate finance. SG is not a formal negotiation track, making the emergence of a new binding treaty text exceptionally unlikely.
*   **2025-10-22** A coalition of Global South nations issues a statement at a pre-COP meeting calling for a precautionary approach to SG. — **↔/↓** — While it signals opposition, it calls for more research and governance discussions under UN auspices, not an immediate treaty. This reinforces the "go slow" dynamic, not a rapid ban.
*   **2025-09-18** The European Parliament releases a report on climate risks, reiterating its call for a global non-use agreement. — **↔** — This is a restatement of a long-held position. It does not create a new diplomatic process or indicate that a treaty is imminent.
*   **2025-07-05** A prominent US tech billionaire publicly announces funding for a major SG research initiative. — **↓** — This action deepens the geopolitical divide, likely hardening the resolve of pro-research states and making a consensus-based restriction agreement harder to achieve.
*   **2025-06-12** A side event on SG governance at the Bonn Climate Change Conference ends without consensus on a path forward. — **↓** — Demonstrates the continued deep divisions between nations on whether to research, regulate, or prohibit SG, showing no progress since the UNEA-6 stalemate in 2024.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Institutional Inertia & Timelines:** International treaty-making is a slow, multi-stage process (negotiation, legal scrubbing, signature, domestic ratification). The 1.5-month horizon is fundamentally at odds with this reality. (Large, negative driver).
2.  **Geopolitical Polarization:** The primary fault line is between a pro-research bloc (often including the US) and a precautionary/pro-ban bloc (including the EU, the African Group, and some Latin American states). This stalemate prevents the consensus needed for a treaty. (Large, negative driver).
3.  **Focusing Event / "Taboo" Catalyst:** A rogue SG experiment with negative consequences or a catastrophic climate event blamed on inaction could rapidly accelerate political will. The absence of such an event means the issue lacks urgency. (Potential for large, positive impact, but currently absent).
4.  **Scientific Ambiguity:** Unlike ozone depletion, the science on SG is nascent and contested. This allows both proponents and opponents to claim the mantle of scientific prudence ("we must research it" vs. "the risks are too great to even research"), preventing a consensus from forming. (Moderate, negative driver).
5.  **Leadership from a "Middle Power" Coalition:** A group of influential states could champion a treaty process outside the main UN bodies, similar to the Ottawa Process for landmines. While the Non-Use Agreement initiative exists, it has not yet been formally championed by a critical mass of states. (Potential for moderate, positive impact, but currently absent).

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The remaining ~45-day window is far shorter than any plausible reference class timeline for negotiating and committing to a new international treaty.
*   **Pre-emptive Nature:** Most MEAs address existing, measurable harms (e.g., mercury poisoning, ozone depletion). This question concerns a pre-emptive ban on a technology that has not been deployed at scale, making the threat feel less tangible to some policymakers.
*   **Lack of a Formal Negotiating Venue:** Unlike the Paris Agreement (which had the UNFCCC) or the Minamata Convention (UNEP), there is currently no agreed-upon, active diplomatic track dedicated to negotiating an SG treaty. The failure to establish one at UNEA-6 in 2024 was a critical setback.
*   **Deep Division on the Core Problem:** In past MEAs, there was general agreement on the problem (e.g., "CFCs are bad"). Here, there is fundamental disagreement on whether SG is a potential solution to be researched or an existential threat to be banned.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the reference class of new MEAs and the question's 3-year timeframe, might have been around 10-15% (equivalent n≈10), acknowledging the difficulty but possibility of such an agreement.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The failure at UNEA-6 in March 2024 to even establish a formal assessment process. This was the most promising path and its closure signals deep deadlock.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The procedural impossibility of negotiating, finalizing, and securing 10 binding state commitments to a new treaty in under two months.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The continued lack of a state-led coalition championing a ban, with advocacy remaining primarily in the academic/NGO space.
    *   **↓ (Small):** Recent events (e.g., new US research funding) that reinforce, rather than resolve, the core geopolitical divisions on the issue.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence overwhelmingly points downward. The posterior probability should be revised to a very low value, close to the procedural floor for such an event occurring.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A surprise announcement at COP30 of a "coalition of the willing" signing a pre-negotiated pact.
    *   A joint declaration by a major geopolitical bloc (e.g., the EU and the African Union) committing to fast-track a specific treaty text.
    *   A major, undeniable climate-related catastrophe that is publicly and credibly linked to the need for radical solutions or the risks of SG.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The final COP30 text contains either no mention of SG or only a non-binding call for "further dialogue."
    *   Key developing countries (e.g., India, Brazil) issue statements supporting the right to research SG.
    *   The conclusion of 2025 without any formal diplomatic meeting being scheduled to discuss an SG treaty.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definitional Gotcha:** The term "treaty obligation" is a high bar. A "politically binding" declaration or a non-binding UN resolution would not suffice but could be mistaken for a positive resolution by observers.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** A sudden, unauthorized, and impactful SG experiment could theoretically trigger a rapid backlash and a quick agreement among a bloc of nations.
*   **Closed-Door Diplomacy:** While unlikely for a 10-country multilateral pact, a small group of nations could have been negotiating in secret and could announce a finalized agreement unexpectedly.
*   **Amendment/Protocol Route:** A group of countries could attempt to add a protocol restricting SG to an existing treaty (e.g., the Convention on Biological Diversity or the ENMOD Convention). This is a procedural shortcut but still highly improbable on this timeline.

**Final Research Summary:** The resolution of this question in the affirmative is exceptionally unlikely. The combination of a deeply polarized political landscape, the absence of a formal negotiating process, and the procedural realities of international law make the timeline of under two months for ten countries to undertake a "treaty obligation" a near impossibility.

To forecast the probability of at least ten countries committing to a diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026, let's apply Bayesian reasoning:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for new multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) achieving 10 state commitments within 3 years is approximately 10-20%. Given the extreme time constraint of less than two months, the base rate for this specific scenario is extremely low, likely less than 1%. This is because the typical timeline for such agreements is much longer, and the current geopolitical and procedural context does not favor rapid agreement.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The process of forming an MEA typically involves multiple countries and requires consensus, similar to the current situation.
   - Differences: The current situation lacks a formal negotiating venue, has deep geopolitical divisions, and involves a pre-emptive ban on a technology not yet widely deployed. These differences significantly reduce the likelihood of a rapid agreement compared to the base case.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Failure at UNEA-6:** The inability to establish a formal assessment process at UNEA-6 indicates deep deadlock, decreasing the probability of an agreement.
   - **Procedural Impossibility:** The short timeline makes it procedurally impossible to negotiate and secure commitments, further decreasing the probability.
   - **Lack of State-led Coalition:** The absence of a state-led coalition championing a ban decreases the probability.
   - **US Research Funding:** Recent funding for SG research by a US billionaire reinforces geopolitical divisions, decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: Let's assume a prior probability of 1% (odds of 0.01).
   - Likelihood ratio: Given the overwhelming negative evidence, the likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1.
   - Posterior odds: Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.01 × (very small number) = very small number.
   - Posterior probability: This results in a posterior probability close to 0%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence Check: Consider the possibility of a "black swan" event or secret negotiations, but these remain highly unlikely given the current evidence.
   - Alternative Forecast: The best alternative scenario involves a sudden geopolitical shift or focusing event, but this is not supported by current indicators.
   - Adjustments: Given the lack of positive indicators and the strong negative evidence, the probability remains very low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the probability of at least ten countries committing to a diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026 is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will at least ten countries commit to a diplomatic agreement restricting solar geoengineering before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for countries committing to international agreements restricting emerging technologies or environmental practices.

Relevant reference classes include:
- New Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)
- Technology prohibition treaties
- Rapid international responses to emerging threats

Looking at historical patterns of environmental treaties:
- The Montreal Protocol (ozone depletion) took about 2 years from proposal to adoption with 46 signatories
- The Minamata Convention on Mercury took about 4 years from negotiation to adoption
- The Paris Climate Agreement took several years of negotiation
- The Convention on Biological Diversity took about 3 years

For technology prohibition treaties:
- The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons took about 1 year from negotiation to adoption
- The Convention on Cluster Munitions took about 1.5 years

However, the key constraint here is the extremely short timeframe - we're in November 2025, with only about 1.5 months remaining before the deadline.

**Prior probability**: Given the typical timeline for international agreements (2-4 years) and the extremely short window remaining (1.5 months), I'll set a very low prior of 2%. This reflects the procedural reality that international treaties typically require extensive negotiation, drafting, legal review, and formal adoption processes that rarely conclude in under 2 months.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Solar geoengineering is an environmental/technological issue that fits within existing international governance frameworks
- There is an existing initiative calling for a Non-Use Agreement
- Environmental treaties often gain momentum when risks become apparent

**Key differences**:
- **Extremely compressed timeline**: With only ~45 days remaining until 2026, there is virtually no time for the normal treaty negotiation process
- **Lack of formal negotiating venue**: Unlike successful treaties, there appears to be no active diplomatic track dedicated to negotiating a solar geoengineering treaty
- **Pre-emptive nature**: Most environmental treaties address existing harms, while solar geoengineering restrictions would be pre-emptive
- **Geopolitical division**: There appears to be a fundamental split between pro-research and precautionary/pro-ban countries
- **No focusing event**: There hasn't been a catastrophic event to catalyze urgent action

These differences significantly reduce the probability below the already low base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Lack of formal negotiating process**
- P(E|H): If a treaty were imminent, we would almost certainly see an active formal negotiation process. Probability ≈ 0.05
- P(E|~H): If no treaty is imminent, we would expect no formal process. Probability ≈ 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.053 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 2: Recent developments showing continued division**
- The June 2025 Bonn Climate Change Conference side event ended without consensus
- A US tech billionaire announced major SG research funding in July 2025, deepening divisions
- P(E|H): If a treaty were imminent, we would expect convergence, not divergence. Probability ≈ 0.1
- P(E|~H): If no treaty is imminent, continued division is expected. Probability ≈ 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.9 = 0.11 (strong evidence against)

**Evidence 3: Upcoming COP30 agenda**
- COP30 begins November 10, 2025, but solar geoengineering is not on the formal agenda
- P(E|H): If a treaty were imminent, it would likely be a major agenda item. Probability ≈ 0.2
- P(E|~H): If no treaty is imminent, it would likely not be a major agenda item. Probability ≈ 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.8 = 0.25 (moderate evidence against)

**Evidence 4: European Parliament's continued call for a non-use agreement**
- The EP reiterated its position in September 2025, showing some political will exists
- P(E|H): If a treaty were imminent, we would expect such statements. Probability ≈ 0.7
- P(E|~H): Even without an imminent treaty, such statements are somewhat likely. Probability ≈ 0.5
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.5 = 1.4 (weak evidence in favor)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 2%/98% = 0.0204

First update (lack of formal process):
Posterior odds = 0.0204 × 0.053 = 0.0011
Posterior probability = 0.0011/(1+0.0011) = 0.11%

Second update (continued division):
Posterior odds = 0.0011 × 0.11 = 0.00012
Posterior probability = 0.00012/(1+0.00012) = 0.012%

Third update (COP30 agenda):
Posterior odds = 0.00012 × 0.25 = 0.00003
Posterior probability = 0.00003/(1+0.00003) = 0.003%

Fourth update (European Parliament statement):
Posterior odds = 0.00003 × 1.4 = 0.000042
Posterior probability = 0.000042/(1+0.000042) = 0.004%

This extremely low probability reflects the procedural near-impossibility of negotiating, finalizing, and securing 10 country commitments to a new treaty in under two months, especially given the current state of international discussions.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Secret negotiations**: Countries could have been negotiating privately and might be ready to announce a pre-negotiated agreement.
   - This is unlikely given the divisive nature of the issue and lack of leaks, but possible.

2. **Rapid response to a crisis**: An unforeseen climate disaster in the next month could trigger emergency action.
   - While possible, even crisis response typically takes months for formal treaties.

3. **Amendment to existing treaty**: Countries might add a protocol to an existing treaty rather than creating a new one.
   - This could be procedurally faster but still highly unlikely in the timeframe.

4. **Definition of "commitment"**: The question specifies "treaty obligation," which is a high bar. A non-binding declaration would not qualify.

5. **Overconfidence in procedural constraints**: I might be overestimating the minimum time needed for treaty processes.
   - However, historical precedent strongly supports my timeline assessment.

After considering these factors, I believe my forecast may be slightly too low. While the procedural constraints are real, I should account for some small possibility of unexpected developments.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the extremely short timeframe (1.5 months), lack of formal negotiating process, continued geopolitical division on the issue, and the procedural realities of international treaty-making, the probability of 10+ countries committing to a treaty obligation restricting solar geoengineering before 2026 is extremely low.

However, to account for unforeseen possibilities like secret negotiations or emergency responses to a crisis, I'll adjust my final probability slightly upward from the calculated 0.004%.

Final: 0.5%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether at least ten countries will commit to a new diplomatic agreement on a specific topic within a very short timeframe (before January 1, 2026, with the forecast being made on November 13, 2025).

An appropriate reference class is the finalization of new multilateral treaties. The process of negotiation, legal review, translation, and securing high-level political mandate for commitment (e.g., signature) typically takes many months, if not years, even after a draft text has been agreed upon. The base rate for a new treaty, for which no public draft text or formal negotiation process exists, to be finalized and committed to by 10 countries in under 48 days is exceptionally low. A generous estimate for such an event, which would require an unprecedented acceleration of normal diplomatic procedure, would be less than 1%.

I will set the initial prior probability P(H) at **1%**. This acknowledges that while procedurally almost impossible, it is not physically impossible.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case for a successful treaty involves a multi-year process with clear stages: formal negotiations within an established venue (like a UN body), circulation of draft texts, and a well-publicized signing conference.

*   **Similarities:** The topic of solar geoengineering (SG) is of global importance, similar to other issues covered by Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs). There is an active civil society campaign (the Non-Use Agreement initiative) which is often a feature of successful prohibition treaties.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The most critical difference is the remaining ~48-day window. This is fundamentally incompatible with the standard timeline of the base case.
    *   **Lack of a Negotiating Venue/Text:** Unlike successful treaties, there is no agreed-upon diplomatic forum for negotiating an SG treaty, nor is there a publicly known and accepted draft text. The failure to even establish a formal assessment group at the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-6) in early 2024 highlights this lack of a starting point.
    *   **Deep Political Division:** While most treaties have holdouts, the division on SG is more fundamental. Major powers and blocs are not just disagreeing on details; they disagree on the basic premise of whether SG should be researched or banned outright. This prevents the formation of the critical mass of consensus needed to even start a negotiation.

The current situation is significantly more challenging and less advanced than the typical successful treaty process, making a positive outcome far less likely than the base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "at least 10 countries commit to an SG restriction treaty by 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: Failure at UNEA-6 (March 2024) to create a formal SG assessment process.**
    *   P(E1 | H): The probability of this failure, if a treaty were to be signed within two years, is very low. A successful treaty would almost certainly be preceded by formal steps in the relevant UN body.
    *   P(E1 | ~H): The probability of this failure, if no treaty is forthcoming, is very high. It is a direct reflection of the political deadlock.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (LR):** P(E1|H)/P(E1|~H) is very small (<< 1). This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The UNFCCC COP30 (Nov-Dec 2025) agenda does not include a formal negotiation track for an SG treaty.**
    *   P(E2 | H): If a treaty were to be finalized and signed by the end of 2025, the year's primary climate conference would be the most logical venue. Its absence from the formal agenda is highly indicative that no such outcome is planned.
    *   P(E2 | ~H): If no treaty is planned, it is very likely that SG would not be on the formal agenda.
    *   **LR:** Very small (<< 1). This evidence also strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Continued public divergence, with some actors (US tech) funding research while others (EU Parliament) reiterate calls for a ban.**
    *   P(E3 | H): This level of open polarization is unlikely if a consensus agreement involving 10+ countries was imminent.
    *   P(E3 | ~H): This polarization is the expected state of affairs given the lack of progress towards a treaty.
    *   **LR:** Small (<< 1). This evidence decreases the probability.

All available evidence points strongly toward the event not happening.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of P(H) = 1% (odds of 1:99), we update with the overwhelming evidence.

The combined weight of the evidence—the procedural impossibility on the timeline, the failure of the most plausible diplomatic track (UNEA), and the absence of the topic from the COP30 agenda—is immense. Each piece of evidence has a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.

Let's consider the procedural timeline alone. The likelihood of a treaty process concluding in 48 days from a standing start (P(E|H)) is perhaps 1 in 1000. The likelihood of it *not* concluding is near 1 (P(E|~H)). This single factor would reduce the odds dramatically.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:99
*   **Likelihood Ratio (for procedural impossibility):** ~1/1000
*   **Posterior Odds:** (1:99) * (1/1000) ≈ 1:99,000
*   **Posterior Probability:** ≈ 1 / 99,001 ≈ 0.001%

This formal calculation shows the probability is vanishingly small. A more qualitative approach confirms this: the prior of 1% was already generous, and all subsequent evidence is strongly negative. The posterior must be significantly lower than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My analysis points to a probability near zero. Could I be wrong?

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: A Secretly Negotiated Pact.** A "coalition of the willing" could have been negotiating a treaty in private for months and plans to unveil it as a surprise at COP30. This would bypass the public gridlock. While keeping a 10+ country negotiation secret is very difficult, it is not impossible. This is the most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: A "Black Swan" Focusing Event.** A major, undeniable climate catastrophe or a rogue SG experiment with disastrous consequences could occur in the next 48 days, creating an instant political imperative for a rapid agreement among a group of nations.
*   **Critique of my Reasoning:** My forecast is heavily reliant on the assumption that normal diplomatic processes will be followed. The "surprise pact" scenario is a direct challenge to this. How likely is it? Given the complete absence of leaks or rumors, its probability is low, but it is the primary source of uncertainty. The Metaculus community prediction is 1%, which suggests the market is pricing in this tail risk. My calculated probability of ~0.001% is likely too low as it doesn't sufficiently account for these non-standard, surprise scenarios.

To account for these tail risks, I must adjust my posterior upward from the near-zero calculated value. A probability of 1% implies a 1-in-100 chance. A surprise announcement of a pre-negotiated pact at a major conference feels like this kind of rare event. Therefore, aligning with a 1% forecast seems reasonable; it correctly captures that the event is extremely unlikely through any normal process, but leaves room for a highly improbable surprise.

### Final Forecast
The probability of at least ten countries committing to a treaty restricting solar geoengineering before 2026 is extremely low. The 48-day timeline is prohibitive for standard international law-making processes. Furthermore, the political landscape is characterized by deep divisions, and the most plausible diplomatic venues (UNEA, UNFCCC) have shown no progress toward such an agreement. The forecast, therefore, rests almost entirely on the small but non-zero probability of a surprise event, such as the unveiling of a secretly pre-negotiated pact by a "coalition of the willing" at COP30.

Final: 1%
