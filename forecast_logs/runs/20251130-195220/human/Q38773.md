### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Mature Cryonics Organizations (e.g., Alcor, Cryonics Institute):** Founded in the 1970s, these organizations exhibit slow, steady linear growth. Alcor, for example, grew from ~170 to ~240 patients in the last decade, an average of ~7 patients/year. The Cryonics Institute shows a similar rate. This suggests a base rate of **5-10 new patients per year** for an established provider.
2.  **Yinfeng's Own History (Early-Stage Growth):** From September 2020 (10 patients) to October 2025 (31 patients) is a period of 61 months. This is an increase of 21 patients, yielding an average linear growth rate of **~4.1 patients per year**. This rate is lower than mature US organizations but represents a high percentage growth (~25% CAGR) due to the low starting base.
3.  **New Cryonics Startups (e.g., Tomorrow Bio):** Newer organizations, like Yinfeng, often experience rapid initial growth as they capture pent-up local demand and early adopters. While specific numbers are sparse, their growth trajectory is characterized by high percentage increases from a near-zero base, similar to Yinfeng's early phase. This class reinforces the expectation of non-linear growth in the initial years.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-01** Cryonics Wiki reports 31 whole-body patients at Yinfeng. (↑) — This is the most crucial data point, providing a high-confidence anchor just two months before the end of the resolution period.
*   **2025-05-19** Yinfeng hosts a public "base visit" event for members. (↑) — Demonstrates active marketing and community engagement, which is a leading indicator for maintaining or increasing sign-up rates.
*   **2025-02-07** Yinfeng's collaborative research on ovarian tissue cryopreservation wins a science award. (↑) — Boosts institutional credibility and public profile, potentially attracting new clients by showcasing scientific legitimacy.
*   **2024-12-24** A documentary about Yinfeng's program is recognized with a brand-building award. (↑) — Successful public relations efforts increase awareness and can destigmatize the practice, widening the pool of potential clients.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Public Relations & Marketing:** Yinfeng is actively promoting its services via documentaries, awards, and public events. This directly drives demand and is a primary lever for growth. (Size: Moderate)
2.  **Monopoly Status:** As the only cryonics provider in China, Yinfeng faces no domestic competition. It can capture 100% of a potentially massive market, assuming demand can be cultivated. (Size: Large)
3.  **Institutional Credibility:** Association with the large Yinfeng Group and winning scientific awards lends an air of legitimacy and stability that is crucial for a service requiring immense long-term trust. (Size: Moderate)
4.  **Cultural & Legal Acceptance:** The growth rate is constrained by cultural views on death and the body in China, as well as a nascent legal framework. Shifts in public opinion or regulation could significantly alter the growth trajectory. (Size: Large)
5.  **Operational Capacity:** The physical capacity of the facility and the number of trained rapid-response teams limit the number of patients that can be accepted and serviced. (Size: Moderate)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **State/Corporate Backing:** Unlike the non-profit, member-run models of Alcor and CI, Yinfeng is part of a major biomedical conglomerate with implicit state support. This provides greater financial stability and resources for marketing and R&D.
*   **Single-Market Focus:** Yinfeng operates in a unique, massive, and culturally distinct market. Its growth is tied to the specific dynamics of Chinese society, not the global trends that influence other providers.
*   **Early Growth Phase:** Yinfeng is still in its first decade of operation. Its growth rate is more characteristic of a startup capturing an untapped market, unlike the mature, incremental growth of the 50-year-old US organizations.
*   **Integrated Research Mission:** The institute heavily emphasizes its broader life-science research (e.g., organ preservation), which may attract a different client profile and generate positive PR that is distinct from the more singular focus of older cryonics organizations.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Based on the 2020-2025 growth rate of ~4.1 patients/year, a prior distribution centered around **33-34** by year-end 2025 would be reasonable, with moderate confidence (equivalent n of ~10) reflecting the 5-year observation period.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓) **Hard Data Anchor (Oct 2025):** The report of 31 patients is strong evidence that pulls the forecast down from the simple linear extrapolation. It suggests growth is lumpy or has slightly decelerated. (Magnitude: Large)
    *   (→) **Short Resolution Horizon:** With only one month (December 2025) remaining for a new report to be published, the potential for a large increase is extremely limited. The expected increase is 4.1 * (2/12) ≈ 0.7 patients. (Magnitude: Large)
    *   (↑) **Sustained Marketing/PR Efforts:** Ongoing positive media coverage and events support the continuation of the established growth trend, making an increase from 31 more likely than stagnation. (Magnitude: Small)
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should shift significantly downward from the prior and become much more concentrated. The October data point is the dominant factor. The new distribution should be tightly clustered around a mode of **32**, with most probability mass on the values {31, 32, 33}.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A year-end press release or news article from Yinfeng.
    *   Chinese media reports celebrating a new "milestone" patient number.
    *   Announcements of new partnerships or facility expansions.
    *   Social media posts from the institute hinting at recent activity.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The absence of any new report by December 31, 2025, which would lock in the last reported number (31).
    *   Official statements focusing solely on research (e.g., organ preservation) with no mention of whole-body patient numbers.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Reporting vs. Reality:** The question resolves on the *reported* number, not the actual number. A patient cryopreserved in late 2025 might not be included in a report published before 2026.
*   **Source Reliability:** The Cryonics Wiki is a well-regarded secondary source, but an official Yinfeng press release would be definitive. We are assuming the Wiki's number is accurate.
*   **Definition of "Patient":** The count of 31 is specified as "whole-body." If Yinfeng also has "neuro" (head only) patients and a report combines them, the number could be higher. The current evidence points to a focus on whole-body preservation.
*   **Ambiguous Resolution Risk:** While a report from 2025 already exists (the Wiki source), if a forecaster is banking on a *new* report, its non-issuance is a key risk. The question will resolve to the last number reported in 2024 or 2025.

**Final Research Summary:** The forecast is strongly anchored by the October 2025 report of 31 patients. Given the historical growth rate of ~4 patients/year and the very short time remaining, the most likely outcome is a small increase of 1-2 patients, contingent on a new report being issued before 2026.

To forecast the number of patients the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute will report by 2026, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate is derived from Yinfeng's own historical growth from 2020 to 2025, which is approximately 4.1 patients per year. This is a reasonable prior given the early-stage growth phase of the institute and its unique market position in China.
   - Mean/Median: 33-34 patients by the end of 2025.
   - Variance: Moderate, reflecting some uncertainty in growth rate consistency.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarity: Yinfeng's growth pattern aligns with early-stage cryonics organizations, capturing pent-up demand.
   - Difference: The October 2025 report of 31 patients suggests a possible deceleration or lumpiness in growth, which is a critical factor for adjusting the base rate downward.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Hard Data Anchor (Oct 2025):** Strong evidence that growth may have slowed, suggesting a lower likelihood of a large increase by year-end.
   - **Short Resolution Horizon:** Limited time for significant changes, supporting a small increase.
   - **Sustained Marketing/PR Efforts:** Positive but minor influence on maintaining growth momentum.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior centered around 33-34 patients.
   - Likelihood from October 2025 data suggests a downward adjustment.
   - Posterior shifts to a tighter distribution around 32 patients, with most probability mass on 31, 32, and 33.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks: A sudden surge in patient numbers is unlikely given the short time frame and recent data.
   - Alternative scenario: If a new report is not issued, the number may remain at 31.
   - Adjustments: Ensure the forecast accounts for reporting delays and potential underreporting.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the analysis, the forecasted number of patients is tightly clustered around the current reported number with a slight increase possible.
   - Percentiles reflect a conservative estimate given the evidence and short time frame.

# Forecast: How many patients will the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute report by 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use Yinfeng's own historical growth rate as the most relevant reference class. From September 2020 to October 2025, Yinfeng grew from 10 to 31 patients over 61 months, which translates to:
- Growth rate: ~4.1 patients per year
- Starting point: 31 patients (as of October 2025)
- Time remaining: ~1 month (from October 2025 to end of December 2025)

This suggests a prior centered around 31 + (4.1 × 1/12) ≈ 31.34 patients by the end of 2025, with some variance to account for uncertainty in the growth rate.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Same organization with consistent operational model
- Continuing in the same regulatory environment
- Similar marketing and outreach strategies as evidenced by recent events

**Differences from base case:**
- Very short time horizon (only ~1 month) means we're looking at a much smaller potential increment than the annual rate would suggest
- Recent PR activities (documentary recognition, science award, public visits) might accelerate growth slightly
- The growth appears to be somewhat lumpy rather than perfectly linear, introducing timing uncertainty

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

Key evidence affecting the forecast:

1. **October 2025 patient count of 31** (strongest evidence)
   - This is a very recent data point, just one month before our forecast date
   - Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors outcomes very close to 31-32

2. **Recent PR and marketing activities**
   - Documentary recognition (December 2024)
   - Scientific award (February 2025)
   - Public base visit event (May 2025)
   - Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors higher growth than baseline (perhaps 1.2× more likely)

3. **Short time window remaining**
   - Only one month remains between latest data and resolution
   - Likelihood ratio: Strongly constrains the possible increase (at most 1-2 patients)

4. **Reporting lag consideration**
   - There may be a lag between actual cryopreservation and public reporting
   - Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors the number staying at 31 (1.1× more likely)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at ~31.34 patients, I'll update based on the evidence:

1. **Update on short time window + recent data point:**
   - Prior: ~4.1 patients/year → ~0.34 patients/month expected
   - With only one month, the most likely outcomes are:
     * No change: 31 patients (probability ~0.7)
     * +1 patient: 32 patients (probability ~0.25)
     * +2 patients: 33 patients (probability ~0.05)
   - This creates a right-skewed distribution with mode at 31

2. **Update on PR activities:**
   - This slightly increases the probability of adding at least one patient
   - Shifts some probability mass from 31 to 32
   - New approximate distribution:
     * 31 patients: ~0.65
     * 32 patients: ~0.28
     * 33 patients: ~0.06
     * 34 patients: ~0.01

The posterior distribution is now heavily concentrated around 31-32, with a mean of approximately 31.43 patients.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the reporting lag. If a patient is cryopreserved in December 2025, it might not be reported until 2026.
- I haven't fully accounted for the possibility of batch reporting (e.g., they might wait to announce multiple new patients at once).
- The question resolves based on reports published before 2026, not the actual patient count. If no new report is published after October 2025, the number would remain at 31.

**Alternative scenarios:**
- **Higher scenario:** A year-end press release in late December 2025 announces 2-3 new patients at once, bringing the total to 33-34. This is plausible if Yinfeng has a tradition of year-end reporting.
- **Lower scenario:** No new report is published after October 2025, leaving the reported number at 31. This is quite plausible given the short timeframe.

**Adjustments:**
- I should widen my distribution slightly to account for these scenarios
- I'll increase the probability of both 31 (no new report) and 33+ (batch reporting)

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here are my calibrated percentiles:

P10: 31
P20: 31
P40: 31
P60: 32
P80: 32
P90: 33

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the observed growth of the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute itself. Between September 2020 (10 patients) and October 2025 (31 patients), the institute added 21 patients over a 61-month period.

*   **Calculation:** 21 patients / (61 months / 12 months/year) ≈ 4.13 patients per year.
*   **Base Rate Distribution:** This establishes a prior expectation of slow, linear growth of approximately 4 new patients per year. For any given year, this might be modeled as a Poisson distribution with a mean (λ) of 4. This prior suggests that large annual jumps (e.g., 10+ patients) are unlikely, while stagnation (0 patients) is also possible but less likely than some growth.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is unique because the forecast horizon is extremely short. The question resolves based on reports published before January 1, 2026, and the current date is November 30, 2025. We also have a very recent, high-confidence data point.

*   **Similarity:** The underlying drivers of growth (marketing, public acceptance, operational capacity) are assumed to be consistent with the past few years, so the established growth rate of ~4 patients/year is a relevant starting point for estimating activity in the final months of 2025.
*   **Difference:** The key difference is the proximity to the resolution date. We are not forecasting growth over a full year, but rather the potential change over a three-month period (October 1 to December 31, 2025). This dramatically reduces the range of possible outcomes.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence strongly constrains the forecast to a narrow range.

*   **Dominant Evidence (Strong Anchor):** The Cryonics Wiki reports 31 whole-body patients as of October 1, 2025. This is the most critical piece of information. It provides a firm floor for the forecast (unless the report is corrected downwards, which is highly unlikely) and anchors the final number very close to 31. This evidence makes any value below 31 extremely improbable and values significantly above 31 (e.g., 40+) also highly improbable.
*   **Growth Rate Evidence (Small Upward Nudge):** The historical growth rate of ~4.1 patients/year implies an average of ~1 patient per quarter (4.1 / 4 ≈ 1.025). This suggests that the most likely change in the final quarter of 2025 is an increase of 1 patient. This evidence pushes the distribution's center of mass slightly above 31.
*   **Reporting Mechanism Evidence (Introduces Bimodality):** The question resolves on the *reported* number. There are two primary scenarios:
    1.  **No new report:** If no new report is issued in October, November, or December 2025, the last valid report is the one stating 31 patients. This scenario makes 31 a highly probable outcome.
    2.  **A new year-end report:** Given Yinfeng's active PR, a year-end summary is plausible. This report would include any patients added since the last count.
    This creates a bimodal-like distribution where there's a large probability mass at exactly 31, and another cluster of probabilities at 32, 33, etc., conditional on a new report being published.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Let's update our prior belief about the year-end 2025 number using the October 1st data.

*   **Prior:** A simple extrapolation of the 4.1 patients/year growth rate from the start (late 2017) would have predicted a number in the low 30s by end-of-2025. Let's say our prior median was ~33.
*   **Likelihood:** The evidence is "the number was 31 on Oct 1, 2025". This evidence is 100% consistent with a final number of 31 + ΔP, where ΔP is the number of patients added and reported in the final quarter.
*   **Posterior:** Our posterior belief is now a distribution for (31 + ΔP).
    *   Let's estimate the probability of a new report being issued as ~60%.
    *   If no new report (40% probability), the outcome is 31.
    *   If a new report is issued (60% probability), the outcome depends on ΔP. We can model ΔP with a Poisson distribution with λ=1 (for the single quarter).
        *   P(ΔP=0) ≈ 37%
        *   P(ΔP=1) ≈ 37%
        *   P(ΔP=2) ≈ 18%
    *   **Combined Probabilities:**
        *   P(Final = 31) = P(No Report) + P(Report & ΔP=0) = 0.40 + (0.60 * 0.37) ≈ 62%
        *   P(Final = 32) = P(Report & ΔP=1) = 0.60 * 0.37 ≈ 22%
        *   P(Final = 33) = P(Report & ΔP=2) = 0.60 * 0.18 ≈ 11%
    *   The posterior distribution is heavily concentrated at 31, with a rapidly decaying tail for higher values. The median is 31, and the mean is slightly higher, around 31.5.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **What if the report combines patient types?** The 31 figure is for "whole-body" patients. A year-end report could potentially use a broader definition, including "neuro" (head only) patients for the first time, causing a surprise jump. While Yinfeng's focus seems to be whole-body, this is a plausible upside risk. I will slightly widen the upper tail (P80, P90) to account for this.
*   **What if growth accelerated?** The recent PR and awards could have boosted sign-ups in late 2025. The rate of ~1 patient/quarter could be an underestimate. This also supports slightly more probability on the upside (33, 34).
*   **What if the Wiki is wrong?** The source is not official. An official year-end report could correct the number down to 30 or up to 32 as the *actual* October 1st number. This is a small risk but argues against being 100% certain the number is at least 31. However, given the context, 31 is the best available anchor.
*   **Conclusion:** The core logic holds, but the upper tail should be slightly fatter than the simple Poisson model suggests to account for definitional changes or a small acceleration in growth. The distribution's median should remain at 31, as the "no new report" scenario is very plausible and anchors more than 50% of the probability mass there.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The distribution is dominated by the high probability of the number remaining at the last reported value of 31. The remaining probability is spread across small increases.

P10: 31
P20: 31
P40: 31
P60: 32

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
For the number of patients reported by Yinfeng by 2026 (effectively the latest report before 2026), I select the institute's own historical growth as the base rate. From September 2020 (10 patients) to October 2025 (31 patients), this represents an increase of 21 patients over ~5 years, yielding a linear growth rate of ~4.2 patients per year. This is chosen because it's specific to Yinfeng, accounting for its early-stage status in a unique market (China), unlike mature US organizations with 5-10/year. As a prior distribution for the end-of-2025 count, I use a shifted Poisson-like distribution centered on 32 (10 + 4.2 * 5.25 years ≈ 32), with mean 32 and variance ~4 (reflecting Poisson variability for low counts and historical lumpiness).

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is similar to the base rate in terms of ongoing marketing, PR efforts, and monopoly status in China, which have driven consistent growth. However, it differs due to the very short resolution horizon (only ~1 month left as of Nov 30, 2025) and the recent anchor at 31 patients in October 2025. These limit potential upside compared to the full-year growth assumed in the base rate, making large increases unlikely and compressing the distribution toward lower values. The early-stage phase suggests possible acceleration, but cultural barriers and reporting lags matter for shifting the mean downward slightly.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **October 2025 report of 31 patients (↓ strong)**: This anchor is highly consistent with lower outcomes, as it leaves little time for additions. Likelihood ratio: makes values >33 ~5× less likely than under prior (large downward push).
- **Short remaining horizon (~1 month, ↓ strong)**: Limits growth to expected ~0.34 new patients (4.2/12), consistent with low or no increase. Makes high values 3-4× less likely.
- **Sustained PR/marketing (e.g., awards, events in 2025, ↑ mild)**: Supports continuation of growth, making small increases (1-2) ~1.5× more likely than stagnation.
- **No report since October despite 2 months passed (↓ moderate)**: Suggests possible lack of new patients in Oct-Nov, pushing down ~2× on high-end outcomes.
- Net: Evidence skews toward lower values, with small upside from PR.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
Posterior ∝ Prior × Likelihood. Starting with prior mean 32 (variance 4), the strong downward evidence from the October anchor and short horizon updates the mean to ~31.7 (subtract ~0.3 for reporting lag and time passed). For explicit update: Prior P(>33) ~0.3 (from Poisson tail). Likelihood from short horizon makes >33 half as likely (LR=0.5), so posterior P(>33) ≈ 0.3 * 0.5 / (0.3*0.5 + 0.7*1) ≈ 0.18. This compresses variance to ~1.5 (tighter due to anchor) and shifts skew slightly positive (PR effects prevent full collapse to 31). Overall, posterior mean ~31.7, mode 32, tighter spread.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast might be overconfident in the tight clustering, underestimating reporting lags or a potential year-end surge (e.g., if unreported Oct-Nov patients are revealed in December). Tail risks include no new report (resolves at 31, ~30-40% chance) or a multi-patient event (unlikely but possible in growing market, adding 3+). Alternative forecast: heavier on 31 (e.g., P(31)=0.5, mean 31.4) if assuming no year-end report is likely given recent silence—plausible due to lumpy growth and cultural factors, but rebutted by research's emphasis on PR momentum and monopoly driving small increases. I adjust by slightly increasing tail mass on 34+ (from ~5% to ~10%) to account for unreported growth or reporting surprises, broadening P90.
