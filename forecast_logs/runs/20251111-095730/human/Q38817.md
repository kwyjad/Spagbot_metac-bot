### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Post-Pandemic Annual Reported COVID-19 Deaths (2023-2024):** This is the most direct reference class. Global reported deaths saw a steep decline after the Omicron peak and the end of the official "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" in May 2023.
    *   **Base Rate:** Approximately 150,000 to 250,000 deaths per year.
        *   **2023:** Our World in Data (OWID) reports ~265,000 deaths.
        *   **2024:** OWID data suggests a further decline, with a provisional total around 140,000 deaths.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class reflects the virus's behavior in a world with high (though complex and waning) population immunity and degraded reporting infrastructure. It captures the current endemic-like state.
    *   **Limitations:** With only two data points (2023, 2024), the trend is highly uncertain. The rate of decline in reporting may not match the rate of decline in actual mortality, making extrapolation difficult.

2.  **Annual Global Deaths from Influenza:** This provides a well-established benchmark for a seasonal respiratory virus.
    *   **Base Rate:** 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year (WHO estimate).
    *   **Reasoning:** Influenza shares transmission modes and seasonality with SARS-CoV-2. It represents a potential long-term "floor" for COVID-19 mortality once it fully settles into a predictable endemic pattern.
    *   **Limitations:** SARS-CoV-2 has thus far shown less predictable seasonality and a higher mutation rate than typical influenza viruses. Furthermore, global surveillance and reporting systems for influenza are different and have been established over decades, whereas COVID reporting is newer and decaying rapidly.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-10-20** WHO releases a statement on Northern Hemisphere winter preparedness, warning of a likely seasonal increase in respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. (↑) — Officially signals the expected seasonal rise in cases and, subsequently, deaths for the final two months of the year.
*   **2025-09-30** Year-to-date (YTD) reported global deaths for 2025 cross the 100,000 mark, per OWID. (↑) — This is a hard data anchor. With three-quarters of the year passed, the final number will be heavily influenced by this existing total.
*   **2025-09-15** A new Omicron subvariant, unofficially dubbed "Pi," becomes dominant in Europe. It shows high immune evasion but no confirmed increase in intrinsic severity. (↔) — Unlikely to dramatically change the death rate per infection, but its transmissibility will fuel the winter wave, leading to more deaths overall.
*   **2025-07-01** Several large countries, including Brazil and India, transition from weekly to monthly public reporting of COVID-19 data. (↓) — This administrative change degrades data quality and timeliness, likely leading to underreporting and data "dumps" that are harder to attribute to specific dates.
*   **2025-06-10** Preliminary data on the uptake of the 2025-2026 updated COVID-19 vaccine in the Southern Hemisphere shows uptake rates below 15% in most countries, even among the elderly. (↑) — Low booster uptake leaves vulnerable populations with less protection against severe outcomes from forthcoming waves.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Year-to-Date (YTD) Accrued Deaths:** (Large) As of November 11, 2025, the vast majority (over 85%) of the year has passed. The number of deaths already reported is the primary driver of the final total. The forecast is now largely an extrapolation for the remaining ~7 weeks.
2.  **Reporting Infrastructure Decay:** (Large ↓) The single largest driver for the *reported* number. National health systems have de-prioritized COVID-19 testing and reporting. The discontinuation of major data streams (like JHU in 2023) is symptomatic of a systemic decline in data fidelity. This exerts strong downward pressure on the final reported number, irrespective of the true burden of disease.
3.  **Northern Hemisphere Seasonality:** (Moderate ↑) SARS-CoV-2 has settled into a seasonal pattern, peaking in the winter in temperate climates. The final months of 2025 (Nov-Dec) coincide with this peak, ensuring that the death rate will be higher than the mid-year average.
4.  **Viral Evolution:** (Moderate) The constant emergence of new, immune-evasive variants (e.g., the "Pi" subvariant) ensures that the virus can continue to cause waves of infection even in a highly immune population. A variant with higher intrinsic severity remains a tail risk.
5.  **Waning Hybrid Immunity & Booster Uptake:** (Moderate ↑) Immunity from past infections and vaccinations wanes over time. Very low uptake of annual boosters, especially among high-risk groups, increases the pool of individuals susceptible to severe disease and death.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **vs. Post-Pandemic COVID (2023-24):** The key difference is the advanced state of reporting decay. In 2023, many systems were still being dismantled; by late 2025, they are largely gone, and data is sparser and less reliable than in either of the previous two years.
*   **vs. Post-Pandemic COVID (2023-24):** Population immunity is now more complex and layered. An individual may have had multiple infections from different variants plus several vaccine doses, creating a heterogeneous "immune mosaic" that makes population-level outcomes harder to predict.
*   **vs. Influenza:** Unlike the established flu surveillance system, the COVID reporting framework is ad-hoc, voluntary, and politically de-prioritized. This means the reported number for COVID is likely a smaller fraction of the true number of deaths than for influenza.
*   **vs. Influenza:** Public and political attention on COVID-19 is minimal compared to influenza. There are no widespread public health campaigns or mandates, leading to lower preventative behavior (e.g., masking) and vaccine uptake than might be expected for a pathogen with this mortality level.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A prior based on the 2023-2024 trend would center around 100,000-120,000 deaths (continuing the decline from ~265k to ~140k). This prior should be weak (equivalent n≈2), reflecting the small sample size of the reference class.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) **YTD Data:** Approximately 110,000 deaths have been reported as of mid-November. This is an extremely strong signal that the final number will significantly exceed a simple trend extrapolation from 2023-2024.
    *   (↑ Moderate) **Seasonality:** We are entering the peak mortality season for the Northern Hemisphere, so the rate of death accumulation will increase in the final weeks of the year.
    *   (↓ Moderate) **Reporting Decay:** The rate of reporting is lower than in previous years. This means the observed YTD number and the upcoming winter peak will both be systematically undercounted relative to 2024, suppressing the final total.
    *   (↑ Small) **Low Booster Uptake:** Waning immunity in vulnerable populations will slightly amplify the size of the winter mortality peak.
*   **Net effect:** The YTD data is the dominant piece of evidence and forces a strong upward revision from the initial prior. The forecast is now an extrapolation problem. The prior suggested ~110k, but we are already there with 1.5 months to go. The posterior should be centered significantly higher, likely in the 125,000-145,000 range, reflecting the YTD total plus a moderate winter surge that is partially obscured by poor reporting.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Weekly death reports from OWID/WHO showing a sustained increase above 2,500/week globally.
    *   Reports of significant hospital strain or rising excess mortality from major Northern Hemisphere countries (e.g., Germany, UK, US).
    *   Identification of a new variant associated with a higher hospitalization-to-case ratio in early surveillance data.
    *   Major retrospective data revisions from large countries (e.g., India) adding deaths to the 2025 tally.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Weekly death reports remaining flat or declining through November, suggesting a muted winter wave.
    *   Major countries

To forecast the number of reported COVID-19 deaths globally in 2025, we will follow a Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The most relevant base rate is the post-pandemic annual reported COVID-19 deaths for 2023-2024, with approximately 150,000 to 250,000 deaths per year. This reflects the virus's behavior in a world with high population immunity and degraded reporting infrastructure.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** The median of this range is about 200,000, with a variance reflecting the uncertainty due to limited data points.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current situation shares the endemic-like state with high population immunity and reduced public health measures.
   - **Differences:** The reporting infrastructure has further decayed, and there is a new variant with high immune evasion, which could increase transmission.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **YTD Data (↑ Large):** Over 100,000 deaths reported by September 2025, indicating a higher total than previous years.
   - **Seasonality (↑ Moderate):** Expected increase in deaths during the Northern Hemisphere winter.
   - **Reporting Decay (↓ Moderate):** Likely underreporting due to reduced data collection efforts.
   - **Low Booster Uptake (↑ Small):** Increased vulnerability in populations due to waning immunity.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 100,000-120,000 deaths based on the declining trend.
   - **Update:** The strong YTD data and expected seasonal increase push the posterior mean higher, despite reporting decay.
   - **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The mean shifts to around 125,000-145,000 deaths, with increased variance due to uncertainties in reporting and variant impact.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a more severe variant or improved reporting, which could shift the distribution.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A muted winter wave or significant data revisions could alter the forecast.
   - **Adjustment:** Account for these tail risks by slightly widening the distribution.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the Bayesian update and red team thinking, the percentiles are adjusted to reflect the evidence and uncertainties.

P10: 115,000  
P20: 120,000  
P40: 130,000  
P60: 140,000  
P80: 150,000  
P90: 160,000

# Forecasting Global COVID-19 Deaths in 2025

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two primary reference classes to establish a prior:

**Recent COVID-19 Death Trends (2022-2024)**:
- 2022: ~1.1 million reported deaths globally
- 2023: ~265,000 reported deaths globally
- 2024: ~140,000 reported deaths (estimated based on partial data)

This shows a clear downward trend, with roughly a 50% reduction year-over-year. Extrapolating this trend would suggest around 70,000-80,000 deaths for 2025.

**Seasonal Respiratory Virus Deaths**:
- Influenza: 290,000-650,000 annual deaths globally (WHO estimate)
- RSV: 100,000-200,000 annual deaths globally

These provide a reference for endemic respiratory viruses with established seasonal patterns.

My prior distribution will be centered around 100,000 deaths (median), with a wide variance reflecting uncertainty in the continued decline rate.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate**:
- COVID-19 has established seasonal patterns similar to other respiratory viruses
- Population immunity continues to build through infections and vaccinations
- The virus remains endemic globally with no elimination in sight

**Key differences**:
- Reporting infrastructure has significantly degraded compared to 2023-2024
- The YTD total of 110,000 deaths (as of November 2025) already exceeds the expected trend
- Vaccine uptake for 2025 boosters is notably lower than previous years
- The "Pi" variant shows immune evasion properties that may drive a larger winter wave

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**YTD reported deaths (110,000 as of mid-November)**:
- This is the strongest piece of evidence, showing we've already reached the expected annual total with 1.5 months remaining
- Likelihood ratio: Strongly favors outcomes >120,000 vs. <120,000 (approximately 5:1)

**Reporting infrastructure decay**:
- Several large countries moved from weekly to monthly reporting
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors lower reported numbers (approximately 2:1)

**Northern Hemisphere winter seasonality**:
- We're entering peak COVID season in regions containing ~70% of global population
- Historical patterns show 25-40% of annual deaths occur in Nov-Dec
- Likelihood ratio: Moderately favors higher numbers (approximately 3:1)

**Low booster uptake (<15% in most countries)**:
- Creates larger vulnerable population, especially among elderly
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors higher numbers (approximately 1.5:1)

**New "Pi" variant dominance**:
- Increased immune evasion but no change in intrinsic severity
- Likelihood ratio: Slightly favors higher numbers (approximately 1.5:1)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered at 100,000 deaths, I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on YTD data (110,000 deaths by mid-November)**:
- Prior: ~100,000 deaths (50-150,000 range)
- Likelihood: Strongly favors outcomes >120,000
- Posterior: Shifts upward to ~130,000 deaths (110,000-150,000 range)

**Update on reporting decay**:
- Prior (after first update): ~130,000 deaths
- Likelihood: Moderately favors lower reported numbers
- Posterior: Slight downward adjustment to ~125,000 deaths

**Update on winter seasonality**:
- Prior (after second update): ~125,000 deaths
- Likelihood: Moderately favors higher numbers
- Posterior: Upward adjustment to ~135,000 deaths

The posterior distribution is now centered around 135,000 deaths, with increased confidence in the 120,000-150,000 range.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential overconfidence**:
- I may be overweighting recent data and underestimating uncertainty in reporting systems
- The relationship between reported and actual deaths could change dramatically

**Tail risks**:
- High: A more severe variant emerges in December, causing a spike in deaths
- Low: Major countries completely abandon COVID reporting, artificially suppressing numbers

**Alternative forecast**:
A plausible alternative would center around 100,000 deaths, arguing that:
- Reporting decay will accelerate dramatically in the final months
- The winter wave will be unusually mild due to accumulated immunity
- Many deaths will be attributed to other causes or go unreported

Rebuttal: While reporting decay is real, the YTD total of 110,000 creates a hard floor, and historical patterns strongly suggest at least some winter increase.

After considering these points, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for greater uncertainty.

## 6. Final Percentiles

P10: 115,000
P20: 122,000
P40: 132,000
P60: 140,000
P80: 152,000
P90: 165,000

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most appropriate base rate is the trend observed in reported global COVID-19 deaths in the post-pandemic era. This reference class reflects the current state of high (but waning) population immunity, viral evolution, and decaying reporting infrastructure.

*   **2023 Reported Deaths:** ~265,000 (Source: OWID, via Research Report)
*   **2024 Reported Deaths:** ~140,000 (Source: OWID, via Research Report)

This two-point trend shows a steep, ~47% year-over-year decline. A simple extrapolation would suggest a prior for the full year of 2025 in the range of 70,000 to 100,000 deaths. This prior should be considered very weak, as it's based on a tiny sample size and assumes the trend continues unabated. The median of this prior would be around 85,000 deaths.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation in November 2025 is fundamentally different from a forecast made at the start of the year. The problem is no longer a full-year prediction but an extrapolation for the final ~7 weeks of the year based on already-accrued data.

*   **Similarity:** The underlying drivers (seasonality, viral evolution, waning immunity) are consistent with the 2023-2024 period.
*   **Difference:** The most significant difference is the availability of year-to-date (YTD) data. As of mid-November 2025, the vast majority of the year's data is already "in the books." This makes the initial base rate almost irrelevant, as it has been superseded by hard evidence. The problem shifts from "what will the total be?" to "how many more deaths will be reported in the last 51 days?"

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The provided research report contains several crucial pieces of evidence that must be used to update the now-obsolete prior.

1.  **YTD Deaths (as of mid-November): ~110,000.** This is the single most powerful piece of evidence. It provides a hard floor for the final number and completely invalidates the initial prior of ~85,000. This evidence has an extremely high likelihood ratio for outcomes >110,000 and a likelihood of zero for outcomes <110,000.
2.  **Northern Hemisphere Seasonality (↑):** The final 7 weeks of the year (mid-Nov to end-Dec) coincide with the winter peak for respiratory viruses in the Northern Hemisphere, where a majority of the global population lives. This makes it highly likely that the average daily death rate will be *higher* than the YTD average. This pushes the forecast upwards.
3.  **Reporting Infrastructure Decay (↓):** The report notes that major countries have reduced reporting frequency. This exerts a strong downward pressure on the *reported* number. While the true winter wave may be significant, the portion that is officially counted will be blunted. This tempers the upward adjustment from seasonality.
4.  **Low Booster Uptake (↑):** Low vaccination rates among the vulnerable will likely lead to a higher number of severe outcomes and deaths during the winter wave than would otherwise occur, providing a moderate upward push to the forecast for the remainder of the year.
5.  **New "Pi" Variant (↔):** The emergence of a new, immune-evasive variant ensures a winter wave will occur. However, its lack of increased intrinsic severity means it is unlikely to cause a catastrophic increase in deaths, keeping the forecast within a "normal" seasonal range.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A weak distribution centered around 85,000 for the full year.
*   **Update 1 (YTD Data):** The observation of 110,000 deaths by mid-November is overwhelming. The posterior distribution is now anchored at a value greater than 110,000. The problem becomes an extrapolation.
    *   Deaths so far: 110,000 in ~314 days (~350 deaths/day).
    *   Days remaining: 51.
    *   Linear extrapolation (baseline): 110,000 + (51 days * 350/day) = 110,000 + 17,850 ≈ 128,000.
*   **Update 2 (Seasonality vs. Reporting Decay):** We must adjust the daily rate for the final 51 days. Seasonality and low booster uptake suggest the rate should be higher than 350/day. Reporting decay suggests the *reported* increase will be muted. I estimate these factors result in a net increase in the reported daily rate of 20-30% for the final period.
    *   Adjusted rate: 350/day * 1.25 = ~438 deaths/day.
    *   Additional deaths: 51 days * 438/day ≈ 22,300.
    *   **Posterior Median:** 110,000 + 22,300 ≈ **132,300**.
*   The posterior distribution is now much narrower and centered around 132,000. It is strongly right-skewed because of the hard floor at 110,000.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
*   **Overconfidence Check:** The primary uncertainty is the net effect of the winter wave versus reporting decay over a short 7-week period. My estimate of a 25% net increase in the daily rate is a judgment call.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Forecast too high):** Reporting could decay faster than expected into the holiday season, with major data lags. The winter wave could be very mild. In this case, the final number might be closer to the linear extrapolation of ~128,000.
*   **Alternative Scenario (Forecast too low):** A major country could release a large retrospective data revision, adding tens of thousands of deaths from earlier in the year to the 2025 total. This is a known feature of COVID data reporting. This creates a significant fat right tail for the distribution. The winter wave could also be substantially worse than anticipated.
*   **Adjustment:** The possibility of a large data dump is the most significant tail risk. I will widen my upper percentiles (P80, P90) to account for this possibility, creating a more pronounced right skew in my final distribution. My median remains robust, but the upper range of possibilities is wide.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final distribution is anchored by the 110,000 deaths already reported. The median is based on a moderate winter wave partially obscured by poor reporting. The lower percentiles reflect a very mild wave or severe reporting lags, while the upper percentiles account for a stronger-than-expected wave and the significant tail risk of a retrospective data dump from a major country.
