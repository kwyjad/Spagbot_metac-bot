### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Post-Cold War Era (1992-Present).** In the 33 years since the dissolution of the USSR, 31 new members have joined the UN, an average of ~0.94 per year. However, this period is front-loaded with former Soviet and Yugoslav republics. This class suggests a non-trivial annual probability but is likely an overestimate due to the unique historical context.
-   **Reference Class 2: 21st Century (2001-Present).** In the last 24 years, 5 new members have joined (Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Montenegro, South Sudan, Tuvalu), for a rate of ~0.21 per year, or roughly a 21% chance of a new member in any given year. This is a more conservative and likely more relevant reference class.
-   **Reference Class 3: Period of Geopolitical Stability/Stasis (2012-Present).** In the ~14 years since South Sudan joined, zero new members have been admitted. This suggests a base rate approaching zero, reflecting a period where the "low-hanging fruit" of state formation has been picked and remaining candidates are locked in intractable disputes.

**Reasoning:** The 21st Century class provides a reasonable starting point, but the long recent drought (Class 3) is a powerful signal that the underlying conditions have changed. A blended base rate would be very low, perhaps in the low single digits for any given 14-month period.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2025-09-10** 79th UN General Assembly session opens. (→) This is a procedural event but creates the venue for any potential membership vote before the deadline.
-   **2025-05-08** UN Security Council extends UNMISS mandate in South Sudan. (→) A routine event, but the abstentions by China and Russia highlight ongoing P5 divisions, which are relevant to any membership vote.
-   **2024-11-05** U.S. Presidential Election results confirmed. (↓) The continuation of or a return to established U.S. foreign policy makes a sudden reversal on the Palestinian veto highly improbable within the forecast horizon.
-   **2024-10-28** Spain, Ireland, Norway, and Slovenia reaffirm joint recognition of Palestinian statehood. (↑) Small effect. Shows growing European support for Palestine in the GA, but does not overcome the U.S. veto in the Security Council.
-   **2024-04-18** U.S. vetoes UN Security Council resolution recommending full UN membership for Palestine. (↓) This is the single most important recent event, demonstrating a hard block on the most plausible candidate. The vote was 12-1 (US veto), with 2 abstentions (UK, Switzerland).

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **UNSC P5 Veto Power (Large):** This is the primary mechanism. A single veto from the US, UK, France, China, or Russia can and does block any membership application, regardless of GA support. This is the main barrier for all top candidates.
-   **Major Geopolitical Realignment (Large):** A sudden, dramatic shift in relations between P5 powers (e.g., a US-China grand bargain, a post-conflict resolution involving Russia) could change veto calculations, but this is a very low-probability event.
-   **Successful Peace Treaty / Independence Referendum (Large):** A definitive, internationally-brokered peace deal creating a new state with the consent of the parent state (e.g., a two-state solution for Israel/Palestine, a Serbia-Kosovo deal) would remove the primary obstacle to membership.
-   **Broad Diplomatic Campaign (Small/Moderate):** Sustained pressure from a large bloc of nations (e.g., the Arab League, African Union) can force a vote and build momentum, but it has historically been insufficient to overcome a P5 veto.
-   **Emergence of a "Clean" Candidate (Moderate):** The formation of a new state through a peaceful, consensual process without a direct link to a P5 conflict (e.g., Bougainville's independence from Papua New Guinea) would have a much higher chance of success than current candidates.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Nature of Candidates:** Unlike the 1990s/2000s candidates (e.g., post-Soviet states, Timor-Leste, South Sudan), which often emerged from broad international consensus, today's primary candidates (Palestine, Kosovo, Taiwan) are at the heart of intractable sovereignty disputes directly involving P5 members or their closest allies.
-   **Heightened P5 Polarization:** The current geopolitical environment is significantly more confrontational than in the early 2000s. Tensions over Ukraine, Taiwan, and other issues make the Security Council a venue for conflict rather than consensus, reducing the likelihood of agreement on any contentious issue.
-   **Absence of Consensual State Dissolution:** The base rate was previously driven by the relatively orderly dissolution of the USSR and Yugoslavia, and consensual secessions. There are no similar processes poised to conclude before 2026.
-   **Extremely Short Time Horizon:** With just over two months until the resolution date, the time for the slow, deliberate diplomatic and procedural steps required for admission is virtually non-existent, barring a sudden, shocking development.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a low prior derived from the "21st Century" reference class, adjusted downwards by the 14-year gap since the last admission. An initial probability of ~2-5% for a new member in a ~14-month period seems plausible (equivalent n of ~20-50 observations).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Large) The April 2024 U.S. veto on Palestinian membership is strong evidence that the primary obstacle for the most likely candidate remains firmly in place.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The highly polarized P5 dynamic, reinforced by recent votes on other matters, lowers the probability of consensus on any new member.
    -   (↓ Large) The extremely short time horizon (<3 months) makes the multi-stage process of SC recommendation and GA vote practically impossible to initiate and complete.
    -   (↑ Small) Growing GA-level recognition for Palestine provides a slight counterweight but is insufficient to overcome the core veto mechanism.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the null hypothesis. The posterior probability should be revised significantly downward from an already low prior, approaching a floor near zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A surprise announcement of a U.S. policy shift on Palestinian statehood.
    -   The scheduling of an emergency UN Security Council session to vote on state membership.
    -   A sudden, comprehensive peace agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
    -   A joint statement by all P5 members supporting a new candidate.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Official statements from any P5 member reaffirming their intent to veto a specific candidate's application.
    -   The UN General Assembly session proceeding with no mention of new membership on its agenda.
    -   Failure of any ongoing diplomatic talks related to potential new states.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Black Swan Events:** The model assumes no sudden state collapse, declaration of a union between states, or major war that redraws maps and forces a UN response.
-   **Procedural Ambiguity:** While unlikely, a creative interpretation of UN charter rules or a procedural maneuver to circumvent a veto (e.g., via a "Uniting for Peace" style resolution) could be attempted, though its legitimacy would be heavily contested.
-   **Focus on Top Candidates:** The analysis assumes the most likely candidates are the known ones. A surprise candidate emerging from a peaceful separation (e.g., a Scottish independence vote followed by rapid UK acceptance) is a remote but non-zero possibility, though not on this timeline.
-   **Resolution Criteria:** The question resolves on the *official number* of member states. This is straightforward and unlikely to be ambiguous.

**Final Research Summary:** The path to UN membership is blocked for all plausible candidates by the veto power of a P5 Security Council member. Given the extremely short timeline and the entrenched, polarized geopolitical landscape, the probability of this changing before 2026 is exceptionally low.

To forecast the probability of the United Nations having more than 193 member states before January 1, 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Reference Class 3: Period of Geopolitical Stability/Stasis (2012-Present)** is most relevant, as it reflects the current geopolitical climate where no new members have been admitted in the last 14 years. This suggests a base rate approaching zero.
- **Base Rate:** Given the historical data and current geopolitical context, a base rate of approximately 1% per year for new membership seems reasonable. For the 14-month period in question, this translates to a prior probability of about 1.2%.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the base case in that there are no ongoing processes or negotiations that are likely to result in new UN memberships within the short timeframe.
- **Differences:** The heightened geopolitical tensions and entrenched positions of P5 members make it even less likely for any new membership to be approved compared to the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **U.S. Veto on Palestinian Membership (April 2024):** Strong evidence against new membership, as it shows the most likely candidate is blocked. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **P5 Polarization:** Further decreases the probability of consensus on new members. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Short Time Horizon:** The procedural requirements for new membership are unlikely to be met in the remaining time. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Growing GA Recognition for Palestine:** Slightly positive but insufficient to overcome a veto. Likelihood ratio slightly more than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 1.2% translates to odds of 0.012 / 0.988.
- **Likelihood Ratios:** The combined effect of the evidence is strongly negative, suggesting a likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × combined likelihood ratio (approaching zero).
- **Posterior Probability:** Given the strong negative evidence, the posterior probability is revised downward to near zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise diplomatic breakthrough or a new candidate emerging unexpectedly. However, given the current evidence, these scenarios remain highly unlikely.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast considering a sudden geopolitical shift might suggest a slightly higher probability, but this is not supported by current evidence.
- **Adjustment:** No significant adjustment needed; the probability remains very low.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, the probability of the UN having more than 193 member states before January 1, 2026, is extremely low.

Final: 0%

# Will the United Nations have more than 193 member states before January 1, 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several reference classes to establish a prior:

**Reference Class 1: Recent History (2012-Present)**
- No new UN members since South Sudan joined in 2011
- 0 new members in ~14 years
- This suggests a base rate approaching 0% for any given year

**Reference Class 2: 21st Century (2001-Present)**
- 5 new members in 24 years (Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Montenegro, South Sudan, Tuvalu)
- Rate of ~0.21 new members per year
- For a ~14-month period (now until Jan 1, 2026), this suggests ~2.5% probability

**Reference Class 3: Post-Cold War (1992-Present)**
- 31 new members in 33 years, but heavily front-loaded with former Soviet/Yugoslav republics
- This reference class is less relevant due to the unique historical circumstances

I'll select a prior based primarily on Reference Class 2, but weighted toward the more recent drought in admissions. Given the short timeframe (only about 2 months remaining until resolution), I'll set a prior of **1.5%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The formal UN admission process remains unchanged (requiring Security Council recommendation and General Assembly approval)
- The same P5 veto power exists in the Security Council
- Many of the same candidate states (Palestine, Kosovo, Taiwan) have been seeking membership for years

**Key differences:**
- **Extremely short timeframe**: With only about 2 months left until resolution, there is virtually no time for the typically lengthy admission process
- **Heightened P5 polarization**: Current geopolitical tensions between Security Council permanent members are significantly higher than during previous admission periods
- **Nature of candidates**: Unlike earlier admissions that often emerged from broad consensus, today's candidates are at the center of intractable disputes directly involving P5 members

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: U.S. veto of Palestinian membership (April 2024)**
- P(E|H): If a new member were to join, it's unlikely this veto would have occurred (~0.2)
- P(E|~H): If no new member joins, this veto is highly expected (~0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2/0.9 = 0.22
- This strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Extremely short timeframe (only ~2 months left)**
- P(E|H): If a new member were to join, we would expect more time for the process (~0.1)
- P(E|~H): If no new member joins, this short timeframe is expected (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1/0.95 = 0.11
- This very strongly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Growing European support for Palestinian statehood**
- P(E|H): If a new member were to join, increased support would be expected (~0.8)
- P(E|~H): If no new member joins, this support could still exist but be insufficient (~0.6)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.6 = 1.33
- This slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 4: No active UN membership applications in final stages**
- P(E|H): If a new member were to join, we would expect to see an application in advanced stages (~0.05)
- P(E|~H): If no new member joins, the absence of advanced applications is expected (~0.95)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.05/0.95 = 0.05
- This very strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 1.5:98.5 = 0.015

Updating with Evidence 1 (U.S. veto):
- Posterior odds = 0.015 × 0.22 = 0.0033
- Posterior probability = 0.0033/(1+0.0033) ≈ 0.33%

Updating with Evidence 2 (short timeframe):
- Posterior odds = 0.0033 × 0.11 = 0.00036
- Posterior probability = 0.00036/(1+0.00036) ≈ 0.036%

Updating with Evidence 3 (European support):
- Posterior odds = 0.00036 × 1.33 = 0.00048
- Posterior probability = 0.00048/(1+0.00048) ≈ 0.048%

Updating with Evidence 4 (no active applications):
- Posterior odds = 0.00048 × 0.05 = 0.000024
- Posterior probability = 0.000024/(1+0.000024) ≈ 0.0024%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a sudden diplomatic breakthrough
- There could be a candidate state I haven't considered that faces fewer obstacles
- A procedural innovation or reinterpretation of UN rules might circumvent the normal process

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A surprise peace agreement between Israel and Palestine with U.S. support
- A sudden, consensual independence referendum in a region without P5 opposition
- An emergency UN response to an unexpected geopolitical crisis creating a new state

While these scenarios are possible, they are extremely unlikely in the next two months. Even in the event of a diplomatic breakthrough, the procedural steps for UN admission typically take months.

Given the extremely short timeframe and the strong evidence against admission, I believe my forecast may actually be too high. However, to account for unknown unknowns and black swan events, I'll adjust my final forecast slightly upward from the calculated 0.0024%.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
To establish a prior probability, we can look at the historical rate of new UN member admissions. The research report offers several reference classes:
- **Post-Cold War (1992-Present):** ~0.94 new members/year. This period is heavily skewed by the dissolution of the USSR and Yugoslavia and is not representative of the current, more stable international order.
- **21st Century (2001-Present):** 5 new members in 24 years, for a rate of ~0.21 per year. This is a more modern and relevant period.
- **Post-South Sudan (2012-Present):** 0 new members in ~14 years. This suggests the rate may have fallen close to zero as the most straightforward cases of state formation have been resolved.

The 21st-century rate (0.21/year) provides a reasonable, if slightly generous, starting point. The question covers a period of approximately 1.5 years (Aug 2024 - Dec 2025). A simple annual probability of ~21% suggests a non-trivial chance over this full period. However, the more recent 14-year drought is a strong signal that conditions have changed. A blended approach suggests a low prior. Let's set a prior probability of **5%** for a new member joining during the entire ~1.5-year window. This acknowledges that it's a rare event but not impossible.
Prior Odds: 0.05 / 0.95 = 1/19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs significantly from the early 21st century when the last members joined:
- **Nature of Candidates:** The last members (e.g., Timor-Leste, South Sudan) emerged from processes that eventually gained broad international consensus. Today's most prominent candidates (Palestine, Kosovo, Taiwan) are at the heart of intractable geopolitical disputes involving permanent Security Council members (P5), who hold veto power.
- **Geopolitical Climate:** The relationship between P5 members, particularly the US, China, and Russia, is far more adversarial now than in the early 2000s. This makes achieving the required consensus (or lack of a veto) in the Security Council on a contentious issue like statehood extremely difficult.
- **Time Horizon:** The most critical factor is that the resolution date is January 1, 2026, and the current date is October 23, 2025. There are just over two months remaining. The UN admission process is typically slow and requires a Security Council recommendation followed by a two-thirds General Assembly vote.

These differences, especially the short timeline, make the current situation far less conducive to the admission of a new member than the historical base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the event that the UN has >193 members before Jan 1, 2026.
Let ~H be the event that it does not.

- **Evidence 1: US Veto of Palestinian Membership (April 2024).** Palestine is the most plausible candidate to gain widespread support. The US exercising its veto in April 2024 is strong evidence that the primary obstacle remains firmly in place.
    - P(E | H): Low. If a new member were to join, it's unlikely that the most viable candidate would have been so recently and decisively blocked.
    - P(E | ~H): High. This veto is a primary cause for the number of members remaining at 193.
    - **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H))**: << 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

- **Evidence 2: The Extremely Short Time Horizon (<3 months remaining).** The UN process is not designed for speed. For a new member to be admitted, a P5 member would have to change its long-held position, a Security Council vote would need to be scheduled and passed, and a General Assembly vote would need to be held.
    - P(E | H): Extremely low. It is procedurally almost impossible for this entire sequence to occur in such a short window without a world-altering "black swan" event that forces unprecedented cooperation.
    - P(E | ~H): Very high. The status quo is the default outcome, and a short timeframe ensures the inertia of the system will lead to no change.
    - **Likelihood Ratio**: << 1. This is the most powerful piece of evidence against the hypothesis.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We start with a low prior of 5% (odds of 1/19) for the entire 1.5-year period. The evidence strongly pushes this down. The April 2024 veto confirmed the political deadlock. The fact that we are now in the final two months with no progress on any candidate is the most damning evidence.

Let's update our thinking based on the time remaining. The initial 5% prior was for the whole period. Given that nothing has happened for the first ~16 months and the primary candidate was explicitly vetoed, the probability for the remaining 2 months is drastically lower. The path to a "Yes" now requires a sudden, dramatic, and unforeseen event, such as:
1.  A complete reversal of US policy on Palestine.
2.  A comprehensive peace deal (e.g., Serbia-Kosovo) that includes P5 agreement on UN membership.
3.  The peaceful and consensual dissolution of a current member state, with the new states being fast-tracked for admission.

The probability of any of these scenarios initiating and concluding within the next two months is exceptionally small. The combined force of the political deadlock and the procedural time constraints reduces the initial low probability to a near-zero value.

Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR(Veto) × LR(Time)
Posterior Odds ≈ (1/19) × (very small number) × (very small number)
This calculation results in a posterior probability that is very close to zero.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
Could this forecast be wrong? What is the best case for "Yes"? The most plausible (though still highly improbable) scenario would be a "grand bargain" to end a major conflict, where the immediate UN admission of a new state is a key component and all P5 members agree to expedite it. For example, a comprehensive resolution to the war in Gaza. However, even if such a deal were announced tomorrow, the diplomatic and procedural hurdles to be cleared before January 1st would be immense. The argument for "No" rests on the powerful inertia of the status quo, confirmed by recent events and procedural realities. The argument for "Yes" rests on low-probability, high-impact events. A small probability is warranted to account for such "black swan" possibilities. A 1% chance implies this would happen once in 100 similar situations, which feels like a reasonable estimate for a shocking geopolitical development that resolves in this specific way within this specific timeframe.

### Final Forecast
The combination of entrenched political opposition from P5 members to all current candidates, reinforced by the recent US veto of Palestinian membership, and the extremely short time remaining for the UN's deliberative admission process to conclude, makes the admission of a new member state before 2026 a highly improbable event. The probability is not absolute zero, as unforeseen geopolitical events could theoretically accelerate a candidate's admission, but it is exceptionally low.

Final: 1%
