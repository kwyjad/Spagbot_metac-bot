### Reference class & base rates
-   **Modern Robotic Lunar Landing Attempts (2010-Present):** This class includes all missions that attempted a soft lunar landing in the modern era. There have been 11 such attempts: 7 successes (Chang'e 3, 4, 5, 6; Chandrayaan-3; SLIM; IM-1) and 4 failures (Beresheet; Chandrayaan-2; Hakuto-R M1; Luna 25). This yields a **base success rate of ~64% per attempt.** This rate is useful for assessing the probability of success for any given mission that reaches the launchpad.
-   **Planned vs. Actual Landings (3-Year Horizon):** A broader class considers missions *planned* to land within a given period versus those that actually do. Looking at lists of proposed missions from ~2021 for the 2022-2025 period, there were over 18 landing missions mentioned. To date, only 4 have successfully landed. This suggests a **base rate of ~20-25% for planned missions actually landing successfully within their initial multi-year window.** This rate accounts for the high frequency of cancellations and multi-year delays, which is a dominant factor.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2024-07-17] NASA cancels VIPER rover mission ↓ — This effectively removed the Astrobotic Griffin lander, one of the most prominent remaining 2025 candidates, from the schedule.
-   [2024-06-06] Chang'e 6 successfully lands on lunar far side ↑ — China's successful sample-return mission became the fourth successful landing of the 2022-2025 period, locking in a higher floor for the final count.
-   [2024-05-08] Firefly announces Blue Ghost Mission 1 launch slip to 2026 ↓ — Another key CLPS mission, previously slated for 2025, was officially pushed out of the resolution window, reducing the pool of potential candidates.
-   [2024-03-27] Intuitive Machines targets Q1 2026 for IM-2 mission ↓ — Following their successful IM-1 mission, the company confirmed its follow-up would not launch in 2025, removing another candidate.
-   [2024-02-22] Intuitive Machines' IM-1 (Odysseus) lands successfully ↑ — The first successful US lunar landing in over 50 years and the first by a private company. It became the third landing of the period.
-   [2024-01-19] JAXA's SLIM lands successfully ↑ — Japan's "Moon Sniper" achieved a precision landing, becoming the second successful landing of the period, despite landing in an off-nominal orientation.
-   [2024-01-09] NASA formally delays Artemis III to September 2026 ↓ — As detailed in the provided sources, this confirmed the only potential crewed landing would not occur in the 2022-2025 timeframe.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Technical Complexity of Landing (Large):** Soft landing remains an exceptionally difficult engineering challenge. Failures occur in the final "minutes of terror" due to propulsion, navigation, or software issues (e.g., Luna 25, Beresheet). This is the primary driver of the ~35% failure rate for missions that launch.
-   **Launch & Payload Readiness (Large):** The final number is highly sensitive to delays. Missions are frequently pushed back by months or years due to issues with the launch vehicle (e.g., delays for Vulcan Centaur affecting early CLPS missions) or the primary scientific payload (e.g., VIPER cancellation).
-   **Commercial Viability & Funding (Moderate):** The new era relies heavily on NASA's CLPS program and private funding. Commercial providers face tight budgets, which can lead to higher risk tolerance but also mission cancellations or delays if funding rounds or contract milestones are not met.
-   **Geopolitical Competition (Moderate):** A "new space race" between the US/partners and China is accelerating timelines and securing government funding. This increases the number of planned missions but does not eliminate the technical and schedule risks.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Dominance of Commercial & Distributed Actors:** Unlike the Cold War Space Race (the implicit base rate for "lunar exploration"), the current landscape is not a duopoly. It features multiple nations (US, China, India, Japan, Russia) and, critically, new commercial companies (Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic, Firefly). This increases the *quantity* of planned missions but introduces new failure modes related to commercial financing and less-proven hardware.
-   **Lower Cost, Higher Risk Tolerance:** The NASA CLPS model explicitly accepts a higher risk of failure in exchange for lower costs and faster development compared to traditional "flagship" missions. This means we should expect more attempts but not necessarily a higher success rate than the historical average, especially for first-time providers.
-   **Focus on the Lunar South Pole:** Many current and planned missions target the South Pole for its potential water ice resources. This presents new landing challenges (e.g., lighting, terrain) not faced by the equatorial Apollo and Luna missions.
-   **High Rate of Schedule Volatility:** The sheer number of interdependent parts (landers, payloads, rockets) from different commercial and government entities creates extreme schedule fragility. A delay in one component can cascade and push a mission out of a given year, a much more common dynamic than in the vertically-integrated Apollo era.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** An informed prior from early 2024 would have started with the 2 known successes (SLIM, IM-1) and considered the ~4-5 remaining plausible candidates for 2024-2025 (Chang'e 6, IM-2, Griffin/VIPER, Blue Ghost, etc.). Applying the ~64% success rate per attempt and a high chance of delay, a reasonable prior might have been a distribution centered around 5 or 6 total landings.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ Moderate) Chang'e 6 succeeded, adding one to the total.
    -   (↓ Large) The cancellation of the VIPER rover mission removed its Griffin lander from the 2025 schedule entirely.
    -   (↓ Large) Confirmed schedule slips of IM-2 and Blue Ghost into 2026 have removed all other credible US commercial candidates from the 2025 calendar.
    -   (↓ Small) Continued confirmation of Artemis III's delay to 2026+ removes any lingering, albeit tiny, probability from that mission.
-   **Net effect:** A strong downward update. The evidence has systematically eliminated every potential landing candidate for the remainder of 2025. The posterior distribution should collapse almost entirely onto the number of landings already achieved.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
With only ~2.5 months remaining in the resolution period, the window for new developments is nearly closed.
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A surprise announcement of a previously unknown mission being ready for a 2025 launch (extremely unlikely).
    -   A sudden reversal of a delay, with a company announcing an immediate launch campaign for Nov/Dec 2025 (logistically near-impossible).
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   Not applicable. The number of successful landings to date (4) cannot decrease.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Edge Cases:** The resolution criteria ("soft landing" and "transmit data") have been tested. SLIM landed at a severe angle and IM-1 tipped over, but both transmitted data and were counted. A future landing could be even more ambiguous.
-   **Unannounced Missions:** The possibility of a classified or unannounced state-actor mission is non-zero but vanishingly small and unlikely to be verifiable for resolution.
-   **Outdated Information:** The single biggest pitfall in this forecast is relying on outdated "List of Future Missions" articles or charts. The situation is highly dynamic, and official announcements of delays are the most critical data points. As of October 2025, all known candidates have been delayed out of the window.
-   **Launch vs. Landing Date:** A mission could launch in December 2025 but land in January 2026. The resolution is based on the landing date, so any late December launch would not count.

To forecast the number of spacecraft that will land on the moon from 2022 through 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Selection:** The base rate for successful lunar landings in the modern era (2010-present) is approximately 64% per attempt, based on 7 successes out of 11 attempts. However, considering the broader context of planned versus actual landings, a more conservative base rate of 20-25% is appropriate due to frequent delays and cancellations.
- **Mean/Median and Variance:** Given the historical data and the current context, a reasonable prior distribution might center around 5 successful landings, with a variance reflecting the uncertainty due to potential delays and cancellations.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation shares similarities with the historical base rate in terms of technical challenges and geopolitical motivations driving lunar missions.
- **Differences:** The modern era features a higher number of commercial actors, which introduces new risks and volatility. The focus on the lunar South Pole also presents unique challenges not faced in previous missions.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Chang'e 6 Success:** Increases the likelihood of a higher number of landings, as it adds to the count.
- **VIPER Cancellation and Delays (IM-2, Blue Ghost):** Strongly decrease the likelihood of additional landings within the timeframe.
- **Artemis III Delay:** Confirms no crewed landings within the period, slightly reducing the probability of additional landings.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior:** Centered around 5 landings, reflecting early 2024 expectations.
- **Likelihood Adjustments:** 
  - Chang'e 6 success nudges the distribution slightly upward.
  - VIPER cancellation and other delays significantly shift the distribution downward.
- **Posterior Distribution:** The evidence suggests a strong downward adjustment, with the distribution now centered around the 4 successful landings already achieved.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast should account for the small but non-zero probability of an unannounced mission or a rapid schedule change.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a surprise mission, but given the logistical constraints, this remains unlikely.
- **Tail Risks:** The primary risk is underestimating the potential for a last-minute mission, but this is mitigated by the current evidence.

### 6. Final Percentiles
Given the analysis, the forecast is adjusted to reflect the current evidence and the likelihood of additional landings is very low.

# Forecasting the Number of Spacecraft Landing on the Moon (2022-2025)

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two key reference distributions:

**Modern Lunar Landing Attempts (2010-2021):** Before our period of interest, there were 4 landing attempts with 3 successes (Chang'e 3, 4, and 5) and 1 failure (Beresheet). This gives a ~75% success rate for modern landing attempts.

**Planned vs. Actual Missions:** Historically, only about 20-30% of announced lunar missions actually launch and land within their initially planned timeframe. The background mentions "at least 18" planned landings for 2022-2025.

For my prior, I'll use a distribution centered around 5-6 landings, with:
- Mean: 5.5 spacecraft
- Standard deviation: ~2 spacecraft
- Shape: Right-skewed (more probability of delays than accelerations)

This prior reflects that out of 18+ planned missions, we'd expect only about 25-30% to successfully land within the timeframe, adjusted for the modern success rate.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities:**
- Technical challenges of lunar landing remain similar to the base rate period
- Mix of established space agencies and newer commercial entities
- Similar geopolitical motivations driving lunar exploration

**Differences:**
- More commercial players (Intuitive Machines, Astrobotic, etc.) with less experience
- NASA's CLPS program explicitly accepts higher risk for lower cost
- More ambitious landing sites (polar regions) with greater technical challenges
- Higher schedule volatility due to interdependent components from different entities
- COVID-19 disruptions affected early development timelines (2022-2023)

These differences suggest we should expect more attempts but potentially lower success rates than historical averages, with significant schedule slippage.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Key Evidence:**

1. **Confirmed Successful Landings (2022-2025):** Four spacecraft have successfully landed:
   - JAXA's SLIM (January 2024)
   - Intuitive Machines' IM-1 (February 2024)
   - Chang'e 6 (June 2024)
   - Chandrayaan-3 (August 2023)
   
   This establishes a firm lower bound of 4 landings.

2. **Confirmed Failures:** Several missions attempted but failed to land:
   - Luna 25 (August 2023)
   - Hakuto-R M1 (April 2023)
   
   These failures demonstrate the continued technical challenges.

3. **Confirmed Delays/Cancellations:**
   - NASA canceled VIPER rover mission (July 2024), removing Astrobotic's Griffin lander
   - Firefly's Blue Ghost Mission 1 slipped to 2026 (May 2024)
   - Intuitive Machines' IM-2 delayed to Q1 2026 (March 2024)
   - NASA's Artemis III crewed landing delayed to September 2026 (January 2024)
   
   These represent the systematic elimination of all major landing candidates for the remainder of 2025.

4. **Time Remaining:** As of October 2025, only ~2.5 months remain in the resolution period, making any new mission extremely unlikely.

**Likelihood Ratios:**
- The confirmed 4 successful landings strongly supports values ≥4 (likelihood ratio: infinite)
- The systematic delays/cancellations of all remaining major missions strongly supports values ≤4 (likelihood ratio: ~10:1 against values >4)
- The short time remaining makes any surprise mission extremely unlikely (likelihood ratio: ~20:1 against values >4)

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior centered around 5-6 landings, I'll update based on the evidence:

**First Update - Confirmed Landings:**
- The 4 confirmed landings establish a firm lower bound
- This shifts the distribution to be truncated at 4
- The posterior mean shifts down slightly from 5.5 to ~5

**Second Update - Confirmed Delays/Cancellations:**
- The systematic elimination of all remaining major candidates for 2025
- This dramatically reduces the probability of values >4
- The posterior mean shifts down significantly from ~5 to ~4.1

**Third Update - Time Remaining:**
- With only 2.5 months left, the probability of a surprise mission is extremely low
- This further concentrates the distribution around 4
- The posterior mean shifts to ~4.05

The final posterior distribution is heavily concentrated around 4, with small probability mass at 5 to account for extremely unlikely surprise missions.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of an unannounced mission, particularly from China or a private entity
- There could be missions in advanced stages of preparation that haven't been widely publicized
- The definition of "landing and transmitting data" might be applied to borderline cases I haven't considered

**Alternative Forecast:**
A reasonable alternative would place more weight on values of 5, arguing that:
- Space agencies might be incentivized to attempt a landing before year-end to meet political goals
- A previously delayed mission might be accelerated to fit within 2025
- A small-scale technology demonstrator might be prepared in secrecy

**Rebuttal:**
- The logistics of lunar missions make rapid preparation impossible; even with existing hardware, the launch windows and transit times require months of lead time
- No credible reports exist of missions in final preparation stages for 2025
- The systematic pattern of delays and cancellations suggests fundamental challenges that can't be easily overcome

After consideration, I'll maintain my forecast but slightly increase the probability of 5 landings to account for these possibilities.

Answering based on the situation as of October 17, 2025.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most relevant starting point is not a broad historical base rate, but the factual, realized number of landings within the resolution period to date. The question covers the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2025. As of today, October 17, 2025, the following successful landings have occurred:
-   **2022**: 0
-   **2023**: 1 (Chandrayaan-3)
-   **2024**: 3 (SLIM, IM-1, Chang'e 6)
-   **2025 (to date)**: 0

This establishes a hard floor and a powerful prior: the final number is **at least 4**. The forecast is therefore focused on the number of *additional* landings in the remaining ~2.5 months of 2025. A base rate for this short period, given the long lead times for space missions, would be zero.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The base case is that no further landings will occur in 2025. This is because lunar landing missions are complex, multi-year undertakings. A mission that is not already publicly announced and in the final stages of launch preparation has virtually no chance of launching and landing within a 10-week window. The current situation is entirely consistent with this base case; there are no known missions on the cusp of launching.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The evidence strongly supports the base case of zero additional landings. We can evaluate the status of all potential candidates that were once considered for 2025:
-   **Intuitive Machines IM-2**: Officially delayed to Q1 2026. This removes a key candidate. (Likelihood of landing in 2025: near zero).
-   **Firefly Blue Ghost Mission 1**: Officially delayed to 2026. This removes another key candidate. (Likelihood of landing in 2025: near zero).
-   **Astrobotic Griffin/VIPER**: The VIPER rover payload was cancelled by NASA, and the Griffin lander has no confirmed launch date, making a 2025 landing impossible. (Likelihood of landing in 2025: zero).
-   **Artemis III (NASA)**: The first crewed landing of the program has been formally delayed to September 2026 at the earliest. (Likelihood of landing in 2025: zero).
-   **Other international missions (e.g., Chang'e 7, LUPEX)**: All are publicly scheduled for 2026 or later.

The cumulative effect of this evidence is a systematic elimination of every plausible candidate for the remainder of 2025. The evidence pushes the forecast for *additional* landings down to 0 with very high confidence.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
-   **Prior**: The distribution starts as a point mass at 4, representing the confirmed landings. P(N ≥ 4) = 100%.
-   **Likelihood**: The evidence (no scheduled missions, long lead times) makes the likelihood of an additional landing (N=5) extremely low, and the likelihood of zero additional landings (N=4) extremely high.
-   **Posterior**: The posterior distribution is overwhelmingly concentrated at N=4. The probability of the final count being exactly 4 is extremely high, likely >99%. The probability of the count being 5 (requiring a surprise, unannounced mission to launch and land successfully in the next 10 weeks) is minuscule. The posterior distribution has a mean just slightly above 4.0 and a median of 4.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Could I be wrong?** The primary way this forecast fails is if a secret or rapidly accelerated mission is launched, most plausibly by a state actor like China. However, this is highly improbable. Lunar launches are difficult to hide and are usually publicized for national prestige. Furthermore, China's lunar program has a clear public roadmap with Chang'e 7 slated for 2026.
-   **Overconfidence Check**: The high confidence is not based on predicting a volatile system, but on observing a slow-moving logistical pipeline. The pipeline of missions for 2025 is empty. The lead time to prepare and launch a new lunar mission is much longer than the time remaining. Therefore, high confidence that the number will not change is warranted.
-   **Alternative Forecast**: The only plausible alternative is N=5. An argument for this would be to account for "unknown unknowns." However, without any supporting evidence, this scenario's probability is too low to shift the core percentiles of the distribution. The floor of 4 is solid, as the four past landings clearly meet the resolution criteria.

The conclusion remains that the final number will be 4 with a very high degree of certainty.

### 6. Final Percentiles
The distribution is a near-point-mass at 4. The four landings in 2023-2024 have already occurred, setting a floor. There are no credible candidate missions remaining for 2025. Therefore, all percentiles up to the very high end of the distribution will be 4.
