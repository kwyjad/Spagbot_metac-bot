### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Dominant tech platforms making core business model concessions without legal compulsion.** Historically, dominant tech platforms (e.g., Microsoft in the 1990s/2000s, Google) rarely make fundamental changes to their most profitable, strategic "walled gardens" unless forced by a final, non-appealable court order or binding legislation. Voluntary, pre-emptive changes of this magnitude are exceedingly rare. **Base rate: <5%.**
2.  **Major international regulatory spillover on core platform policy.** How often does a regulation in one jurisdiction (EU's DMA) cause a company to voluntarily apply the same costly, revenue-damaging policy in another major market (US) where no such law exists? While companies often standardize privacy features (e.g., GDPR-like options globally) for efficiency, they typically resist changes that directly undermine a multi-billion dollar revenue stream like the App Store commission. **Base rate for this type of spillover: <10%.**
3.  **Passage and implementation of major US federal antitrust legislation targeting a specific industry.** The US legislative process is slow and subject to intense lobbying and political polarization. Bills like the Open App Markets Act have been debated for years without passing. The time from a bill's passage to full implementation and corporate compliance on a technical issue of this scale is typically longer than the remaining forecast horizon. **Base rate of a bill passing and being implemented within a ~1-year timeframe from a stalled position: <5%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-06-26** Apple again modifies EU App Store rules, introducing a new fee structure (CTC) to replace the controversial CTF. **(↓)** This demonstrates Apple's pattern of reluctant, iterative, and narrowly-scoped compliance, reinforcing that changes are made only where legally mandated (i.e., in the EU) and not proactively applied elsewhere.
*   **2025-03-10** Pre-trial scheduling orders in the US DOJ vs. Apple case confirm a trial start date in early 2026. **(↓ Large)** This effectively removes the DOJ lawsuit as a mechanism to force change *before* the January 1, 2026 resolution date. The legal process will not conclude in time.
*   **2024-11-12** The Open App Markets Act (OAMA) fails to be attached to must-pass legislation before the end of the congressional session. **(↓)** This signals continued legislative gridlock and makes a statutory requirement for sideloading in the US highly improbable within the forecast window.
*   **2024-10-01** Apple executives, in public interviews, reiterate that the security and privacy of the iPhone are paramount and that sideloading would create unacceptable risks for US consumers. **(↓)** This is a continuation of their long-standing public relations and legal defense strategy, indicating no change in corporate intent.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **US Legal System Pace:** The timeline of the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit is the most significant driver. As it is scheduled for trial in 2026, it cannot force a resolution by the deadline. **(Large, driving probability down)**
2.  **US Federal Legislation:** The passage of a law like the Open App Markets Act would compel Apple to act. However, legislative momentum has stalled repeatedly, making this path highly unlikely in the short term. **(Large, but probability of occurrence is very low)**
3.  **Apple's Financial Incentive:** The App Store is a cornerstone of Apple's high-margin Services division, generating tens of billions in revenue annually. Voluntarily opening it to competition in its largest market (the US) would be a direct, self-inflicted financial wound. **(Large, driving probability down)**
4.  **Regulatory Spillover from EU:** The precedent set by the DMA in Europe creates a blueprint for other regulators and a potential (though unlikely) incentive for Apple to create a single global standard to reduce complexity. However, their EU implementation has been designed to be EU-specific. **(Moderate, driving probability down due to observed resistance)**
5.  **Apple's Corporate Ideology:** The "walled garden" approach is central to Apple's brand identity, which emphasizes simplicity, security, and privacy. They genuinely see sideloading as a threat to the user experience and will resist it on principle as well as financial grounds. **(Moderate, driving probability down)**

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Absence of a Legal Mandate:** Unlike the EU which has the DMA in full effect, the US has no equivalent law on the books. This is the single largest difference from the reference class of "companies complying with regulation." Here, there is no regulation to comply with.
*   **Imminent but Post-Dated Legal Threat:** The DOJ lawsuit is a massive threat, but its timeline is known and falls *after* the resolution date. This creates a unique situation where the pressure is clear, but the deadline for compliance is not within the forecast horizon.
*   **Demonstrated "Malicious Compliance" Playbook:** We have a live case study of how Apple responds to this exact pressure from the EU. Their strategy involves minimal, grudging compliance with complex and unattractive fee structures designed to discourage developers from using the new options. This playbook is likely to be deployed in the US if they are ever forced, but it also shows their deep-seated resistance to voluntary change.
*   **Extreme Profitability:** The scale of Apple's App Store revenue is arguably greater than for many historical antitrust targets, increasing their incentive to fight and delay change in their most important market by any means necessary.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a low prior, perhaps 10% (equivalent n=10), based on the reference classes showing that dominant firms do not voluntarily cede core, profitable territory without a final legal or legislative mandate.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   DOJ trial scheduled for 2026 (↓, large): This closes the primary legal avenue for a "Yes" resolution within the timeframe.
    *   Continued legislative failure of OAMA (↓, moderate): This closes the primary legislative avenue.
    *   Apple's EU compliance strategy (↓, moderate): This provides a clear and recent signal of Apple's intent to resist, contain, and monetize any required changes, making a voluntary move in the US even less likely.
    *   Consistent executive messaging on security (↓, small): Reinforces that there has been no internal shift in strategy.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative and reduces uncertainty. The posterior should move significantly downward, likely into the very low single digits.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any announcement of a surprise settlement in the DOJ v. Apple case.
    *   A bipartisan breakthrough in Congress reviving the Open App Markets Act with a clear path to a vote.
    *   A major developer (e.g., Meta, Microsoft) announcing a planned US-based third-party app store, suggesting they have inside information.
    *   Apple announcing a "global developer conference" to discuss "new platform business models."
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Filings of pre-trial motions by Apple and the DOJ that reaffirm the 2026 trial schedule.
    *   Public statements from key congressional leaders that tech regulation is not a priority for the remainder of the session.
    *   Apple launching a new marketing campaign heavily focused on the iPhone's security and privacy compared to other platforms.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria Ambiguity:** "Straightforwardly possible" is subjective. Apple could introduce a highly complex, fee-laden, or developer-unfriendly process that technically allows sideloading but is not "straightforward," creating a gray area for resolution.
*   **"Black Swan" Settlement:** While extremely unlikely given the timeline and stakes, Apple could decide to settle with the DOJ to avoid a long, distracting trial. The terms of such a settlement are unknown.
*   **Geographic Specificity:** The question is strictly about the United States. News about changes in the EU, Japan, or other regions are only relevant as indicators of Apple's strategy, not as direct resolution events.
*   **Voluntary vs. Forced:** The most probable path to a "Yes" is a voluntary, pre-emptive move by Apple. This is an internal decision, making it difficult to forecast with external signals alone. However, all available signals point against such a decision.

**Final Research Summary:** The primary legal and legislative mechanisms that could force Apple to allow sideloading in the US will not conclude before the January 1, 2026 deadline. Apple's established resistance to this change in the EU, combined with its powerful financial and ideological incentives, makes a voluntary change in the US extremely improbable.

To forecast the probability of Apple allowing sideloading or other app stores on iPhones in the United States before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for this event is informed by historical data on dominant tech platforms making significant changes to their business models without legal compulsion. Historically, such voluntary changes are exceedingly rare, with a base rate of less than 5%. Given the context of Apple's strong financial incentives to maintain its App Store model and the absence of a legal mandate in the US, a prior probability of 5% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarity:** The situation aligns with the base case where dominant tech companies resist voluntary changes that could undermine their revenue streams.
- **Difference:** Unlike some historical cases, there is a clear regulatory framework in the EU (DMA) that Apple is complying with, but this does not directly apply to the US. The absence of a US equivalent law is a significant difference.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **DOJ Trial Scheduled for 2026:** This evidence strongly decreases the probability, as it confirms that the primary legal mechanism will not conclude before the deadline. Likelihood ratio significantly less than 1.
- **Legislative Gridlock on OAMA:** The failure of the Open App Markets Act to progress reduces the probability, as it indicates continued legislative inaction. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Apple's EU Compliance Strategy:** Apple's minimal compliance in the EU suggests a reluctance to voluntarily change in the US, decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio less than 1.
- **Executive Messaging on Security:** Consistent messaging against sideloading reinforces Apple's resistance, slightly decreasing the probability. Likelihood ratio slightly less than 1.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior probability of 5%, the overwhelmingly negative evidence suggests a significant downward adjustment. The posterior probability, after considering the evidence, is likely to be in the very low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast could be overconfident if there is an unexpected regulatory or legal development. However, the current evidence strongly supports a low probability.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** A surprise settlement in the DOJ case or a sudden legislative breakthrough could change the outlook, but these are unlikely given the current context.
- **Rebuttals:** The best alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher probability if one assumes Apple might preemptively align US policies with the EU for simplicity, but this is countered by their current strategy.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential alternative scenarios, the final forecast is a low probability of Apple allowing sideloading or other app stores on iPhones in the US before 2026.

Final: 2%

# Will Apple allow side-loading or other app stores on iPhones in the US before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll consider several relevant reference classes:

1. **Tech platforms voluntarily opening closed ecosystems**: Major tech companies rarely voluntarily open their profitable walled gardens without legal compulsion. Examples include Microsoft with Internet Explorer, Google with Android in the EU, and Apple's own history of tight control.

2. **Regulatory spillover from EU to US**: Companies sometimes standardize policies globally after being forced to change in one jurisdiction, but typically only when the cost of maintaining different systems exceeds the benefit of the restrictive practice.

3. **Apple's specific history with App Store control**: Apple has consistently fought to maintain its App Store monopoly, including lengthy legal battles with Epic Games and others.

Based on these reference classes, I'll set a prior of **8%**. This reflects the historical rarity of voluntary ecosystem opening, but acknowledges some small possibility of regulatory spillover or strategic preemption.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Apple continues to derive significant revenue from App Store commissions
- The company maintains its public stance that sideloading threatens security and user experience
- Apple has historically resisted changes to its business model until legally required

**Key differences**:
- The EU's Digital Markets Act has already forced Apple to allow sideloading in Europe, creating a precedent
- The DOJ antitrust case against Apple specifically targets App Store practices
- Apple has demonstrated its compliance approach in the EU, which has been minimal and designed to maintain revenue

These differences suggest some pressure toward change, but Apple's demonstrated resistance in the EU indicates they will likely maintain the status quo where legally possible.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: DOJ trial scheduled for 2026**
- P(E|H): If Apple will allow sideloading before 2026, the DOJ trial timing is somewhat irrelevant = 0.8
- P(E|~H): If Apple won't allow sideloading, we'd expect them to fight until forced = 0.95
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.95 = 0.84 (evidence against)

This is strong evidence against voluntary change, as it removes the primary legal mechanism that could force Apple to act within our timeframe.

**Evidence 2: Apple's EU compliance strategy**
- P(E|H): If Apple will voluntarily open US iPhones, their EU strategy would likely be more accommodating = 0.3
- P(E|~H): If Apple won't voluntarily change, we'd expect exactly the reluctant, complex compliance we've seen = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.9 = 0.33 (strong evidence against)

Apple's "malicious compliance" in the EU strongly suggests they will maintain control wherever legally possible.

**Evidence 3: Failure of Open App Markets Act legislation**
- P(E|H): If Apple will allow sideloading, legislative pressure becoming irrelevant is somewhat expected = 0.6
- P(E|~H): If Apple won't allow sideloading, we'd expect them to lobby against legislation = 0.8
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.8 = 0.75 (moderate evidence against)

The stalled legislation removes another potential forcing mechanism.

**Evidence 4: Consistent executive messaging on security**
- P(E|H): If Apple plans to allow sideloading, they might soften their rhetoric = 0.4
- P(E|~H): If Apple won't allow sideloading, they'd maintain consistent messaging = 0.9
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.9 = 0.44 (evidence against)

Apple continues to frame sideloading as a security threat, indicating no shift in position.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 8%/92% = 0.087

Updating with Evidence 1 (DOJ trial timing):
- Posterior odds = 0.087 × 0.84 = 0.073
- Posterior probability = 0.073/(1+0.073) = 6.8%

Updating with Evidence 2 (EU compliance strategy):
- Posterior odds = 0.073 × 0.33 = 0.024
- Posterior probability = 0.024/(1+0.024) = 2.3%

Updating with Evidence 3 (Legislative failure):
- Posterior odds = 0.024 × 0.75 = 0.018
- Posterior probability = 0.018/(1+0.018) = 1.8%

Updating with Evidence 4 (Executive messaging):
- Posterior odds = 0.018 × 0.44 = 0.0079
- Posterior probability = 0.0079/(1+0.0079) = 0.78%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

Potential blind spots in my analysis:

1. **Strategic preemption**: Apple might decide to preemptively allow sideloading on their own terms before being forced to do so, to maintain control over implementation.

2. **Competitive pressure**: If Android gains market share due to developer preference for its more open ecosystem, Apple might respond.

3. **Settlement possibility**: While unlikely, Apple could reach a settlement with the DOJ that includes earlier implementation of sideloading.

4. **Technical standardization**: Maintaining different iOS versions for different regions creates technical complexity that Apple might decide isn't worth the cost.

However, these considerations are already factored into my low but non-zero probability. Apple's demonstrated behavior in the EU shows they prefer complex compliance to voluntary standardization. The DOJ case timeline makes settlement before 2026 possible but unlikely.

I believe my forecast of approximately 1% appropriately balances these considerations.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the overwhelming evidence against voluntary change, particularly:
1. The DOJ trial timeline extending beyond our resolution date
2. Apple's demonstrated resistance in the EU
3. The failure of legislative pathways
4. The significant financial incentive to maintain the status quo

I assess there is approximately a 1% chance that Apple will allow sideloading or other app stores on iPhones in the US before 2026.

Final: 1%

Here is a probabilistic forecast following the specified methodology.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event is a dominant technology company (Apple) voluntarily relinquishing a core, highly profitable control point (the App Store monopoly) in its most important market (the United States) without a direct legal or legislative mandate forcing it to do so within the specified timeframe.

An appropriate reference class is "dominant firms making fundamental, revenue-damaging changes to their core business model without final legal compulsion." Historically, companies like Microsoft (browser bundling) and Google (search preferencing) have resisted such changes until forced by a final, non-appealable court order or binding legislation. Voluntary, pre-emptive concessions of this magnitude are exceedingly rare.

A second reference class is "costly regulatory spillover," where a company applies a revenue-damaging rule from one jurisdiction (like the EU's DMA) to another major market (the US) where no such rule exists. Companies typically "geo-fence" compliance for such costly changes to protect revenue in unregulated markets.

Based on these reference classes, a low prior probability is warranted. I will set the initial prior at **10%**. This is equivalent to 1:9 odds and acknowledges the heightened global regulatory pressure on big tech while still reflecting the historical rarity of such a voluntary concession.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation with Apple differs from the general base case in several key ways that make a "Yes" outcome even less likely:

*   **Known Legal Timeline:** Unlike a situation with an uncertain court deadline, the research report specifies that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust trial is scheduled for *early 2026*. This places the most significant legal threat *after* the resolution date of January 1, 2026, removing it as a mechanism to force change within the forecast window.
*   **Demonstrated Playbook:** We have a live case study of Apple's response to this exact pressure in the European Union. Their implementation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) has been characterized by creating a complex, developer-unfriendly system with new fees, signaling a strategy of "malicious compliance" and containment rather than a philosophical shift towards openness. This playbook is the opposite of a voluntary, global rollout.
*   **Legislative Stalemate:** In the US, the legislative path is also blocked. The Open App Markets Act (OAMA) has repeatedly failed to pass, and the report indicates this gridlock continues.

These factors mean the primary external forces that would compel a company to act in the base case are absent here.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis that "Apple will allow side-loading in the US before 2026."

*   **Evidence 1: DOJ trial is scheduled for early 2026.**
    *   The probability of this trial date being set *if* Apple planned to concede beforehand (P(E|H)) is very low. A concession would likely be part of a settlement to *avoid* the trial.
    *   The probability of this trial date *if* Apple plans to fight (P(E|~H)) is very high, as this reflects a normal legal timeline.
    *   The likelihood ratio (P(E|H) / P(E|~H)) is much less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: The Open App Markets Act (OAMA) has failed to pass.**
    *   This removes the legislative path to a "Yes" resolution. Its failure is highly consistent with the "No" outcome (~H), where Apple's lobbying and political inertia prevail.
    *   The likelihood ratio is less than 1. This evidence **decreases** the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Apple's EU compliance strategy involves high friction and new fees.**
    *   This reveals Apple's preference: when forced, they will comply in the narrowest, most self-serving way possible. This is highly inconsistent with a plan to voluntarily and "straightforwardly" open their platform in the US (H).
    *   The likelihood ratio is much less than 1. This evidence strongly **decreases** the probability.

All key pieces of evidence point in the same direction, reducing the likelihood of a "Yes" resolution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 10% (1:9 odds), we update with the evidence.

The most crucial piece of evidence is the DOJ trial date being set for 2026. This single fact removes the most plausible forcing function from the equation. A conservative likelihood ratio for this evidence might be 1/10, reflecting that it makes the "Yes" outcome ten times less likely.

*   **Prior Odds:** 1:9
*   **Likelihood Ratio (for DOJ trial date):** ~1/10
*   **Posterior Odds:** (1/9) * (1/10) = 1/90
*   **Posterior Probability:** 1 / (1 + 90) ≈ 1.1%

The other evidence (OAMA failure, EU playbook) reinforces this conclusion, pushing the probability even lower. Cumulatively, the evidence is overwhelming. The posterior probability should be in the very low single digits.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest counter-argument is the possibility of a "black swan" strategic decision by Apple to settle with the DOJ before the trial. They might do this to avoid a long, distracting, and potentially reputation-damaging legal battle, and to control the terms of the new app ecosystem themselves rather than having them dictated by a court.

However, this is unlikely for several reasons. First, with the trial set for 2026, the immediate pressure to settle *before* the resolution date is low. Second, Apple's actions in the EU demonstrate a willingness to engage in complex, jurisdiction-specific compliance rather than making broad, preemptive changes. A surprise settlement in the US would contradict this revealed strategy.

The ambiguity in the resolution criteria "straightforwardly possible" is a minor risk, but even a token, hard-to-use implementation would likely stem from a settlement, the probability of which is already low.

The analysis seems robust, but to account for the small, non-zero chance of a surprise strategic settlement, the final probability should be slightly above zero.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a dominant firm making such a voluntary concession is low. The specific evidence for this case is overwhelmingly negative: the legal and legislative paths that could force Apple's hand are effectively closed within the resolution timeframe. Apple's own actions in the EU reveal a clear intent to resist and contain this type of change, not to embrace it voluntarily. The only remaining path to a "Yes" is a surprise settlement with the DOJ, which is a low-probability tail risk. Therefore, the final probability is very low.

Final: 2%
