### Reference class & base rates
1.  **All Post-1980 US Government Shutdowns (n=10):** This class includes all shutdowns since the modern budget process began. The median duration is 3 days. The current shutdown, at 35 days (as of Nov 4), has already exceeded the duration of 90% (9/10) of these historical instances. The only comparable event was the 35-day shutdown of 2018-2019. This base rate suggests that reaching this length is rare and that we are in an outlier event.
2.  **"Contentious" Modern Shutdowns (n=4):** A more relevant reference class may be shutdowns lasting longer than one week, which indicates a serious political impasse rather than a brief procedural lapse. This class includes the shutdowns of 1995 (5 days, then 21 days), 2013 (16 days), and 2018-2019 (35 days). The current shutdown is already at the maximum duration observed in this class. The base rate for a shutdown in this class ending within the next 17 days (i.e., between day 35 and day 52) is effectively 0/1, as the only one to reach 35 days ended on that day. This suggests that once a shutdown becomes this protracted, predicting its end based on historical precedent is difficult.
3.  **Shutdowns Under Divided Government (n=7):** The longest shutdowns (1995-96, 2013, 2018-19, and the current one) have all occurred under a divided government. This is the most pertinent reference class. The median duration for this class is 16 days. The current shutdown has more than doubled this median, reinforcing its status as an extreme event.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-03** House leadership holds a press conference blaming the Senate and White House for refusing to negotiate on "essential spending reforms," signaling no change in position. ↓ — Reinforces political entrenchment and suggests leadership is not yet feeling enough pressure to compromise.
*   **2025-11-01** A bipartisan group of Senators publicly calls for a "clean" Continuing Resolution (CR) to reopen the government while negotiations continue. ↑ — Shows the emergence of cross-party pressure, which can be a precursor to a deal, though its influence on House leadership is uncertain.
*   **2025-10-29** Reports emerge of moderate House members from swing districts expressing significant concern about the impact on constituents ahead of the second missed paycheck. ↑ — Indicates that political pressure is building on the most vulnerable members of the majority caucus, a key lever for forcing a resolution.
*   **2025-10-24** The first paycheck is officially missed by most federal workers. Public and media attention on individual hardship stories increases significantly. ↑ — This was a key pressure point, but the fact that it passed without a resolution suggests the political impasse is very strong.
*   **2025-10-15** The House fails to pass a partisan appropriations bill, with a hardline faction voting with the opposition, demonstrating the Speaker's lack of control. ↓ — Highlights the core difficulty: intra-party divisions are preventing the majority from consolidating a negotiating position, making a deal with the other party nearly impossible.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Public/Worker Pressure (Large):** As federal workers and contractors miss paychecks (Nov 7, Nov 21) and government services are curtailed, public pressure on elected officials mounts. This is the primary mechanism for ending shutdowns.
2.  **Intra-Party Cohesion (Large):** The ability of party leadership (particularly the House Speaker) to control their caucus is critical. A small, powerful faction can prevent a deal that the majority of Congress would otherwise support. A breakdown in this faction's cohesion is a strong indicator of an impending end.
3.  **Proximity to Action-Forcing Events (Moderate-Large):** External deadlines, especially holidays like Thanksgiving (Nov 27), create immense pressure. Members of Congress are highly motivated to return to their districts for holidays, often forcing a last-minute deal.
4.  **Perceived Political Blame (Moderate):** If polls and media coverage begin to assign blame heavily to one party, that party's negotiating position weakens, making them more likely to concede.
5.  **Economic Impact (Moderate):** Negative reports on GDP, consumer confidence, and market stability from sources like the CBO or Federal Reserve can increase the urgency for a resolution among business-oriented factions.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Record-Tying Duration:** The shutdown has already matched the longest in US history. This suggests the political dynamics are unusually stubborn and that historical averages for duration are less predictive.
*   **Intra-Party Veto Power:** Unlike some past shutdowns centered on disputes between two unified parties, this one appears driven by a hardline faction within one party that can effectively veto any compromise acceptable to the other party and the White House. This makes a traditional leadership-negotiated settlement extremely difficult.
*   **Nature of Demands:** If the core dispute is over highly ideological policy riders rather than just spending levels, compromise is harder. Fiscal numbers can be split, but ideological principles are often treated as non-negotiable, prolonging the conflict.
*   **Post-2019 Precedent:** The 35-day shutdown of 2018-19 created a new precedent for extended shutdowns. What was once unthinkable is now a known political playbook, potentially emboldening factions to hold out for longer.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior slightly favoring "No," perhaps around 40% Yes. The reference class of contentious, divided-government shutdowns shows they can be long, and we are already at the record. (Equivalent n ≈ 8, reflecting moderate confidence in the reference class).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **Current Duration (35 days):** ↓ Large. We are in outlier territory, indicating the forces for continuation are exceptionally strong and have overcome pressures that ended previous shutdowns.
    *   **Hardline Factional Veto:** ↓ Large. This structural problem within the House majority is the primary driver and makes a simple compromise unlikely. It is the key difference from many historical cases.
    *   **Imminent Thanksgiving Holiday:** ↑ Large. This is the strongest piece of evidence for "Yes." It is a powerful, historically effective action-forcing event that falls just after the resolution date.
    *   **Mounting Bipartisan/Moderate Pressure:** ↑ Moderate. The "cracks" are beginning to show, but it's unclear if this pressure is sufficient to overcome the hardline faction's influence on leadership.
    *   **Entrenched Leadership Rhetoric:** ↓ Small. Public posturing is expected, but the lack of any reported back-channel talks is a negative signal.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is mixed but leans negative. The structural, political realities (duration, factional veto) are powerful downward forces. The main upward force is the Thanksgiving deadline, but its timing (Nov 27) could easily allow the shutdown to pass the Nov 21 resolution date before a deal is struck over the final weekend. The posterior should move down from the prior, perhaps significantly.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (Shutdown will end before Nov 21):**
    *   House Speaker begins discussing a "discharge petition" as a viable way to force a vote on a clean CR.
    *   Public statements from several members of the hardline faction shifting focus from "no compromise" to "we've made our point."
    *   Reports of secret, high-level negotiations between the Speaker, Senate Majority Leader, and the White House.
    *   A significant stock market drop (>3%) explicitly attributed to the shutdown by financial analysts.
    *   Key party leaders cancel overseas trips or other engagements scheduled for the week of Thanksgiving.
*   **DOWN indicators (Shutdown will continue past Nov 21):**
    *   House leadership schedules votes on other, unrelated "messaging" bills instead of funding bills.
    *   The President or Speaker announces a national address to the nation to "explain their position," indicating a public relations campaign, not a negotiation.
    *   Agencies begin issuing more detailed guidance for a shutdown lasting into December.
    *   Rhetoric from the hardline faction escalates, adding new demands to the negotiation.
    *   No weekend sessions of Congress are scheduled for the weekends of Nov 8-9 or Nov 15-16.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Timing of the Deal:** The largest driver for resolution is the Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27). A deal could easily be struck on Nov 22 or 23, resolving "No" but still being driven by the holiday. The forecast is highly sensitive to the exact date of resolution.
*   **Definition of "End":** A short-term CR (e.g., one week) could be passed to get through the holiday, which would resolve the question as "Yes" but not solve the underlying dispute. The nature of the resolution matters.
*   **Exogenous Shocks:** An unrelated national security or economic crisis could instantly change the

To forecast the probability of the US government shutdown ending before November 21, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The base rate for this event can be derived from historical data on US government shutdowns. The most relevant reference class is "Contentious Modern Shutdowns" (n=4), which includes shutdowns lasting longer than one week. The current shutdown has already reached 35 days, matching the longest in history (2018-2019). Given this, the base rate for a shutdown ending within the next 17 days (between day 35 and day 52) is effectively 0/1, as the only one to reach 35 days ended on that day. This suggests a low probability of resolution based on historical precedent. Therefore, we start with a prior probability of around 40% for the shutdown ending before November 21, 2025.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to past contentious shutdowns in that it involves a divided government and significant political impasse.
- **Differences:** The current shutdown has reached a record-tying duration, indicating unusually strong political dynamics. Additionally, the presence of a hardline faction within the majority party adds complexity, making resolution more difficult compared to past shutdowns.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Current Duration (35 days):** The shutdown's duration is already at a historical maximum, suggesting strong forces for continuation. This decreases the probability of resolution.
- **Hardline Factional Veto:** The presence of a faction within the House majority that can veto compromises decreases the likelihood of a resolution.
- **Imminent Thanksgiving Holiday:** The upcoming holiday is a strong action-forcing event, historically effective in prompting resolutions. This increases the probability of resolution.
- **Mounting Bipartisan/Moderate Pressure:** Emerging pressure from moderates and bipartisan groups suggests potential for compromise, increasing the probability.
- **Entrenched Leadership Rhetoric:** Continued public posturing without back-channel negotiations decreases the probability.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Starting with a prior of 40% (odds of 0.67), we adjust based on the evidence:
- **Negative Evidence (Duration, Factional Veto):** Strong downward pressure, suggesting a likelihood ratio < 1.
- **Positive Evidence (Thanksgiving, Bipartisan Pressure):** Moderate upward pressure, suggesting a likelihood ratio > 1.

Given the mixed evidence, but with strong structural impediments, the posterior probability should be adjusted downward from the prior. A reasonable adjustment might be to lower the probability to around 30%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast could be overconfident in the negative direction due to the strong historical precedent of shutdowns ending around significant holidays.
- **Tail Risks:** An unexpected political breakthrough or external crisis could rapidly change the dynamics.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A forecast of 50% could be plausible if one believes the Thanksgiving deadline will exert overwhelming pressure.

### 6. Final Forecast
Considering the base rate, evidence, and potential biases, the final forecast is a probability of 30% that the US government shutdown will end before November 21, 2025.

Final: 30%

# Will the US government shutdown end before November 21, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I'll use the reference class of all post-1980 US government shutdowns, with special attention to "contentious" shutdowns lasting more than a week.

Looking at the historical data provided:
- There have been 10 government shutdowns since 1980
- The median duration is 3 days
- Only 4 shutdowns lasted more than a week: 1995 (5 days, then 21 days), 2013 (16 days), and 2018-2019 (35 days)
- The current shutdown has already reached 35 days (as of Nov 4, 2025)

The current shutdown has already matched the longest in US history (35 days from 2018-2019). Once shutdowns reach this extreme duration, they enter rare territory where historical precedents become less reliable.

Given that the question asks if the shutdown will end before November 21 (17 more days), I need to assess the probability of a 52-day shutdown. No shutdown in US history has lasted this long.

**Prior probability:** I'll start with a prior of 40% that the shutdown ends before November 21. This reflects that we're already in unprecedented territory duration-wise, but also acknowledges that extreme pressure tends to build as shutdowns extend.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Like previous extended shutdowns, this is occurring under divided government
- Federal workers have already missed one paycheck (Oct 24), similar to the pressure point in previous long shutdowns
- Public and media attention is increasing as hardships mount

**Key differences:**
- The current shutdown has already tied the longest in history (35 days), suggesting unusually entrenched positions
- There appears to be a hardline faction within the majority party that can effectively veto compromise, making resolution more difficult than in some past shutdowns
- The approaching Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27) creates a powerful deadline, but it falls after our resolution date
- Two missed paychecks (Oct 24 and Nov 7) will have occurred before our resolution date, with the third potential miss on Nov 21 itself

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Current Duration (35 days)**
- P(E|H): Probability of seeing a 35-day shutdown if it will end before Nov 21 = Low (0.3)
- P(E|~H): Probability of seeing a 35-day shutdown if it will continue past Nov 21 = High (0.8)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.8 = 0.375
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability of resolution before Nov 21

**Evidence 2: Bipartisan Senate group calling for a clean CR (Nov 1)**
- P(E|H): Probability of seeing this if shutdown will end before Nov 21 = Moderate-High (0.7)
- P(E|~H): Probability of seeing this if shutdown will continue past Nov 21 = Moderate (0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.5 = 1.4
- This evidence moderately increases the probability of resolution

**Evidence 3: Approaching Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27)**
- P(E|H): Probability of Thanksgiving creating pressure if shutdown ends before Nov 21 = High (0.8)
- P(E|~H): Probability of Thanksgiving creating pressure if shutdown continues past Nov 21 = Moderate (0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This evidence increases the probability of resolution, but note that Thanksgiving falls after our resolution date

**Evidence 4: House leadership's entrenched position (Nov 3)**
- P(E|H): Probability of seeing this rhetoric if shutdown ends before Nov 21 = Moderate (0.5)
- P(E|~H): Probability of seeing this rhetoric if shutdown continues past Nov 21 = Very High (0.9)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.5/0.9 = 0.56
- This evidence decreases the probability of resolution

**Evidence 5: Moderate House members expressing concern (Oct 29)**
- P(E|H): Probability of seeing this if shutdown ends before Nov 21 = High (0.8)
- P(E|~H): Probability of seeing this if shutdown continues past Nov 21 = Moderate (0.5)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.8/0.5 = 1.6
- This evidence increases the probability of resolution

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 40% (odds of 0.67):

First update (Current Duration):
- Prior odds: 0.67
- Likelihood ratio: 0.375
- Posterior odds: 0.67 × 0.375 = 0.25
- Posterior probability: 0.25/(1+0.25) = 20%

Second update (Bipartisan Senate group):
- Prior odds: 0.25
- Likelihood ratio: 1.4
- Posterior odds: 0.25 × 1.4 = 0.35
- Posterior probability: 0.35/(1+0.35) = 26%

Third update (Thanksgiving pressure):
- Prior odds: 0.35
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 0.35 × 1.6 = 0.56
- Posterior probability: 0.56/(1+0.56) = 36%

Fourth update (House leadership position):
- Prior odds: 0.56
- Likelihood ratio: 0.56
- Posterior odds: 0.56 × 0.56 = 0.31
- Posterior probability: 0.31/(1+0.31) = 24%

Fifth update (Moderate House members):
- Prior odds: 0.31
- Likelihood ratio: 1.6
- Posterior odds: 0.31 × 1.6 = 0.50
- Posterior probability: 0.50/(1+0.50) = 33%

After incorporating all evidence, my posterior probability is approximately 33% that the shutdown will end before November 21, 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the pressure from the third missed paycheck (Nov 21). Since this date coincides with our resolution date, there could be strong incentive to resolve before this critical threshold.
- I might be overweighting the historical precedent. Just because no shutdown has lasted 52+ days doesn't mean it can't happen.
- The proximity to Thanksgiving could create more urgency than I've accounted for, as legislators may want to resolve before the holiday week begins.

**Alternative forecast:**
A reasonable alternative forecast might be 50-60%, arguing that:
1. The third missed paycheck creates an inflection point that will force resolution
2. Thanksgiving holiday pressure will begin to be felt well before the actual holiday
3. Economic impacts will become severe enough to force compromise

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While these points have merit, the evidence of the hardline faction's veto power and the House leadership's entrenched position suggests that even these pressures may not be sufficient. The fact that we've already reached 35 days indicates an unusual level of political entrenchment.

After considering these points, I'll adjust my forecast slightly upward to 35%, acknowledging the potential pressure from the third missed paycheck coinciding with our resolution date.

Here is a probabilistic forecast based on the provided information.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

*   **Reference Class:** The most relevant reference class is not all government shutdowns, but rather shutdowns that have become protracted under a divided government. There are four such instances since 1990: 1995 (21 days), 2013 (16 days), 2018-19 (35 days), and the current one (35 days and counting).
*   **Base Rate Calculation:** The question is, given a shutdown has lasted 35 days, what is the probability it ends in the next 16 days (by day 51)? We have only one historical data point that reached this duration: the 2018-19 shutdown, which ended on day 35. This tiny sample (n=1) is insufficient for a robust base rate.
*   **Chosen Prior:** Instead, I will establish a prior based on the general principle that political pressure for resolution intensifies dramatically as major deadlines approach. The period from November 4 to November 20 contains two missed paychecks and leads directly into the Thanksgiving holiday week. This concentration of pressure points makes a resolution within this window more likely than in a random 16-day period. I will set a slightly optimistic prior of **P(H) = 60%** that the shutdown will end in this critical window.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

*   **Similarities:** The current situation is similar to the longest shutdown (2018-19) in that it occurs under a divided government and has become highly contentious, lasting for an extended period. Public and economic pressure are the primary mechanisms for resolution in both cases.
*   **Differences:**
    *   **Intra-Party Conflict:** The research report suggests this shutdown is driven by a hardline faction *within* the House majority exercising veto power over the Speaker. This is different from past shutdowns that were primarily inter-party disputes. This internal division makes it structurally harder for leadership to negotiate and deliver a compromise, suggesting this shutdown could be even more difficult to resolve.
    *   **Precedent:** The 35-day shutdown in 2018-19 created a new precedent. A shutdown of this length is no longer unthinkable, which may embolden hardliners to hold out for longer than they would have in the past.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let H be the event "the shutdown ends before November 21, 2025."

*   **Evidence 1: Intra-party factional veto power.**
    *   This is the key structural feature of the current crisis. This dynamic is much more likely given a prolonged stalemate (~H) than it is given a swift resolution (H). A resolution would require this faction to be defeated or to capitulate, which is difficult.
    *   *Likelihood Ratio: P(E|H) / P(E|~H) << 1 (Strongly decreases probability).*
*   **Evidence 2: Proximity to Thanksgiving holiday (Nov 27).**
    *   This is the most powerful action-forcing event on the horizon. The pressure on members of Congress to resolve the issue and return home for a major holiday is immense. This is highly indicative of a resolution happening soon (H).
    *   However, the peak pressure occurs in the days immediately preceding the holiday (e.g., Nov 22-25), which is *after* the resolution deadline of Nov 21. A deal struck on that weekend would resolve the question as "No." Therefore, while the holiday is a strong positive signal for a resolution *around* Thanksgiving, its timing makes it ambiguous for this specific question.
    *   *Likelihood Ratio: P(E|H) / P(E|~H) > 1 (Increases probability, but with a major caveat on timing).*
*   **Evidence 3: The shutdown has already lasted 35 days.**
    *   This demonstrates that the political forces causing the shutdown are exceptionally strong and have already resisted significant pressure (e.g., the first missed paycheck). This fact is more consistent with a continued, stubborn stalemate (~H) than an imminent resolution (H).
    *   *Likelihood Ratio: P(E|H) / P(E|~H) < 1 (Decreases probability).*
*   **Evidence 4: Growing pressure from bipartisan senators and moderate House members.**
    *   These "cracks" in party-line unity are a classic precursor to a deal. This evidence is more likely if a resolution is near (H). However, its effectiveness is uncertain against the power of the hardline faction.
    *   *Likelihood Ratio: P(E|H) / P(E|~H) > 1 (Moderately increases probability).*

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

1.  **Start with the prior:** P(H) = 60%, or 1.5-to-1 odds in favor.
2.  **Apply the strongest negative evidence:** The intra-party veto power is the core problem. It suggests a fundamental brokenness in the legislative process that is hard to overcome. This is a powerful argument for a longer shutdown. I'll apply a strong negative update, multiplying the odds by 1/3.
    *   New Odds = 1.5 * (1/3) = 0.5
    *   New Probability = 0.5 / (1 + 0.5) = 33.3%
3.  **Apply the strongest positive evidence:** The Thanksgiving deadline. This is a massive force pushing for resolution. However, because its peak effect is after the Nov 21 cutoff, its power to force a "Yes" is diminished. A resolution on Nov 22 is a very plausible outcome that would be driven by Thanksgiving but resolve as "No". I will apply a moderate positive update, multiplying the odds by 2.
    *   New Odds = 0.5 * 2 = 1.0
    *   New Probability = 1.0 / (1 + 1.0) = 50%
4.  **Combine remaining evidence:** The record duration (negative) and building moderate pressure (positive) are somewhat offsetting. The fact that the shutdown has persisted this long suggests the moderate pressure is not yet decisive. The net effect is slightly negative. I'll apply a final small update, multiplying odds by 0.9.
    *   Final Odds = 1.0 * 0.9 = 0.9
    *   **Final Probability ≈ 0.9 / 1.9 = 47%**

### 5. Red Team Thinking

My forecast is slightly below 50%, suggesting a "No" is more likely. The strongest argument against this is the possibility of a short-term "clean" Continuing Resolution (CR). Congress could pass a simple extension to get through the holidays and postpone the fight until December. This is a common tactic. If the pressure from moderates becomes unbearable, the Speaker might risk the wrath of the hardliners to pass a clean CR with bipartisan support. This would resolve the question as "Yes".

However, the core of the problem remains the Speaker's apparent inability to control their own caucus. The hardline faction may view a clean CR as a total capitulation and could threaten the Speaker's position, making inertia (continuing the shutdown) the safer political option for leadership. The most probable single scenario seems to be a frantic, last-minute deal struck on the weekend before Thanksgiving (Nov 22-23), which would resolve this question as "No". My forecast reflects that this scenario is slightly more likely than a resolution happening a few days earlier.

### 6. Final Forecast

The forecast is a close call, balancing two powerful and opposing forces: an unprecedented level of internal party dysfunction pushing for a longer shutdown, and the immense political pressure of the Thanksgiving holiday pushing for an imminent resolution. Because the peak of the holiday pressure falls just after the question's deadline, and the political stalemate appears exceptionally rigid, I assess that it is slightly more likely than not that the shutdown will continue past November 20th.

Final: 47%
