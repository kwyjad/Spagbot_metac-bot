### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Falcon 9 Block 5 Launches:** This is the most specific and relevant class. Since its introduction in May 2018, this variant has flown over 300 times with zero launch failures. A simple base rate is 0%. Using a Bayesian approach like the Rule of Three to estimate the upper bound of the failure rate given zero failures in ~320 trials (approximate number of Block 5 flights by late 2025) suggests the failure rate is very likely below 1% (specifically, 3/320 ≈ 0.94%).
2.  **All Falcon 9 / Falcon Heavy Launches:** This class includes earlier, less mature versions of the rocket. There have been two failures (one in-flight, one on-pad) in approximately 355 total launches to date. This yields a historical failure rate of ~0.56%. This rate is likely an overestimate for the current system's reliability.
3.  **Modern Commercial Orbital Launch Vehicles (e.g., Atlas V, Ariane 5/6):** This class provides broader industry context. Highly reliable vehicles like the Atlas V have success rates exceeding 98% (failure rate <2%). The industry average for mature systems is typically in the 1-3% failure rate range per launch. This serves as a conservative upper bound.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-24** SpaceX successfully launches 25th mission in 60 days — **↓** — Demonstrates continued high operational tempo and reliability under strain, reinforcing the "factory-like" production and launch model's success.
*   **2025-10-15** A Falcon 9 booster completes its 25th flight — **↓** — Pushes the envelope on reuse successfully, providing more data on component lifetime and further validating the refurbishment process. Each high-flight-count success reduces uncertainty about wear-related failures.
*   **2025-09-02** Minor pad-side anomaly during static fire test causes one-week delay for a Starlink mission — **↑ (small)** — Highlights that ground systems and pre-flight checks remain a potential source of issues, though the system successfully caught the problem before launch.
*   **2025-07-20** SpaceX announces accelerated launch cadence for Q4 2025 to meet Starlink v3 deployment goals — **↑ (small)** — Increased operational tempo could potentially strain quality control, maintenance crews, and supply chains, slightly elevating the risk of human error or missed inspections.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Maturity & Iteration (Large ↓):** The Falcon 9 Block 5 is a highly mature and understood system. SpaceX's iterative design philosophy and vast dataset from hundreds of flights allow for continuous refinement and the elimination of potential failure modes.
2.  **Booster Reuse (Moderate ↓ / Small ↑):** Reuse provides an unparalleled amount of data on component wear and performance through post-flight inspections, driving reliability improvements. However, it also introduces the risk of latent wear-and-tear issues or novel failure modes on high-life boosters that have not yet been observed. The net effect is considered a strong positive for reliability.
3.  **High Launch Cadence (Moderate ↓ / Small ↑):** A high, steady launch rate creates a "production line" effect, reducing the chance of one-off errors that can occur with infrequent operations ("standing army" effect). Conversely, it can strain personnel and resources, potentially increasing the risk of mistakes.
4.  **Vertical Integration (Moderate ↓):** SpaceX's control over the design, manufacturing, and testing of most components reduces reliance on external suppliers and allows for rapid root cause analysis and implementation of fixes, improving overall system reliability.
5.  **Engine-Out Capability (Moderate ↓):** The Falcon 9's nine-engine first stage is designed to complete its mission even if one engine fails during ascent. This redundancy has been successfully used in flight (e.g., Starlink V1 L5 in March 2020), preventing a mission failure.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Unprecedented Success Streak:** The most significant difference is the active streak of over 300 consecutive successes for the Block 5 variant, which is statistically anomalous compared to any other launch vehicle's introductory period or overall history. The base rates of other rockets do not account for this demonstrated hyper-reliability.
*   **Vast Flight Data:** Unlike any other launch program in history, SpaceX collects extensive data from dozens of recovered and inspected boosters each year. This creates a rapid learning cycle that is not present in programs with fully expendable vehicles.
*   **Extreme Operational Tempo:** SpaceX's launch rate (approaching 100-120 launches per year) is an order of magnitude higher than most other vehicles in the reference class. This operational environment is unique and has its own distinct risk profile.
*   **Single System Dominance:** SpaceX relies almost exclusively on a single, well-understood rocket family. This contrasts with agencies or countries that operate multiple distinct vehicles, allowing for deeper system-specific expertise to develop.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with a prior informed by the "Modern Commercial Orbital Launch Vehicles" reference class, suggesting a per-launch failure probability of ~1-2%. This could be represented by a Beta(1, 99) distribution, reflecting a belief in high but not perfect reliability.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↓ (Large):** The primary evidence is the perfect success record of the Falcon 9 Block 5 across 300+ launches. This should overwhelmingly pull the posterior probability of failure per launch towards a very low value (e.g., <0.5%).
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The robust data collection from booster reuse and successful high-life missions provides strong evidence that the learning curve is steep and that wear-related risks are being successfully managed.
    *   **↑ (Small):** The extremely high launch cadence acts as a slight counterweight, introducing a small, persistent risk of operational strain or human error not fully captured in historical data.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior belief in the per-launch failure rate should be significantly lower than the prior, heavily concentrated in the 0.1% - 0.5% range. The forecast for the number of failures should be overwhelmingly concentrated on zero.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   Any launch scrub after the T-1 minute mark for a new technical reason.
    *   A stand-down or multi-week delay for a non-weather, non-range issue.
    *   Public statements from NASA or DoD expressing new concerns about quality control.
    *   An anomaly during a static fire test that damages pad equipment.
    *   Loss of a booster during a landing attempt due to a new hardware failure mode.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   Every successful launch between now and Dec 31, 2025.
    *   A new record for booster reuse (e.g., 26th or 27th flight) is set without issue.
    *   Official statements from SpaceX confirming production and launch cadence targets are being met smoothly.
    *   Successful introduction of a minor upgrade (e.g., Block 5.1) without incident.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Resolution Criteria:** The forecast is tied strictly to the "Launch outcome" column on a specific Wikipedia page. An edit war or a subjective classification of a partial failure could theoretically affect the resolution, though this is unlikely for a major anomaly.
*   **"Black Swan" Event:** The primary risk is a novel, unanticipated failure mode. With a mature system, failures often come from complex interactions or "unknown unknowns" rather than common causes.
*   **The Problem of Zero:** Forecasting based on a long streak of zeros is statistically challenging. The true underlying failure rate is not zero, but it is very difficult to estimate precisely. The model should reflect a very small but non-zero probability.
*   **Time Period is Almost Over:** As of today (2025-11-26), ~98% of the 2022-2025 period has passed with zero failures. The forecast is almost entirely dependent on the outcome of the ~8-12 launches remaining in 2025.

**Final Research Summary:** The number of Falcon 9 family failures from 2022 through today is zero. The forecast hinges on the small, non-zero probability of a failure in the handful of launches remaining before 2026. Given the Falcon 9 Block 5's unprecedented reliability streak of over 300 successes, the probability of a failure in this short window is extremely low, and the final distribution should be overwhelmingly concentrated on 0.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The most relevant base rate is the Falcon 9 Block 5 launch history, which has had zero failures in over 300 launches. This suggests a very low failure rate, potentially below 1%. A conservative estimate using the Rule of Three gives an upper bound of approximately 0.94%.
   - The mean of this base rate is close to zero, with a variance reflecting the small but non-zero probability of failure.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - The current situation is similar to the reference distribution due to the continued success and reliability of the Falcon 9 Block 5.
   - Differences include the high operational tempo and the extensive data from reused boosters, which could slightly increase the risk of failure due to operational strain but also enhance reliability through rapid learning.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - The perfect success record of the Falcon 9 Block 5 (↓ Large) strongly supports a lower failure rate.
   - The high launch cadence (↑ Small) introduces a slight risk of operational errors.
   - Successful high-flight-count missions (↓ Moderate) reduce uncertainty about wear-related failures.
   - Minor anomalies caught pre-launch (↑ Small) indicate potential issues but also show effective risk management.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Starting with a prior failure rate of ~1-2%, the strong evidence of continued success significantly lowers the posterior failure rate.
   - The posterior distribution is heavily skewed towards zero failures, with a small probability of one failure due to the high launch rate and operational risks.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of tail risks, such as a novel failure mode or operational oversight, suggests maintaining a non-zero probability of failure.
   - An alternative forecast might assume a higher failure rate due to operational strain, but the evidence of reliability and successful risk management counters this.
   - Adjustments ensure the forecast accounts for small but plausible risks.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the evidence and Bayesian updates, the forecast is overwhelmingly concentrated on zero failures, with a very small chance of one failure.

# Forecasting Falcon 9 Failures Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

**Primary reference class**: Falcon 9 Block 5 performance (most relevant)
- The Block 5 variant has had 0 failures in approximately 300+ launches since May 2018
- Using the Rule of Three for zero-failure systems, this suggests an upper bound failure rate of 3/300 = 1% per launch

**Secondary reference class**: All Falcon 9 family historical performance
- 2 failures in approximately 355 total launches (~0.56% failure rate)
- These failures occurred in earlier variants with less mature designs

**Tertiary reference class**: Modern commercial orbital launch vehicles
- Mature systems like Atlas V have failure rates <2%
- Industry average for established systems is 1-3% per launch

Based on these reference classes, I'll use a prior centered on a 0.5% per-launch failure probability, with most of the probability mass below 1%.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution**:
- The Falcon 9 continues to be the same fundamental rocket system
- SpaceX maintains the same core engineering and operational teams
- The mission profiles remain similar (primarily LEO/GTO deployments)

**Differences from reference distribution**:
- The current Block 5 variant has demonstrated unprecedented reliability (300+ consecutive successes)
- SpaceX now has vastly more flight data and experience than at any previous point
- Launch cadence has increased dramatically (approaching 100-120 launches per year)
- Booster reuse has been pushed to new limits (25+ flights for some boosters)
- Only ~8-12 launches remain in the forecast period (we're at November 26, 2025)

These differences suggest the current failure rate is likely lower than historical averages.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence favoring lower failure count**:
- Perfect success record of Block 5 variant (very strong evidence, ~10:1 likelihood ratio favoring lower failure rates)
- Extensive data collection from recovered boosters enabling rapid learning and improvement (moderate evidence, ~3:1 likelihood ratio)
- Engine-out capability providing redundancy against single-engine failures (moderate evidence, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)
- Vertical integration allowing for tight quality control (moderate evidence, ~2:1 likelihood ratio)

**Evidence favoring higher failure count**:
- Accelerated launch cadence potentially straining operations (weak evidence, ~1.5:1 likelihood ratio favoring higher failure rates)
- Minor pad anomaly in September 2025 indicating potential ground system issues (very weak evidence, ~1.2:1 likelihood ratio)
- Pushing boundaries of booster reuse beyond previous experience (very weak evidence, ~1.1:1 likelihood ratio)

The net evidence strongly favors a lower failure rate than the prior.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered on 0.5% failure rate per launch, I'll update based on the evidence:

- The 300+ consecutive successful Block 5 launches provides overwhelming evidence for a very low failure rate
- If we model this as a Beta distribution, starting with Beta(1, 199) representing a 0.5% failure rate, and update with 300+ successes, we get approximately Beta(1, 499+) 
- This yields a posterior failure rate of approximately 0.2% per launch

With ~8-12 launches remaining in 2025:
- Expected number of failures = 0.002 × 10 = 0.02 failures
- Probability of 0 failures = (1-0.002)^10 ≈ 0.98 or 98%
- Probability of 1 failure = 10 × 0.002 × (1-0.002)^9 ≈ 0.0196 or ~2%
- Probability of 2+ failures is negligible (<0.1%)

Since we're at November 26, 2025, and no failures have occurred from 2022-2025 so far, the posterior distribution is heavily concentrated on 0.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- "Black swan" events: Novel failure modes could emerge that weren't anticipated
- Complacency: The long success streak could lead to reduced vigilance
- Operational strain: The high launch cadence might create hidden stresses not yet manifested
- Statistical overconfidence: Zero failures doesn't mean zero probability

**Alternative forecast considerations**:
- A more conservative approach might place higher weight on the industry average failure rate (1-3%)
- The remaining time window is very short, which limits exposure but doesn't eliminate risk
- A single catastrophic failure could occur without warning, as happened with previous mature systems

I should slightly increase the probability of at least one failure to account for these considerations, particularly the possibility of a black swan event.

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential blind spots, here is my final forecast for the number of Falcon 9 failures before 2026:

P10: 0
P20: 0
P40: 0
P60: 0
P80: 0
P90: 1

Here is my probabilistic forecast.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the total number of Falcon 9 family failures from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2025. As of the forecast date (November 26, 2025), there have been zero failures in this period. The forecast, therefore, reduces to estimating the number of failures in the remaining ~5 weeks of 2025.

The key parameter for my prior is the per-launch failure probability (`p_fail`). I select the most specific reference class: the Falcon 9 Block 5 variant.
- **Reference Class:** Falcon 9 Block 5 launches.
- **Data:** This variant has a perfect record of over 300 successful launches since its debut in 2018.
- **Prior Distribution:** Using a Bayesian approach (e.g., updating a uniform Beta(1,1) prior with ~320 successes) suggests a posterior mean `p_fail` of approximately 0.3%. A more conservative base rate, including all Falcon 9 history (2 failures in ~355 launches), is ~0.56%. I will anchor my estimate in this 0.3% - 0.6% range.

The other key parameter is the number of launches (`N`) in the remaining period. Based on recent cadence (25 launches in 60 days) and end-of-year acceleration, I estimate `N` to be between 12 and 15.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The upcoming launches are standard missions using the same mature hardware and procedures that established the base rate. However, there are two key differences that slightly increase the risk compared to a simple historical average:
1.  **Accelerated Cadence:** The report notes an accelerated schedule for Q4 2025. This increases operational tempo, which can strain personnel and quality control, slightly elevating the risk of human error.
2.  **Pushing the Reuse Envelope:** With boosters now flying 25+ times, SpaceX is operating in a domain with less historical data, which introduces a small risk of undiscovered wear-out failure modes.

These factors justify using a `p_fail` slightly higher than the most optimistic estimates derived purely from the success streak.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Evidence for Lower Failures (↓):** The dominant piece of evidence is the unprecedented success streak of over 300 Block 5 launches. This provides a very strong likelihood that the true `p_fail` is low. This is further supported by the robust data collection from booster reuse and systemic reliability factors like engine-out capability.
- **Evidence for Higher Failures (↑):** The primary evidence pushing the forecast up is the operational strain from the high launch cadence. This is a small, qualitative adjustment suggesting the risk is not zero. The minor pad-side anomaly is weak evidence; the fact that it was caught pre-launch can also be seen as a sign of system robustness.

The net effect is that the evidence for reliability is overwhelming, but the operational context suggests a small, non-zero probability of failure that might be slightly elevated compared to the long-term average.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
I model the number of failures in the remaining period using a Binomial distribution, `Failures ~ Bin(N, p_fail)`. The total number of failures for 2022-2025 will be `0 + Failures_remaining`.

- **Prior:** A `p_fail` centered around 0.4%.
- **Evidence:** The factors of accelerated cadence and high-reuse push me to adopt a more conservative set of parameters for the final calculation.
- **Update Step:** I will use `N = 15` (high end of launch estimate) and `p_fail = 0.006` (near the conservative end of my range, reflecting the historical rate of all F9 versions).
    -   P(0 failures) = (1 - 0.006)^15 ≈ 0.914
    -   P(1 failure) = 15 * 0.006 * (1 - 0.006)^14 ≈ 0.083
    -   P(≥2 failures) ≈ 1 - 0.914 - 0.083 = 0.003
- **Posterior:** My final distribution for the total number of failures is heavily concentrated on zero. There is approximately a 91.4% chance of zero failures, an 8.3% chance of one failure, and a negligible chance of more than one.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast of all percentiles being 0 seems extreme. Could I be overconfident?
- **Alternative Forecast:** The main alternative is that there will be one failure. This would require P(0 failures) to be lower than 90%. For this to happen with N=15 launches, the per-launch failure probability `p_fail` would need to be greater than 0.7%.
- **Plausibility:** A `p_fail` of >0.7% is higher than the entire historical average for the Falcon 9 program (~0.56%), which includes its less reliable early versions. It seems implausible that the current, highly mature Block 5 system is *less* reliable than the program's average. The streak of 300+ successes strongly argues against such a high failure rate.
- **Conclusion:** While a single failure is possible (I assign it an ~8% chance), it is not probable enough to shift the 90th percentile up to 1. The model correctly reflects that a failure would be a tail event. The Metaculus community forecast, with ~92% probability on zero, corroborates this conclusion. I will stick with my distribution.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My posterior distribution is P(0) ≈ 91.4%, P(1) ≈ 8.3%, P(≥2) ≈ 0.3%. The cumulative distribution function is P(≤0) = 0.914. Since the cumulative probability at zero exceeds 0.90, all percentiles up to the 91st must be 0.
