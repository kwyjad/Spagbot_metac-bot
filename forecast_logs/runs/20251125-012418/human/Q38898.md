### Reference class & base rates
1.  **High-profile federal prisoners testifying before Congress.** This is a rare event. It requires a subpoena, followed by a court-issued *writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum*, which compels the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to produce the prisoner. The process involves coordination between the legislative, judicial, and executive (DOJ/BOP) branches, creating multiple points of failure. **Base rate estimate: <5%** for a specific, high-profile prisoner to be compelled to testify within a given year, and significantly lower within a specific 6-week window.
2.  **Major congressional investigations securing key witness testimony in the final weeks of a session.** As a congressional session ("lame duck" period) ends, legislative focus often shifts to must-pass bills (e.g., funding). Launching a complex, high-security proceeding like this is unusual. Most major hearings are planned months in advance. **Base rate estimate: <10%** for a new, logistically complex witness hearing to be scheduled and executed in the final 6 weeks of a Congress.
3.  **Individuals with knowledge of high-level crimes cooperating post-conviction.** After exhausting appeals, some inmates cooperate in exchange for potential sentence reductions (under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35) or improved prison conditions. However, those implicated in conspiracies with powerful figures may also face significant pressure or threats to remain silent. The rate of cooperation is highly variable and case-specific. **Base rate estimate: 20-30%** for some form of cooperation, but public testimony is a much smaller subset of that.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-21** Comer demands Clinton depositions for Dec 17-18. **↓** — Shows the committee's immediate, short-term focus is on the Clintons, consuming limited time and resources before the session ends.
*   **2025-10-06** Supreme Court denies Maxwell's appeal. **↑** — This exhausts her primary legal avenues for overturning her conviction, potentially increasing her incentive to cooperate or negotiate in exchange for benefits (e.g., sentence reduction, prison transfer).
*   **2025-07-22** House Oversight Committee approves motion to seek a subpoena for Maxwell. **↑** — This was the necessary first step, establishing clear congressional intent. However, a motion is not a subpoena, and no public action has followed in four months.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Maxwell's Cooperation Calculus (Large):** With her appeal denied, her primary motivation would be to trade information for a sentence reduction or other benefits. Conversely, fear of reprisal from powerful figures or self-incrimination (risking new charges) strongly incentivizes silence. Her decision is the single largest driver.
2.  **Bureaucratic & Logistical Feasibility (Large):** The timeline is the biggest obstacle. Securing a writ, coordinating with the DOJ/BOP, and arranging secure transport or remote testimony for a high-risk inmate before Jan 1, 2026, is a monumental task, especially during the holiday season. This is a powerful driver towards NO.
3.  **Committee's Political Will & Priority (Moderate):** Chairman Comer has demonstrated a strong will to investigate the Epstein network. However, with the 118th Congress ending, his priority may be securing the Clinton depositions, a tangible goal, rather than starting the complex Maxwell process which may not conclude in time.
4.  **Legal Maneuvering (Moderate):** Even if subpoenaed, Maxwell's lawyers could file motions to quash it, citing her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, safety concerns, or other procedural arguments. This would easily delay any testimony past the deadline.
5.  **Resolution Criteria: "Hearing" vs. "Deposition" (Moderate):** The committee's stated goal is a *deposition*, which is typically a private, sworn testimony. The resolution requires a public *hearing*. The committee may achieve its goal (a deposition) in 2026, but that would not trigger a YES resolution for this question.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Extreme Political Sensitivity:** Unlike a typical witness, Maxwell's testimony could implicate a former/current President (Trump), a former President (Clinton), and numerous other global elites, making the political stakes and potential for executive branch resistance exceptionally high.
*   **Unprecedented Security Risk:** Maxwell is arguably one of the most high-profile and high-risk inmates in the federal system. The security logistics for her testimony, whether in-person or remote, would be far more complex than for a standard prisoner.
*   **Severely Compressed Timeline:** The question resolves in under six weeks, coinciding with the end of a congressional session and major holidays. This is a uniquely powerful constraint not present in the general reference class of congressional investigations.
*   **Witness as the "Rosetta Stone":** Alan Dershowitz's comment highlights that Maxwell is not just *a* witness but potentially *the* central witness to the entire Epstein operation. This elevates both the incentive to hear her testimony and the incentive for powerful people to prevent it.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A low prior, perhaps 10%, is warranted, reflecting the low base rate of incarcerated individuals testifying before Congress, especially on such a short timeline. (Equivalent n ~10).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   **↑ (Moderate):** The committee's formal motion to seek a subpoena and the SCOTUS denial of Maxwell's appeal create a plausible pathway and motivation for testimony.
    *   **↓ (Large):** The sub-six-week timeline until the end of the 118th Congress presents a near-insurmountable logistical and bureaucratic barrier.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The committee's immediate focus on the Clinton depositions suggests Maxwell is not the top priority for the remaining legislative days.
    *   **↓ (Moderate):** The high potential for legal challenges from Maxwell's team to delay proceedings past the deadline.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly reinforces the low prior. The initial political momentum from July has been overwhelmed by the reality of the calendar. The posterior should be revised significantly downwards.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   The House Oversight Committee formally issues a subpoena to Ghislaine Maxwell.
    *   The committee files a petition in federal court for a *writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum*.
    *   Public statements from Maxwell's attorneys indicating a willingness to negotiate testimony.
    *   The committee publicly schedules a hearing involving Maxwell for late December.
*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   No public action on the Maxwell subpoena by the second week of December.
    *   Chairman Comer's public statements focus exclusively on the Clintons or other matters.
    *   The House announces its final legislative schedule for the year with no mention of a Maxwell hearing.
    *   Reports that the committee will pursue a deposition in the next Congress (i.e., after the deadline).

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Deposition vs. Hearing:** This is the most significant definitional pitfall. The committee could successfully depose Maxwell, but if it's not at a "hearing," the question resolves NO. Media may conflate the two terms.
*   **Maxwell's Health and Safety:** As a high-profile inmate, her safety is a real concern. Her death or incapacitation before testifying would resolve the question as NO.
*   **"Lame Duck" Inactivity:** The period between an election and the start of the new Congress is often marked by a lack of significant legislative action. The political will from July may have entirely dissipated.
*   **Information Asymmetry:** Any negotiations between the committee, DOJ, and Maxwell's lawyers would be confidential. A deal could be reached and executed quickly, surprising outside observers, though this is unlikely given the logistics.

**Final Research Summary:** While the political desire to hear from Ghislaine Maxwell is established, the severe logistical hurdles and the extremely short timeline before the 118th Congress adjourns make a formal public hearing before 2026 highly improbable.

To forecast the probability of Ghislaine Maxwell giving oral testimony on the Epstein Files or Epstein's relationship with Trump in a hearing at the US Congress before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate Estimate:** The base rate for high-profile federal prisoners testifying before Congress is estimated to be less than 5% per year. Given the specific context and the compressed timeline, this base rate is likely even lower.
- **Rationale:** This base rate is chosen based on the rarity of such events, the complex legal and logistical hurdles involved, and the political sensitivity of the case.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The situation involves a high-profile prisoner and a politically sensitive case, aligning with the base case of rare congressional testimonies by such individuals.
- **Differences:** The timeline is extremely compressed, with less than six weeks remaining in the congressional session, and the political stakes are exceptionally high due to potential implications for powerful figures.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Committee's Motion to Subpoena (↑):** The committee's motion to seek a subpoena is a positive indicator, suggesting intent. However, it is not a guarantee of action. Likelihood ratio: Moderate increase.
- **Supreme Court Denial of Appeal (↑):** This increases Maxwell's potential motivation to cooperate, as her legal options are exhausted. Likelihood ratio: Moderate increase.
- **Compressed Timeline (↓):** The short timeline is a significant barrier, making it unlikely that all necessary steps can be completed in time. Likelihood ratio: Large decrease.
- **Focus on Clinton Depositions (↓):** The committee's focus on other matters suggests Maxwell is not the top priority. Likelihood ratio: Moderate decrease.
- **Potential Legal Challenges (↓):** Legal maneuvers could easily delay proceedings past the deadline. Likelihood ratio: Moderate decrease.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Probability:** Start with a low prior of 10% due to the rarity and complexity of the event.
- **Evidence Update:** The positive indicators (committee motion, appeal denial) are outweighed by the negative indicators (timeline, focus on other matters, legal challenges).
- **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
  - Prior odds = 10% / 90% = 0.111
  - Likelihood ratio (combined): Given the strong negative evidence, assume a net likelihood ratio of 0.3.
  - Posterior odds = 0.111 * 0.3 = 0.0333
  - Posterior probability = 0.0333 / (1 + 0.0333) ≈ 3.2%

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** The forecast might underestimate the possibility of rapid developments or undisclosed negotiations.
- **Alternative Scenarios:** Consider the possibility of a sudden political shift or a strategic decision by Maxwell to testify.
- **Rebuttals:** The logistical and legal barriers remain significant, and the timeline is a critical constraint.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** After considering all evidence and potential scenarios, the probability of Maxwell testifying before the deadline is very low.
- **Final Output:**
  
Final: 3%

# Probability Analysis: Will Ghislaine Maxwell Testify Before Congress by 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for a high-profile federal prisoner testifying before Congress on a politically sensitive matter within a specific timeframe.

The most relevant reference class is: **High-profile federal prisoners testifying before Congress within a short, specific timeframe (approximately 5 weeks in this case).**

This is an extremely rare event that requires:
- A formal congressional subpoena
- A court-issued writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum
- Coordination between legislative, judicial, and executive branches
- Security arrangements for a high-risk prisoner
- Overcoming potential legal challenges from the witness

Based on historical precedent, the base rate for such events is very low, likely below 5%. Given the compressed timeline (only about 5 weeks remaining until January 1, 2026), I'll set a conservative **prior probability of 3%**.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Maxwell is a federal prisoner requiring the same legal mechanisms as other prisoners to testify
- The House Oversight Committee has expressed formal interest in her testimony
- There is political motivation to hear from her given her connection to a high-profile case

**Key differences:**
- **Timeline is extremely compressed**: With only about 5 weeks remaining in 2025, this is far shorter than typical congressional investigation timelines
- **End of congressional session**: The 118th Congress is in its final weeks, with competing priorities and the "lame duck" period typically not conducive to launching complex new proceedings
- **Exceptional security concerns**: Maxwell is an unusually high-risk witness given her connection to powerful figures and the suspicious circumstances of Epstein's death
- **Extraordinary political sensitivity**: Her testimony could implicate a former/current President and numerous global elites
- **Committee's current focus**: The committee appears to be prioritizing Clinton depositions in December, consuming limited remaining time

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the already low base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: House Oversight Committee approved a motion to seek a subpoena (July 2025)**
- P(E|H): ~0.95 (If she were to testify, such a motion would almost certainly have occurred)
- P(E|~H): ~0.30 (Many congressional motions are approved without resulting in testimony)
- Likelihood ratio: ~3.17
- This moderately increases probability, but the motion was four months ago with no visible progress

**Evidence 2: Supreme Court denied Maxwell's appeal in October 2025**
- P(E|H): ~0.70 (Exhausting appeals could increase willingness to cooperate)
- P(E|~H): ~0.65 (Appeal denial would happen regardless of testimony plans)
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.08
- This very slightly increases probability

**Evidence 3: No subpoena has been issued in the four months since the motion**
- P(E|H): ~0.10 (If testimony were imminent, a subpoena would likely have been issued by now)
- P(E|~H): ~0.90 (Long delays or inaction are common when testimony won't occur)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.11
- This strongly decreases probability

**Evidence 4: Committee has scheduled Clinton depositions for December 17-18**
- P(E|H): ~0.30 (If Maxwell were to testify, the committee might still prioritize other witnesses)
- P(E|~H): ~0.80 (Scheduling other major witnesses suggests Maxwell is not an immediate priority)
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.38
- This significantly decreases probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 3:97 (3% probability):

**Update on Evidence 1 (motion approval):**
- Prior odds: 3:97 = 0.031
- Likelihood ratio: 3.17
- Posterior odds: 0.031 × 3.17 = 0.098
- Posterior probability: 0.098/(1+0.098) = 8.9%

**Update on Evidence 2 (appeal denial):**
- Prior odds: 8.9:91.1 = 0.098
- Likelihood ratio: 1.08
- Posterior odds: 0.098 × 1.08 = 0.106
- Posterior probability: 0.106/(1+0.106) = 9.6%

**Update on Evidence 3 (no subpoena issued):**
- Prior odds: 9.6:90.4 = 0.106
- Likelihood ratio: 0.11
- Posterior odds: 0.106 × 0.11 = 0.012
- Posterior probability: 0.012/(1+0.012) = 1.2%

**Update on Evidence 4 (Clinton depositions scheduled):**
- Prior odds: 1.2:98.8 = 0.012
- Likelihood ratio: 0.38
- Posterior odds: 0.012 × 0.38 = 0.0046
- Posterior probability: 0.0046/(1+0.0046) = 0.46%

After incorporating all evidence, the posterior probability is approximately 0.5%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the speed at which Congress can act when motivated
- There could be private negotiations or preparations not visible to the public
- The committee might schedule an emergency hearing in late December

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Maxwell could have already agreed to testify in exchange for benefits, with arrangements being made quietly
- The committee might be deliberately keeping plans quiet for security reasons
- A remote testimony option could simplify logistics and enable faster scheduling

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might argue for 5-10% probability, citing:
- The strong political motivation to hear from Maxwell
- The committee's demonstrated interest via the motion
- Potential for expedited procedures given the high-profile nature

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
Even with strong motivation, the procedural and logistical barriers remain formidable:
- The writ process alone typically takes weeks
- Legal challenges from Maxwell's attorneys could easily push past January 1
- The committee's focus on Clinton depositions consumes critical remaining time
- The holiday period further complicates scheduling

After considering these alternatives, I believe my forecast of approximately 0.5% is appropriate, though I'll adjust slightly upward to account for the possibility of unseen preparations.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering all evidence and the extremely compressed timeline, I assess there is approximately a 1% chance that Ghislaine Maxwell will give oral testimony on the Epstein Files or Epstein's relationship with Trump in a hearing at the US Congress before 2026.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The appropriate reference class is "attempts by a US Congressional committee to compel public testimony from a high-profile, incarcerated federal prisoner within a short, specific timeframe." This is an exceedingly rare event. The process requires not just a subpoena but a court-issued *writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum*, which compels the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to produce the prisoner. This involves complex coordination between the legislative, judicial, and executive (DOJ/BOP) branches.

A generous base rate for a congressional committee successfully securing testimony from a *non-incarcerated* but resistant witness within a single session might be 30-40%. For an *incarcerated* witness, the logistical and legal hurdles are much higher, dropping the probability significantly. For this to happen within the final ~5 weeks of a "lame duck" Congress, which includes major holidays, the base rate is even lower.

Given these factors, a reasonable prior probability P(H) is **10%**. This acknowledges the committee's formal vote to seek a subpoena (which elevates it from a zero-probability event) but respects the immense inherent difficulties. In odds, this is 1:9.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
**Similarities:**
*   A politically motivated committee is investigating a high-profile scandal.
*   The witness is seen as central to the investigation ("the Rosetta Stone").

**Differences (and their impact):**
*   **Incarceration Status:** Unlike most congressional witnesses, Maxwell is a high-security federal inmate. This adds layers of legal and logistical complexity (court orders, BOP coordination, security protocols) that do not exist in the base case, strongly decreasing the probability.
*   **Extreme Timeline:** The question resolves before Jan 1, 2026, leaving just over one month from today (Nov 25, 2025). This period includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, when government work slows considerably. This is a uniquely powerful constraint that drastically reduces the chances of success.
*   **Political and Security Stakes:** The testimony could implicate a former President and other global elites. This raises the security risk for Maxwell to an extraordinary level and increases the potential for political interference or obstruction from the executive branch, further lowering the probability.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let's evaluate key evidence against the 10% prior.

*   **Evidence (E1):** Four months have passed since the committee's July 22 vote to seek a subpoena, with no public follow-up action (e.g., subpoena issued, court filing).
    *   **P(E1 | H):** If a hearing were to happen before Jan 1 (H), it is very unlikely there would be four months of public silence. Urgent action would have been needed. The probability of this evidence, given the hypothesis is true, is very low.
    *   **P(E1 | ~H):** If no hearing were to happen (~H), this long period of inaction is exactly what one would expect. The initial vote may have been for political messaging, with the committee later deprioritizing the effort due to its complexity. The probability of this evidence, given the hypothesis is false, is high.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** (Very Low / High) << 1. This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence (E2):** The Supreme Court denied Maxwell's final appeal on October 6.
    *   **P(E2 | H):** This event increases Maxwell's incentive to cooperate in exchange for a potential sentence reduction or improved prison conditions. It makes her testimony (H) more plausible than it was before the ruling.
    *   **P(E2 | ~H):** Maxwell could still choose not to cooperate, fearing for her safety or facing new legal jeopardy. Her appeal being denied doesn't guarantee cooperation.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** > 1. This evidence moderately increases the probability, as it provides a clear motive for Maxwell to negotiate.

*   **Evidence (E3):** On Nov 21, Chairman Comer publicly demanded depositions from the Clintons for Dec 17-18.
    *   **P(E3 | H):** If the committee's top priority was securing Maxwell's testimony in December, it is unlikely they would be focusing their limited time and public attention on scheduling another major deposition in the same narrow window.
    *   **P(E3 | ~H):** If the Maxwell hearing is not a priority for the remainder of the session, it makes perfect sense for the committee to focus on other targets like the Clintons.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio:** < 1. This evidence moderately decreases the probability, as it indicates the committee's bandwidth is allocated elsewhere.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's walk through the update from the **10% prior (1:9 odds)**.

1.  The strongest evidence is the **four months of inaction (E1)**. This is a powerful signal that the initial momentum has stalled. An LR of 1/10 seems conservative.
    *   *Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × LR* = (1/9) × (1/10) = 1/90.
    *   This drops the probability to ~1.1%.

2.  Next, we account for the **SCOTUS denial (E2)**, which provides Maxwell a motive to cooperate. This pushes the probability back up. Let's use an LR of 2.
    *   *Posterior Odds* = (1/90) × 2 = 2/90 = 1/45.
    *   This raises the probability to ~2.2%.

3.  Finally, the committee's **focus on the Clintons (E3)** suggests Maxwell is not the immediate priority. Let's apply a negative LR of 1/2.
    *   *Posterior Odds* = (1/45) × (1/2) = 1/90.
    *   This brings the probability back down to ~1.1%.

The formal update suggests a probability around 1%. The core of the argument is that the logistical and bureaucratic barriers, combined with the extremely short holiday-season timeline, are nearly insurmountable.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The primary argument for a higher probability is the "secret deal" scenario: that the months of silence were spent in back-channel negotiations, and now that Maxwell's appeal is denied, a pre-arranged plan for testimony will be executed swiftly. This would require an unprecedented level of efficiency and cooperation between Congress, the DOJ, and the BOP. While this is a possible "tail risk" scenario, it is highly improbable compared to the more straightforward explanation that the committee has moved on to more achievable goals for the end of the session.

Another risk is misinterpreting the resolution criteria. The question requires a public "hearing," not a private "deposition." The committee's own language has focused on a deposition, making a public hearing even less likely. This reinforces a low probability.

The overwhelming factor remains the calendar. It is extremely difficult to imagine all the necessary legal and logistical steps being completed in the next five weeks. My estimate of ~1-2% feels robust. I will select a final value in this range.

### Final Forecast
The confluence of an extremely short timeline, major holidays, and immense logistical and legal hurdles makes it highly improbable that Ghislaine Maxwell will testify in a public congressional hearing before 2026. While the political will existed in July, the lack of any public action since then, combined with the committee's new focus on other witnesses, strongly suggests this is no longer a priority for the current congressional session. The small remaining probability accounts for a slim chance of a surprise, rapidly executed deal.

Final: 2%
