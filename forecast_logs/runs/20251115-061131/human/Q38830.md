### Reference class & base rates
-   **Major CDC Public Health Reports:** The primary reference class is the publication cycle and data trends within major, periodic CDC reports (e.g., the AR Threats Report, reports on smoking-attributable mortality). These reports are typically released every 4-7 years. The rate of change in the core metric (AMR deaths) was an ~8% annualized increase between the 2013 and 2019 reports. A base rate of a metric doubling in a single reporting cycle (~6 years) is very low, perhaps <5%, absent a paradigm-shifting event.
-   **Growth of Complex Public Health Crises:** A broader class is the trajectory of slowly evolving, complex public health threats like obesity or the opioid crisis. These crises typically show steady, compounding growth rather than sudden doublings in mortality over a few years. The base rate for such a crisis doubling its annual death toll in a 5-7 year window in a high-income country is low, likely in the 10-20% range, as interventions and awareness campaigns often temper the growth rate.
-   **Limitations:** The primary limitation is the infrequency of the key CDC report, with only two major data points (2013, 2019), making trend extrapolation highly uncertain. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant shock to the system, potentially breaking the historical trend.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   **2024-07-16** A report from *Contagion Live* stated the CDC would release updated estimates for AR threats in 2025, following a noted 20% increase in infections during the pandemic. (↑) — This confirms a report is planned for *sometime* in 2025, keeping the possibility of resolution alive.
-   **2025-01-31** The CDC updated its "About Antimicrobial Resistance" page, reiterating the 2019 report's figures of over 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually. (↓) — The continued use of 2019 data well into 2025 suggests no new official, superseding data has been finalized or released.
-   **2025-11-15** As of today, with ~6 weeks left in the year, the CDC has not released a new comprehensive AR Threats Report. (↓↓) — The window for a major government report to be prepared, cleared, and published before year-end is extremely small, especially considering the holiday season. This is the strongest piece of evidence.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Post-COVID-19 Healthcare Strain (Large ↑):** The pandemic led to overwhelmed hospitals, disruptions in infection control protocols, and increased antibiotic use for secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. This is confirmed to have increased AMR *infections* and will almost certainly increase reported deaths.
-   **CDC Reporting Lag & Methodology (Large ↑/↓):** The single largest driver for this question is the CDC's publication schedule. A report released before the deadline is a prerequisite. A change in methodology (e.g., including deaths "associated with" AMR rather than just "directly attributable to" it) could dramatically increase the final number.
-   **Underlying AMR Trend (Moderate ↑):** The slow, steady increase in resistance due to antibiotic overuse in medicine and agriculture continues. This provides a consistently upward pressure on the true number of deaths, independent of acute shocks.
-   **Antibiotic Stewardship & Infection Control (Moderate ↓):** Efforts to improve antibiotic prescribing and hospital hygiene are ongoing. While disrupted by COVID-19, these programs exert downward pressure on the growth rate of AMR infections and deaths.
-   **New Drug Pipeline (Small ↓):** The pipeline for new antibiotics is notoriously slow and economically challenging. While some new drugs may have come to market, their impact on national-level mortality statistics by 2025 is likely minimal.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Extreme Time Constraint:** The most significant difference is the resolution horizon. With only ~6 weeks remaining in 2025, the question is less about the epidemiological reality and more about the bureaucratic/logistical probability of a major report being published.
-   **The COVID-19 Shock:** Unlike the steady state assumed in the base rate, the 2020-2022 period was a massive external shock that significantly worsened the AMR problem, providing a plausible (though likely insufficient) mechanism for an accelerated death rate.
-   **High, Specific Threshold:** The question requires a doubling to a specific number (70,000), not just a significant increase. This makes it more brittle than a general "will AMR deaths increase?" forecast. The jump from the last official figure (~36,000) is substantial.
-   **Ambiguity of "Credible Source":** While the CDC is the most likely source, the resolution criteria allow for "another credible source." This introduces a small possibility of a major academic study (e.g., in *The Lancet*) or another government body publishing a qualifying report, though this is unlikely to occur without prior signals.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** A reasonable prior, based on the historical trend and the high threshold, might be around 15% (equivalent n≈10), acknowledging the upward pressure from AMR trends but tempered by the large jump required.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↑ small) The confirmed pandemic-era surge in AMR infections makes a significant jump in deaths plausible, though likely not to the 70,000 threshold (a 20% increase on ~36k is ~43k).
    -   (↓ large) The lack of any pre-release announcements or media chatter from the CDC about an imminent, landmark report on AMR. Major reports are usually socialized in advance.
    -   (↓↓ very large) The extremely short time remaining in 2025 makes the logistics of publishing a major, vetted federal report highly improbable. Government and academic publishing cycles are slow and wind down in December.
-   **Net effect:** A strong downward update. The evidence, particularly the severe time constraint, overwhelmingly suggests the necessary report will not be published before the deadline. The posterior should be very low.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A CDC press release or media advisory announcing the imminent publication of the 2025 AR Threats Report.
    -   A pre-print or "in-press" listing of a major US-focused AMR mortality study in a top-tier journal.
    -   Leaked data or a statement from a high-level public health official referencing a number at or near 70,000 annual deaths.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The calendar turning to December 2025 with no announcement.
    -   A CDC announcement that the next AR Threats Report is scheduled for release in 2026.
    -   Publication of smaller, related CDC reports (e.g., on specific pathogens) that use the 2019 top-line numbers as their context.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Definitional Gotcha - "Credible Source":** A non-CDC entity could publish a report with a novel methodology that produces a high number. The credibility would be debated, but it could trigger resolution.
-   **Definitional Gotcha - "Annually":** The report must state that at least 70,000 people die "annually." This implies a stable or recent-year estimate, not a one-off peak during the worst of the pandemic.
-   **Data Lag vs. Reporting Date:** The report will be based on past data (likely 2022 or 2023). The key is the *publication date* of the report, not the year the deaths occurred.
-   **"Report" vs. "Data Update":** A simple update to a data table on the CDC website might not be considered a "report" in the spirit of the question, which seems to imply a comprehensive publication like the 2013 and 2019 Threats Reports.
-   **Possibility of a Surprise Release:** While highly unlikely, a government agency could rush a report for political or public health reasons, defying normal publication schedules.

**Final Research Summary:**
The resolution requires a credible source to publish a report before Dec 31, 2025, stating annual US AMR deaths have reached 70,000. This is highly improbable due to the combination of an extremely tight time window and the unlikelihood that the true number, even after a post-COVID surge, has doubled from the last official estimate of ~36,000.

To forecast the probability of the event that at least 70,000 people die annually from antibiotic-resistant infections in the US by December 31, 2025, we will follow the Bayesian reasoning steps outlined.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
- **Base Rate:** The base rate for a major public health metric doubling in a short time frame (6 years) is low. Historical data from CDC reports show an 8% annualized increase in AMR deaths between 2013 and 2019. The base rate for a doubling in such a period is likely less than 5%, absent a paradigm-shifting event.
- **Initial Prior:** Given the historical trends and the significant increase required, a reasonable prior probability might be around 15%, acknowledging the upward pressure from AMR trends but tempered by the large jump required.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
- **Similarities:** The current situation involves a slowly evolving public health threat, similar to past trends in AMR deaths.
- **Differences:** The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant shock, potentially accelerating AMR deaths. However, the requirement for a report to be published by the end of 2025 introduces a logistical constraint not present in the base case.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
- **Pandemic Surge in Infections (↑ small):** The pandemic led to increased AMR infections, making a significant jump in deaths plausible, though likely not to the 70,000 threshold.
- **Lack of Pre-release Announcements (↓ large):** The absence of announcements or media chatter about an imminent CDC report suggests a low likelihood of a report being published soon.
- **Short Time Remaining in 2025 (↓↓ very large):** With only ~6 weeks left in the year, the logistics of publishing a major report are highly improbable.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
- **Prior Odds:** 15% probability translates to odds of 0.176 (15/85).
- **Likelihood Ratio:** Given the strong evidence against a report being published, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards the event not occurring.
- **Posterior Odds:** Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = 0.176 × (very low likelihood of report) = very low posterior odds.
- **Posterior Probability:** The posterior probability is very low, reflecting the overwhelming evidence against the event occurring.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
- **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a surprise release or a non-CDC entity publishing a report. However, these scenarios remain unlikely given the lack of signals.
- **Alternative Forecast:** A plausible alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher probability if there were any indications of an imminent report, but current evidence strongly suggests otherwise.

### 6. Final Forecast
- **Final Probability:** Considering the base rate, evidence, and Bayesian update, the probability of the event occurring is extremely low.

Final: 1%

# Will the number of deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections per year double by December 31, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability for whether the CDC or another credible source will report that at least 70,000 people die annually from antibiotic-resistant infections in the US by December 31, 2025.

The most recent CDC figure cited is approximately 35,000-37,000 deaths per year (from their 2019 report). The question asks whether this will double to at least 70,000 by the end of 2025.

**Base rate considerations:**
- Historical growth rate: Between the 2013 report (~23,000 deaths) and the 2019 report (~35,000-37,000 deaths), there was approximately a 60% increase over 6 years, or roughly 8% annual growth.
- CDC reporting frequency: Major CDC reports on antibiotic resistance appear to be published every 4-7 years (2013, 2019).
- Time remaining: As of today (November 15, 2025), there are only about 6 weeks left in the year.

Given these factors, I'll set a prior of **5%**. This reflects:
1. The historical growth rate would need to accelerate dramatically to reach a doubling
2. The extremely short timeframe remaining for a new report to be published
3. The general rarity of public health metrics doubling in such a short period

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The underlying problem of antibiotic resistance continues to worsen gradually
- The CDC remains the primary authority for tracking and reporting these statistics
- The healthcare system continues to implement antibiotic stewardship programs

**Key differences:**
- COVID-19 pandemic: This represents a major shock to the system that wasn't present in the base rate period. The pandemic likely increased antibiotic usage and hospital-acquired infections.
- Time constraint: With only 6 weeks left in 2025, the probability hinges almost entirely on whether a report will be published in this short window, not just whether the true number has doubled.
- Reporting cycle: Based on the 2013 and 2019 reports, we might expect the next major report around 2025-2026, but there's no guarantee it will be released before December 31, 2025.

These differences suggest both upward pressure (COVID-19 impact) and strong downward pressure (time constraint) on the probability.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: CDC plans to release updated estimates in 2025**
- P(E|H): If deaths have doubled, it's highly likely (90%) the CDC would plan to release this information in 2025
- P(E|~H): Even if deaths haven't doubled, the CDC would still likely (70%) plan a regular update in 2025 based on their reporting cycle
- Likelihood ratio: 90%/70% = 1.29
- This evidence slightly increases the probability

**Evidence 2: CDC still using 2019 figures in January 2025**
- P(E|H): If deaths had doubled, it's unlikely (20%) the CDC would still be using old figures without at least mentioning a significant increase
- P(E|~H): If deaths haven't doubled dramatically, it's very likely (90%) they would continue using the most recent official figures
- Likelihood ratio: 20%/90% = 0.22
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: No new comprehensive report as of November 15, 2025**
- P(E|H): If deaths had doubled, it's very unlikely (10%) that the CDC would not have released or at least announced an imminent report by mid-November
- P(E|~H): If deaths haven't doubled, it's quite likely (80%) that no report would be released by this time
- Likelihood ratio: 10%/80% = 0.125
- This evidence very strongly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19):

**Update based on Evidence 3 (most significant):**
- Prior odds: 0.05/0.95 = 0.0526
- Likelihood ratio: 0.125
- Posterior odds: 0.0526 × 0.125 = 0.00658
- Posterior probability: 0.00658/(1+0.00658) = 0.0065 or about 0.65%

This extremely low probability reflects the reality that with only 6 weeks left in the year, it's highly unlikely that a major CDC report would be published without prior announcement. Government reports typically have long lead times for preparation, review, and publication.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I might be underestimating the possibility of a non-CDC "credible source" publishing a report with a higher death count
- The COVID-19 impact on antibiotic resistance could be more severe than I've accounted for
- There could be a methodological change in how deaths are counted that would suddenly increase the number

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major academic journal could publish a study with a higher estimate in the next few weeks
- The CDC could have a report ready but embargoed until a specific date in December
- A different government agency (NIH, FDA) could release relevant data

Even considering these possibilities, the time constraint remains the dominant factor. The probability of a major report being published in the next 6 weeks, especially during the holiday season, is extremely low.

## 6. Final Forecast

Given the extremely short timeframe remaining in 2025, the lack of signals about an imminent report, and the historical growth rate of antibiotic-resistant deaths, I assess there is a very low probability that a credible source will report at least 70,000 annual deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections by December 31, 2025.

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the publication of a report by a credible source before December 31, 2025, stating that annual deaths from antibiotic-resistant (AR) infections in the US are at least 70,000.

The primary reference class is the publication cycle of the CDC's comprehensive "Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report." These were released in 2013 and 2019, establishing a 6-year cycle. This cycle would suggest a new report is due around 2025.

The second consideration is the magnitude of the change required. The 2013 report cited 23,000 deaths, and the 2019 report cited over 35,000. This represents a ~52% increase over six years. The question requires a 100% increase (doubling) from ~35,000 to 70,000 in the subsequent six-year period (2019-2025). While the underlying trend is upward, and the COVID-19 pandemic likely accelerated it, a doubling is a very high bar.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prior probability at the beginning of 2025 would be low. The likelihood of a report in the correct year is high, but the likelihood of it containing such a dramatic increase is low. A prior of **15%** seems appropriate, acknowledging the possibility while respecting the high threshold. This corresponds to prior odds of approximately 1 to 5.7.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs from the base case in two critical ways:
1.  **The COVID-19 Shock:** The pandemic (2020-2022) dramatically increased hospitalizations, disrupted infection control, and led to widespread antibiotic use. This provides a strong mechanistic reason for an accelerated increase in AR deaths, making the 70,000 figure more plausible than a simple trend extrapolation would suggest.
2.  **Extreme Time Constraint:** The most significant factor is that the forecast is being made on November 15, 2025, with only six weeks remaining until the deadline. The base rate for a major, vetted government report being prepared, cleared, and published within such a short, holiday-filled window is exceptionally low. This factor now dominates the forecast.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
The most crucial piece of evidence is the current date and the corresponding lack of any announcement.

*   **Evidence (E):** As of November 15, 2025, no new AR Threats Report has been published or announced by the CDC or any other major public health body.
*   **Likelihood if the event happens (P(E | H)):** If a report stating >=70,000 deaths were to be published by December 31, 2025 (H), it is extremely unlikely that there would be no public announcement, press briefing schedule, or media pre-socialization by mid-November. Government and major academic publishing cycles are slow and deliberate. A surprise release of a landmark report in late December is highly improbable. Let's generously estimate the probability of this scenario as 5%, or P(E | H) = 0.05.
*   **Likelihood if the event does not happen (P(E | ~H)):** If no such report is published by the deadline (~H), it is certain that no report would have been published by November 15. Therefore, P(E | ~H) = 1.
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** The likelihood ratio is P(E | H) / P(E | ~H) = 0.05 / 1 = 0.05. This is a very strong piece of evidence that massively decreases the probability of the event occurring.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
We can update our initial assessment using the powerful evidence of the time constraint.

*   **Prior Odds:** 0.15 / (1 - 0.15) = 0.176 (or ~1 to 5.7)
*   **Likelihood Ratio:** 0.05
*   **Posterior Odds:** Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio = 0.176 × 0.05 = 0.0088
*   **Posterior Probability:** Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) = 0.0088 / 1.0088 ≈ 0.0087 or **0.9%**.

This calculation shows that the time constraint alone reduces the probability to less than 1%.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider scenarios where my forecast could be wrong.
*   **Alternative Scenario 1: The "Other Credible Source" Clause.** The question is not limited to the CDC. A major academic study (e.g., from IHME, published in *The Lancet*) could be released on short notice (e.g., as a pre-print). This is the most plausible path to a "Yes" resolution, as it bypasses the CDC's bureaucratic timeline. However, a finding of this magnitude would likely have been presented at conferences or otherwise signaled to the research community, and no such signals are noted.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: A Rushed, Emergency Release.** A sudden public health emergency (e.g., a novel, highly resistant pathogen) could prompt the CDC to rush the report to justify emergency funding or action, overriding normal schedules. This is a tail risk.
*   **Alternative Scenario 3: The number is real and high.** If the true number of deaths is indeed at or above 70,000, the pressure to release the data could be immense, potentially accelerating publication. However, a public health failure of that magnitude would likely have produced many other observable signals by now.

These alternative scenarios are plausible but have low probabilities. They prevent the forecast from being 0%, but they don't significantly raise it from the very low baseline established by the time constraint. The lack of any pre-release chatter remains the strongest counter-evidence to all these scenarios. I will adjust my posterior slightly upward from 0.9% to account for these tail risks. A 2% forecast seems appropriate, acknowledging that while the default path is almost closed, a surprise is not impossible.

### Final Forecast
The probability of this event occurring is extremely low. The primary barrier is the very short time remaining until the December 31, 2025 deadline. The normal publication cycle for a major government report like the one required makes a release in the next six weeks highly improbable. While the underlying number of deaths has likely increased since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a doubling to 70,000 is a high threshold. The combination of a near-impossible timeline and a high substantive bar for the data makes a "Yes" resolution a remote possibility, dependent on a surprise academic publication or an emergency release.
