### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Rapidly Adopted Tech/Social Legislation:** This class includes issues with high public salience and clear harms, like data breach notification laws or "revenge porn" laws. These typically see a rapid S-curve of adoption, with 15-25 states passing laws within the first 2-3 years of the issue gaining prominence. Deepfake regulation, with its links to election integrity and non-consensual pornography, fits this pattern well. The base rate suggests a large wave of adoptions in 2024-2025.
2.  **State-Level Responses to Federal Inaction:** This class covers areas where states act as policy laboratories due to a gridlocked or slow-moving Congress (e.g., cannabis legalization, data privacy). The rate of adoption is often steady but varies by political alignment. A base rate might be 5-10 states per year during the peak adoption phase.
3.  **Limitations:** The speed of AI development and the unique, visceral nature of deepfake threats may accelerate legislative action beyond historical precedent. The 2024 election cycle likely acted as a significant, non-repeating catalyst, potentially front-loading adoptions into the 2024 legislative session.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
Given the resolution date of Jan 1, 2026, and the current date of Nov 28, 2025, the most critical recent development is the conclusion of the 2025 legislative sessions.
*   **2025-11-20** State lawmakers gear up for AI regulation battles in ‘26 (Pluribus News) — (→) Matters because it signals the legislative focus has shifted entirely to the *next* session, which begins after this question resolves. This strongly implies the 2025 legislative season is over and the number of states is now fixed.
*   **2025-10-01** (Implied) Adjournment of most state legislative sessions — (↓) The primary mechanism for passing new laws has ceased for the year in nearly all states. Only a highly unusual special session could change the count, which is extremely unlikely for this topic.
*   **2025-03-19** Colorado AI Act highlighted as a model for future state laws — (↑) While this event is from earlier in the year, it demonstrates the continued momentum and template-driven approach states were taking, which fueled the high number of adoptions seen throughout 2025.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
1.  **Legislative Calendar (Large):** This is the dominant mechanism. As of late November 2025, virtually all state legislatures have adjourned for the year. Without a legislative session, no new bills can be passed. This effectively freezes the number of states.
2.  **High-Profile Events (Moderate):** A major deepfake scandal (e.g., a significant political event or celebrity exploitation) could create immense pressure for a special session, but this is a very high bar and thus a low-probability driver at this stage.
3.  **Bipartisan Consensus (Moderate):** The issue has strong bipartisan appeal, framed around either election integrity (a GOP focus) or protecting individuals from harassment/exploitation (a Democratic focus). This has accelerated passage in many states and reduces partisan gridlock as a barrier.
4.  **Federal Inaction (Moderate):** The absence of a comprehensive federal deepfake law creates a policy vacuum that states are actively filling. The Pluribus News source notes the federal government *aims* to preempt state rules, which can sometimes spur states to act faster to set their own terms.
5.  **Resolution Source Lag/Correction (Small):** The final count depends on the MultiState tracker. A delay in updating the site for a law passed months ago, or a re-classification of an existing law, could change the final number without any new legislative action.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Proximity to Deadline:** The question resolves in under 5 weeks. Unlike a typical forecast made mid-year, we are at the absolute end of the legislative calendar, making the "rate of adoption" nearly irrelevant from this point forward.
*   **Extreme Salience:** The 2024 U.S. Presidential election cycle made deepfakes a top-tier, urgent political issue, likely compressing the adoption timeline compared to reference classes like data privacy which had a slower burn.
*   **Technological Acceleration:** The underlying technology is advancing at a pace far exceeding previous legislative challenges, creating sustained urgency among lawmakers to avoid falling further behind.
*   **Clear Resolution Source:** The question is tied to a specific public tracker (MultiState). This reduces ambiguity about what "counts" as a deepfake law, focusing the problem on tracking that source rather than debating legal definitions.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** A forecaster in mid-2025, observing the high legislative activity, might have set a prior based on the "Rapid Adoption" reference class, perhaps centered around 28 states, with moderate uncertainty (equivalent n=15) allowing for a few more or less by year-end.
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓ Large) The adjournment of nearly all state legislatures for 2025 is dispositive evidence that the opportunity for new laws to pass has closed. This should drastically reduce the variance in the forecast.
    *   (→ Small) News reports confirming the legislative focus has shifted to 2026 reinforces that the 2025 count is final.
    *   (↑/↓ Small) The primary remaining uncertainty is potential lag or re-classification by the official resolution source, MultiState. This suggests a small amount of residual variance around the currently reported number.
*   **Net effect:** The posterior should collapse onto the current, verifiable number of states listed by the resolution source. The mean of the distribution should be updated to this number, and the variance should become very small. The update is less about changing the central tendency and more about becoming extremely confident in it.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators:**
    *   A governor in a key state calls a surprise special session that includes AI/deepfake regulation on the agenda.
    *   The MultiState tracker updates to include a state whose bill was passed months ago but was not yet cataloged.
    *   A re-interpretation of an existing, broader AI law by the resolution source to now count as "regulating deepfakes."

*   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The MultiState tracker removes a state from its list, perhaps due to a re-evaluation or a court injunction against the law.
    *   Discovery of a "sunset" provision in a previously passed law that causes it to expire before Jan 1, 2026.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Definition of "Regulating Deepfakes":** The resolution hinges entirely on MultiState's classification. A law might tangentially mention "synthetic media" but not be deemed a "deepfake regulation," or vice-versa. The forecaster is outsourced to their judgment.
*   **Data Lag at the Source:** The MultiState tracker is the single point of failure. Its update frequency is unknown. A law could have been signed in October, but the site may not reflect it until December, causing a late shift.
*   **The "Special Session" Black Swan:** While exceedingly rare for this type of issue, a major national deepfake crisis could theoretically trigger an emergency legislative session in one or more states, breaking the "calendar is king" assumption.
*   **Effective Date vs. Passage Date:** The question resolves on laws "passed" before 2026. A law could be passed in 2025 with a 2026 or later effective date; this should still count, but could cause confusion.

### Final Research Summary
The 2025 state legislative year is effectively over, meaning the number of states with deepfake laws is highly unlikely to change. The forecast should center tightly on the current count provided by the MultiState tracker, with minimal variance for potential data lags or re-classifications by that source.

To forecast the number of US states that will pass legislation regulating deepfakes before 2026, we will follow the structured approach outlined:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** The "Rapidly Adopted Tech/Social Legislation" class is appropriate here. Historically, issues with high public salience and clear harms, such as data breach notification laws, see rapid adoption. The base rate suggests 15-25 states within the first 2-3 years. As of March 2024, 15 states had already passed such laws.
   - **Mean/Median and Variance:** Assuming a mean of 20 states with a variance reflecting moderate uncertainty (e.g., standard deviation of 5 states).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The rapid adoption pattern fits well, given the urgency and bipartisan support for deepfake regulation.
   - **Differences:** The 2024 election cycle likely accelerated adoption, potentially front-loading legislative action into 2024-2025.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Adjournment of State Legislatures (↓ Large):** Most state legislatures have adjourned, making new laws unlikely.
   - **Shift to 2026 Focus (→ Small):** Confirms that 2025's legislative activity is concluded.
   - **Potential Data Lag (↑/↓ Small):** Some uncertainty remains due to potential delays in the MultiState tracker updates.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - **Prior:** Centered around 20 states with moderate uncertainty.
   - **Update:** The adjournment of legislatures significantly reduces variance, collapsing the distribution around the current count from the MultiState tracker.
   - **Posterior Mean and Variance:** The mean aligns with the current count, and variance is minimal due to the near-finality of the legislative calendar.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a special session or data lag, though both are unlikely.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** A major deepfake scandal could theoretically prompt emergency sessions, but this is a low-probability event.
   - **Adjustment:** Ensure the forecast accounts for small residual uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Given the near-finality of the legislative calendar and reliance on the MultiState tracker, the forecast should reflect high confidence in the current count with minimal variance.

# Forecasting US States Passing Deepfake Legislation Before 2026

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use a combination of reference classes to establish a prior:

- **Rapidly Adopted Tech/Social Legislation**: Issues like data breach notification laws or "revenge porn" laws typically see 15-25 states passing laws within 2-3 years of gaining prominence.
- **State-Level Responses to Federal Inaction**: Areas where states act due to Congressional gridlock (e.g., cannabis legalization, data privacy) see adoption rates of 5-10 states per year during peak phases.

Given that the background states "As of March 2024, at least 15 US states have passed laws concerning deepfakes," and considering the high salience of this issue, I'll use a prior centered around 30 states (15 existing + expected additional adoptions through 2025), with a moderate variance reflecting uncertainty in adoption rates.

Prior distribution: Mean = 30 states, with a standard deviation of approximately 5 states.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference classes**:
- Deepfakes present clear harms (election integrity, non-consensual imagery) that motivate legislative action
- Federal inaction creates a policy vacuum for states to fill
- Bipartisan appeal (Republicans focus on election integrity, Democrats on protecting individuals)

**Key differences**:
- The question is being answered in late November 2025, with only about a month before resolution
- State legislative sessions for 2025 have almost certainly concluded
- The 2024 election cycle likely accelerated adoption beyond typical rates
- AI technology is advancing faster than previous tech issues, creating greater urgency

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence pointing to higher numbers**:
- Starting point of 15 states in March 2024 provides a strong foundation
- High public salience and bipartisan appeal suggests rapid adoption
- The 2024 election cycle created significant pressure for legislation
- Colorado AI Act serving as a model law facilitates faster adoption by other states

**Evidence pointing to lower numbers or stabilization**:
- Most critical: As of November 28, 2025, state legislative sessions for 2025 have concluded
- News reports indicate lawmakers are now focused on 2026 legislative sessions
- The question resolves in just over a month, leaving minimal time for additional adoptions

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of approximately 30 states (mean) with SD of 5:

The strongest evidence is that state legislative sessions for 2025 have concluded, and lawmakers are focusing on 2026 legislation. This effectively freezes the count at whatever it currently is according to the MultiState tracker.

This evidence drastically reduces uncertainty rather than shifting the mean. The likelihood ratio strongly favors the current count being final, collapsing the distribution around the current number.

If we assume the current count is 32 states (a reasonable estimate given the starting point and adoption patterns), the posterior distribution would have:
- Mean: 32 states
- Standard deviation: reduced to approximately 1 state (reflecting only uncertainty about potential data lags or reclassifications)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I don't have access to the actual current count from MultiState's tracker
- Special legislative sessions could theoretically be called before January 2026
- The MultiState tracker might have data lags or reclassify certain laws
- Court challenges could invalidate some existing laws before resolution

**Alternative scenarios**:
- A major deepfake scandal could trigger emergency sessions in 1-2 states
- MultiState could update their tracker to include previously passed laws
- MultiState could remove states from their list due to reclassification

Given these considerations, I should maintain a small amount of uncertainty around the current count, but the distribution should be much tighter than my prior.

## 6. Final Percentiles

Given the evidence that legislative sessions have concluded and the question resolves in just over a month, I'll center my distribution around 32 states (a reasonable estimate given the starting point and adoption patterns) with a narrow spread to account for potential tracker updates or special sessions.

P10: 31
P20: 31
P40: 32
P60: 32
P80: 33
P90: 33

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The most critical piece of information for this forecast is the date: November 28, 2025. The question resolves in just over one month, on January 1, 2026. Therefore, a base rate based on multi-year legislative adoption curves is inappropriate.

The correct base rate is the state of legislative affairs at the end of a calendar year. For almost all US states, legislative sessions conclude by the fall. It is exceptionally rare for new, non-emergency legislation to be passed in December. Therefore, my prior distribution is that the number of states with deepfake laws will not change from its current value.

The central challenge is determining the current value. The background states "at least 15" as of March 2024. Given the high salience of the issue through the 2024 election and 2025 legislative sessions, this number has certainly increased. The Metaculus community median is 33, which serves as a good proxy for the current publicly known number on the resolution source (MultiState's tracker).

My prior is therefore a very tight distribution centered on **33**, with small variance reflecting only the uncertainty in the exact current count on the specified tracker.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation is highly similar to the base case of "end-of-year legislative stasis." The primary mechanism for changing the number—active state legislatures—is dormant.

The main difference from a forecast made earlier in the year is this extreme proximity to the deadline. This difference is paramount, as it shifts the source of uncertainty away from legislative outcomes and towards data integrity (i.e., how accurately and quickly the resolution source reflects the reality of laws passed months ago).

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
1.  **Legislative Calendars (Extremely strong evidence for stasis):** As of late November, nearly all state legislatures have adjourned for 2025. This provides overwhelming evidence that no *new* laws will be passed. This strongly supports a posterior distribution with very low variance.
2.  **Pluribus News Report (Nov 20, 2025) (Strong evidence for stasis):** The report that "lawmakers gear up for AI regulation battles in ‘26" explicitly confirms that the legislative focus has shifted to the next year. This corroborates the legislative calendar evidence, making the current count very likely to be the final count.
3.  **Resolution Source Specificity (Evidence for minor variance):** The question resolves to a specific tracker (MultiState). This introduces two small, opposing sources of uncertainty:
    *   **Data Lag (Slight upward pressure):** The tracker might be lagging in adding a state that passed a law in, for example, October 2025. This makes a value of 34 slightly more likely than a value of 32.
    *   **Re-classification (Symmetric, low-probability pressure):** The source could conduct a year-end review and change its criteria, adding or removing a state. This is a small risk that could push the number up or down, likely by one.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
*   **Prior:** A sharp distribution centered at N=33. Let's model it as P(33) ≈ 90%, with small probabilities for 32 or 34.
*   **Likelihoods:** The evidence from legislative calendars and news reports is highly consistent with the number remaining static. The evidence of a specific tracker introduces a small probability of a +/- 1 change due to data artifacts.
*   **Update Step:**
    *   Start with the prior belief that there's a 90% chance the number is 33.
    *   The evidence of data lag makes an outcome of N=34 more plausible. Let's assign a ~10-15% chance that the tracker will be updated to add one more state.
    *   The evidence of re-classification suggests a small chance of the number decreasing. Let's assign a ~5-10% chance that a state is removed from the list.
    *   This leads to a posterior distribution heavily concentrated on 33, but with a slightly longer tail on the high side.
*   **Posterior Shape:** My final posterior is a discrete probability distribution:
    *   P(N=32): ~10% (chance of a downward re-classification)
    *   P(N=33): ~75% (most likely outcome, no change)
    *   P(N=34): ~14% (chance of an upward correction due to data lag)
    *   P(N=35): ~1% (chance of two upward corrections or a black swan event like a special session)

The posterior median is 33, the mean is slightly higher at ~32.95, and the variance is very small.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast is highly confident and rests on two assumptions: 1) The legislative process is indeed over for the year, and 2) the MultiState tracker is reasonably accurate and stable.

*   **Alternative Scenario 1: "Special Session" Black Swan.** A major deepfake scandal in December forces a governor to call an emergency session, and a bill is passed. The probability of this happening *and* a law passing in the next 33 days is exceedingly low, but not zero. I have accounted for this with a tiny probability mass at N=35.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2: "Tracker Overhaul".** The MultiState source could perform a major year-end data review and significantly alter its classification criteria, causing a shift of more than +/-1. This is a key risk to the forecast's narrowness. However, professional tracking services value consistency, making a sudden large change unlikely.
*   **Best Alternative Forecast:** A forecaster more skeptical of the data source's stability might propose a wider distribution, perhaps P10=31 and P90=35. My rebuttal is that the evidence points to data lag of one, maybe two, states as the most likely "error," not a fundamental methodological shift. My current distribution, with P10=32 and P90=34, appropriately captures the primary sources of uncertainty without being needlessly broad.

I will stick with my distribution, as it correctly identifies the dominant factor (legislative calendars) while accounting for the main residual uncertainty (data source artifacts).
