### Reference class & base rates
1.  **Modern US Federal Government Shutdowns (1980-Present):** This class includes 10 shutdowns prior to the current one.
    *   **Base Rate:** 1 out of 10 (10%) of these shutdowns lasted 35 days or longer. The current shutdown has already reached this 35-day mark. The question is whether it will end in the next 16 days (i.e., have a total duration of 35-51 days). The single instance in this class (2018-19) ended on day 35, which would imply a high probability of ending immediately.
    *   **Reasoning:** This class captures the general phenomenon of shutdowns in the modern budgetary era.
    *   **Limitations:** The sample size is small (N=10), and political conditions (polarization, media environment) have changed significantly over this period. The data is sparse for long-duration events.

2.  **Shutdowns Lasting Longer Than Two Weeks (14+ days):** This class filters for shutdowns that overcame initial inertia and became prolonged political battles. It includes the 1995-96 (21 days), 2013 (16 days), and 2018-19 (35 days) events.
    *   **Base Rate:** Given a shutdown has already lasted 14 days, the probability of it ending before day 52 is 100% (3/3). The median duration of these long shutdowns is 21 days.
    *   **Reasoning:** This reference class is more relevant as it focuses on protracted disputes rather than brief, multi-day lapses in funding. It reflects situations where political intransigence is high.
    *   **Limitations:** The sample size is extremely small (N=3), making the base rate highly uncertain and sensitive to single events.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
*   **2025-11-07 (projected):** Second missed paycheck for most federal workers. (↑) — Increases financial hardship and public pressure on political leaders to find a resolution.
*   **2025-11-04 (today):** Shutdown reaches 35-day mark. (↑) — Ties the record for the longest shutdown in US history, creating a symbolic milestone that increases media scrutiny and pressure for a resolution.
*   **2025-10-24:** First missed paycheck for most federal workers. (↑) — The first tangible, widespread financial impact on the federal workforce, initiating a key pressure-building mechanism.
*   **2025-10-08:** BPC report highlights administration may not honor back-pay guarantee. (↑/↓) — Dramatically raises stakes. Could increase worker pressure for a swift end (↑) or signal extreme administration resolve to prolong the shutdown (↓).
*   **2025-10-01:** Government shutdown begins. (N/A) — Initiating event.
*   **2025-03-14:** Lawfare article reports on OPM memo directing agencies to identify non-essential positions for potential RIFs. (↓) — Suggests the administration may have strategic goals beyond appropriations (e.g., workforce reduction), reducing its incentive to end the shutdown quickly.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
*   **Holiday Deadlines:** The proximity of the Thanksgiving congressional recess (traditionally starting the week of Thanksgiving, Nov 24-28 in 2025) is a powerful forcing function for legislative action. Members of Congress are highly motivated to return to their districts for the holiday. (Size: Large)
*   **Federal Worker Hardship:** As workers miss multiple paychecks, the accumulating financial distress generates media attention and direct pressure on lawmakers, particularly in districts with a large federal workforce. (Size: Moderate to Large)
*   **Public Opinion & Blame:** As the shutdown's negative effects (e.g., closed national parks, delayed services) become more widespread, public frustration grows. Polling will show one or both parties taking a hit, creating an incentive to compromise. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Economic Damage:** Each week of a shutdown subtracts from quarterly GDP growth and creates market uncertainty. While not immediately felt by the public, this pressure is significant for economic policymakers and business stakeholders. (Size: Moderate)
*   **Political Leverage & Resolve:** The core of the conflict. The party or faction that believes it can outlast the other is incentivized to prolong the shutdown to achieve its specific policy or funding goals. Evidence of unusual resolve (e.g., the RIF strategy) can counteract other pressures. (Size: Large)

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
*   **Strategic Goal of Workforce Reduction:** Unlike past shutdowns primarily focused on appropriations disputes (e.g., ACA funding in 2013, border wall in 2018-19), the OPM memo suggests this administration may be using the shutdown as a tool to facilitate "reductions in force" (RIFs). This gives the executive branch a unique and powerful incentive to prolong the shutdown.
*   **Uncertainty Over Back Pay:** The suggestion that the 2019 law guaranteeing back pay might not be honored is a significant departure from the last several shutdowns. This fundamentally changes the calculus for federal workers and could lead to unprecedented labor actions or political backlash, creating a highly volatile environment.
*   **Record-Tying Duration:** The shutdown has already reached 35 days, matching the all-time record. We are in historically uncharted territory from day 36 onward. Past models of resolution based on shorter durations may no longer apply, as the actors involved have already demonstrated extreme intransigence.
*   **Perfect Alignment with Thanksgiving Deadline:** The resolution date of Nov 21 falls on the Friday immediately preceding Thanksgiving week. This creates an exceptionally strong, psychologically potent deadline for a deal, arguably stronger than the deadlines in previous long shutdowns which occurred around the longer Christmas/New Year period.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
*   **Prior:** Start with the reference class of shutdowns lasting >2 weeks. This small sample (N=3) suggests long shutdowns are rare but have always ended before 52 days. A prior centered around 70-80% seems plausible, reflecting the historical pattern that even the most protracted shutdowns eventually end. (Equivalent n ≈ 3-4).
*   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↑ Large) The impending Thanksgiving holiday recess is a powerful, time-bound forcing function that strongly incentivizes a deal before Nov 21.
    *   (↑ Moderate) The shutdown has now tied the record length and workers have missed one, soon two, paychecks, significantly increasing public and media pressure.
    *   (↓ Large) Evidence that the administration is using the shutdown to achieve a secondary, strategic goal of workforce reduction suggests a much higher tolerance for a prolonged duration than in past events.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The threat to withhold back pay signals a hardball tactic that may indicate a willingness to break prior norms and extend the conflict.
*   **Net effect:** The evidence is conflicting. The administration's unusual resolve and potential strategic goals argue for a longer shutdown. However, the power of a major holiday deadline as a Schelling point for compromise is historically very strong. The Thanksgiving deadline is the most salient and time-critical factor, likely outweighing the administration's intransigence. The posterior should likely remain high, perhaps slightly reduced from the prior due to the signs of unusual executive branch resolve.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
*   **UP indicators (shutdown will end before Nov 21):**
    *   Reports of bipartisan "gangs" in the Senate or House working on a compromise funding bill.
    *   Softening rhetoric from House/Senate leadership or the White House, shifting focus from demands to the impact on federal workers.
    *   Announcement of a vote on a "clean" Continuing Resolution (CR) to reopen the government while negotiations continue.
    *   Key members of the President's party in competitive districts publicly calling for an end to the shutdown.
    *   Major negative economic news (e.g., jobs report, market downturn) explicitly blamed on the shutdown.

*   **DOWN indicators (shutdown will continue past Nov 21):**
    *   White House or congressional leaders doubling down on non-negotiable demands in public statements.
    *   Scheduling of congressional hearings on topics other than the shutdown for the week of Nov 17.
    *   The President or party leaders attacking members of their own party who call for compromise.
    *   Official statements from the administration confirming plans for RIFs connected to the shutdown.
    *   Congress passes a bill to fund only a single popular agency (e.g., Defense or Veterans Affairs), relieving pressure while leaving the rest of the government closed.

### Caveats & pitfalls
*   **Hypothetical Political Scenario:** The prompt is set in a hypothetical 2025, and we lack crucial details about the specific political actors (e.g., who is Speaker, who controls the Senate) and the precise nature of the funding dispute. These unknown variables are the largest source of uncertainty.
*   **Small-N Problem:** The reference class for long shutdowns is extremely small, making any base rate fragile and of limited predictive power.
*   **Black Swan Potential:** The threat of not providing back pay is a norm-breaking event. Its actual effect is unknown and could trigger unpredictable responses, such as widespread federal worker strikes, that would scramble all existing models.
*   **Resolution Definition:** The resolution requires OPM to list the status as "Open." A partial reopening or a last-minute deal late on Nov 20 that isn't reflected on the website until Nov 21 could cause ambiguity.

To forecast the probability of the US government shutdown ending before November 21, 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Base Rate:** We consider the reference class of shutdowns lasting longer than two weeks. Historically, all such shutdowns (3 out of 3) have ended before reaching 52 days. This suggests a high base rate for resolution before November 21, 2025, which is day 51 of the current shutdown. A reasonable prior probability might be around 80%, reflecting the historical tendency for even prolonged shutdowns to resolve before reaching this duration.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** The current shutdown has already reached 35 days, matching the longest in history, and is subject to similar pressures as past shutdowns, such as public and economic pressure.
   - **Differences:** Unique factors include the administration's potential strategic goal of workforce reduction and uncertainty over back pay, which could prolong the shutdown beyond historical norms.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Thanksgiving Deadline (↑):** The upcoming holiday recess is a strong incentive for resolution, as Congress typically aims to adjourn for Thanksgiving. This increases the likelihood of the shutdown ending before November 21.
   - **Public and Worker Pressure (↑):** With federal workers missing paychecks, pressure mounts on lawmakers to resolve the shutdown, increasing the likelihood of an earlier resolution.
   - **Strategic Workforce Reduction (↓):** The administration's potential goal of using the shutdown for workforce reduction suggests a willingness to endure a longer shutdown, decreasing the likelihood of resolution by November 21.
   - **Back Pay Uncertainty (↓):** The threat of not honoring back pay could indicate a hardline stance, further decreasing the likelihood of a quick resolution.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 80% probability translates to odds of 4:1.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** Considering the strong Thanksgiving deadline and public pressure (↑), but also the administration's resolve (↓), the net effect might slightly reduce the prior probability. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 0.8.
   - **Posterior Odds:** 4:1 × 0.8 = 3.2:1.
   - **Posterior Probability:** 3.2 / (3.2 + 1) ≈ 76%.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** The small sample size of past long shutdowns and unique current factors suggest caution. The administration's resolve could be underestimated.
   - **Alternative Scenarios:** If the administration's strategic goals are more influential than anticipated, the shutdown could extend beyond November 21.
   - **Adjustment:** Given these considerations, a slight downward adjustment to account for the administration's resolve and strategic goals is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential overconfidence, the final calibrated probability is:
   
Final: 72%

# Will the US government shutdown end before November 21, 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

I'll use two reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **All modern US government shutdowns (1980-present)**: Of 10 shutdowns, 9 (90%) ended before 52 days. However, only 1 shutdown (2018-2019) lasted as long as the current one (35 days).

2. **Long shutdowns (14+ days)**: This includes 3 shutdowns: 1995-96 (21 days), 2013 (16 days), and 2018-19 (35 days). All of these (100%) ended before 52 days, with the longest being 35 days.

Given that the current shutdown has already reached 35 days (tying the record), I'll use the long shutdowns reference class as my primary base rate, but with caution due to the small sample size. 

**Prior probability**: 75% that the shutdown will end before November 21 (day 52). This reflects the historical pattern that even the most protracted shutdowns eventually end, but acknowledges we're in uncharted territory beyond day 35.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Like previous long shutdowns, this one involves significant political polarization
- Financial pressure on federal workers is building (one missed paycheck already)
- Public pressure and economic impacts increase with duration

**Key differences**:
- Strategic goal of workforce reduction: The OPM memo suggests the administration may be using the shutdown to facilitate "reductions in force" (RIFs)
- Uncertainty over back pay: The suggestion that the 2019 law guaranteeing back pay might not be honored is unprecedented
- Already record-tying duration: We're in uncharted territory from day 36 onward
- Thanksgiving deadline: November 21 falls immediately before Thanksgiving week, creating a strong natural deadline

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence for ending before November 21**:
- **Thanksgiving deadline** (Strong): Congress has a powerful incentive to resolve before the holiday recess. Likelihood ratio ≈ 2:1 in favor of resolution.
- **Missed paychecks** (Moderate): Workers missing a second paycheck on November 7 will create substantial pressure. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.5:1 in favor of resolution.
- **Economic damage** (Moderate): Accumulating economic costs create pressure on both parties. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1.3:1 in favor of resolution.

**Evidence against ending before November 21**:
- **Strategic workforce reduction goal** (Strong): If the administration is using the shutdown to achieve RIFs, they have incentive to prolong it. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1:1.5 against resolution.
- **Back pay uncertainty** (Moderate): Threatening to withhold back pay signals unusual hardball tactics. Likelihood ratio ≈ 1:1.3 against resolution.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with prior odds of 75:25 = 3:1

First update (Thanksgiving deadline):
- Posterior odds = 3:1 × 2:1 = 6:1
- Posterior probability = 6/(6+1) = 85.7%

Second update (Missed paychecks):
- Posterior odds = 6:1 × 1.5:1 = 9:1
- Posterior probability = 9/(9+1) = 90%

Third update (Economic damage):
- Posterior odds = 9:1 × 1.3:1 = 11.7:1
- Posterior probability = 11.7/(11.7+1) = 92.1%

Fourth update (Strategic workforce reduction):
- Posterior odds = 11.7:1 × 1:1.5 = 7.8:1
- Posterior probability = 7.8/(7.8+1) = 88.6%

Fifth update (Back pay uncertainty):
- Posterior odds = 7.8:1 × 1:1.3 = 6:1
- Posterior probability = 6/(6+1) = 85.7%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- The sample size for long shutdowns is extremely small (N=3), making the base rate fragile
- We lack crucial details about the specific political actors and the precise nature of the funding dispute
- The threat of not providing back pay is norm-breaking and could trigger unpredictable responses

**Alternative scenarios**:
- The administration might be genuinely committed to using the shutdown for workforce reduction, making them willing to break the Thanksgiving deadline
- Congressional leadership might calculate that the political blame for the shutdown falls primarily on the other party, reducing their incentive to compromise
- A partial reopening of the government could relieve some pressure while leaving the dispute unresolved

**Adjustments**:
Given these considerations, I should be less confident in my forecast. The unprecedented nature of this shutdown's duration and the potential strategic goals beyond appropriations warrant more uncertainty. I'll adjust my final probability downward to account for these factors.

## 6. Final Forecast

Considering the historical pattern that even the longest shutdowns eventually end, the powerful Thanksgiving deadline, but also the unusual factors suggesting this shutdown may be strategically different, I arrive at a final probability of 80% that the shutdown will end before November 21, 2025.

Final: 80%

Here is my probabilistic forecast reasoning:

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is whether a government shutdown that has already lasted 35 days will end within the next 16 days (by November 20, 2025). The most relevant reference class is not all historical shutdowns, but those that have become protracted crises.

- **Reference Class:** US federal government shutdowns lasting longer than two weeks (14+ days). This class includes three events: 1995-96 (21 days), 2013 (16 days), and 2018-19 (35 days).
- **Base Rate:** Given that a shutdown has lasted at least 14 days, the historical probability of it ending before day 52 (the outer bound of the question's timeframe) is 100% (3 out of 3). The longest shutdown on record lasted exactly 35 days, the point we are at in the current scenario.
- **Prior Probability:** This historical data, though sparse, suggests that shutdowns do not last indefinitely and that 35 days represents a historical breaking point. This indicates a high prior probability for a resolution in the near term. I will set the prior at **P(H) = 80%**, which reflects the strong historical pattern but leaves room for this event to be an outlier. This corresponds to prior odds of 4:1 in favor of the shutdown ending before Nov 21.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation has strong similarities and critical differences compared to the base case, particularly the record-setting 2018-2019 shutdown.

- **Similarities:** The shutdown is causing financial hardship for federal workers (missed paychecks) and is running up against a major holiday deadline (Thanksgiving). These factors create immense political pressure on all parties to find a resolution, as they have in the past.
- **Differences:** The research report highlights two key differences. First, there is evidence the administration may have a strategic goal of using the shutdown to facilitate "reductions in force" (RIFs), giving it an incentive to prolong the shutdown. Second, there are suggestions the administration might not honor the law guaranteeing back pay, a norm-breaking signal of extreme resolve. These factors suggest the executive branch's willingness to endure a long shutdown may be significantly higher than in previous instances.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate two main clusters of conflicting evidence.

- **Evidence for Resolution (Increases Probability): The Thanksgiving Deadline.**
    - The deadline for resolution (Nov 21) falls on the Friday immediately preceding Thanksgiving week. This is a powerful, psychologically potent deadline. Members of Congress are extremely motivated to return to their districts for the holiday, and no party wants to be blamed for "canceling Thanksgiving."
    - P(E | H): Very high. If a resolution is to happen, a pre-holiday deadline is the most natural and politically convenient off-ramp.
    - P(E | ~H): Low. Continuing the shutdown past this deadline would require an extraordinary level of political intransigence and willingness to absorb public anger.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly greater than 1. This evidence powerfully supports the hypothesis that the shutdown will end.

- **Evidence Against Resolution (Decreases Probability): Unusual Administration Resolve.**
    - The reports about using the shutdown for RIFs and potentially withholding back pay suggest this is not a standard appropriations dispute. It points to a deeper, ideological motivation that is less susceptible to normal political pressures.
    - P(E | H): Low. An administration seeking a quick compromise is unlikely to employ such extreme, norm-breaking tactics and long-term strategies.
    - P(E | ~H): High. These tactics are consistent with a strategy to fundamentally alter the stakes of the conflict and fight a protracted battle to achieve transformative goals.
    - **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly less than 1. This evidence powerfully argues that the shutdown will continue.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
The forecast hinges on the relative strength of these two opposing forces.

1.  **Start with Prior Odds:** 4:1 (80% probability).
2.  **Update with Evidence of Unusual Resolve:** The evidence of RIF goals and threats to back pay is significant. It suggests this shutdown is unlike its predecessors. This might cut the odds of a near-term resolution by a factor of three (LR ≈ 1/3).
    -   *Updated Odds:* 4:1 × (1/3) = 1.33:1.
    -   *Updated Probability:* 1.33 / (1 + 1.33) ≈ 57%.
3.  **Update with Evidence of Thanksgiving Deadline:** The holiday deadline is an extremely powerful short-term forcing function. It provides a face-saving exit for all parties. I assess this evidence as increasing the odds of resolution by a factor of roughly 2.5 (LR ≈ 2.5).
    -   *Final Odds:* 1.33:1 × 2.5 = 3.33:1.
    -   *Final Probability:* 3.33 / (1 + 3.33) ≈ 77%.

This formal update seems a bit high. A more conservative, holistic approach suggests the final probability should be lower than the prior, reflecting the unprecedented nature of the administration's tactics, but still well above 50% due to the deadline. A final probability in the high 60s seems more appropriate.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
My forecast could be wrong if I am underestimating the administration's resolve. If the strategic goal of reshaping the federal workforce is the primary driver, the administration might view the political pain of disrupting Thanksgiving as a necessary cost. In this scenario, the shutdown is not a bargaining chip but the tool itself, and it will continue until its strategic objective is met, or until the political pressure becomes truly unbearable, which might be months away. An alternative forecast of 40% would be plausible under this interpretation.

However, this view may underestimate the collective pressure from rank-and-file members of Congress on their own leadership. The desire to avoid blame and go home for a major holiday is a powerful, near-universal incentive. A short-term continuing resolution that reopens the government is a classic political escape hatch that allows the fight to be postponed. This path of least resistance is historically the more common outcome. My forecast acknowledges the risk of the hardline scenario but weights the traditional political incentives more heavily. I will therefore stick to a forecast in the high 60s.

### Final Forecast
The forecast balances two powerful, opposing forces. The impending Thanksgiving holiday creates an extremely strong incentive for all parties to reach an agreement before November 21. However, evidence of the administration's unusual strategic goals and hardline tactics suggests a resolve far greater than in past shutdowns, creating a real possibility that this crisis will defy historical precedent. Weighing these factors, the probability of a resolution before the holiday remains significantly more likely than not, but the risk of a prolonged stalemate is substantial.

Final: 68%
