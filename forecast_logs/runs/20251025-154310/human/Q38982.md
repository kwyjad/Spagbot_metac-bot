### Reference class & base rates
-   **Major, president-led, across-the-board tariff legislation:** Historically, this is an exceptionally rare event. The most famous example is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, Congress has largely delegated tariff-setting authority to the executive branch. A bill of this scope, reversing 90 years of precedent, has not been passed in the modern era. **Base rate: <1% per presidential term.**
-   **Major, controversial economic legislation in a president's first year:** Presidents often try to pass a signature economic bill in their first year (e.g., Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, Obama's 2009 stimulus, Trump's 2017 tax cuts). Success depends heavily on unified government and party discipline. The controversy level of a 10%+ universal tariff is likely higher than a tax cut, facing opposition from both Democrats and free-trade Republicans. **Base rate: ~15-25% for any major economic bill, likely lower for this specific type.**
-   **Major, non-essential legislation passed in the final quarter of a calendar year:** The end of the year is typically consumed by appropriations bills, defense authorization, and other "must-pass" legislation. Passing a standalone, highly contentious bill during this period is difficult unless it is a top, urgent priority. **Base rate: <10%.**

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-01-20] Trump issues multiple executive orders on immigration, including a review of USMCA. (↓) — Establishes immigration as the immediate "Day One" priority and signals a preference for executive action over legislation for trade policy review.
-   [2025-01-29] Trump signs the Laken Riley Act into law. (↓) — The first major piece of legislation mentioned is on immigration, reinforcing the administration's and Congress's primary focus, not on trade.
-   [2025-08-01] Administration adjusts tariffs on Canadian potash via executive action. (↓↓) — This is a crucial event. It demonstrates the administration's willingness and ability to use executive authority for tariffs, making a difficult legislative battle in Congress less necessary.
-   [2025-10-21] Reports indicate Trump has issued 210 executive orders, many on immigration. (↓) — Reinforces the administration's primary governing strategy is unilateral executive action, bypassing the legislative process for its key priorities.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Presidential Priorities (↓, Large):** The administration's documented actions and focus throughout 2025 have been overwhelmingly on immigration. A massive legislative lift for tariffs does not appear to be the primary, secondary, or even tertiary priority.
-   **Availability of Executive Authority (↓, Large):** The President has significant, albeit legally contestable, authority to impose tariffs (e.g., via Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act or the IEEPA). The use of this authority on Canadian goods suggests this is the preferred path, avoiding a congressional fight.
-   **Congressional Appetite & Unity (↓, Large):** A 10%+ universal tariff would be deeply divisive. It would face unified Democratic opposition and significant opposition from a substantial free-trade/pro-business wing of the Republican party, making passage in the Senate (requiring 60 votes or a change to the filibuster) and even the House extremely difficult.
-   **Short Legislative Calendar (↓, Moderate):** With only two months left in 2025, including holiday recesses, the window to introduce, debate, reconcile, and pass such a monumental and controversial bill is exceptionally narrow.
-   **Lobbying and Industry Opposition (↓, Moderate):** A universal tariff would trigger massive opposition from a broad coalition of business groups, from retail and tech to agriculture, which would exert significant pressure on lawmakers to oppose the bill.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Preference for Unilateral Action:** Unlike past presidents who might have worked with Congress on a signature economic bill, this administration's observed behavior in 2025 heavily favors executive orders over legislation.
-   **Policy Extremity:** The proposed policy—a universal 10%+ tariff—is far more extreme and economically disruptive than typical first-year economic proposals like tax cuts or stimulus, making legislative consensus much harder to achieve.
-   **Demonstrated Alternative Path:** The administration has already used executive action to adjust tariffs in 2025. This provides a clear, real-world example of the chosen strategy, which diverges from the legislative path required for a "Yes" resolution.
-   **Divergent Priorities:** While past administrations focused on economic legislation early, the evidence shows this administration has prioritized and legislated on immigration, a different policy domain.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a very low prior (e.g., 5%) based on the historical rarity of Congress passing such sweeping tariff legislation (equivalent n ≈ 20).
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    *   (↓↓ Large) The administration's use of executive authority to adjust tariffs on Canada strongly indicates the legislative path is not the chosen one.
    *   (↓ Large) The overwhelming and sustained focus on immigration as the top policy priority, evidenced by numerous EOs and the Laken Riley Act.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The complete absence of any reporting on a congressional tariff bill being drafted or debated in the first 10 months of the year.
    *   (↓ Moderate) The very short time remaining on the 2025 legislative calendar for a highly contentious bill.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence strongly and consistently points away from a legislative solution. The posterior should be revised significantly downward from an already low prior.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    *   Trump publicly calls on the Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader by name to pass a universal tariff bill before year's end.
    *   A "national security" or "emergency" justification is floated that could plausibly unify the Republican caucus.
    *   Draft legislative text is leaked or formally introduced by a major committee chair.
    *   Reports of a deal to attach the tariff bill to "must-pass" year-end funding legislation.
-   **DOWN indicators:**
    *   The President announces further tariff actions via new executive orders.
    *   Congressional leadership announces the schedule for the remainder of the year, and it is focused solely on appropriations and defense bills.
    *   Prominent Republican senators (e.g., from agricultural or manufacturing states) publicly state their opposition to a universal tariff.
    *   The administration's public communications remain focused on immigration and border security.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Uncertain Congressional Control:** The provided sources do not specify the party control or margins in the House and Senate. Unified Republican control would make passage easier than divided government, though still very difficult. This is a major data gap.
-   **"Black Swan" Event:** A sudden, severe geopolitical or economic crisis could scramble all political calculations and create an unexpected window for radical policy.
-   **Definitional Specificity:** The resolution hinges on a *bill passed by Congress*. Any tariff implementation via executive order, no matter how broad, resolves the question as "No." The 10% and "across-the-board" thresholds are also strict.
-   **Source Blindspots:** The provided sources are heavily focused on immigration. While this likely reflects the administration's priorities, there is a small chance that quiet legislative work on trade is happening outside the view of these specific reports.

**Final Research Summary:** The base rate for Congress passing such a bill is extremely low. All available evidence from 2025 shows the Trump administration is prioritizing immigration and using executive authority, not legislation, as its primary tool for policy implementation, including on tariffs.

To forecast the probability of the US Congress passing a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for Congress passing major, president-led, across-the-board tariff legislation is historically very low, less than 1% per presidential term. This is due to the rarity of such legislation since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which delegated much of the tariff-setting authority to the executive branch.
   - Initial prior: 1% probability.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation involves a president advocating for significant tariff changes, similar to historical instances where presidents have pushed for major economic legislation.
   - Differences: The current administration has shown a preference for using executive orders over legislative processes, and the proposed tariffs are more extreme and controversial than typical economic proposals.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Executive Action on Tariffs**: The administration has already used executive authority to adjust tariffs, indicating a preference for this route over legislative action. This decreases the probability of Congress passing a bill.
   - **Focus on Immigration**: The administration's primary focus has been on immigration, not trade, as evidenced by numerous executive orders and legislative actions. This further decreases the probability.
   - **Congressional Opposition**: The proposed tariffs face significant opposition from both Democrats and free-trade Republicans, making legislative passage difficult. This decreases the probability.
   - **Short Legislative Calendar**: With only two months left in the year, the time to pass such a contentious bill is very limited. This decreases the probability.
   - **Lobbying and Industry Opposition**: Strong opposition from business groups would likely hinder the passage of the bill. This decreases the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: 1% probability = 0.01 odds.
   - Given the strong evidence against the legislative path, the likelihood ratio is heavily skewed towards the event not happening.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio (which is very low).
   - Posterior probability is significantly lower than the prior, reflecting the overwhelming evidence against the passage of such a bill.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Consideration of alternative scenarios, such as a sudden geopolitical crisis, could potentially change the legislative priorities, but these are unlikely given the current evidence.
   - The best alternative forecast might consider a slightly higher probability if there were signs of legislative movement or a shift in priorities, but current indicators do not support this.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the base rate and the strong evidence against the passage of the bill, the final probability is adjusted downward from the initial prior.
   - Final: 1% probability.

Final: 1%

# Will the US Congress pass a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate base rate for Congress passing a major tariff bill in the remaining months of 2025.

The most relevant reference classes include:
- **Major tariff legislation in modern era**: Extremely rare. Since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, Congress has largely delegated tariff authority to the executive branch. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was the last major across-the-board tariff legislation.
- **Major economic legislation in a president's first year**: While common (tax cuts, stimulus packages), universal tariffs are more controversial than typical economic legislation.
- **Major legislation passed in final months of a calendar year**: The end of the year is typically dominated by "must-pass" appropriations bills, not new major policy initiatives.

Considering these reference classes, I'll set a prior of **5%**. This reflects the historical rarity of Congress passing sweeping tariff legislation, especially this late in a calendar year.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case**:
- Trump has consistently advocated for tariffs, both during his first term and in his campaign
- Republicans likely control at least one chamber of Congress
- Economic nationalism remains a component of Trump's policy agenda

**Differences from base case**:
- The timeline is extremely compressed (only ~2 months left in 2025)
- The administration has already demonstrated a preference for executive action on tariffs (Canadian potash tariff adjustment)
- The administration's documented focus has been overwhelmingly on immigration, not trade policy
- The proposed universal tariff is more extreme than typical economic legislation, making consensus harder

These differences significantly reduce the probability compared to the base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: Administration's use of executive authority for tariffs**
- P(E|H): If Congress were going to pass a tariff bill, it would be somewhat unlikely (~30%) that the administration would already be using executive authority for tariffs
- P(E|~H): If Congress were not going to pass a tariff bill, it would be highly likely (~90%) that the administration would use executive authority
- Likelihood ratio: 0.33
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 2: Administration's focus on immigration, not trade**
- P(E|H): If Congress were going to pass a tariff bill, we would expect to see more focus on trade policy (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If Congress were not going to pass a tariff bill, we would expect the focus to be elsewhere (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Short legislative calendar remaining in 2025**
- P(E|H): If Congress were going to pass a tariff bill, a short calendar would be somewhat problematic but possible (~40%)
- P(E|~H): If Congress were not going to pass a tariff bill, a short calendar would be expected (~90%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.44
- This evidence moderately decreases the probability

**Evidence 4: No reporting on draft legislation or committee work**
- P(E|H): If Congress were going to pass a tariff bill, we would expect to see reporting on draft legislation (~15%)
- P(E|~H): If Congress were not going to pass a tariff bill, we would expect no such reporting (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.16
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with my prior of 5% (odds of 1:19), I'll update based on the strongest piece of evidence: the administration's demonstrated use of executive authority for tariffs.

Prior odds = 0.05/0.95 = 0.053
Posterior odds = 0.053 × 0.33 = 0.017
Posterior probability = 0.017/(1 + 0.017) = 1.7%

Updating again based on the administration's focus on immigration rather than trade:
Prior odds = 0.017/0.983 = 0.017
Posterior odds = 0.017 × 0.25 = 0.004
Posterior probability = 0.004/(1 + 0.004) = 0.4%

The remaining evidence would push this probability even lower, but I'll stop here to avoid potential underconfidence. The evidence consistently and strongly points away from Congress passing a tariff bill in the remaining months of 2025.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots**:
- I may be underestimating the possibility of a "must-pass" year-end omnibus bill that includes tariff provisions
- A sudden economic or geopolitical crisis could create unexpected urgency for tariff legislation
- The sources might not capture behind-the-scenes legislative preparation
- I might be overweighting the administration's current focus on immigration

**Alternative forecast**:
A more optimistic view might argue that Trump could pivot to economic issues after securing immigration wins, and that Republican leadership might rally around a tariff bill as a show of support for the President's agenda. This could suggest a probability closer to 10-15%.

**Rebuttal**:
Even with a pivot to economic issues, the compressed timeline, the demonstrated preference for executive action, and the likely opposition from business-friendly Republicans make congressional passage extremely unlikely. The 10% universal tariff threshold is also quite high, making it harder to achieve consensus.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering all the evidence and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of Congress passing a bill implementing Trump's tariff policies in 2025 is extremely low. The administration has clearly demonstrated a preference for executive action on tariffs, has focused primarily on immigration, and faces a very short legislative calendar with likely significant opposition even within the Republican party.

Final: 1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The event in question is the US Congress passing a specific type of major legislation: a bill implementing a 10% or greater across-the-board tariff on nearly all imports.

A suitable reference class is "major, controversial, president-led economic legislation passed by Congress." Within this class, a bill that fundamentally reverses ~90 years of trade policy delegation from Congress to the President is exceptionally rare. The last comparable act was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Since then, Congress has consistently granted tariff authority to the executive branch. This historical precedent suggests an extremely low base rate, likely less than 1% in any given presidential term.

However, Donald Trump's presidency is an outlier, as his platform explicitly calls for such policies. A more generous reference class might be "major, controversial economic legislation in a president's first year" (e.g., Reagan's 1981 tax cuts, Obama's 2009 stimulus, Trump's 2017 tax cuts). The success rate here is higher, perhaps 20-25%. But a universal tariff is far more divisive, even within the Republican party, than a tax cut.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prior at the start of 2025 for this specific, historically anomalous event would be low. I will set the initial prior at **5%**. This is higher than the long-term historical base rate to account for the unique political environment of a Trump presidency, but still reflects the high degree of difficulty.
*   Prior Odds: 0.05 / (1 - 0.05) = 0.05 / 0.95 ≈ 1 to 19.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The current situation differs significantly from the base case of a president attempting to pass a signature economic bill at the start of their term.

*   **Timeline:** It is October 25, 2025. Nearly 10 months of the legislative year have passed with no visible progress on such a bill. The remaining legislative window is very short and typically crowded with "must-pass" items like appropriations bills.
*   **Presidential Strategy:** The Trump administration has demonstrated a clear preference for unilateral executive action over the legislative process for its key priorities, including trade. This is a major departure from a president who would typically work with congressional allies to build consensus for a bill.
*   **Policy Focus:** The administration's primary focus throughout 2025, measured by both executive orders and legislative achievements (the Laken Riley Act), has been on immigration, not trade.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Several key pieces of evidence from 2025 strongly inform the forecast.

*   **Evidence 1: Demonstrated use of executive authority for tariffs.** In August 2025, the administration adjusted tariffs on Canadian potash via executive action.
    *   P(E | H): The likelihood of the administration taking piecemeal executive action if it were planning a comprehensive legislative solution is low. It suggests the executive path is the preferred and sufficient one.
    *   P(E | ~H): The likelihood of using executive authority if the legislative path is *not* being pursued is very high. This is the expected course of action.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio (P(E|H)/P(E|~H)) is much less than 1.** This evidence strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 2: Sustained focus on immigration.** The administration's "Day One" actions, first signed law, and the high volume of executive orders have all centered on immigration.
    *   P(E | H): It's highly unlikely that an administration planning a massive, difficult legislative fight over tariffs would dedicate almost all of its political capital and focus for 10 months to a different issue, leaving the tariff bill for the final, crowded weeks of the year.
    *   P(E | ~H): This is exactly the behavior we would expect if immigration is the top priority and a legislative tariff bill is not on the agenda.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is much less than 1.** This evidence also strongly decreases the probability.

*   **Evidence 3: Absence of legislative groundwork.** As of late October, there are no reports of a bill being drafted, debated in committee, or even publicly requested by the President from Congress.
    *   P(E | H): The probability of a major, controversial bill passing in the next two months with zero prior public groundwork is virtually zero.
    *   P(E | ~H): The absence of groundwork is the default state if no bill is planned.
    *   **Likelihood Ratio is near zero.** This is the most powerful piece of evidence against a "Yes" resolution.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
Let's update the initial 5% prior (1-to-19 odds) with the evidence.

*   **Initial Prior:** 5% (Odds: 1 to 19)
*   **Evidence:** The administration is using executive orders for tariffs, has focused entirely on immigration, and no legislative groundwork has been laid with only two months left in the year. The combined likelihood ratio of this evidence is extremely small. For instance, let's estimate a conservative combined LR of 1/20.
*   **Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio**
    *   Posterior Odds ≈ (1/19) × (1/20) = 1/380
*   **Posterior Probability = Odds / (1 + Odds)**
    *   Posterior Probability ≈ 1 / (1 + 380) = 1/381 ≈ 0.26%

This formal update pushes the probability to a very low number. Qualitatively, the evidence is so uniformly and strongly negative that it should reduce the initial 5% prior to a near-zero probability.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
The strongest argument for a "Yes" outcome is a last-minute, chaotic scenario where the tariff legislation is attached as a rider to a must-pass appropriations bill to avoid a government shutdown. In this scenario, the President could exert maximum leverage on his own party.

However, this path is fraught with peril. Such a controversial rider would almost certainly trigger a filibuster in the Senate, requiring 60 votes, which is highly improbable. It would also face significant opposition from free-trade Republicans in both chambers, potentially causing the underlying must-pass bill to fail. Given that the President has a viable alternative (executive action), risking a government shutdown for a legislative fight he might lose seems like a poor strategic choice.

The Manifold market forecast of 6.2% seems to be an outlier that may be overweighting the President's rhetoric while underweighting the specific resolution criteria (a *bill passed by Congress*) and the overwhelming evidence of an alternative strategy being pursued. My analysis suggests the market is too high.

My initial Bayesian update resulted in a sub-1% probability. To account for the small but non-zero chance of a "black swan" legislative event or a chaotic year-end deal, I will adjust this upward slightly, but remain at a very low value. The evidence against is simply too compelling.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for such a historic bill is extremely low. All available evidence from the first ten months of 2025 indicates that the administration is not pursuing a legislative path for its tariff policy. Instead, it is focused on immigration and is using its executive authority for trade matters. With only two months left on the legislative calendar, the window for passing such a monumental and divisive bill is effectively closed. The probability is not zero, as a last-ditch effort could be made to attach it to year-end funding bills, but the success of such a maneuver is highly improbable.

Final: 2%
