### Reference class & base rates
-   **Reference Class 1: Leading Frontier AI Labs.** This class includes organizations developing the most powerful, general-purpose foundation models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta). Of these four, two (OpenAI, Anthropic) have established evaluation partnerships with METR.
    -   **Base Rate:** 2/4 = 50%.
    -   **Reasoning:** This class represents the labs METR is most interested in evaluating due to the potential for their models to exhibit novel, potentially catastrophic capabilities.
    -   **Limitations:** C3.ai is arguably not in this reference class. Their business model is focused on enterprise AI applications, not on developing the largest-scale, general-purpose foundation models from scratch.

-   **Reference Class 2: Publicly Traded US-based AI-focused Companies.** This class includes companies like C3.ai, Palantir, and others whose primary business is AI software and services.
    -   **Base Rate:** ~0%.
    -   **Reasoning:** To date, no company in this class has publicly announced a pre-release model evaluation partnership with METR. METR's known partners are private companies (OpenAI, Anthropic). This class better reflects C3.ai's corporate structure and market position.
    -   **Limitations:** This class is broad and includes companies with vastly different technical approaches and risk profiles.

-   **Conclusion:** Reference Class 2 is more appropriate for C3.ai. The initial base rate should be very low, likely <5%, reflecting the fact that METR's specialized, catastrophic-risk evaluations are a niche activity currently confined to a handful of private, frontier-model labs.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
-   [2025-04-21] METR paper on AI acceleration analyzed, showing their continued focus on long-term, capability-driven risks. (↓) — Reinforces METR's focus on the frontier, a space C3.ai does not primarily operate in.
-   [2025-03-15] METR's AI Action Plan comment references their 2024/early 2025 evaluations of GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. (↓) — Shows METR's ongoing work is with existing partners (OpenAI, Anthropic), not expanding to companies like C3.ai.
-   [2024-10-11] METR comment to BIS lists their evaluated models, exclusively from OpenAI and Anthropic. (↓) — Recent official documentation confirms their narrow partnership focus, with no mention of C3.ai or similar firms.
-   [2024-09-09] METR comment to NIST AI Safety Institute again highlights work with OpenAI and Anthropic. (↓) — Consistent pattern of METR engaging only with the top frontier labs in official government and policy discussions.
-   [2024-08-28] METR analysis of frontier AI safety policies focuses on labs building the most powerful models. (↓) — C3.ai is not mentioned and does not fit the profile of the companies whose policies are being analyzed.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
-   **Mismatch in Technical Focus (Large ↓):** C3.ai provides enterprise AI applications and platforms, often leveraging or fine-tuning existing models. METR evaluates novel, frontier foundation models for catastrophic risks like autonomous replication. There is a fundamental mismatch in what is being built and what is being tested.
-   **METR's Limited Bandwidth (Large ↓):** METR is a specialized non-profit with finite resources. They will prioritize their efforts on the models they perceive as posing the greatest potential risk, i.e., the next generation of models from labs like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.
-   **Prohibitive Timeline (Very Large ↓):** The resolution date is Jan 1, 2026, less than two months from the current date (2025-11-17). Establishing a new partnership, gaining access to a pre-release model, and conducting a thorough evaluation for catastrophic risk is a multi-month process. It is logistically infeasible to start and finish this by the deadline.
-   **Regulatory or Public Pressure (Small ↑):** A sudden, binding government mandate or a major AI incident could theoretically compel a wider range of companies, including C3.ai, to seek third-party evaluations. However, such a specific mandate targeting METR evaluations is highly unlikely to be enacted and implemented within the short timeframe.
-   **C3.ai's Corporate Strategy & Culture (Moderate ↓):** C3.ai's public posture, led by CEO Tom Siebel, focuses on near-term business value and practical AI ethics (e.g., bias, privacy). They have not engaged publicly with the long-termist, catastrophic-risk-focused AI safety community that METR is a part of.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
-   **Business Model:** Unlike the frontier labs (Reference Class 1), C3.ai's business is not selling access to a base model but providing tailored enterprise applications. This makes their risk profile, and thus their evaluation needs, fundamentally different.
-   **Technical Capabilities:** C3.ai is not known to be training a frontier model from scratch that would push the state-of-the-art in a way that would trigger METR's interest. Their work is primarily in application and integration.
-   **Ecosystem & Community:** C3.ai is not a member of consortia like the Frontier Model Forum and does not appear to be an active participant in the specific AI safety ecosystem where METR operates. OpenAI and Anthropic were born from this ecosystem.
-   **Timeline Constraint:** The most critical difference is the extremely short horizon. Any prior probability of a partnership forming is drastically reduced by the fact that there are only ~6 weeks until the deadline.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
-   **Prior:** Start with a prior near the base rate of publicly traded AI companies partnering with METR, which is effectively 0%. A reasonable starting point is 1% (equivalent n ≈ 50), acknowledging a small possibility of an unexpected event.
-   **Evidence mapping:**
    -   (↓ Very Large) The ~6-week timeline makes a new partnership and evaluation logistically impossible.
    -   (↓ Large) The fundamental mismatch between C3.ai's enterprise application focus and METR's frontier model/catastrophic risk mission.
    -   (↓ Large) METR's documented and consistent focus on its existing partners (OpenAI, Anthropic) in all recent public communications.
    -   (↓ Moderate) The complete absence of any public statements, rumors, or connections between C3.ai and METR or the associated AI safety community.
-   **Net effect:** The evidence is overwhelmingly negative and mutually reinforcing. The posterior should be updated sharply downwards, to a value very close to 0%.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
-   **UP indicators:**
    -   A joint press release from C3.ai and METR announcing a partnership (this would resolve the question).
    -   C3.ai announcing the development of a new, frontier-scale foundation model.
    -   C3.ai CEO Tom Siebel making public statements expressing concern about catastrophic AI risk.

-   **DOWN indicators:**
    -   The passage of time with no announcements (the default and most likely scenario).
    -   METR announcing a new partnership with a different frontier lab (e.g., Google or Meta), confirming their priorities.
    -   Public statements from C3.ai emphasizing their focus on near-term, practical AI ethics, further distinguishing them from METR's concerns.

### Caveats & pitfalls
-   **Private Engagement:** A partnership could theoretically be underway in secret. However, the short timeline makes it highly improbable that a secret, ongoing evaluation would be completed and credibly reported by the deadline.
-   **Definitional Ambiguity:** A "credible report" is the key. A leak or rumor might not suffice. Resolution likely requires a public statement from C3.ai or METR, or a report in a major media outlet.
-   **Sudden Strategic Pivot:** C3.ai could make a completely unexpected strategic announcement for PR or market positioning reasons, though this is highly improbable and out of character.
-   **Acquisition:** C3.ai could acquire a smaller lab that already has a relationship with METR. This is a highly speculative and low-probability scenario.
-   **Question Scope:** The question is strictly about evaluation by METR. An internal evaluation or one by another body (like the US AI Safety Institute) would not trigger a "Yes" resolution.

To forecast the probability of C3.ai having its models evaluated for dangerous behavior by METR before 2026, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - **Reference Class 2: Publicly Traded US-based AI-focused Companies** is more appropriate for C3.ai. The base rate for this class is approximately 0% because no company in this class has publicly announced a pre-release model evaluation partnership with METR. Given the context, a reasonable prior probability is 1%, acknowledging a small possibility of unexpected developments.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - **Similarities:** C3.ai is a publicly traded AI-focused company, fitting the reference class.
   - **Differences:** C3.ai focuses on enterprise AI applications rather than developing frontier models, which METR targets. This difference is significant because METR's evaluations are aimed at models with potential catastrophic risks, which C3.ai's models are unlikely to present.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Timeline Constraint (Very Large ↓):** With only ~6 weeks until the deadline, it is logistically improbable for C3.ai to establish a partnership and complete an evaluation.
   - **Mismatch in Focus (Large ↓):** C3.ai's focus on enterprise applications does not align with METR's focus on frontier models.
   - **METR's Current Partnerships (Large ↓):** METR's ongoing work with OpenAI and Anthropic suggests no expansion to companies like C3.ai.
   - **Absence of Public Engagement (Moderate ↓):** No public statements or connections between C3.ai and METR or the AI safety community.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - **Prior Odds:** 1% or 0.01 in probability terms.
   - **Likelihood Ratio:** The evidence overwhelmingly suggests a decrease in probability. For simplicity, assume a likelihood ratio that reduces the probability by a factor of 10.
   - **Posterior Odds:** 0.01 × 0.1 = 0.001
   - **Posterior Probability:** 0.001 / (1 + 0.001) ≈ 0.1%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - **Overconfidence Check:** Consider the possibility of a sudden strategic pivot or acquisition by C3.ai, though these are highly unlikely.
   - **Alternative Forecast:** A sudden regulatory mandate could increase the probability, but this is improbable within the short timeframe.
   - **Adjustment:** Given the overwhelming evidence against a partnership, the probability remains very low.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - The final probability reflects the base rate and the strong negative evidence, resulting in a very low likelihood of C3.ai having its models evaluated by METR before 2026.

Final: 0%

# Will C3.ai have their models evaluated for dangerous behavior before 2026?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to identify an appropriate reference class and base rate for C3.ai having their models evaluated by METR before January 1, 2026.

**Reference Class Selection:**
- **Enterprise AI Solution Providers**: C3.ai is primarily an enterprise AI application company that builds solutions on top of existing foundation models rather than developing frontier foundation models from scratch.
- **Current METR Evaluation Partners**: Currently, only OpenAI and Anthropic have established partnerships with METR for evaluating their models for catastrophic risks.

**Base Rate Calculation:**
- Among enterprise AI solution providers similar to C3.ai (companies that primarily build applications on top of foundation models rather than developing their own frontier models), 0 out of dozens have METR evaluations.
- Among all AI companies, only 2 (OpenAI and Anthropic) have METR partnerships.

**Initial Prior**: 1%
- This reflects the extremely low historical frequency of companies in C3.ai's reference class having METR evaluations.
- I'm setting it slightly above 0% to account for unknown possibilities and black swan events.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to Base Case:**
- C3.ai, like most AI companies, has public-facing AI products and services.
- C3.ai, like most companies, would theoretically benefit from safety evaluations for reputation purposes.

**Critical Differences:**
- **Business Model Mismatch**: C3.ai focuses on enterprise AI applications, not developing frontier foundation models that METR typically evaluates for catastrophic risks.
- **Technical Focus**: METR evaluates models for catastrophic risks like autonomous replication or power-seeking behavior, which is misaligned with C3.ai's enterprise solutions focus.
- **Timeline Constraint**: With the resolution date of January 1, 2026 (approximately 6 weeks away from today's date of November 17, 2025), there is extremely limited time to establish a partnership and complete an evaluation.
- **No Historical Connection**: Unlike OpenAI and Anthropic, C3.ai has shown no public engagement with the long-termist AI safety community that METR is part of.

These differences significantly reduce the probability below the already low base rate.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation

**Evidence 1: METR's Documented Focus on Frontier Models**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai were to get evaluated, we would still expect to see METR focusing on frontier models (moderate)
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai were not to get evaluated, we would expect METR to focus exclusively on frontier models (very high)
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) < 1 (evidence against)
- METR's consistent focus on frontier models from OpenAI and Anthropic in all recent communications suggests they are not expanding to companies like C3.ai.

**Evidence 2: Extremely Short Timeline**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai were to get evaluated before 2026, we would expect to see signs of this partnership already (very high)
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai were not to get evaluated, we would expect no signs of partnership (very high)
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) ≈ 1 (neutral)
- However, the short timeline itself (6 weeks) makes establishing a new partnership and completing an evaluation logistically nearly impossible.

**Evidence 3: C3.ai's Business Focus**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai were to get evaluated, we would expect them to shift focus toward frontier model development (high)
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai were not to get evaluated, we would expect them to maintain their enterprise application focus (very high)
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) < 1 (evidence against)
- C3.ai's consistent focus on enterprise applications rather than frontier model development makes them an unlikely candidate for METR evaluation.

**Evidence 4: Absence of Public Statements or Rumors**
- P(E|H): If C3.ai were to get evaluated, we might expect some public hints or rumors (moderate)
- P(E|~H): If C3.ai were not to get evaluated, we would expect no public hints (very high)
- Likelihood ratio: P(E|H)/P(E|~H) < 1 (evidence against)
- The complete absence of any public statements, rumors, or connections between C3.ai and METR suggests no partnership is in development.

## 4. Bayesian Updating

Starting with a prior of 1% (odds of 1:99), I'll update based on the strongest evidence:

**Update on Timeline Constraint:**
- The 6-week timeline makes a new partnership and completed evaluation extremely unlikely
- Likelihood ratio: 0.1 (very strong evidence against)
- Posterior odds = 1:99 × 0.1 = 0.1:99 ≈ 0.1:100
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.1/(0.1+100) ≈ 0.1%

**Update on Business Model Mismatch:**
- C3.ai's enterprise focus vs. METR's catastrophic risk focus
- Likelihood ratio: 0.2 (strong evidence against)
- Posterior odds = 0.1:100 × 0.2 = 0.02:100 = 1:5000
- Posterior probability ≈ 0.02%

These updates reflect the extremely low probability of C3.ai having a METR evaluation before 2026, given both the practical timeline constraints and the fundamental mismatch between C3.ai's business and METR's mission.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential Blind Spots:**
- **Private Negotiations**: It's possible that C3.ai and METR have already begun discussions that aren't public.
- **Strategic Pivot**: C3.ai could make an unexpected strategic announcement about developing a frontier model.
- **Acquisition**: C3.ai could acquire a smaller lab that already has a relationship with METR.
- **Regulatory Pressure**: A sudden government mandate could force wider adoption of METR evaluations.

**Best Alternative Forecast:**
The strongest case for a higher probability would be if C3.ai had already been in private discussions with METR for months, and an evaluation was nearly complete. However, this scenario is highly implausible given:
1. No leaks or hints of such a partnership
2. C3.ai's consistent business focus away from frontier models
3. METR's limited resources and focus on the highest-risk models

Even accounting for these possibilities, the probability remains extremely low due to the overwhelming evidence against and the extremely short timeline.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, the specific circumstances of C3.ai, the extremely short timeline until resolution, and potential blind spots, I assess that the probability of C3.ai having their models evaluated by METR before January 1, 2026, is extremely low.

Final: 0.1%

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
-   **Reference Class:** The most appropriate reference class is not "frontier AI labs" (like OpenAI, Google) but rather "publicly traded, US-based enterprise AI companies." C3.ai's business model is focused on providing AI applications and platforms to businesses, not on training state-of-the-art, general-purpose foundation models from scratch.
-   **Base Rate Calculation:** Within this reference class, the number of companies that have had a model evaluated by METR (an organization focused on catastrophic risks from frontier models) is zero.
-   **Initial Prior:** A strict base rate would be 0%. However, to allow for the possibility of unprecedented events in a rapidly evolving field, a more robust prior would be a very low number. I will set the initial prior at **2%**. This acknowledges that while it has never happened, it is not a logical impossibility.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
-   **Similarities:** C3.ai is a prominent company in the AI sector, which is facing increasing pressure for safety and transparency. In this general sense, it is subject to the same broad industry trends as the frontier labs.
-   **Differences:** The differences are far more significant.
    -   **Technical Focus:** C3.ai's work on enterprise applications is fundamentally different from the frontier model development at OpenAI or Anthropic. METR's evaluation methodologies are designed for novel, potentially super-human capabilities that are not the focus of C3.ai's products. This is a core mismatch of purpose.
    -   **Corporate Strategy & Culture:** C3.ai's public messaging, led by CEO Tom Siebel, centers on near-term business value and practical AI ethics (e.g., bias, fairness). They are not participants in the long-termist, catastrophic-risk-focused AI safety community from which METR and its current partners emerged.
    -   **Existing Relationships:** METR's partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic are deep and stem from shared history and concerns within the AI safety ecosystem. C3.ai has no such connection.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
Let H be the hypothesis "C3.ai will have a model evaluated by METR before 2026."

-   **Evidence 1: The Extremely Short Timeline.** The resolution date is January 1, 2026. The current date is November 17, 2025. This leaves only about six weeks. A new partnership would need to be negotiated, a model chosen and prepared, a complex evaluation conducted, and a credible report issued.
    -   P(E | H): The probability of this entire process happening in six weeks, starting from no public indication of a partnership, is exceptionally low.
    -   P(E | ~H): The probability of the clock running out is the default scenario if no evaluation is planned.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** Very strongly favors ~H (<< 1). This is the most powerful piece of evidence.

-   **Evidence 2: METR's Consistent and Narrow Focus.** All of METR's recent public comments and papers (to NIST, BIS, etc.) exclusively mention their work with OpenAI and Anthropic and their focus on the most powerful frontier models.
    -   P(E | H): If METR were about to partner with a company like C3.ai, we might expect their public language to broaden to include different types of AI or partnerships. Its continued narrowness is evidence against this.
    -   P(E | ~H): METR's statements are perfectly consistent with them *not* planning to partner with C3.ai.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** Favors ~H (< 1).

-   **Evidence 3: Lack of any Public Signals.** There are no rumors, joint statements, or any other "soft" evidence suggesting a relationship between C3.ai and METR.
    -   P(E | H): Given the short timeline, if an announcement were imminent, some precursor signals would be very likely. Their absence is significant.
    -   P(E | ~H): The absence of signals is the expected state if nothing is happening.
    -   **Likelihood Ratio:** Strongly favors ~H (<< 1).

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)
-   **Prior Odds:** 2% probability corresponds to odds of 2:98, or approximately 1:49.
-   **Updating with Timeline Evidence:** The logistical impossibility of completing this process in six weeks is the most critical factor. This evidence carries a very strong likelihood ratio against H, conservatively estimated at 1/50.
    -   Posterior Odds = Prior Odds × Likelihood Ratio
    -   Posterior Odds ≈ (1:49) × (1/50) = 1:2450
-   **Converting to Probability:** A 1:2450 odds corresponds to a probability of 1 / (1 + 2450) ≈ 0.04%.
-   **Summary:** The other pieces of evidence (mismatch in focus, METR's stated priorities) further reinforce this conclusion, pushing the probability even lower. The final probability should be extremely low.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
-   **Alternative Scenario:** The most plausible way this resolves "Yes" is if an evaluation has been secretly underway for months and is pending a public announcement before the deadline. This would be done for PR reasons by C3.ai and to show expanded reach by METR.
-   **Plausibility Check:** This scenario is highly unlikely. There is no strategic or technical reason for this specific partnership. C3.ai's models are not the kind METR evaluates, and METR's limited resources are almost certainly focused on the next generation of models from Google, Meta, or their existing partners. The complete lack of any leaks or signals makes a secret collaboration improbable.
-   **Risk of Misinterpretation:** Could a minor consultation be spun as a full "evaluation"? The resolution criteria's requirement for a "credible report" makes this less likely. METR would have a strong incentive to protect its brand and clarify the nature of any engagement, preventing a misleading report from being considered credible.
-   **Conclusion:** The arguments against are robust and multi-faceted. The primary uncertainty is the "unknown unknown" of a secret deal, which is a very small tail risk. A forecast of 1% is a conservative way to account for this remote possibility.

### 6. Final Forecast
The base rate for a company like C3.ai partnering with METR is near zero. The evidence, particularly the extremely short timeline of ~6 weeks remaining, makes the prospect of a new partnership and evaluation being completed logistically infeasible. This is compounded by the fundamental mismatch between C3.ai's enterprise AI focus and METR's mission to evaluate frontier models for catastrophic risks. The lack of any public signals reinforces this conclusion. The probability is therefore exceptionally low.

Final: 1%
